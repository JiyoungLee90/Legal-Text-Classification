Likewise, in most of the decisions of the authorities to extend the applicant\u2019s detention they failed to assess specific facts and evidence about possible danger of the applicant absconding, re-offending or obstructing the investigation. In some decisions they did refer to his lack of a permanent address (see paragraphs 28, 31 and 32 above), while in others no grounds were cited at all (see paragraphs 27 and 32 above). In so far as the authorities did not consider it necessary to justify the continuation of the applicant\u2019s detention on each and every occasion they seem to have considered his detention mandatory and to have primarily relied on the statutory provisions requiring such detention for serious intentional offences.",

A further delay was caused by the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office remitting the case to the investigation stage on two separate occasions between 13 July 1998 and 22 June 1999 demanding that the instructions of the Sofia City Court be fulfilled (see paragraph 23 above).
