Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions \u2013 and to this extent it is autonomous \u2013 there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of them. The prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and the Protocols thereto require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see, among many other authorities, Molla Sali v. Greece [GC], no. 20452/14, \u00a7\u00a0123, 19 December 2018).",

Indeed, in the Government\u2019s view, the applicants could also, if needed, have made use of the redress envisaged in Article 61 and Article 62 of the Constitutional Court Act (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above). In support of their contentions the Government provided domestic case-law and relied, mutatis mutandis, on the Court\u2019s decisions adopted in two cases brought against Latvia (Gri\u0161ankova and Gri\u0161ankovs v.

Finally, in addition or in the alternative, the Government argued that in the very specific circumstances of the present case, and for the above reasons, the constitutional appeal under Article 170 of the Constitution could not be deemed an effective domestic remedy, meaning that the applicants should have lodged their applications with the Court several years earlier.\u00a0In view of the foregoing, the Government maintained that the applicants\u2019 complaints should be rejected, either on the basis of non-exhaustion or for having been lodged with the Court after the six-month time-limit had already expired.",

Their injuries would also, because of the said risk, be otherwise difficult to insure and it would likewise be onerous, if at all possible, for them to obtain, by means of litigation, any redress for the injuries caused to them by, for example, the agents of an opposing State engaged in a military confrontation. The other group, however, was comprised of civilians, including the applicants, who had sustained their injuries in situations unrelated to the performance of such duties, mostly involving accidents or illnesses or the actions of third parties. The Court furthermore notes that the relevant difference in treatment was a consequence of their distinct positions and the corresponding undertakings on the part of the respondent State to provide them with benefits to a greater or lesser extent. This includes a moral debt which States may feel obliged to honour in response to the service provided by their war veterans (see paragraph 38 above).",

Hungary, \u201cthe first, critical, question in an Article 14 analysis is whether two persons or groups of persons are in an analogous or relevantly similar situation\u201d (\u00a7 12). It is only if such comparability is verified that the question arises as to the difference in treatment between these persons in comparable situations and whether it is justified. There is in fact no conceptual problem of treating situations which are not analogous or comparable in a different way: the very question of the different treatment of non-comparable situations does not make any sense. Comparability is the logical precondition for engaging in the exercise of examining the justification for a difference in treatment.

Judges O\u2019Leary and Koskelo pertinently state, in paragraph 10 of their concurring opinion, cited above, that \u201cthe long and open-ended list of prohibited grounds in Article 14 means that a lack of rigour in cases where the comparator is central mean all \u2018eggs\u2019 are placed in the justification and reasonableness basket. When that happens ... it may be all too easy for a lacklustre defence by a respondent Government on the question of objective and reasonable justification to lead to the finding of a violation\u201d. They point to the consequences that this may have for the respondent State or for other States with social protection mechanisms involving similar distinctions, or which are planning reforms in the area concerned. In addition, we note that the fundamental principle of comparison seems to be founded in the tautology that one can only compare what is comparable, which obviously does not lead very far. The question of the basis of comparison is raised by Kelsen in the following way: \u201cTo say that two cases are similar is simply to ask that they coincide in certain essential points\u201d.

In short, as noted by Judges O\u2019Leary and Koskelo in their concurring opinion, \u201cthe analysis is both specific and contextual\u201d (\u00a7 26). It is therefore necessary to examine the question of comparability \u201cwith reference to all the differences, past and present, which characterise the situation of the applicant and those who belong to his chosen comparator group\u201d (\u00a7 25 of the concurring opinion cited above), an operation which makes it necessary to \u201cinclude not only the beneficiaries\u2019\u00a0circumstances at the point in time where the impugned measures took effect and the impact of those measures but also the factors that determine the nature of the entitlements or benefits at the outset, the basis on which those entitlements have accrued and the State guarantee which supports them\u201d (\u00a7 19). In F\u00e1bi\u00e1n the origin of the benefits, which constituted the difference between the retirement schemes under which the rights had been acquired, played an essential role.",

In short, their disabilities had different origins. Taking into account the origin of the disability in this way is not in itself open to criticism. However, it can be criticised if it establishes the origin of the disability as the sole element of comparison. It would simply be too easy, not to say simplistic, to see in the origin of the disability a difference of such magnitude that the situation of the various disabled persons is not even comparable (leaving aside the justification for a difference in treatment which takes into account the difference in the origin of the disability). Proceeding in such a way would lead to almost as many distinct situations as there are disabilities and would lose sight of something essential: the disability itself.",

The content and objective of the Social Welfare Act and the Veterans\u2019 Entitlements Act concern the regulation of social benefits, reflecting a system by which the community provides assistance to its most vulnerable members, a category which obviously includes disabled persons (Article 69 \u00a7 4 of the Serbian Constitution mentions disabled persons and war veterans as beneficiaries of special protection \u2013 incidentally, without making any distinction, see paragraph 23 of the judgment). A specific and contextual analysis of the respective situations implies that the comparison must be made on the basis not only of the origin of the disabilities of the members of the two groups, but also of their respective needs. On the question of needs, it must be noted that the two groups are similar, given that civilians can have the same disabilities and the same degree of incapacity as war veterans.

A second way would be to first admit that the difference between civilian and military status is rooted in reality (some have fought in war, others have not). However, at this stage, one could consider that this difference in the status of the protagonists is precisely a material characteristic and not an inequality, leaving untouched the comparability of their situations which, under certain conditions, could justify differentiated measures in favour of war veterans. In other words, the difference in the treatment of civilians and war veterans by way of legislative provisions \u2013 based on the different origins of their disabilities \u2013 leaves their comparability unaffected.",

This specific rationale, which may \u2013 at least in part \u2013 be at the origin of the benefits granted to this specific group and which may therefore be relevant for the question of justification, does not however affect the comparability of disabled war veterans with disabled civilians.
