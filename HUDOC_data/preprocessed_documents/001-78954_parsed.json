The Government alleged that the \u201cprescribed rules\u201d were envisaged by the Law and the Decree, while the applicant contended that these were legal acts of the former USSR and were no longer valid and applicable in  following its independence. Thus, according to him, no \u201cprescribed rules\u201d existed in  which he was found to have violated. In support of their arguments, both parties advanced their own interpretation of various domestic and international provisions, such as 's Declaration of Independence, the Constitutional Law on the Foundations of Independent Statehood, the Constitution of 1995 and the CIS Convention.",

While the Decision of the Supreme Council of Armenia of 26 February 1992, as pointed out by the Government, explicitly allowed the application of two former USSR laws on the  (see paragraph 34 above), no such decision was ever adopted in respect of the Law or the Decree. Furthermore, the Court does not agree with the Government that Armenia would have faced a legal crisis if the former USSR laws were no longer applied after its independence, since it is clear from Articles 1 and 2 of Armenia's Declaration of Independence that all the legal acts of the former ASSR, which included a constitution and all the vital codes, were transformed into legal acts of the newly independent Republic of Armenia. It is not obvious, however, from the wording of these provisions whether the same applied to the former  laws.",

The Court, however, would draw attention to the absence of any domestic case-law concerning the disputed matter. Notwithstanding the Court's request, the Government failed to submit any examples of domestic practice, such as copies of any court decisions or judgments which would clarify this issue or at least make references to any former  laws, in general, or the Law and the Decree, in particular. Furthermore, the domestic courts in the present case also failed to refer to any legal act which prescribed the rules for holding rallies and street processions which the applicant was found to have violated. Thus, having regard to the domestic courts' lack of reference to any legal provision prescribing the rules in question and to the absence of any case-law concerning the applicability of the former USSR laws in Armenia following its independence, the Court considers that the law in question, namely the \u201cprescribed rules\u201d referred to in Article 180.1 of the CAO, was not formulated with such precision as to enable the applicant to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences of his actions (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Baklanov, cited above). The Court notes that following the dissolution of the USSR there was no legal act applicable in  which contained these rules and the relevant law was adopted only on 28 April 2004. The Court accepts that it may take some time for a country to establish its legislative framework in a transition period, but it cannot accept the delay of almost thirteen years to be justifiable, especially when such a fundamental right as freedom of peaceful assembly is at stake. The Court concludes that the interference with the applicant's right to freedom of peaceful assembly was not prescribed by law.",
