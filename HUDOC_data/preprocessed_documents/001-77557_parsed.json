The terms of the agreement were stated on the cover of the bank account savings card. There was a bank stamp which defined three terms of the deposit: the amount of the savings, the duration of the deposit and the interest rate of 10%. Since the parties did not terminate the agreement after it expired, it was considered that the certificate was extended. Until 1992 the bank continued to pay him interest, but at differing rates.",

From October 1982 until the end of June 1986, the bank paid the applicant 11% interest, which was 1% higher than stated at the bank stamp on the bank account savings card. From 1 July 1986 until the end of 1990, the bank paid the applicant interest at a rate lower than 10%. This was in accordance with a bank decision, which was based on an inter-bank agreement which stipulated that domiciliary interest rate was to be calculated on the foreign currency deposits as of July 1986. In pursuance of that inter-bank agreement, the bank paid the applicant domiciliary interest lower than 10%. In absence of a written contract specifying a fixed interest rate and the fact that the applicant accepted the payment of an interest of 11% for a certain period, the court concluded that the parties had agreed on a variable interest rate.",

It observes that it took four years for the Kocani Court of First Instance to decide the applicant's claim after the Court of Appeal had referred the case back for re-examination (17\u00a0November 1997-23 November 2001). Within this period, there was a period of total inactivity of two years and eight months (from\u00a017\u00a0November\u00a01997 to 12 July 2000). The proceedings lay dormant for additional one year and two months (between 12 July 2000 and 27\u00a0September 2001). The Court cannot find that the Government has given sufficient explanation for the delays that occurred. As it has consistently held, it might be reasonable for national courts to await under certain circumstances the outcome of parallel proceedings as a measure of procedural efficiency. However, this decision must be reasonable having regard to the special circumstances of the case (see mutatis mutandis K\u00f6nig\u00a0v. , judgment of 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, \u00a7\u00a0110; Boddaert\u00a0v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 12 October 1992, Series A no. 235D, \u00a7\u00a039; Pafitis and Others v. Greece, judgment of 26 February 1998, Reports\u00a01998I, \u00a7\u00a097). In the present case, the national courts neither stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of the enforcement proceedings concerning the bank's request for counter-enforcement nor was their outcome of importance for the proceedings complained of. The lapse of four years before the trial court cannot be justified by considerations of procedural efficiency as it should have acted with particular expedience given the length of proceedings at that stage.",
