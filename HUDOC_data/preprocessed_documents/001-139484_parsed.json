In particular, there was no evidence to suggest that the applicant might obstruct the establishment of the truth by destroying evidence. In fact, he could no longer do that, because in December 2005 the investigating authorities had carried out a search of Print Capital\u2019s premises, seizing all its financial and other documents; information on the company\u2019s assets and bank accounts had been attached. The Town Court\u2019s reference to the risk of the applicant absconding was not supported by relevant facts either. The applicant had always appeared when summoned by the investigating authorities and had no intention of absconding. He suffered from a heart disease and since his placement in detention his state of health had deteriorated. His poor health would not allow him to abscond or obstruct the proceedings.

The Court welcomes the approach adopted by the Supreme Court in the present case, which was in conformity with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. However, even assuming that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions could have been regarded as an acknowledgment of a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under that provision, this acknowledgement related only to a part of his pre-trial detention. By 30 January 2007 he had already been deprived of his liberty for more than a year. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s release was ordered only on 17 April 2007 after the quashing of the detention order of 22 February 2007. The Court also notes that the applicant was not awarded any compensation at the national level. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that the applicant can still claim to be a victim in respect of his complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",
