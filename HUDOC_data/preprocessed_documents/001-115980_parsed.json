In its judgment, which ran to ninety-three pages, it dismissed an objection that the investigations into the alleged offence of concealment of a body had been unlawful as they had resulted from an abuse of process by the civil party in the form of a spurious accusation. It further held that the fact that the victim\u2019s body had never been discovered did not prove that no crime had been committed; on the contrary, the disappearance of the body might have been an aspect of the crime designed to thwart any useful inquiries. Furthermore, after noting that the applicant was the only person charged with murder in the case, it observed that it would be appropriate to examine his attitude towards the missing person\u2019s family and the proceedings. The Investigation Division found that the applicant had indulged in a series of lies, omissions and changes of story that could not be explained by his anxiety at being held in police custody or the fear of making statements that could jeopardise his career as a lawyer. It concluded that sufficient evidence had been gathered in the proceedings to suggest that the applicant had intentionally killed A.R. in order to appropriate the sum of three million French francs.",

In its view, the requirement to give reasons in criminal cases amounted to a legal guarantee of the constitutional requirement for legislation to prevent any arbitrary decisions by the courts in accordance with the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty. Not including reasons could be justified on condition that appropriate safeguards were provided by law to preclude any arbitrariness. The Constitutional Council considered that such safeguards were afforded in proceedings before the assize courts, for the following reasons: the principle that proceedings were conducted orally (only evidence adduced orally and examined by the parties in the defendant\u2019s presence was taken into account in the deliberations) and were uninterrupted (the judges and jury deliberated immediately after the oral proceedings ended); the requirement for the assize court to determine the case on the basis of a reasoned judicial decision, namely the order by the investigating judge or the judgment of the Investigation Division committing the accused for trial; the detailed arrangements concerning deliberations within the assize court; the requirement for the assize court and its president to ensure that the questions put to the court were clear, precise and geared to the circumstances of each individual; and the principle that the verdict was the direct expression of the personal conviction of the members of the jury, seeing that all decisions that were unfavourable to the defendant had to be adopted by at least an absolute majority of the jury.",

Similarly, it was obvious that nobody could have understood the reasons for the judgment convicting him, even in the light of the two questions and the indictment (he referred to Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, ECHR 2010). Although the indictment had given a detailed account of the background to A.R.\u2019s disappearance and her relationship with the applicant, it had not contained any information about the essential elements of any criminal charge: where, when and how had the alleged offence been committed? Only through the answers to these questions could he have understood the verdict, especially as no reasons had been given for the departure from the assessment of the first-instance assize court, which had acquitted him. The applicant pointed out that besides the allegation of murder, there were two other possible explanations for A.R.\u2019s death, based on precise and established factual circumstances: the victim had disappeared of her own accord before committing suicide, or she had been killed by the Mafia during what was commonly known as the \u201ccasino war\u201d on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in 1977. He also explained that he had applied for a retrial on account of fresh witness evidence indicating that A.R. had been murdered by the Marseilles Mafia following the sale of her shares in the Palais de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e casino under conditions that had prevented the Mafia from adding the casino to the others it effectively controlled.",

They stated firstly that the requirement to give reasons for court decisions, which did not appear in the Convention, was to be seen as just one aspect of the proceedings, which needed to be examined as a whole. As a result, the Court had not criticised the fact that in French law, judgments of assize courts did not contain reasons; the finding by a Chamber to that effect in the Papon v. France decision of 15 November 2001 (no. 54210/00, \u00a7 26, ECHR 2001-XII) had thus been confirmed by the Grand Chamber in the Taxquet judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90 and 93). A statement of reasons was not the only means of understanding the decision, since the assize court\u2019s finding as to guilt resulted from reasoning which the defendant could understand and reconstruct through a set of safeguards afforded during the trial (they cited Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7 92).",

In these circumstances, Article 6 requires an assessment of whether sufficient safeguards were in place to avoid any risk of arbitrariness and to enable the accused to understand the reasons for his conviction. Such procedural safeguards may include, for example, directions or guidance provided by the presiding judge to the jurors on the legal issues arising or the evidence adduced, and precise, unequivocal questions put to the jury by the judge, forming a framework on which the verdict is based or sufficiently offsetting the fact that no reasons are given for the jury\u2019s answers (ibid.; see also Papon, cited above).
