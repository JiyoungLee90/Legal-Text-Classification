In this context, the Court observes that, according to the wording of Article\u00a0117 of the Code, \u201cin the absence of a dispute over the amount\u201d of salary arrears, retired employees were entitled to compensation for late payment of such arrears until their \u201cfactual payment\u201d (Article 117\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01) and, \u201cin the event of a dispute over the amount\u201d of salary arrears, compensation was to be paid if that dispute was resolved in the employee's favour (Article 117 \u00a7\u00a02). Particular importance must be attached to the fact that the second paragraph of Article 117 of the Code, which concerns entitlement to compensation in the event of judicial determination of the amount of salary arrears and was applicable to the applicant's claims at issue, does not provide for compensation until the factual payment of salary arrears, unlike the first paragraph of Article 117. Thus, it cannot be reasonably argued that those provisions provided for an entitlement to compensation as regards delays in payment of salary arrears taking place after their amount was determined by a court.",

Moreover, the Court reiterates that it is not a court of appeal from the decisions of domestic courts and that, as a general rule, it is for those courts to interpret domestic law and assess the evidence before them (see, for instance, Waite and Kennedy v.
