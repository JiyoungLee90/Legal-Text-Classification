I consider the applicant's separation from his daughter to be all the more serious as the child needed to remain in contact with her father, especially because of her young age (see, mutatis mutandis, Berrehab v. the Netherlands, judgment of 21\u00a0June\u00a01988, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0138, \u00a7\u00a037).
