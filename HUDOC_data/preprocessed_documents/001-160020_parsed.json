They pointed out that (i) \u201csection 7/E (2) surveillance\u201d was always linked to a particular crime and could only be ordered for the purposes of identifying or locating suspects, whereas \u201csection\u00a07/E\u00a0(3) surveillance\u201d was not linked to any particular crime; (ii) \u201csection\u00a07/E\u00a0(2) surveillance\u201d was always ordered by the court, whereas \u201csection\u00a07/E\u00a0(3) surveillance\u201d was authorised by the government minister in charge of justice; (iii) the decision on ordering \u201csection\u00a07/E\u00a0(2) surveillance\u201d was subject to detailed reasoning, whereas no reasoning was included in the minister\u2019s decision on ordering \u201csection\u00a07/E\u00a0(3) surveillance\u201d; and (iv) under the legislation relating to \u201csection\u00a07/E\u00a0(2) surveillance\u201d, all collected but irrelevant information had to be destroyed within eight days, unlike in the case of \u201csection\u00a07/E\u00a0(3) surveillance\u201d.",

In one aspect the Constitutional Court agreed with the applicants, namely, it held that the decision of the minister ordering secret intelligence gathering had to be supported by reasons. However, the Constitutional Court held in essence that the scope of national security-related tasks was much broader that the scope of the tasks related to the investigation of particular crimes. For the purpose of national security, the events of real life were examined not for their criminal law relevance; therefore they might not necessarily be linked to a particular crime. Furthermore, in the context of national security, the external control of any surveillance authorised by the minister was exercised by Parliament\u2019s National Security Committee (which had the right to call the minister to give account both in general terms and in concrete cases) and by the Ombudsman, and that this scheme was sufficient to guarantee respect for the constitutional right to privacy of those concerned. Finally, the Constitutional Court was of the opinion that the National Security Act, which applies to \u201csection\u00a07/E\u00a0(3) surveillance\u201d, contained general provisions on ex officio deletion of any data unnecessary for achieving the aim underlying the gathering of intelligence.",

As to the requirement of the clarity of rules the Court also pointed out that the laws should specify the cases and circumstances which warrant such interference and the conditions of the interference. As a minimum guarantee the laws should determine the criteria based on which the scope of persons potentially affected can be determined and should contain provisions regulating the documentation of the use of secret intelligence devices and specifying the rules applicable to the protection and destruction of the documentation.

Therefore national security-related tasks are not comparable to secret intelligence gathering linked to investigating a crime, which is carried out under section 69 of Rtv. and is subject to authorisation by a court. The prevention and elimination of risks to national security require political decisions, therefore decisions of this type fall in the competence of the executive power.

In doing so, it must start from the principle that secret intelligence methods for national security purposes may only be used even by the anti-terrorist organ as a last resort means of detection. Section 53 (2) of Nbtv. clearly provides for the ultima ratio nature of secret intelligence methods: the special devices and methods of secret intelligence gathering can only be used where the data needed for the completion of a prescribed task cannot be obtained in any other way, namely by the traditional means of detection.

Relying on several observations made in this report, the Government submitted that the domestic courts were not suitable to determine the necessity of secret intelligence gathering for national security purposes due to the nature of the data to be assessed, to the inherent subjectivity of the risk assessment, to the political nature of the notion of national security and to the wide margin of appreciation afforded in this field to the Government.",

The reason for that was that, in authorising national security secret intelligence gathering, the decision, for which the decision-maker bore political responsibility, was to be taken by assessing the country\u2019s security interests and by taking into account home and foreign political aspects. Consequently, the Minister of Justice \u2013 bearing political responsibility  was a person more qualified than judges to make such decisions.

However, this margin is subject to European supervision embracing both legislation and decisions applying it.

It is therefore essential to have clear, detailed rules on interception of telephone conversations, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated.

Greece, 25 May 1993, \u00a7\u00a040, Series A no. 260A). It is satisfied that even in the field of secret surveillance, where foreseeability is of particular concern, the danger of terrorist acts and the needs of rescue operations are both notions sufficiently clear so as to meet the requirements of lawfulness. For the Court, the requirement of \u201cforeseeability\u201d of the law does not go so far as to compel States to enact legal provisions listing in detail all situations that may prompt a decision to launch secret surveillance operations. The reference to terrorist threats or rescue operations can be seen in principle as giving citizens the requisite indication (compare and contrast Iordachi and Others, cited above, \u00a7 46).

In this respect, the Court observes that there is an overlap between the condition that the categories of persons be set out and the condition that the nature of the underlying situations be clearly defined. The relevant circumstances which can give rise to interception, discussed in the preceding paragraphs, give guidance as to the categories of persons who are likely, in practice, to have their communications intercepted.

The techniques applied in such monitoring operations have demonstrated a remarkable progress in recent years and reached a level of sophistication which is hardly conceivable for the average citizen (see the CDT\u2019s submissions on this point in paragraphs 49-50 above), especially when automated and systemic data collection is technically possible and becomes widespread. In the face of this progress the Court must scrutinise the question as to whether the development of surveillance methods resulting in masses of data collected has been accompanied by a simultaneous development of legal safeguards securing respect for citizens\u2019 Convention rights. These data often compile further information about the conditions in which the primary elements intercepted by the authorities were created, such as the time and place of, as well as the equipment used for, the creation of computer files, digital photographs, electronic and text messages and the like. Indeed, it would defy the purpose of government efforts to keep terrorism at bay, thus restoring citizens\u2019 trust in their abilities to maintain public security, if the terrorist threat were paradoxically substituted for by a perceived threat of unfettered executive power intruding into citizens\u2019 private spheres by virtue of uncontrolled yet far-reaching surveillance techniques and prerogatives. In this context the Court also refers to the observations made by the Court of Justice of the European Union and, especially, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, emphasising the importance of adequate legislation of sufficient safeguards in the face of the authorities\u2019 enhanced technical possibilities to intercept private information (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above).",

Reference is made in this context to the views expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Parliament (see paragraphs 23 and 25\u00a0above). This threat to privacy must be subjected to very close scrutiny both on the domestic level and under the Convention.

Indeed, the mere requirement for the authorities to give reasons for the request, arguing for the necessity of secret surveillance, falls short of an assessment of strict necessity (see in paragraphs 72 and 73 below). There is no legal safeguard requiring TEK to produce supportive materials or, in particular, a sufficient factual basis for the application of secret intelligence gathering measures which would enable the evaluation of necessity of the proposed measure  and this on the basis of an individual suspicion regarding the target person (see Roman\u00a0Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 259 and 261).

A measure of secret surveillance can be found as being in compliance with the Convention only if it is strictly necessary, as a general consideration, for the safeguarding the democratic institutions and, moreover, if it is strictly necessary, as a particular consideration, for the obtaining of vital intelligence in an individual operation. In the Court\u2019s view, any measure of secret surveillance which does not correspond to these criteria will be prone to abuse by the authorities with formidable technologies at their disposal. The Court notes that both the Court of Justice of the European Union and the United Nations Special Rapporteur require secret surveillance measures to answer to strict necessity (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above) \u2013 an approach it considers convenient to endorse. Moreover, particularly in this context the Court notes the absence of prior judicial authorisation for interceptions, the importance of which will be examined below in paragraphs 75 et seq. This safeguard would serve to limit the law-enforcement authorities\u2019 discretion in interpreting the broad terms of \u201cpersons concerned identified ... as a range of persons\u201d by following an established judicial interpretation of the terms or an established practice to verify whether sufficient reasons for intercepting a specific individual\u2019s communications exist in each case (see, mutatis mutandis, Roman\u00a0Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7 249).

The Court recalls that the rule of law implies, inter alia, that an interference by the executive authorities with an individual\u2019s rights should be subject to an effective control which should normally be assured by the judiciary, at least in the last resort, judicial control offering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure. In a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such harmful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge (see Klass and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 55 and 56). The Court recalls that in Dumitru Popescu (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-73) it expressed the view that either the body issuing authorisations for interception should be independent or there should be control by a judge or an independent body over the issuing body\u2019s activity. Accordingly, in this field, control by an independent body, normally a judge with special expertise, should be the rule and substitute solutions the exception, warranting close scrutiny (see Klass and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042 and 55). The ex ante authorisation of such a measure is not an absolute requirement per se, because where there is extensive post factum judicial oversight, this may counterbalance the shortcomings of the authorisation (see Kennedy, cited above, \u00a7 167). Indeed, in certain respects and for certain circumstances, the Court has found already that ex ante (quasi-)judicial authorisation is necessary, for example in regard to secret surveillance measures targeting the media. In that connection the Court held that a post factum review cannot restore the confidentiality of journalistic sources once it is destroyed (see Telegraaf Media Nederland Landelijke Media B.V. and Others v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a039315/06, \u00a7\u00a0101, 22\u00a0November 2012; for other circumstances necessitating ex ante authorisation see Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, Reports 1998 II).",

This is especially true in the present-day upheaval caused by terrorist attacks experienced throughout the world and in Europe, all too often involving important losses of life, producing numerous casualties and significant material damage, which inevitably disseminate a feeling of insecurity amongst citizens. The observations made on this point by the Court in Klass and Others are equally valid in the circumstances of the present case: \u201c[d]emocratic societies nowadays find themselves threatened by highly sophisticated forms of espionage and by terrorism, with the result that the State must be able, in order effectively to counter such threats, to undertake the secret surveillance of subversive elements operating within its jurisdiction. The Court has therefore to accept that the existence of some legislation granting powers of secret surveillance over the mail, post and telecommunications is, under exceptional conditions, necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security and/or for the prevention of disorder or crime\u201d (cited above, \u00a7 48).",

For the Court, this exceptional power should be sufficient to address any situations in which external, judicial control would run the risk of losing precious time.

The Minister is under an obligation to present a general report, at least twice a year, to the responsible parliamentary committee about the functioning of national security services, which report, however, does not seem to be available to the public and by this appears to fall short of securing adequate safeguards in terms of public scrutiny (see Roman\u00a0Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7 283). The committee is entitled, of its own motion, to request information from the Minister and the directors of the services about the activities of the national security services. However, the Court is not persuaded that this scrutiny is able to provide redress to any individual grievances caused by secret surveillance or to control effectively, that is, in a manner with a bearing on the operations themselves, the daily functioning of the surveillance organs, especially since it does not appear that the committee has access in detail to relevant documents. The scope of their supervision is therefore limited (see, mutatis mutandis, Roman\u00a0Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7 281).",

In a chillingly accurate forecast, the Report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, of 17 April 2013, analysed the implications of States\u2019 surveillance of communications on the exercise of the human rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion and expression. Immediately after the Snowden revelations, on 21 June 2013, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Protection and Promotion of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression and the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights considered it necessary to highlight a series of international legal principles on the issue and published a \u201cJoint Declaration on surveillance programs and their impact on freedom of expression\u201d. On 26 September 2013 the 35th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners adopted a \u201cResolution on anchoring data protection and the protection of privacy in international law\u201d.

The report dealt with the protection and promotion of the right to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance and the interception of digital communications and the collection of personal data, including on a mass scale. Concerned with media revelations suggesting that the National Security Agency in the United States of America and the General Communications Headquarters in the United Kingdom had developed technologies allowing access to much global internet traffic, call records in the United States, individuals\u2019 electronic address books and huge volumes of other digital communications content, and that these technologies had been deployed through a transnational network comprising strategic intelligence relationships between Governments, regulatory control of private companies and commercial contracts, the UNHCHR underscored that, other than the right to privacy, the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, and to seek, receive and impart information, to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and to family life may also be affected by mass surveillance, the interception of digital communications and the collection of personal data. Targeted surveillance of digital communication may constitute a necessary and effective measure for intelligence and law- enforcement entities when conducted in compliance with international and domestic law, but \u201cit will not be enough that the measures are targeted to find certain needles in a haystack; the proper measure is the impact of the measures on the haystack, relative to the harm threatened; namely, whether the measure is necessary and proportionate\u201d. Mandatory third-party data retention, whereby Governments require telephone companies and Internet service providers to store metadata about their customers\u2019 communications and location for subsequent law-enforcement and intelligence agency access, appears neither necessary nor proportionate. With the line between criminal justice and protection of national security blurring significantly, the sharing of data between law-enforcement agencies, intelligence bodies and other State organs risks violating the right to privacy, because surveillance measures that may be necessary and proportionate for one legitimate aim may not be so for the purposes of another. Thus, States should take steps to ensure that effective and independent oversight regimes and practices are in place, with attention to the right of victims to an effective remedy.",

The Commission insists on a system of judicial authorisation complemented by some form of follow-up control that conditions are being complied with. The power to \u201ccontact chain\u201d, i.e. to identify people in contact with each other, should be framed narrowly: contact chaining of metadata should normally only be possible for people suspected of \u201cactual involvement in particularly seriously offences\u201d, such as terrorism. Strengthened justification requirements and procedural safeguards should apply, such as the involvement of a privacy advocate, with regard to searches of content data. In the view of the Commission, notification that one has been subject to strategic surveillance is not an absolute requirement of Article 8 of the Convention.

In the framework of the relations between the EU and the US, the European Parliament specifically required that effective guarantees be given to Europeans to ensure that the use of surveillance and data processing for foreign intelligence purposes is proportional, limited by clearly specified conditions, and related to reasonable suspicion and probable cause of terrorist activity, stressing that this purpose must be subject to transparent judicial oversight. One year later, the European Parliament resolution of 29\u00a0October 2015 on the follow-up to the European Parliament resolution of 12\u00a0March 2014 called on the Commission to prepare guidelines for Member States on how to bring any instruments of personal data collection for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, including terrorism, into line with the judgments of the Court of Justice on data retention and on Safe Harbour, pointing in particular to paragraphs 58 and 59 of the data retention judgment and to paragraphs 93 and 94 of the Safe Harbour judgment, which, in the parliamentarians\u2019 view, clearly demand a targeted approach for data collection rather than a \u2018full take\u2019. It further warned against the obvious downward spiral for the fundamental right to privacy and personal data protection occurring when every bit of information on human behaviour is considered to be potentially useful in combating future criminal acts, necessarily resulting in a mass surveillance culture where every citizen is treated as a potential suspect and leading to the corrosion of societal coherence and trust.",

In Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared that the Commission\u2019s US Safe Harbour Decision is invalid, because it authorises, on a generalised basis, storage of all the personal data of all the persons whose data is transferred from the EU to the United States without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective pursued and without an objective criterion being laid down for determining the limits of the access of the public authorities to the data and of its subsequent use. The Court added that legislation permitting the public authorities to have access on a generalised basis to the content of electronic communications must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life. Likewise, the Court observed that legislation not providing for any possibility for an individual to pursue legal remedies in order to have access to personal data relating to him, or to obtain the rectification or erasure of such data, compromises the essence of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, the existence of such a possibility being inherent in the existence of the rule of law. Finally, the Court found that the Safe Harbour Decision denies the national data protection supervisory authorities their powers where a person calls into question whether the decision is compatible with the protection of the privacy and of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. The Court held that the Commission did not have competence to restrict the national supervisory authorities\u2019 powers in that way.",

This assumption is wrong in the present case, in face of the letter of section 7/E (3) of the Police Act, which specifically refers to preventing, tracking and repealing of attempts to carry out terrorist acts in Hungary (subsection (1) point a) sub-point ad)) and to rescuing Hungarian citizens who are in distress due to an imminent and life-threatening danger of act of war, armed conflict, hostage-taking or terrorist action outside the territory of Hungary (subsection (1) point (e)). As is clear, these tasks refer either to to the criminal prevention of acts of terrorism in Hungary or to rescue operations in situations of danger, war, armed conflict, hostage-taking or terrorist action already ongoing outside the territory of Hungary. In both the cases of criminal prevention and rescue operations, nothing hinders the applicability of the criterion of the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the targeted monitored person is involved in the future commission of a terrorist act or in the creation of an imminent situation of danger when collecting secret intelligence useful for the performance of those tasks.",

The vagueness of this language is impressive, encapsulating the net-widening, all-inclusive, minimalist suspicion threshold supposedly needed to fight efficiently terrorism. In so stating, the Chamber ignores that \u201cThe Court does not consider that there is any ground to apply different principles concerning the accessibility and clarity of the rules governing the interception of individual communications, on the one hand, and more general programmes of surveillance, on the other.\u201d Furthermore, such optimistic language is indicative of an illusory conviction that global surveillance is the deus ex machina capable of combating the scourge of global terrorism. Even worse, such delusory language obliterates the fact that the vitrification of society brings with it the Orwellian nightmare of 1984. In practice, the Chamber is condoning, to use the words of the European Parliament, \u201cthe establishment of a fully-fledged preventive state, changing the established paradigm of criminal law in democratic societies whereby any interference with suspects\u2019 fundamental rights has to be authorised by a judge or prosecutor on the basis of a reasonable suspicion and must be regulated by law, promoting instead a mix of law-enforcement and intelligence activities with blurred and weakened legal safeguards, often not in line with democratic checks and balances and fundamental rights, especially the presumption of innocence\u201d.",

This creative rephrasing of the legal test raises several problems. Firstly, it is a stricter criterion than that in paragraphs 233 and 236 of Roman Zakharov. Secondly, it does not match the looser criterion for the degree of suspicion of involvement in the offences or activities being monitored. It is logically inconsistent that the same judgment imposes a \u201cstrict necessity\u201d test for the determination of the surveillance measure, but at the same time accepts a very loose criterion for the degree of suspicion of involvement in the offences or activities being monitored, as demonstrated above. It is logically incoherent to criticise the overly broad text of the Hungarian law when it refers to the \u201cpersons concerned identified as a range of persons\u201d and yet to accept the linguistically vague and legally imprecise \u201cindividual suspicion\u201d test to ground the applicability of a surveillance measure.
