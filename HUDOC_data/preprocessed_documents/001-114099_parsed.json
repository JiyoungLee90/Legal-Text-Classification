In excluding A.P.\u2019s statement the court relied on the statement of a psychologist, who submitted that in cases of extreme tiredness a person may be prone to making false self-incriminating statements. As to the statement of O.O., the court considered it unreliable because she had reason to resent the police officers who had arrested her on 10 December 2005. Moreover, some of the assertions she had made in her statement were considered to be contradictory. As to the findings of the panel of forensic doctors, the court held that they were refuted by the statements of one of the experts who had signed the report dated 31 May 2006, I.C. That expert had been invited to testify by one of the accused police officers. He had changed his opinion and had stated that Leonid Ghimp\u2019s injuries could have been caused between 6.35 a.m. on 9 December and 6.35 a.m. on 10\u00a0December 2005 that is prior to his detention.

In particular, they all changed their statements as regards the manner in which Leonid Ghimp came to the police station. One of them, A.P., later admitted to violence having been used against Leonid Ghimp during his detention, but withdrew this statement some time later, citing such reasons as tiredness and hunger at the time of questioning. At an advanced stage of the proceedings, another accused officer, I.B., produced a new possible explanation for Leonid Ghimp\u2019s injuries, stating that a table had fallen over and landed on his stomach during questioning.
