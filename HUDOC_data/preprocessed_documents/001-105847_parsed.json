The Government, on the other hand, contended that the police bore no responsibility for the applicant\u2019s injuries, which had either been selfinflicted or had been caused by use of proportionate force made strictly necessary by the applicant\u2019s own conduct. Relying on the statements of the two police officers involved in the incidents (K.B. and \u00d6.M.), they argued that prior to his identity check, which had taken place before his medical examination on 28 October 2006, the applicant had begun acting violently and had hit his head against the front window of the \u00dcsk\u00fcdar police headquarters in a fit of frenzy. The applicant\u2019s rowdy conduct had necessitated his being restrained by forceful means, including being handcuffed while in a stranglehold. All of the injuries found on the applicant\u2019s body could thus be traced back to these incidents, which had taken place outside the \u00dcsk\u00fcdar police headquarters on 28\u00a0October 2006.",

The Court reiterates here that, where an individual raises an arguable claim that he has been seriously ill-treated by the police or other such agents of the State unlawfully and in breach of Article 3, that provision, read in conjunction with the State\u2019s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to \u201csecure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ...

In fact, there is a considerable amount of evidence provided by the applicant, which the Government failed to rebut, to suggest that the investigation file which formed the basis of the public prosecutor\u2019s decision did not even contain a copy of the Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institute\u2019s preliminary report of 28\u00a0October 2006. Although the findings in the Haydarpa\u015fa Numune Hospital\u2019s report of 28 October 2006 alone were sufficient to establish the extent of the injuries sustained by the applicant, the public prosecutor\u2019s apparent indifference as to the incompleteness of the case file casts doubt on the accuracy, breadth and fairness of the entire investigation, particularly in view of the repeated attempts by the applicant to have this particular deficiency remedied.",

Confining the examination solely to the events surrounding the applicant\u2019s arrest on 27 October 2006, the public prosecutor concluded that the applicant\u2019s injuries had been caused by his resistance to arrest and that the police had not used excessive force while taking him into detention. In coming to this conclusion the public prosecutor relied mainly on the arrest report, the statements made by the police officers who had conducted the applicant\u2019s arrest and the witness statement by E.A., who had testified on behalf of the police. The public prosecutor also took into account whatever medical certificates he had in the investigation file, including those establishing the injuries sustained by two of the arresting officers. However, the public prosecutor failed to answer the obvious question as to why the medical report issued immediately after the applicant\u2019s arrest bore no sign of ill-treatment, if the injuries noted in subsequent reports had really been sustained at the time of arrest. Nor did he refer, even briefly, to the events that allegedly occurred the next day outside the \u00dcsk\u00fcdar police headquarters, not even to endorse K.B.\u2019s version of events. The Court notes in this connection that even assuming that the events had indeed occurred as recounted by K.B., the national authorities were still under an obligation to demonstrate with convincing arguments that the force used by K.B. to restrain the applicant was not excessive and was indispensable, particularly in view of the hyperaemia noted on the applicant\u2019s neck which indicated forceful strangulation (see above paragraph\u00a017 and 19). The applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment against K.B. were, therefore, left completely unexamined.",

The Court notes in particular that the facts of the dispute concerning the applicant\u2019s illtreatment have not been the subject of any determination by a national court or other judicial authority and that, consequently, the investigation was not capable of establishing the true circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s treatment. The Court therefore considers that the Government, who simply relied on the unscrutinised statements of K.B. and \u00d6.M., that is the perpetrator of the alleged ill-treatment and his colleague and relative by marriage, have failed to meet their responsibility to provide a plausible explanation as to how the applicant suffered his injuries while he was in the hands of agents of the State. In those circumstances the Court finds that the violence inflicted on the applicant on 28 October 2006, as described by the applicant himself and which appears consistent with the findings of the medical report of the same date, reaches the threshold of inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",
