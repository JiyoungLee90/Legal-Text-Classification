The Regional Commission held that Ringeisen\u2019s plans were incompatible with the principles enunciated in Section 4 (1) of the Upper Austrian Real Property Transactions Act as it was to be feared that more than half of the various properties in question were to be sold for building. The contract for sale of 6th February 1962 was therefore found to be designed to destroy and break up a farm which had up till then been a workable unit, to bring about the abandonment of farm buildings and to effect a resale of valuable agricultural land for profit (Section 6 of the Upper Austrian Real Property Transactions Act).",

In computing the sentence, the Supreme Court held that the reasons for mitigation predominated in substance if not in number and that it was therefore possible to apply Article 265a of the Code of Criminal Procedure; the sentence originally imposed in January 1966 had been appropriate to Ringeisen\u2019s convictions at that time but account should be taken of the fact that the charge of defrauding F.

When it is further taken into consideration that the accused\u2019s transactions with regard to the above-named properties and the criminal charges and civil actions relating to these transactions have been given very wide publicity, then it cannot be supposed that the accused will still be able to advertise and to find purchasers for building plots.

After about two and a half years spent in detention on remand it could no longer be reasonably assumed that he would abscond in order to avoid prosecution, even having regard to the sentence pronounced on 18th October 1966. As to the danger of his committing further offences, the Court of Appeal observed that two charges unconnected with the Alkoven property (fraud on F. Widmann and fraudulent conversion) had been discontinued on 14th September 1966; the only count remaining was that which concerned the fraud perpetrated on the 78 purchasers of sites at Alkoven. The court had already pointed out in the decision of 2nd March 1966 that Ringeisen could no longer deal with that property. Moreover, it could be expected that the length of his detention on remand would suffice to deter Ringeisen from committing further offences, especially as he had had no previous convictions.",

This interpretation was - they stated - the only one in conformity with the ratio legis of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, namely the protection of the States against any decision holding them responsible for a violation of an international obligation without the competent national authorities having been seized of the complaint in order to remedy the situation where necessary.

The same holds true for the complaint made against a member who was alleged by Ringeisen to have made certain statements the precise tenor of which the Regional Commission was, moreover, at pains to restore (paragraph 22 above). As to the twofold fact that the president had represented the Regional Commission before the  in 1964 and that another member had been heard as a witness, this is obviously immaterial. Nor, finally, can any grounds of legitimate suspicion be found in the fact that two other members had participated in the first decision of the Regional Commission, for it cannot be stated as a general rule resulting from the obligation to be impartial that a superior court which sets aside an administrative or judicial decision is bound to send the case back to a different jurisdictional authority or to a differently composed branch of that authority.",

The predominant part played at the outset by the provisional detention in the fraudulent bankruptcy case was again made clear a few months later: on 24th and 27th September 1965, Ringeisen had attacked the two decisions of the investigating judges who, in both cases, had rejected his requests to be released but the file contains only one decision of the Judges\u2019 Chamber dismissing an appeal, that given on 10th November 1965 in the fraudulent bankruptcy case (paragraph 64 above; see also paragraph 65).",

Such detention having been effected or continued following the conviction cannot be considered on the same footing as a detention under Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c) with which Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) is solely concerned. On the other hand, we cannot assume that a detention ordered under Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c), even if not expressly revoked, can continue to be reckoned as detention for the purpose of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) after the person detained is convicted by a competent court. Moreover, a person kept in detention consequent upon conviction cannot complain of deprivation of liberty under Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) which applies only to persons in custody awaiting their trial. In this connection, I can usefully refer to paragraph 9 at page 23 in the Wemhoff judgment (27th June 1968).",

The presumption of guilt is only a rebuttable one; it becomes final and conclusive after the decision of an appellate court or by lapse of the time allowed for appeal if no appeal is lodged against such conviction.",

From this it might be inferred that the continued detention after the date of conviction cannot be considered as one under Article 5 (1) (a) (art. 5-1-a). Bearing in mind the suspensive effect of the applicant entering an appeal and plea of nullity and of what has been stated on that occasion before the court by the counsel for the prosecution, this view carries a certain amount of weight. But against this one might advance the following points. For the purpose of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) the kind of detention we are concerned with is the one effected under Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c). Therefore in order to rule on the relevancy of the post conviction period of detention for Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3), we must be able to say that the detention of the applicant during such period did not lose its previous character.

His complaints turned out to be entirely untenable and unfounded. In other words, he was all the time abusing the process of the court with the result of prolonging unnecessarily the proceedings in the investigation and of delaying the completion of his case by preventing it from being brought before the court for trial.
