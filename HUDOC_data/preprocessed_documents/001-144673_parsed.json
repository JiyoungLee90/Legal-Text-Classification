The demonstration was supposed to be held in a recreational park in the village of Usukhchay from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the estimated number of participants was 5,000.

He\u00a0further explained that at some time after 10\u00a0a.m. on 25 April 2006, his men had stopped a large group of protesters who had been trying to enter Usukhchay. Mr Akb. had spoken with the leaders of the protesters and explained to them that \u201cthe demonstration had not been authorised, and that the actions [of the demonstrators] were unlawful\u201d. Subsequently, he had been involved in the negotiations with the demonstrators. The deputy head of the district administration had proposed to the protesters that they hold the demonstration in a municipal garage, explaining that if they stayed in the square near the district administration premises, they risked blocking the main road. The leaders of the protesters visited the garage, but were not satisfied with that offer. They informed the authorities that they would send the protesters to Miskindzha and hold their demonstration there, in the village community centre. When the negotiations were over, a small group of protesters started to move towards the village centre, whereas others marched to Miskindzha, accompanied by the police. At about 1 p.m. Mr Akb. was informed that the federal road had been blocked by two large heaps of stones. He arrived at the scene and started to negotiate with the leaders of the protesters. He tried to persuade them to unblock the road, but they refused and insisted on meeting the leadership of the Dagestan Republic. New people arrived at the scene, armed with stones and sticks. Since the negotiations had failed, Mr Akb. ordered the police to start clearing the road. The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers, several of whom were hit, so Mr\u00a0Akb. authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons. Once the first heap of stones had been removed and the traffic had started to move, the police discovered that 300 metres further down the road it had again been obstructed with pipes. Throughout that time the police officers had stones thrown at them. Mr Akb. authorised them to use firearms but only above the heads of the protesters. By 6 p.m. the road had been unblocked.",

There is no proof that the authorities had arrested the applicants on the basis of wittingly false accusations and evidence. Furthermore, there is no doubt that the detention orders in respect of all three of them were \u201clawful\u201d in domestic terms and issued \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, as required by Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01.",

The applicants spent less than two months in pre-trial detention (one month and twenty-eight\u00a0days for the first applicant, one month and twenty-nine days for the second, and one month and twenty-seven days for the third). Although the reasonableness of the length of the detention cannot be defined in abstracto, and whereas even short periods of detention are susceptible to review by the Court (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a038822/97, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2003-I (extracts), and \u0162urcan v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a039835/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045 et seq., 23 October 2007), the Court observes that in casu the applicants\u2019 detention was mainly justified by the gravity of the charges against them; the three detention orders were equally laconic and did not rely on other facts specific to the situation of each applicant (except for a very general reference to the \u201cpersonality\u201d of the first applicant). The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant\u2019s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Pelevin v. Russia, no.\u00a038726/05, \u00a7 55, 10\u00a0February 2011, with further references). However, most of the previous cases concerned extensions of the pre-trial detention, whereas the present case concerns the initial detention orders imposed immediately after the start of the criminal investigation. The Court reiterates that it has assumed in many cases that during the initial period of detention a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d alone could be a sufficient reason for remanding the suspect in custody (see Kusyk v. Poland, no.\u00a07347/02, \u00a7\u00a037, 24 October 2006). The Court considers that in the present case the seriousness and, more importantly, the character of the alleged crimes (involvement in riots and organising violent resistance to law-enforcement bodies), in the light of the available information about the applicants\u2019 role in the clashes could reasonably constitute sufficient factual grounds justifying the initial detention of the applicants. Since all of the applicants were released after less than two months\u2019 detention, and in view of the overall context of the case the Court is prepared to conclude that their complaint under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (c) and 3 is manifestly ill-founded. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, in these circumstances, Article\u00a010 is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11, a lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26\u00a0April 1991, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 202). The applicants were seeking not only to express their opinion about corruption in the local administration, but to do so together with other demonstrators (see Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany, nos. 8080/08 and 8577/08, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The Court reiterates that in Galstyan v. Armenia (no.\u00a026986/03, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, 15 November 2007), in which the applicant was arrested and convicted because of his behaviour during a demonstration, the Court found it unnecessary to consider the complaint under Article\u00a010 separately from that under Article 11 of the Convention. There are no reasons to depart from that approach in the present case. Consequently the Court concludes that the applicants\u2019 complaint does not require a separate examination under Article 10.",

The Court reiterates that the link between Article\u00a010 and Article 11 is particularly relevant where the authorities have interfered with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in reaction to the views held or statements made by participants in a demonstration or members of an association (see, for example, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

In any event, lacking any proof that the applicants were amongst the organisers of the demonstration, the Court concludes that they have not, as such, been personally affected by the refusal of the district administration to allow it.

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the mere wish of a person to take part in a demonstration does not suffice to conclude that this person was affected by banning or dispersal of a public gathering. It follows that the second applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 11 about his arrest and about the events of 25 April 2011 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article\u00a035 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article\u00a035 \u00a7 4.",

In Ziliberberg the Court decided that a short detention of the applicant and a small fine were not an excessive response to participation in an unauthorised demonstration in a public thoroughfare. However, as the Court stated in Sam\u00fct Karabulut v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 16999/04, \u00a7 35, 27 January 2009, with further references), \u201can unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly\u201d. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, the Court emphasises that their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings (see Berladir and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a034202/06, \u00a7 38, 10 July 2012; Galstyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0116-117; Bukta and Others v.

Thus, it should be established why the demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what was the public interest at stake, and what were the risks represented by the demonstration. The methods used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place and dispersing the demonstration are also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference. Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate even where the Court acknowledged that the demonstration could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above).",

They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay.

There is no proof that the authorities had at their disposal any important piece of evidence or vital information which would refute the initial suspicion against the applicant and which they knowingly ignored. It is thus safe to conclude the authorities genuinely suspected the applicant of having incited attacks against the policemen. Therefore, the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention had a lawful basis (see the Court\u2019s findings under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) above) and pursued a legitimate aim of \u201cprevention disorder or crime\u201d. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court observes that Article 11 does not give immunity against prosecution for violent actions during public gatherings, especially where the intensity of violence is considerable, as in the present case. There is no evidence that the authorities acted in bad faith, the duration of his detention pending the investigation (two months) appears reasonable, given the complexity of the case. Finally, the fact that the applicant was finally released and the charges against him were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence of his involvement in violent acts is indicative of the will of the authorities to establish the truth and not just put the blame for the tragic events of 25 April 2006 on the leaders of the protesters. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to conclude that the two months\u2019 detention of the first applicant following the events of 25 April 2006 was not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention.

The Court has found a violation of this Article in respect of the fact that it was impossible to demonstrate. The Court has stated, in particular, that \u201ccontent-based restrictions on the freedom of assembly\u201d should be justified by convincing arguments, and that the Government failed to provide such arguments. But there were indeed arguments, and the demonstration was prohibited on account of the allegedly inaccurate message being expressed by its organisers, since, according to the authorities, all of the allegations of corruption were false and had been refuted by official investigations and audits (see paragraphs\u00a0132-136 of the judgment). The Court has not explained why these arguments were unconvincing. The Court has also found no violation of Article 11 in respect of the forced dispersal of the demonstration. In my view, there is a link between the content-based refusal to allow the demonstration and the subsequent blockade and clash between protesters and the police. The authorities\u2019 preliminary reaction in the letter of 17\u00a0April 2006 (see paragraph 7) was formalistic and contrary to the fundamental principles of governance in a democratic society, and consequently led to the dissatisfaction which turned into outrage, intolerance and, ultimately, violence. If corruption and embezzlement were the subject-matter of criticism, as in the present case, a dialogue between the authorities and the organisers and the latter\u2019s involvement in the investigation and audit process were vital in order to maintain the legitimacy of the authorities\u2019 power. Therefore, the authorities are partly to blame for the violence committed by the demonstrators and police.",

Outside the context of elections, citizens\u2019 involvement, including through protest, is the only method by which grievances can be brought to the attention of government. In order for citizens\u2019 participation to be meaningful, the government must be responsive to the concerns raised by the citizenry, as the individual\u2019s power to influence is necessarily limited by the government\u2019s responsiveness. To the extent that freedom of association and assembly are considered essential to democratic self-governance, the force of these freedoms is curtailed when government officials are not responsive to the concerns raised. Admittedly, government officials cannot enact every change or proposal advocated by dissident citizens. But a problem arises when officials offer no response, or a perfunctory and/or dismissive response, to claims of wrongdoing by government officials (and in the facts of this case, the fact that the official dismissing the grievances is the very same official against whom they are made is even more problematic). The right to assemble in order to petition the government for redress of grievances is a hollow right when officials offer inadequate responses to potentially valid concerns of corruption. This is especially so in the case of local governments, which are closer and more accessible to the population.",

Upon receiving notice that the applicants intended to hold a demonstration to denounce alleged corruption and misuse of funds by Mr. A and the attendant failure of lawenforcement agencies to counter these abuses, the local authorities responded by stating that those allegations were baseless. In effect, this response seems to suggest the applicants were prohibited from holding their demonstration because the government considered their views to be incorrect. Yet a fundamental purpose of the freedoms of association and assembly is to enable citizens to gather in order to express their own views on the workings of the government and to demand accountability for perceived shortcomings \u2013 governments may not block protests on account of officials\u2019 beliefs that protesters\u2019 positions are inaccurate. This type of inadequate response to citizens\u2019 grievances undermines one of the core functions of the freedom of assembly, namely citizens\u2019 right to selfgovernance and to communicate their views to their government authorities. If denied the ability to hold a demonstration on the issue of alleged corruption by the local authorities, protesters are effectively denied any opportunity of making their views heard by the public and by local authorities.

The applicants\u2019 statements made during the domestic criminal investigation were disregarded in spite of the existence of irrefutable video and testimonial evidence that the first and third applicants had conducted themselves peacefully during the demonstration and that the first applicant had left the scene of the demonstration before the confrontation with the police started (see paragraphs 54-56). In fact, the very fact that the criminal cases against the applicants were dismissed for lack of evidence was not considered. Neither the criminal investigation\u2019s evidence nor its conclusions were taken seriously. Basically, the majority accepted as the uncontested truth the conclusions of the internal inquiry carried out by the federal Ministry of the Interior, which was based on the statements of police officers who had been involved in the dispersal of the demonstration, including the commander of the \u201cmixed squad\u201d, Mr Iz. (see paragraph 66), without even taking note of the fact that none of the police officers had ever referred to the use of knives or guns by the demonstrators against the police in their testimonies before the domestic criminal investigator, or the fact that a police officer had even retracted his previous statement claiming that the demonstrators had acted violently towards the police (see paragraph 53). Although there were reasons to suspect that the wound caused to the sole police officer allegedly injured by a gunshot (Mr Il.) had been accidental and self-inflicted, the fact that Mr Il.\u2019s medical certificate was not presented by the Government to the Court was likewise considered of no importance by the majority (see paragraph\u00a033, contrasted with paragraph 19). Finally, the crucial fact that gas grenades were fired by the police \u201cin the direction of the crowd\u201d, as the Government themselves acknowledged (see paragraph 29), and that one of these gas grenades hit the thorax of a demonstrator and killed him (see paragraph\u00a031), was entirely disregarded by the majority. Thus, the statement that \u201cthe essential finding of the investigation, namely that the protesters had attacked the police first, had support in the materials of the case (see, in particular, paragraphs 34, 36, 37, 38 and 40)\u201d reflects a one-sided reading of the evidence.

The domestic criminal investigation was fruitless, in spite of the seventy witnesses heard and the ballistic and medical forensic examinations carried out. It did not reach any conclusion as to the identity of the people responsible for the death and injuries which occurred during the demonstration of 25 April 2006. In other words, the domestic prosecuting authorities did not, and to this day do not, know exactly who did what and when on 25 April 2006 on the road going to Miskindzha, and therefore closed the investigation in February 2007 and, after reopening it, closed it again in January 2010. If in 2007 the domestic prosecuting authorities knew little about the order of events, the Court knows even less seven years later. Any factual assumption made in 2014 on the basis of an inconclusive criminal investigation and, worse still, of an internal inquiry of the Ministry of the Interior based on evidence produced by the very police officers under investigation, is nothing but pure illusion. Hence, the Court should have refrained from imputing to the applicants responsibility for the grave incident that occurred on 25 April 2006, and instead should have stuck to the bare fact that on that day the police used dangerous weapons unlawfully against the demonstrators and killed one of them.",

In the instant case, the Government did not prove to the required level of satisfaction that the violence had been initiated by the demonstrators, still less that the applicants had been in any way involved in violent action against the police.

On the contrary, it is necessary to consider these issues in order to make a fair assessment of the proportionality of the \u201coverall response\u201d of the police during the demonstration of 25 April 2006 and to be able ultimately to come to a conclusion as to whether the police conduct was in accordance with Article\u00a011 of the European Convention on Human Rights (\u201cthe Convention\u201d).

In the case at hand, the political nature of the assembly and the nature of the administrative and police authorities\u2019 conduct in breach of the State\u2019s negative obligation not to interfere unduly with freedom of assembly, as well as the public place where the police conduct took place, point in the direction of a narrow margin of appreciation for the district administration.

Russian law required organisers to \u201clodge\u201d the notice no earlier than fifteen and no later than ten days before the planned event, failing which the demonstration would be prohibited. In addition to the lack of clarity of this law, already stressed by the majority\u2019s judgment, the way it was applied is subject to justified criticism. The district administration\u2019s interpretation, according to which the notice had to be received before the deadline, is manifestly arbitrary, since it imputes to the organisers any delay caused by the public postal service. This interpretation places an untenable burden on the organisers of the demonstration, in view of the obvious fact that they cannot prevent delays in the public postal service, for which they have no responsibility. Since the organisers of the demonstration sent notice of the demonstration in due time, any delay in the delivery of this notice to its addressees must be imputed to the public postal service and cannot in any way be held against the organisers. Furthermore, as the Government admitted, the notice of the meeting was received by the local administration eight days prior to the holding of the meeting, which allowed a sufficient period of time for the administration to take the necessary measures to guarantee observance of the law. In sum, any requirement regarding the giving of notice to the public authorities may not be excessively stringent in terms of the deadline imposed, and only the belated lodging of the notice can be imputed to the organisers, not its belated receipt. In any case, failure to comply with such a requirement may not be considered as sufficient grounds for prohibiting a demonstration.",

The place chosen by the organisers, a public recreational park, is a traditional public forum, where the State may not restrict speech based on its content unless it can show that such regulation is necessary to secure a compelling State interest and is precisely tailored to achieve that interest. In addition, while regulations as to time, place and manner may be imposed, they must not be of such a nature as to encroach upon the substance of the freedom of assembly, and therefore must take into account the purpose of the demonstrators. In the case at hand, the district administration opposed the demonstration in the recreational park because the latter allegedly had a maximum capacity of 500 people, well below the estimated number of 5,000 demonstrators. According to the Government, the \u201cauthorities\u201d proposed to the organisers that the demonstration be held in a \u201cmunicipal garage\u201d, a proposal which was declined (see paragraphs\u00a024 and 34). Even if the initial concern of the public authorities to ensure the security of the event might have justified a change of venue, the proposed alternative location was evidently unacceptable for two reasons. First, the proposed change from an outdoor to an indoor venue, where its impact would be muted, would have substantially diminished the practical impact of the event on the targeted administrative official and the administrative body he headed, and would have deprived the demonstration of its purpose of raising the political awareness of the general population. Second, even more importantly, the proposed alternative venue would necessarily have implied a reduction in the number of demonstrators, limiting the number of people admitted to express their views and participate in the public debate. Both restrictions would unequivocally have affected the essence of the demonstrators\u2019 freedom of assembly. To formulate it in a principled manner, public authorities may not impose, directly or indirectly, a reduction in the number of participants in a demonstration or a venue where the limited space available would result in such a reduction, or one where the social and political purposes of the demonstrators would be frustrated. Furthermore, they may not \u201crefuse to allow\u201d (that is, prohibit) the holding of such a demonstration if the organisers reject the proposed alternative venue and, in the event that the latter stage the demonstration in the initial venue, may not punish them except where the grounds set forth in Article\u00a011 \u00a7 2 of the Convention apply.",

According to this principle, the State is not assumed to support all the messages that are communicated in public facilities and spaces. It seems that this was not the case in Dagestan. The political purpose and public interest of the demonstration, which was aimed at criticising the work of the head of the district administration and condemning the embezzlement of public funds and the deliberate destruction of financial records by the district administration, were protected by the Russian Constitution (Article\u00a031). Even assuming that, as the head of the district administration claimed, the competent law-enforcement authorities, in particular the prosecutor\u2019s office, and financial authorities such as the Ministry of Finance of Dagestan, had already inquired into those allegations and concluded that there was no case to answer, these conclusions were irrelevant for the purpose of assessing the legality of the demonstration. The fact that the head of the district administration, who was himself the target of the demonstrators\u2019 criticism, took the decision to prohibit the demonstration, with the tacit acceptance of the public prosecutor (see paragraph 24), is telling as regards the deficiency of the rule of law in Dagestan. According to one of the major tenets of a State under the rule of law, namely the principle of impartiality, a public official should not take decisions on issues where he or she has a personal interest. In the light of this principle, a responsible public official would have withdrawn from the case where he or she was the subject of the criticisms of those wishing to demonstrate. In other words, the rule to be extracted from the principle of impartiality is that a public official targeted by a demonstration is not in a position to take any substantive or procedural decision on it, and should therefore withdraw from the case.",

The police officers in Dagestan did the opposite. The gas grenades were fired \u201cin the direction of the crowd\u201d, which means that they were fired in a prohibited manner (see paragraphs 66 and 71).

In the dispersal of violent assemblies, lawenforcement officials may use firearms only in self-defence or in defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury and when less dangerous means have not been effective. In these circumstances, lawenforcement officials must identify themselves as such and give a clear warning of their intent to use firearms, with sufficient time for the warning to be observed, unless to do so would create a risk of death or serious injury to law-enforcement officials or other persons. The Government have not provided the Court with any evidence that these preventive measures were taken by the police before they opened fire against the demonstrators.
