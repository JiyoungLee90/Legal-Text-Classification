The case originated in fifteen applications against the Republic of Azerbaijan lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). The details concerning each application are set out in the appended table.
On various dates notice of the applications or their parts was given to the Azerbaijani Government, who were represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Əsgərov.
The Government did not object to the examination of the present applications by a Committee.
The circumstances relating to the applicants’ arrest and custody, and the subsequent administrative proceedings against them are similar to those in Bayramov v. Azerbaijan ([Committee] nos. 19150/13 and 52022/13, 6 April 2017); Huseynov and Others v. Azerbaijan ([Committee] nos. 34262/14 and 5 others, 24 November 2016); Huseynli and Others v. Azerbaijan (nos. 67360/11 and 2 others, 11 February 2016); and Gafgaz Mammadov v. Azerbaijan (no. 60259/11, 15 October 2015). That is to say, the applicants, who were members of various opposition parties and movements at the material time, were arrested and convicted under different provisions of the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”) with a view to either punishing them for participating in peaceful demonstrations or preventing them from doing so. Further information concerning the applications, including the applicants’ personal details, is set out in the appended table.
The applicant, together with a number of other members of the Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan, was arrested during the dispersal of an unauthorised demonstration held on 23 November 2006. On the same date the Sabail District Court, relying on the related administrative offence report, convicted the applicant under Article 310.1 of the CAO and sentenced him to ten days’ administrative detention. It appears that similar decisions were given in respect of a number of others arrested in connection with the demonstration. The applicant was not represented during the pretrial or trial stage of the proceedings. According to the applicant, following the trial, he was unaware of the decision taken by the court as it was not announced by the judge during the hearing. He was able to obtain a copy of the decision several months later (see below).
On 24 November 2006, E.Q., a lawyer, lodged an appeal against the Sabail District Court’s decision of 23 November 2006 on behalf of several of the members of the Popular Front Party who had been detained, including the applicant. According to the applicant, there had been no contact between him and E.Q. and he was unaware of the appeal lodged by the latter. On 27 November 2006 the Baku Court of Appeal held a hearing in the applicant’s absence and upheld the decision of 23 November 2006.
Following his release from detention, the applicant requested a copy of the Sabail District Court’s decision of 23 November 2006, but to no avail. On 7 February 2007 he managed to obtain a copy by visiting the court’s registry.
On 12 February 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 23 November 2006, alleging a breach of his rights under Articles 5, 6, 10 and 11 of the Convention. He complained, in particular, that he had been denied legal assistance during the pre-trial and trial stage of the proceedings. On 2 March 2007 the Court of Appeal refused to admit his appeal on the grounds that a similar appeal had already been lodged by E.Q. and examined on 27 November 2006.
On 5 February 2007 the applicant instituted civil proceedings, seeking compensation for his unlawful arrest on 23 November 2006 (see application no. 39919/07 above). On 12 June 2008 the Sabail District Court dismissed his civil action. The decision was upheld on appeal on 21 October 2008. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal, but it was left unexamined for procedural reasons.
