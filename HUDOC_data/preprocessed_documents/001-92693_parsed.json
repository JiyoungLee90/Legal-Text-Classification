The report concluded that although the autopsy report dated 26 February 1999 had stated that the entrance hole had been in the back, as following the chemical examination no nitrite and nitrate ions had been found on Halim Bayram\u2019s clothes, this should indicate that the bullet must have entered from the xiphoid process.

The presence of nitrate-nitrite ions on the skin taken from the back of the body and their absence on the front would provide confirmatory evidence that the back contained the entrance wound.

[GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0110113, ECHR 2005VII). The investigation must be capable, firstly, of ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and, secondly, of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (with regard to autopsies, see, for example, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2000VII; concerning witnesses, for example, Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7 109, ECHR 1999IV; and concerning forensic evidence, for example, G\u00fcl v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022676/93, \u00a7\u00a089, 14 December 2000). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capacity to establish the cause of death or identify the person responsible will risk falling below this standard. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v. Turkey, no. 42942/02, \u00a7 63, 8 April 2008).",

Furthermore, no statement had been taken from Halim\u00a0Bayram at the hospital, despite the fact that he had gained consciousness and was able to speak after the operation. In the Government\u2019s observations, it is also accepted that Halim Bayram had regained consciousness the day after the operation, but it is stated that as his survival was still uncertain, and as, in any event, the judicial inquiry had started after his death, no statement had been taken from him at the hospital.

It is noted that the first report filed on 15 September 1998 stated that a bullet exit hole had been noted in the left lumbar region and a bullet entry hole in the chest area. Subsequently, samples of the skin taken from the xiphoid process and the back were examined for chemicals and as a result on 18 September 1998 the Forensic Medicine Institute reported that large amounts of nitrite-nitrate ions had been observed on the piece of skin taken from Halim Bayram\u2019s back and none had been found on the piece of skin taken from the xiphoid process. The Court observes that based on the medical report dated 26\u00a0February 1999, the Forensic Medicine Institute prepared a second report, this time concluding that Halim Bayram had been shot in the back. According to this report, a bullet had entered his back and exited from right below the xiphoid process. In order to determine the exact range from which the shot had been fired, Halim Bayram\u2019s clothes were also sent for chemical examination. In a report dated 25 October 1999, the Forensic Medicine Institute found that there was no trace of nitrite-nitrate ions or gunshot residue on the clothes. Ultimately, on 21 January 2000, the Forensic Laboratory Department issued a final report which contradicted the previous reports filed on 15 and 18 September 1998 and 26 February 1999. This report referred to the finding that no nitrite-nitrate ions or gunshot residue had been found on Halim Bayram\u2019s clothes and concluded that the bullet had entered from the abdomen. At this point, the Court notes that the purpose of the post-mortem examination is to elucidate the circumstances surrounding the death, including an objective analysis of the clinical findings (see G\u00fcl, cited above, \u00a7 89). The Court finds that, in deciding to accept the conclusion in the report of the Forensic Laboratory Department and to terminate the investigation, the relevant authorities failed adequately to investigate or explain the patent contradictions between the findings in that report and those in the two earlier reports of the Forensic Medicine Institute which clearly indicated that Halim Bayram had been shot in the back and not in the abdomen, a view which was confirmed by the ballistics examination of the Halim Bayram\u2019s shirt which contained a single bullet hole in the back and by the subsequent report of Professor Christopher Milroy. The Court further finds that no or no adequate steps were taken by the relevant authorities to investigate the apparent inconsistency between the conclusion that the bullet had entered from the abdomen and the fact that the only gunshot residue on Halim Bayram\u2019s body was found on his back and that no traces of gunfire were found anywhere on his clothing.",

The Court would observe that its difficulty in determining whether there was any substance in the applicant\u2019s claim that his brother was unlawfully killed rests with the failure of the authorities adequately to investigate the circumstances of the death (see, mutatis mutandis, Veznedaro\u011flu v.
