The article went on to present what the journalist deemed to be \u201cthe facts\u201d. Firstly, it stated that it was no coincidence that the son of the applicant\u2019s successor as head of the department of transport in the Gala\u0163i mayor\u2019s office had been employed as a manager by company S., one of the larger private maxi-taxi transport providers operating in the area. It stated that this was an attempt \u201cto ensure peace of mind on the road and a healthy profit\u201d for the transport provider. Secondly, it stated that \u201cit\u2019s blatantly obvious that young Lauren\u0163iu Jalb\u0103 is an old fox in a sneaky business. The dude owns cars that run on the maxi-taxi routes and bring in large sums of money for the private transport operator ACJGT\u201d. The last part of the article depicted violence similar to the kind found in films portraying members of organised crime and went on to state that the local public transport department operated by the town council had made several attempts to improve transport services in the city but its requests for public transport licences \u2013 including transport licences for the routes covered by the maxi-taxis \u2013 had been rejected by \u201cthe mayor\u2019s office when the applicant was employed there\u201d, in spite of the scandal that ensued, \u201cbecause this fellow, with his maxi-taxi business, is not interested in making the public transport services efficient, but rather in filling up his bank accounts without anyone holding him accountable\u201d.",

He argued that the journalist had published an insulting and slanderous article about him, accusing him of abuse of power without any proof and without properly examining the transport legislation in force at the time. He submitted evidence proving that neither he nor his family members owned any maxi-taxi business \u2013 nor were they associated with one \u2013 that no disciplinary or criminal action had been initiated against him for alleged acts of corruption, that the department of transport he was managing had not suffered any loss as a result of his actions, and that no third parties had lodged any complaints in relation to his conduct. In addition, he submitted that \u2013 under the transport legislation in force at the time \u2013 the 2005 contract for transport licences awarded to the local public transport operator could not have been reallocated for a period of five years and no other licences could therefore have been granted during that period.

In addition, he argued that the applicant had failed to ask the newspaper to publish a rebuttal (drept la replic\u0103). Furthermore, his article had used as a source of information complaints lodged with the Gala\u0163i mayor\u2019s office by several vehicle owners with regard to the failure of the mayor\u2019s office to issue transport licences for private maxi-taxi operators which had fulfilled the lawful requirements to obtain such a licence.

It held that the journalist had published the article \u201cTwo Slyboots from the Mayor\u2019s Office Protect the Maxi-taxi Mafia in Gala\u0163i\u201d, in which he portrayed the applicant as a \u201cslyboots\u201d, an \u201cold fox in a sneaky business\u201d, and one of the \u201cfellows with maxi-taxi businesses\u201d who was interested in \u201cfilling up his bank accounts\u201d. The journalist had expressly stated that the applicant \u201cowns cars that run on the maxi-taxi routes\u201d, meaning that he was the proprietor of a business incompatible with his civil-servant status, a statement which would have exposed the applicant to very serious personal and professional consequences if proved to be true. The applicant\u2019s public image had been tarnished by the journalist\u2019s defamatory statements, which had been unsupported by evidence and had not been subject to preliminary investigation. Consequently, the journalist bore responsibility for the damage caused to the applicant because he had acted negligently. Journalistic freedom of expression was not absolute and was restricted by the applicant\u2019s right to dignity, to protection of his public image and to private life. The journalist had failed to carry out a preliminary investigation of the information used in his article and had failed to support any of his statements with relevant evidence, while the applicant had proved that the statements concerned could not be confirmed. No registration number was recorded in the local mayor\u2019s office in connection with the third-party complaint relied on by the journalist, nor did the complaint refer to the applicant\u2019s name or actions. Even if the complaint had in fact contained such references, the applicant would still have enjoyed his right to be presumed innocent pending an official decision. The journalist\u2019s statements had not been substantiated by the copy of the article of 18 September 2008 either, because the applicant\u2019s mother had stopped working as a taxi driver in February 2007, before the article had been published.

It held that the article had concerned an issue of public interest \u2013 in particular the management by a civil servant of public funds pertaining to transport licences \u2013 and not just aspects of the applicant\u2019s private life. In the light of the applicant\u2019s civil-servant status, the limits of acceptable criticism of his activity had been wider and, given the public nature of the debate concerning the management of public funds, the degree of exaggeration and provocation had been tolerable. In addition, the journalist\u2019s comments had been made in the form of a value judgment which did not have to be proved to be exact. A defamed person\u2019s right to respect for his reputation, although legitimate, could very rarely be allowed to prevail over public interest, particularly in circumstances where such public interest was very important. Freedom of expression, in particular the right to impart and receive information, was a central element of democracy. Lastly, the press was democracy\u2019s watchdog and journalistic freedom and the public\u2019s right to access information were extremely broad, even though exercising one\u2019s freedom of expression also entailed duties and responsibilities.",

Not only does the press have the task of imparting information and ideas, the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (see, inter alia, Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 216; Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.\u00a0Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7 59, ECHR 1999-II; and Flux v.\u00a0Moldova (no.\u00a06), no. 22824/04, \u00a7 24, 29 July 2008). Accordingly, journalistic freedom covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Von\u00a0Hannover\u00a0v.\u00a0Germany, no. 59320/00, \u00a7 58, ECHR\u00a02004VI). In this respect, it is clear from the Court\u2019s case-law that the right to freedom of expression is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see, inter alia, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7\u00a049, Series\u00a0A no. 24, and Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 1999VIII). This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article\u00a010 \u00a7 2, which must, however, be construed strictly. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, for example, Lingens v.\u00a0Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 103, and Tammer v. Estonia, no.\u00a041205/98, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2001I).",

In this connection, there are different ways of ensuring \u201crespect for private life\u201d, and the nature of the State\u2019s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private life that is at issue (see\u00a0Odi\u00e8vre, cited above, \u00a7 46). Furthermore, the Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervision is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions that they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, Tammer, cited above, \u00a7 63).",
