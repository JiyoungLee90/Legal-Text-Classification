The Court's task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, \u00a7\u00a067, Reports 1996-II, and Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, \u00a7 50, Reports 1997-III). All the evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence (see L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, judgment of 15 June 1992, \u00a7\u00a049, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0238).",

Sweden, 29 October 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 31-32, Series A no. 212-A), and their importance for the appellant (see Kremzow v.

Switzerland, judgment of 18\u00a0February 1997, \u00a7 23, Reports 1997-I). The concept of a fair trial also means in principle the opportunity for the parties to a trial to have knowledge of and comment on all evidence adduced or observations filed with a view to influencing the court's decision (see Kress v. France [GC], no.\u00a039594/98, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2001VI, with further references).
