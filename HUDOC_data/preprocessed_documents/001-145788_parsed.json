The establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the requesting country, whether under general international law, the Convention, or otherwise. In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a090-91, Series A no. 161).",

Sweden, 20 March 1991, \u00a7 75, Series A no. 201).

To that end, as regards the general situation in a particular country, the Court has often attached importance to the information originating from various reliable and objective sources such as, for instance, agencies of the United Nations, reputable domestic or international human-rights protection associations, or other Contracting or non-Contracting States (see, for example, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 99-100, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V; Saadi v.

The effect of Article 13 of the Convention is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable claim\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 of the Convention varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see, among other authorities, Aksoy v.

Bulgaria, no.\u00a061507/00, \u00a7 67, 26 July 2007, and Mohammed v. Austria, no. 2283/12, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a085 and 111, 6 June 2013).

In the present case, that was sufficient to show that his allegations in this regard were arguable and should have been examined. He raised the same arguments in his appeal, but the Baku Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was silent in this regard (compare Garayev v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a053688/08, \u00a7 84, 10 June 2010, and Chankayev, cited above, \u00a7 93). It does not appear that the courts took these considerations into account when they examined the question of the applicant\u2019s extradition, even though they were required to do so not only under the Convention, which was directly applicable in the Azerbaijani legal system, but also under the substantive provisions of the domestic law on extradition detailing the situations in which extradition should be refused (see paragraphs 28 and 31-32 above).",
