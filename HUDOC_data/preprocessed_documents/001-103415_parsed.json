The personal anecdotes told in the book concentrate on the ill-treatment inflicted on the detainees or pressure exerted on them by security officials, which no doubt may create in the mind of the reader a powerful hostility towards the injustice to which the detainees were subjected in the prisons. Furthermore, in one of the articles, entitled \u201cPrisons and health\u201d, the author, who is a medical doctor, criticizes the general conditions of detention in prisons, which he considers inhuman and degrading for the detainees.
