The second applicant had left, despite the officers\u2019 threats. Another employee, T.K., had also left. At about 10 p.m. V.G. telephoned the second applicant, asking her to return to the site to find his power of attorney to act on behalf of company M. She had arrived at about 10.30 p.m. Later, the second applicant had gone to a lounge area to rest. At about 3\u00a0a.m. she had been approached by the VID officers, who had told her that V.G. had left and that the first applicant had been handcuffed. I.R. had seized her telephone and had ordered her to participate in the inspection, without informing her that she had a right not to participate. The second applicant had asked I.R. several times to allow her to stay on the office premises as she had been tired. I.R. had refused several times and had eventually told her that if she continued to make such requests I.R. would detain her for forty-eight hours and place her in isolation cell. She had therefore been compelled to participate in the inspection. Furthermore, she had been under the constant watch of the officers. At about 11 a.m. she had been questioned by V.V., who had not given her an opportunity to contact a lawyer. Although the second applicant had not been under arrest, she had not been allowed to leave the site and her brother had been prevented from seeing her.

At the same time, the crux of the applicants\u2019 complaints in the present case is the unlawful nature of the deprivation of their liberty as a result of measures taken in criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 35 and 45 above). In the case of Zikovs, the Court accepted that a claim in the domestic courts in civil proceedings was an effective remedy with regard to a measure which had been taken in connection with criminal proceedings (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 22, 35 and 38). However, unlike in the case at hand, in Zikovs the domestic courts in the criminal proceedings had acknowledged that the measure had been taken in breach of the Criminal Procedure Law (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 22, 23 and 35).
