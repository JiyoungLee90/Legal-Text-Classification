On the facts, the Court notes that the applicant mentioned the issue in the criminal proceedings against him, and also lodged a separate criminal complaint about the situation, which arguably amounted to an unlawful deprivation of liberty, a criminal offence. The applicant and his counsel repeatedly requested that the prosecutors and investigators assess the lawfulness of the situation; however, the institution of criminal proceedings was refused, for there was nothing to indicate that a criminal offence had been committed. The normal chain of appeals was concluded with the final decision of the Altay Regional Court on 19\u00a0October 2006, when the applicant must have become aware of the ineffectiveness of the criminal complaint (see Aleksandr Sokolov v.

It appears from the testimony of the police officers given to the trial court that the applicant had remained there under constant guard, that he had not been allowed to leave the station or go outside, that the door had been locked, and that one of the officers had stood guard over him (see paragraphs 11 to 14 above). Their testimony before the trial court was at variance with their later version of events, according to which they had merely acceded to the applicant\u2019s plea for overnight accommodation for humanitarian reasons (compare Guenat v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 24722/94, Commission decision of 10\u00a0April 1995, Decisions and Reports (DR) 81, p. 134). The Court lends credence to their testimony in court. Not only was it given under penalty of perjury, but it also coincided with the applicant\u2019s description and appeared eminently plausible in the circumstances of the present case. Indeed, it would be highly irregular if a person suspected of smuggling an inordinately huge shipment of heroin would be allowed to walk free almost immediately, even before he could have been interviewed or examined. As it happened, the interview and search of the applicant did not take place until the following day, when a criminal case was opened and an investigator assigned to the case (see paragraph 8 above). Accordingly, the Court finds that, from the moment he was taken to the police station on 1\u00a0August 2005, the applicant remained under the effective control of the police officers there, and could not leave at will. He was therefore deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (compare Belousov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 4494/07, \u00a7 83, 7 November 2013; Kortesis v.

The absence of a record of such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Fedotov v.

Although the record was eventually prepared, the date and time of the applicant\u2019s arrest listed therein were at variance with the actual date and time of his apprehension. The applicant\u2019s overnight detention, from 1 to 2\u00a0August 2005, at the Rubtsovsk police station, was not recorded or acknowledged in any procedural form. The lack of a proper record of the applicant\u2019s arrest is therefore sufficient for the Court to hold that his detention from 1 to 2\u00a0August 2005 was contrary to the requirements implicit in Article 5 of the Convention for the proper recording of deprivations of liberty (see Venskut\u0117 v. Lithuania, no.\u00a010645/08, \u00a7 80, 11 December 2012; Aleksandr Sokolov, cited above, \u00a7 72, and Menesheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a087-89).",
