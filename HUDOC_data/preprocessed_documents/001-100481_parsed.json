However, making a global assessment of all the available information, in particular that referred to in paragraph 15 above, the Court cannot overlook that in 2004 the national authorities acknowledged the existence of the overpopulation problem in the remand centre during 2001 and 2002 (see also Matyush, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51-59, concerning the same detention facility during the relevant periods). Various certificates and reports supplied by the Government furnish contradictory information as to whether or not the actual population of the remand centre exceeded its design capacity by national standards or the number of beds (see paragraph 15 above). Thus, as the Government have not adduced appropriate and conclusive evidence, the Court considers that the applicant was affected by the general overpopulation problem in the remand centre.",
