It could not however be claimed that the court had ignored this question. Before ruling on a case, the division concerned would systematically seek to establish whether there were any circumstances that would preclude it from doing so. If there were no obstacles, the court, as in the instant case, would continue its examination of the case without adopting any express decision on that matter. This was common practice, for a certain presumption of impartiality was necessary for the proper administration of justice. It would certainly be difficult to provide systematically for a special procedure. In case of doubt, it was incumbent upon the defendant to submit an application for the judge's withdrawal, which the applicant had not done in the instant case, for he made no protest to the High Court against the participation of R.T.
