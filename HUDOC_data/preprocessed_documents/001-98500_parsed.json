The agreement reached in the negotiations, in particular in respect of the categories of persons who were eligible and the establishment of the German Foundation as a means of providing funds to victims, was subsequently incorporated in the German Foundation Act of 2 August 2000. Section 10 of the Act stipulated that partner organisations, including the Polish Foundation, were entrusted with evaluation of claims and disbursement of payment to eligible claimants. The same provision stipulated that the German Foundation was neither authorised nor obligated in respect of the approval and disbursement of payments by the partner organisations. The particular feature of the second compensation scheme was that the eligibility conditions had been specified in the GFA, while at\u00a0the same time the examination of the relevant applications was to be carried out by the partner organisations, including the Polish Foundation. The Court considers that for all practical purposes, decisions to qualify applicants as coming under a particular eligibility category and to grant payments in respect of the claimants who resided in Poland were taken by the Polish Foundation (see Wo\u015b v. Poland (dec.), no. 22860/02, \u00a7 66, ECHR\u00a02005IV; Jakowicz v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 16778/02, \u00a7 76 in fine, 13\u00a0October\u00a02009).",

It follows that while processing the\u00a0applications the Polish Foundation was bound to follow the substantive criteria as specified in the GFA and had no power either to review its reasonableness or to unilaterally modify or extend them. Thus, the Polish Foundation and, a fortiori, the Polish State cannot bear responsibility in\u00a0cases where an applicant, due to the scope of the substantive eligibility conditions as such, was not included in the group of persons entitled to\u00a0certain benefits. The Court emphasises that the Polish Foundation exercised only a certain measure of discretion when assessing the facts of\u00a0individual cases and the evidence submitted by the claimants. Its assessment of those elements was decisive for the outcome of the proceedings before the Foundation. The Court considers that the\u00a0responsibility of the  may be engaged exclusively as regards those cases where the dispute concerns the application of the eligibility conditions to the facts of\u00a0individual cases in the area falling within the Foundation's margin of\u00a0discretion. Accordingly, in each case it is necessary to determine whether a\u00a0claimant challenges the eligibility conditions or the assessment of facts and evidence by the Polish Foundation and whether that assessment remained within the Polish Foundation's margin of discretion.",

It established that in connection with his work M.C. had been temporarily staying in Belarus or in the General Government but he had not lost contact with his habitual place of residence in .

In particular, she disagreed with the finding that her husband had not lost permanent contact with his abode. In the present case the thrust of the applicant's complaint is\u00a0directed against the Polish Foundation's erroneous assessment of the facts underlying her claims and the resultant flawed application of the eligibility conditions to the case (compare and contrast, Jakowicz v. Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 80). In the case of Jakowicz the Foundation dismissed the applicant's claims which went beyond the scope of the substantive eligibility conditions and as such were outside the Foundation's remit. By\u00a0contrast, in\u00a0the present case the Foundation refused the applicant's claims while exercising its discretion as to the assessment of the relevant facts which had direct bearing on the determination of the eligibility status of the applicant's husband. In the present case the Polish Foundation recognised that the applicant's husband had, at least, temporarily performed forced labour while having been relocated. In this respect the Court notes that section 11 of the GFA which was invoked by the Polish Foundation does not appear to\u00a0require that the deportation (relocation) of a forced labourer has to be of\u00a0a\u00a0certain minimum duration. Nor was the Court apprised of by the Government of any binding regulations issued to that effect by the German Foundation. Thus, the present case can be distinguished from the Jakowicz case on the ground that it concerned the\u00a0dispute as to the assessment of\u00a0relevant facts and not a challenge to the\u00a0substantive eligibility conditions. Accordingly, the Court finds that the\u00a0dispute arose between the applicant and the Polish Foundation as regards the\u00a0application of the eligibility conditions to her case.",

Such claims could be established exclusively through domestic law, and in such a case the legislator enjoys a\u00a0wide margin of discretion. In this respect the Court observes that the conditions and procedures with which a claimant had to comply before a\u00a0payment could be awarded by the Foundation were first agreed in the course of multilateral negotiations, then laid out in the GFA and subsequently transposed into the regulations binding on the Foundation via the Partnership Agreement of 16\u00a0February 2001 and any subsequent agreements concluded in the framework of the so-called openness clause. The Foundation's statutes were subsequently amended with a view to\u00a0implementing the provisions of the GFA and the Agreement of\u00a016\u00a0February 2001. Thus, the Foundation's regulations stipulated the conditions which had to be fulfilled by a person seeking benefits. It\u00a0is\u00a0noteworthy that the Supreme Court in its Resolution of 27 June 2007 found that the basis of the rights of a person seeking payment from the Foundation were the Foundation's statutes, the rules of the Verification Commission and the relevant provisions of the GFA. The Court is mindful of the particular character of the legal regime governing the second compensation scheme which defined the categories of eligible claimants. Nevertheless, it finds that the Foundation's regulations could be considered to create a right for a\u00a0claimant arguably fulfilling the relevant eligibility conditions to claim compensation from the Foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, Wo\u015b v. Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7\u00a083).",
