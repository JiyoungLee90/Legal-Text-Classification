However, the absence of a hearing before a second or third instance may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue, provided a hearing has been held at first instance (see Helmers v. Sweden, 29 October 1991, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 212A). Accordingly, unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with a hearing, the right to a public hearing under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 implies a right to an oral hearing at least before one instance. A hearing may not be necessary, for example when it raises no question of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see, inter alia, D\u00f6ry v.
