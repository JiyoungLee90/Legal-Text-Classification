The Court further notes that the third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants did apply personally for concession tenders that could have effectively remedied the grievances suffered by the first and second applicants. However, none of these tenders was successful. The concession tender process which, in the Court\u2019s view, appeared to be on the verge of arbitrariness, was the primary subject of the scrutiny in the V\u00e9kony case (see\u00a0V\u00e9kony v. Hungary, no. 65681/13, \u00a7 36, 13 January 2015) and, in essence, led to the violation that was found by the Court in that case. Therefore, the Court is satisfied that the third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants, who participated in the tender process but to no avail, can claim to be the victim of the violation alleged, whilst the first and second applicants cannot. In regard to the first and second applicants, the application is therefore incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 4.",
