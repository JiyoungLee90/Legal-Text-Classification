In the present case it took the authorities more than two months to initiate a full-scale investigation of the accident (see paragraph 10 above).

In particular, the domestic authorities admitted that important initial procedural measures had not been properly taken (notably, an inspection of the scene of the accident) or had not been taken at all (see\u00a0paragraph 12 above).",
