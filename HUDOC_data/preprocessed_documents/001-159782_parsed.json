It was only following the entry into force of the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other Dangerous Offences Act on 31 January 1998 (see paragraph 51 below) that the courts responsible for the execution of sentences could prolong preventive detention without any maximum duration. The applicant therefore fell within the category of detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively, as defined by the Federal Constitutional Court in its judgment of 4 May 2011 (see paragraphs 66-72 below). The Regional Court further noted that the second sentence of section 316f(2) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code had regard to, and had taken up, the standards set up by the Federal Constitutional Court in the above-mentioned judgment for the continuation of retrospectively ordered or retrospectively prolonged preventive detention.",

It endorsed the findings made on that point by W., an external psychiatric expert it had consulted, in his report dated 8 June 2013. The expert had been obliged to draw up his report on the basis of the case files as the applicant had refused to be examined. Expert W. had confirmed that the applicant suffered from sexual sadism, a sexual deviance, and was addicted to alcohol, even though he had not drunk since being detained. The Regional Court stressed that expert W.\u2019s assessment confirmed the findings made by a number of previous experts, notably those made in January and May 2011 by two experts who had diagnosed the applicant with a sexual preference disorder with sadomasochistic, fetishist and paedophiliac elements and with an alcohol addiction without current consumption of alcohol.",

Endorsing the findings of expert W., in accordance with the above-mentioned previous expert reports, the court noted that the applicant had admitted to his sadistic fantasies but had been unable to address them through therapy. In Celle Prison, he had stopped participating in any activities for persons in preventive detention. The\u00a0Regional Court stressed that, in his assessment of the applicant\u2019s dangerousness, the expert had taken into consideration his advanced age of sixty-nine years. However, he had convincingly explained that the applicant\u2019s sexual deviance had not yet been considerably alleviated thereby.

They further stressed that this diagnosis confirmed the findings previously made by a number of experts that the applicant was suffering from a sexual preference disorder with sadomasochistic, fetishist and paedophiliac elements. The\u00a0Court further observes in that context that the applicant had already been found to have, in particular, a sexual deviance at the time of the offences in respect of which his preventive detention had been ordered. His mental abnormality, combined with the consumption of alcohol, had led to the diminution of his criminal responsibility at the time of the acts (see\u00a0paragraph 9 above).

To\u00a0render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, \u00a7 27, Series\u00a0A no. 307A; Jamil v.

The wording of the second sentence of Article 7 \u00a7 1 indicates that the starting-point \u2013 and thus a very weighty factor (see Glien, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0121) \u2013 in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question was imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a029514/05, ECHR 2006XV; and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. \u00a021906/04, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2008). The severity of the measure is not, however, in itself decisive, since many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may, just as measures which must be classified as a penalty, have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 32; M. v.

Based on the subsequent amendment in 1998 of Article 67d of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 1a(3) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraph 51 above), which abolished that maximum duration with immediate effect, and section 316f(2), second sentence, of the same Act, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences then ordered, in the proceedings at issue, the applicant\u2019s continued preventive detention beyond the ten-year limit.

Germany (cited above, \u00a7 131) and Glien (cited above, \u00a7 128), the applicant\u2019s preventive detention was ordered by the (criminal) sentencing courts. Its\u00a0implementation was determined by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences, that is, courts also belonging to the criminal justice system, in a separate procedure. The procedure differs in this respect from that under sections 1 and 4 of the Therapy Detention Act, which provides that the civil sections of the Regional Court decide on the confinement of particularly dangerous offenders suffering from a mental disorder (see\u00a0paragraph 64 above). However, the Court takes account of the Government\u2019s argument in that respect (see paragraph 146 above) that the courts dealing with the execution of sentences were particularly experienced in assessing the necessity of confining mental-health patients as they also dealt with decisions concerning detentions in psychiatric hospitals under Article 63 of the Criminal Code.",

Germany (cited above, \u00a7 132) and Glien (cited above, \u00a7 129), still entailed detention which, following the change in the law in 1998, no longer had a maximum duration. The applicant\u2019s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. However, it must equally be noted that, other than for prison sentences, there was also no minimum duration of detention. The duration of detention thus depended to a considerable extent on the applicant\u2019s cooperation. However, even though he was put in a better position, by the new framework in which his preventive detention was implemented, in order to work towards the reduction of his dangerousness, his release was still subject to a court finding that it was no longer highly likely that he would again commit serious crimes of violence or sexual offences as a result of his mental disorder.",

Germany (ibid.). Preventive detention, however, still remains among the most severe measures which may be imposed under the Criminal Code. It is noted in that context that at the time of the proceedings at issue, the applicant had already been in preventive detention for more than twelve years, following his term of imprisonment of fifteen years.",
