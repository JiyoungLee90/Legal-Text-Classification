The NNI is a long-term average measure of noise exposure which is used in the  to assess the disturbance from aircraft noise to communities near airports. It takes account of two features of the noise, namely the average noisiness and the number of aircraft heard during an average summer day. The flights which determine the NNI at any point on the ground are those which take place between 06.00 and 18.00 hours Greenwich Mean Time during the three busy summer months of mid-June to mid-September and which make a peak noise level exceeding 80 perceived noise decibels (PNdB) at that point. The purpose of the NNI is to represent community reaction to the level of aircraft noise so as to guide planning, development and noise control. Thus, the NNI is amongst the criteria applied in planning controls, so that land within the 35 to 39 NNI contours may be used for residential development, planning permission not being refused on noise grounds alone. However, land within the 40 to 50 NNI contours (moderate noise-annoyance zone) will not be given over to development, except for the infilling of existing built-up areas on condition that appropriate sound insulation is used. No development whatsoever is permitted within the 60 NNI and over contours (high noise-annoyance zone). It is to be noted that the NNI calculation reflects a logarithmic element in the PNdB scale, which has the result that every increase of 10 in that scale represents approximately a doubling of the loudness.",

The positioning of these terminals is designed to protect the first built-up area reached after take-off from noise levels in excess of the statutory limits of 110 PNdB by day (07.00-23.00 hours local time) and 102 PNdB by night (23.00-07.00 hours local time). In the event of an infringement of the noise limit, the Airport informs the airline by letter and sends a copy to the Department of Transport. According to the Government, the effect of recent bans on non-noise-certificated aircraft has been to keep the rate of compliance to around 99% by day and 98% by night. The Secretary of State is empowered by section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act to deny Heathrow\u2019s facilities to operators who fail to comply with noise abatement measures, but to date it has not been found necessary to invoke this provision. On the other hand, night flight quotas have been reduced for infringing operators.",

The scheme concentrated on those localities that would still be experiencing comparatively high noise levels in the mid 1980\u2019s and on localities where there is the greatest degree of disturbance due to aircraft noise at night. Within this area the amount of grant provided was intended to cover 100% of the reasonable costs incurred. The boundary was based on the forecast 50 NNI contour for 1985 and the composite of the 95 PNdB noise footprint for quieter aircraft. 95 PNdB is the exterior noise level below which current evidence suggests that the average person in an uninsulated room is unlikely to be awakened.

In its report the Commission further reasoned that no separate issue of an effective remedy could arise under Article 13 (art. 13) since its requirements were less strict than and absorbed by those of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1); and that, in so far as the applicants were contesting the compatibility of section 76(1) with the Convention, Article 13 (art. 13) did not guarantee a remedy allowing a Contracting State\u2019s legislation to be challenged as such. It therefore concluded that there had been no violation of Article 13 (art. 13) under this head.",

The entitlement to bring an action against individual airline operators for flying in breach of the regulations or at an unreasonable height, which was left intact by section 76(1), was, in the applicants\u2019 submission, theoretical and illusory. They contended that the statutory bar created by section 76(1) infringed the principles enunciated by the Court in the Ashingdane case (see the judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, pp. 24-25, \u00a7 57), in that it did not pursue a legitimate aim, it placed a disproportionate burden on the applicants and, as a result, it destroyed the very essence of their above-mentioned common-law right.",

Framed in this way their grievance does not bring into play Article 6 (art. 6) or Article 13 (art. 13). As the Commission pointed out in its admissibility decisions, the effect of section 76(1) is to exclude liability in nuisance with regard to the flight of aircraft in certain circumstances, with the result that the applicants cannot claim to have a substantive right under English law to obtain relief for exposure to aircraft noise in those circumstances. To this extent there is no \"civil right\" recognised under domestic law to attract the application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) (see the Lithgow and Others judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, p. 70, \u00a7 192).

It noted in its report that his home and farm were very close to and in the direct line of one of Heathrow Airport\u2019s busy runways, that further development was prohibited in this area, which was classified as a high noise-annoyance zone, and that he had acquired his home before the major expansion of Heathrow Airport (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above).
