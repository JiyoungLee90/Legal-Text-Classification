According to the report drawn up by an orthopaedist in that hospital on 20 August 1991, the applicant suffered a thoracic vertebral fracture as a result of the accident, was unfit for work for 45 days and was required to undergo 180 days of treatment.

Between 3 March 2000 and 21 March 2001, the  collected further evidence in the case.

It noted that one of the persons ordered to pay compensation was not an apartment owner in the business centre at the time of the accident and that the first-instance court should have duly established the names of the owners before rendering its judgment. The Court of Cassation further noted that the applicant’s petition of 17 October 2001 should have been served on all the defendants.
On 10 December 2003 the Court of Cassation dismissed the parties’ requests for rectification of its decision of 12 May 2003.
On 22 March 2005 the Ankara Civil Court rendered a new judgment in the light of the Court of Cassation’s decision of 12 May 2003, ordering Elmas Elektrik Sanayi Ticaret A.Ş. and seven persons who were apartment owners at the time of the accident to pay the applicant compensation in the amount of 3,145,941,990 Turkish liras (TRL), with interest running from 1 November 1990.
