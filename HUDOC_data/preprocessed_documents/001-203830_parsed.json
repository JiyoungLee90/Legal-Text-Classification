France [GC], no. 39594/98, \u00a7\u00a072, ECHR 2001VI). It is easily understandable that doubts should arise, especially in the mind of an accused, as to the neutrality of an expert when it was his or her report that in fact prompted the bringing of a prosecution (see B\u00f6nisch v. Austria, 6 May 1985, \u00a7\u00a032, Series A no. 92). Such apprehensions may have a certain importance, but are not decisive. What is decisive is whether the doubts raised by appearances can be held to be objectively justified (see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28\u00a0August 1991, \u00a7 44, Series A no.\u00a0211).",

As regards the applicant\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damage, the Court does not consider it necessary to make an award under this head in the circumstances of this case (compare Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a050541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and 40351/09, \u00a7\u00a0315, 16 December 2014). It further refers to its settled case-law to the effect that when an applicant has suffered an infringement of his rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, he should, as far as possible, be put in the position in which he would have been had the requirements of that provision not been disregarded, and that the most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be the reopening of the proceedings, if requested (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7 210 in fine, ECHR\u00a02005IV, and Popov v. Russia, no.\u00a026853/04, \u00a7 263, 13 July 2006). The Court notes, in this connection, that Article 413 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure provides the basis for the reopening of the domestic proceedings if the Court finds a violation of the Convention. It therefore considers that its finding of a violation constitutes a sufficient just satisfaction and makes no award under this head.",
