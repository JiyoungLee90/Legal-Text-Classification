The case originated in an application (no. 4345/06) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Eduard Andreyevich Burmaga (“the applicant”), on 16 December 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr I. P. Shcherbakov, a lawyer practising in Krasnoyarsk. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 2 December 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Krasnoyarsk.
On 16 March 2001 a senior investigator of the Krasnoyarsk regional prosecutor’s office charged the applicant with large-scale trafficking in firearms and ammunition and issued a warrant for his arrest.
On 3 June 2002 and in view of the additional charges brought against the applicant another arrest warrant was issued. This decision did not set a time-limit for the applicant’s detention and it has never been served on him.
On 27 September 2003 the applicant was arrested in Monaco and on 29 April 2005 he was extradited to Russia. He was placed in remand prison IZ-77/4 in Moscow with a view to a subsequent transfer to Krasnoyarsk.
Before his final admission to Krasnoyarsk prison, the applicant was held in several different remand prisons and repeatedly complained about his unlawful detention.
On 11 May 2005 criminal proceedings against the applicant were resumed. On the same day the investigator from the Krasnoyarsk Prosecutor’s office initiated a request for extension of the applicant’s detention.
On 31 May 2005 the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention from 10 May 2005 until 17 August 2005 inclusive. The matter was heard in the presence of the investigator, the prosecutor ‒ who supported the application for extension ‒ and counsel Mr V., who left the issue of the applicant’s detention for determination by the court.
On 8 June 2005 he arrived at Krasnoyarsk prison IZ-24/1.
On 24 June 2005 the applicant filed a statement of appeal. He submitted in particular that his detention had been contrary to the requirements of the Russian Constitution and the new Code of Criminal Procedure, that the arrest warrants of 16 March 2001 and 3 June 2002 had never been served on him or his counsel, and that the detention hearing had been held in his absence.
On 17 August 2005 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld this detention order on appeal, in the presence of only the prosecutor.
On 21 May 2007, after two rounds of proceedings, the Regional Court found the applicant guilty of attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm and leadership of a criminal enterprise and sentenced him to eleven years’ imprisonment.
On 19 February 2008 the Supreme Court upheld the conviction.
On 20 December 2006 he complained to the Zheleznodorozhny District Court of Krasnoyarsk, which had territorial jurisdiction over the place of his detention, about unjustified delays in the criminal proceedings and a violation of the right to respect for his family life. He alleged that following his conviction on 9 February 2006, he had not been allowed to have any visits from his relatives.
On 28 December 2006 the District Court declared his complaint inadmissible, finding that the matters complained of were outside the court’s jurisdiction. On 27 February 2007 the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court upheld the inadmissibility decision at final instance.
On 13 March 2007 the applicant had a meeting with his mother.
Until 1 July 2002 criminal-law matters were governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Soviet Federalist Socialist Republic (Law of 27 October 1960, “the old CCrP”). From 1 July 2002 the old CCrP was replaced by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (Law no. 174-FZ of 18 December 2001, “the new CCrP”).
Under the old CCrP, a decision ordering pre-trial detention could be taken by a prosecutor or a court (Articles 11, 89 and 96). After arrest a suspect could be placed in custody “pending investigation” for an initial two-month period (Article 97 of the old CCrP). Further extensions could be granted by prosecutors at ascending levels of jurisdiction.
Under the new CCrP, before a defendant can be detained or his or her detention extended (Article 108 §§ 1, 3-6) there must be a judicial decision by a district court on a reasoned request for detention by a prosecutor, supported by appropriate evidence.
In accordance with Federal Law no. 177-FZ of 18 December 2001 governing the entry into force of the new CCrP, detention orders issued before 1 July 2002 remain in force in accordance with the time-limits set out in those orders (Article 10 § 3).
An application for an extension of a defendant’s detention may be lodged either with the court within the territorial jurisdiction of which the preliminary investigation is carried out or with the court where the defendant is detained (Article 109 § 8 of the new CCrP).
An application for an extension of a defendant’s detention may not be examined by a court in the defendant’s absence, except in cases where the defendant has been admitted for an inpatient forensic psychiatric examination or where other circumstances precluding his presence have been shown to exist by appropriate documents. In such cases, the participation of the defendant’s counsel is mandatory (Article 109 § 13 of the new CCrP). If the defendant cannot be present, the court must give a separate decision setting out the reasons which rendered his presence impossible (Article 109 § 14 of the new CCrP).
