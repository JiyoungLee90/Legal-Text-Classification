On 4 September 2015, 15 prisoners complained of diarrhoea at CCF, followed by another 20 inmates the following day. Various stool samples from inmates were also sent by CCF to the hospital laboratory on the evening of 4\u00a0September. Health Inspectors attended the prison on the morning of 5\u00a0September and took samples of water and food from the kitchen. Initially, prison management stated that all inmates affected had been in single cell accommodation and remained there; however, the delegation found nine of the affected prisoners were sharing cells with at least one other person and one inmate was in a large dormitory. The prison management explained that this was their first experience of a new phenomenon and the delegation observed that they were unsure how to contain and deal with the outbreak. On 9 September, some five days after the outbreak had commenced, it was confirmed that the cause of the outbreak was salmonella, which was presumed to have come from tuna in the kitchen. In total, 41 prisoners had been affected by this outbreak.",

However, in the present cases the applicants did not submit detailed information as to specific periods when the temperature inside had dropped to very cold or close to freezing temperatures, and for how long such conditions persisted during the winters over the years during which they had been detained.

While this shows that the Government is taking action to counter the problem, it undermines the assertion that problems of infestation on the premises do not exist. On the contrary, such frequent treatment rather points to a persistent problem which could give rise to an unsanitary and unsafe environment (compare Testa v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 20877/04, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 62, 12 July 2007). This is even more likely given the high temperatures which are common in Malta over the summer and the fact that detainees have no access to automatically flushing toilets, resulting in unpleasant odours over periods of time which could attract pests. The Court therefore registers its concern about the matter, particularly given that the applicants claim that it is a common occurrence (see paragraph 87 above). However, the Court also notes that in the domestic proceedings instituted by the second applicant, it was found that  according to the pest control treatment report released by the private company involved (dated 4 July 2014) \u2013 the situation had been certified as being under control (see paragraph 41 above). The Court cannot deny that the situation is an unsatisfactory one, but reiterates that, in reaching its conclusion about the conditions of detention, consideration must be given to the cumulative effects of the various aspects thereof.",

Nevertheless, it cannot go unremarked that a number of instances of gastrointestinal problems have been reported in the local press, nor can it be ignored that similar problems were encountered during the visit by the CPT (see paragraph 63 above). In this respect, the Court notes, however, that the applicants have failed to demonstrate the inadequacy of the food provided or to specify how, if at all, the provision of such food has affected their health (compare Z.N.S. v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 21896/08, \u00a7 82, 19 January 2010). Thus, while failure to provide food in accordance with the general nutritional tables and menus in prison may put at risk the health of detainees (compare Rotaru v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 51216/06, \u00a7\u00a037, 15 February 2011), it has not been established that this was the situation in the present cases (see also Kurkowski v.

Moreover, the Court notes that the applicants\u2019 basic needs have been seen to by the distribution of materials free of charge (including limited cleaning materials), and the applicants were not left unclothed \u2013 even if partly with private help (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, Mahamed Jama v. Malta, no.\u00a010290/13, \u00a7\u00a098, 26\u00a0November 2015). In this connection the Court also notes that the absence of a laundry is not in itself conclusive, but it is imperative that cleaning materials suitable for ensuring the required hygienic standards are available at all times (see, mutatis mutandis, Story and Others, cited above, \u00a7 121). The Court reiterates that it is incumbent on the respondent Government to organise its prison system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of financial or logistical difficulties (ibid).",

The Court is struck by the fact that the common areas (save for the learning zones) are smoking areas and refers to the findings of the domestic courts in this respect (see paragraph 42 above), particularly given the general ban in Malta on smoking in public spaces. Nevertheless, as far as his cell is concerned, the second applicant was detained in a single-occupancy cell and, while it is not impossible that the odour in the adjoining cells might have reached his own, it has not been shown to the Court\u2019s satisfaction that any fumes reached the second applicant\u2019s cell. It follows that while an unregulated smoking environment remains regrettable, the second applicant could for most of his day seek refuge from such fumes either in his own cell or in the yard to which he had access nearly all day long \u2013 this situation distinguishes the second applicant\u2019s case from other cases brought before the Court in which detainees were sharing multi-occupancy rooms with smokers for most of the day (as in, for example, Ostrovar, cited above). Moreover, it has not been claimed that the second applicant suffered any specific health condition or deterioration as a result of the situation.",

Such a favourable situation has a particular bearing when assessing the applicants\u2019 conditions of detention. To that must be added the fact that, even when in their cells, the applicants were not exposed to extreme conditions, since they each had a cell measuring around 9 sq.m, with an individual sleeping place and the relevant accessories.",

It also appears that the applicants were regularly seen by doctors in connection with common ailments and were prescribed the relevant medical treatment, as would have been the case had they been treated in the State Hospital like any other citizen at liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Prestieri v. Italy, (dec.), no.\u00a066640/10, 29 January 2013). In this connection, the Court notes that the medicine taken by the third applicant would, likewise, not have been provided free of charge to Maltese citizens. However, it appears that the applicant ultimately had the possibility of having the cost of his medicines covered by an NGO (see paragraph 60 above). The Court reiterates that medical treatment within prison facilities must be appropriate and comparable to the quality of treatment which the State authorities have committed themselves to providing for the entire population. However, this does not mean that each detainee must be guaranteed the same medical treatment as is available in the best health establishments outside prison facilities (see Cara-Damiani v.

Is this the standard the Court has established? Do detainees need to wait until they actually suffer from serious health conditions?
