By virtue of that legislation a large group of people (male military personnel) continue to be denied an entitlement to parental leave. The Court considers that the subject matter of the present application \u2013 the alleged discrimination under Russian law against male military personnel as regards entitlement to parental leave \u2013 involves an important question of general interest which has not yet been examined by the Court.

Accordingly, although Article 8 does not include a right to parental leave or impose any positive obligation on States to provide parental leave allowances, if a State does decide to create a parental leave scheme, it must do so in a manner which is compatible with Article 14 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Petrovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 26 to 29).",

It observes that in contrast to maternity leave and associated allowances, which are primarily intended to enable the mother to recover from the fatigue of childbirth and to breastfeed her baby if she so wishes, parental leave and the parental leave allowances relate to the subsequent period and are intended to enable the parent to stay at home to look after the infant personally.

The Court held that at the material time there was no European consensus in this field, as the majority of Contracting States did not provide for parental leave or related allowances for fathers (see Petrovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38 to 42). However, in the more recent case of Weller v. Hungary the Court took a step away from the approach adopted in the Petrovic case and found that the exclusion of natural fathers from the entitlement to receive parental allowances, when mothers, adoptive parents and guardians were entitled to them, amounted to discrimination on the ground of parental status (see Weller, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30 to 35). It is also significant that since the adoption of the judgment in the Petrovic case the legal situation as regards parental leave entitlements in the Contracting States has evolved. In an absolute majority of European countries the legislation now provides that parental leave may be taken by both mothers and fathers (see paragraphs 26 to 30 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion, this shows that society has moved towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibility for the upbringing of their children and that men\u2019s caring role has gained recognition. The Court considers that it cannot overlook the widespread and consistently developing views and associated legal changes to the domestic laws of Contracting States on this issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Smith and Grady v. the , nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 104, ECHR\u00a01999VI). It follows that the respondent State can no longer rely on the absence of a common standard among the Contracting States to justify the difference in treatment between men and women as regards parental leave. Nor can the reference to the traditional perception of women as primary child-carers provide sufficient justification for the exclusion of the father from the entitlement to take parental leave if he so wishes. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no convincing or weighty reasons have been offered by the Government to justify the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to parental leave.",

Thus, although in the case of Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, which concerned the dismissal of homosexuals from the armed forces, the Court allowed a certain margin of appreciation to the States as far as the organisation of their own system of military discipline was concerned, it nevertheless found that the applicants\u2019 dismissal from the armed forces on the ground of their sexual orientation violated their rights under Article 8 of the Convention. It did not accept the Government\u2019s argument that the presence of homosexuals in the army undermined its operational effectiveness, because that argument was not supported by any concrete evidence and the Court was not satisfied that operational-effectiveness problems of the nature and level alleged could be caused by the admission of homosexuals into the armed forces (see Smith and Grady, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89 to 112).",

The Court finds that argument unconvincing. It notes the lack of concrete evidence to substantiate the alleged damage to national security. There is no indication that any expert study or statistical research was made to assess the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take three years\u2019 parental leave at any given time and would be willing to do so. There is accordingly no evidentiary basis for the assertion that the number of servicemen simultaneously taking parental leave would be so significant as to undermine the fighting capacity of the army. It follows that the Constitutional Court based its decision on a pure assumption, without attempting to probe its validity by checking it against statistical data or by weighing the conflicting interests of maintaining the operational effectiveness of the army, on the one hand, and of protecting servicemen against discrimination in the sphere of family life and promoting the best interests of their children, on the other. Accordingly, it has not been demonstrated to the Court\u2019s satisfaction that operational-effectiveness problems of the nature and level alleged would be caused by extending the parental leave entitlement to servicemen.",

To the extent that the difference was founded on the traditional gender roles, that is on the perception of women as primary child-carers and men as primary breadwinners, these gender prejudices cannot, by themselves, be considered by the Court to amount to sufficient justification for the difference in treatment, any more than similar prejudices based on race, origin, colour or sexual orientation. Nor can the fact that in the armed forces women are less numerous than men justify the disadvantaged treatment of the latter as regards entitlement to parental leave. The Court is particularly struck by the Constitutional Court\u2019s intimation that a serviceman wishing to take personal care of his children was free to resign from the armed forces. Servicemen are thereby forced to make a difficult choice between caring for their new-born children and pursuing their military career, no such choice being faced by servicewomen. The Court reiterates in this respect the unique nature of the armed forces and, consequently, the difficulty in directly transferring essentially military qualifications and experience to civilian life. It is therefore clear that, if they choose to resign from military service to be able to take care of their new-born children, servicemen would encounter difficulties in obtaining civilian posts in their areas of specialisation which would reflect the seniority and status that they had achieved in the armed forces (see, mutatis mutandis, Smith and Grady, cited above, \u00a7 92). In view of the above consideration, the Court finds that the reasons adduced by the  provide insufficient justification for imposing much stronger restrictions on the family life of servicemen than on that of servicewomen. Accordingly, convincing and weighty reasons have not been offered by the Government to justify the difference in treatment between male and female military personnel as regards entitlement to parental leave.",

Accepting the applicant\u2019s arguments that the matter was not effectively resolved at the domestic level within the meaning of Article 37 \u00a7\u00a01 (b) of the Convention, the Court, in its conclusions on the admissibility of the case, gives the impression that the \u201cissues on public-policy grounds in the common interest\u201d are more important than the specific and delicate nature of the case (see paragraphs\u00a039-40).

The question is: does \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d of servicewomen in the army as regards entitlement to parental leave amount to discrimination of male military personnel?

Given the special (armed forces) context of the case and the wide margin of appreciation left to States in matters of national security, I am prepared to accept the Constitutional Court\u2019s argument as providing objective and reasonable justification for the difference in treatment between military personnel and civilians as regards entitlement to parental leave.",

The  held that women were few in number in the armed forces and that for that reason the taking of parental leave by them would have no impact on the fighting capacity of the army. It was therefore a policy choice, motivated by women\u2019s special social role as mothers, to grant them entitlement to parental leave on an exceptional basis. The authorities\u2019 direct knowledge of their society and its needs means that they are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest. This is a common meaning of the principle of subsidiarity. In such a case the Court would generally respect the legislature\u2019s policy choice unless it is \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2007 XIII).
