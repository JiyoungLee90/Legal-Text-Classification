For its part, the Court reiterates that an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must strike a fair balance between the general interests of the community and the individual\u2019s rights. This means that a measure must be both appropriate for achieving its aim and not disproportionate to that aim. The requisite balance will be upset if the person concerned has had to bear \u201can individual and excessive burden\u201d (see, among other authorities, James and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February 1986, \u00a7\u00a050, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a098). Authorities should be able to correct their mistakes, but not in a situation where the individual concerned is required to bear an excessive burden (see Vuku\u0161i\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a069735/11, \u00a7\u00a064, 31\u00a0May 2016, with case-law cited therein). The search for a balance is reflected in the structure of Article\u00a01 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 as a whole, regardless of which paragraphs are concerned in each case; there must always be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. Ascertaining whether such a balance existed requires an overall examination of the various interests in issue (see Perdig\u00e3o v. Portugal [GC], no.\u00a024768/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a067-68, 16\u00a0November 2010), which may call for an analysis of such elements as the terms of compensation and the conduct of the parties to the dispute, including the means employed by the State and their implementation, such as the requirement for the authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate manner and with utmost consistency (see, mutatis mutandis, Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0114 and 120, ECHR 2000-I).",

Neither M. nor the applicant were parties to the court proceedings in question. It was not proven that K., M. and the applicant were connected in any way. At that time there was no free access to a database of judicial acts, and such a database did not even exist. When the State Property Agency challenged the amicable agreement, it did not take the necessary action to impose interim measures to prevent the ensuing sale of the property to third parties by indicating those measures in the property register, so that the applicant could have known about the court proceedings. As a result of such omissions on the part of the State, the applicant did not have the possibility of making a full-scale inquiry and she objectively had to rely on the ownership certificate presented by M. Moreover, the validity of the transaction was not verified by the public notary, and I cannot blame the applicant for such an \u201comission\u201d because at that time the State had annulled the requirement to notarise immovable property transactions. However, the Supreme Court did not take all those factors into consideration and it concluded that since the court proceedings were extant, it was the applicant\u2019s duty to take cognisance of them and to refrain from purchasing the property.",

It appears that, according to the national courts, the State authorities did not know for more than 8 years about the ensuing transactions (sale of property from K. to M. and then from M. to the applicant), although those transactions were registered in the immovable property register. The national court refused to apply the three-year prescription rule and to find that the State had lost the right to claim the property from the applicant. At the same time, the applicant was obliged by the national court to exercise due diligence in order to obtain the information about pending proceedings against K., even though she was not in contact with him. I am not sure that the whole proceedings against the applicant were fair, or that the authorities sought to strike a fair balance between individual and general interests. The issue of the bona fide purchaser, as the key decisive factor in deciding the case against the applicant was adjudicated by a single judge at the level of the highest national court without any public hearings or adversarial proceedings which could have allowed the applicant to prove that she had acted in good faith and had exercised her duty of care. She was thus deprived of procedural safeguards. Otherwise, her case should have been referred back by the Supreme Court for a new examination.",
