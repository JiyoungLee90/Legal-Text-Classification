There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence. It may prove necessary in certain circumstances to refer to statements made during the investigative stage. If the defendant has been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the statements, either when made or at a later stage, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d). The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on statements that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6. With respect to statements of witnesses who proved to be unavailable for questioning in the presence of the defendant or his counsel, the Court observes that paragraph\u00a01 of Article\u00a06 taken together with paragraph\u00a03 requires the Contracting States to take positive steps so as to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him. However, provided that the authorities cannot be accused of a lack of diligence in their efforts to afford the defendant an opportunity to examine the witnesses in question, the witnesses' unavailability as such does not make it necessary to discontinue the prosecution. Evidence obtained from a witness under conditions in which the rights of the defence cannot be secured to the extent normally required by the Convention should, however, be treated with extreme care. The defendant's conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on statements which the defence has not been able to challenge (see Zhoglo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-40 with further references).",

As to the Government's contentions that the applicant and his lawyer did not object to the continuation of the proceedings without the witnesses in question being examined, it does not appear to the Court that such actions could be interpreted as implicit consent to the use of those witnesses' statements as an important element in the applicant's conviction. Furthermore, it should be noted that the applicant and his lawyer raised the issue of the impossibility of questioning witnesses in their appeal to the Supreme Court. Despite the above shortcomings, the testimonies of the witnesses Mrs V., Mr P. and Mrs N.
