While the Law does provide adequate protection for an individual\u2019s right to profess or not to profess the religion of his choice, it contains some other provisions which seem to be inconsistent with international standards and with Russia\u2019s international treaty obligations. In particular, the Law establishes two categories of religious associations: the more privileged \u2018religious organisations\u2019 and the less privileged \u2018religious groups\u2019. Religious groups, unlike religious organisations, do not have the status of a legal person, and do not enjoy the rights associated with this status, such as owning property, concluding contracts, and hiring employees. In addition, they are explicitly barred from operating schools or inviting foreign guests to . Religious organisations have these rights, but to be recognised as such must be either classified as a \u2018traditional\u2019 religion or must have existed as a registered religious group on Russian territory for at least fifteen years, the latter to be certified by the local authorities. In fact, with the entry into force of this Law, a third category of religious associations was created: religious groups registered with the authorities on that day (for less than fifteen years) who already enjoy the status of a legal person may keep this status and the associated rights, provided they re-register every year with the authorities. These provisions may lead to discriminatory treatment especially of non-traditional religions, thus undermining the principle of religious equality before the law. A revision of some of these provisions may be called for to ensure compliance with Council of Europe standards. ...\u201d",

Unless affiliated with a centralised religious organisation, a religious group under this Law cannot acquire full religious entity status unless it has been in the country for fifteen years. What is strikingly unusual about this requirement is that to the best of our knowledge, at the time of its adoption, there were no other OSCE participating States that imposed a waiting requirement (other than document processing periods) with respect to base-level entities ... Russia has taken some steps to mitigate the discriminatory impact on smaller groups by minimising the evidentiary burden required to demonstrate presence in the country for the required period, and by creating a limited entity status for religious groups waiting out their fifteen-year period. But problems remain for smaller groups or for congregations that have split off from the Moscow Patriarchate, and while limited entity status is better than nothing, it imposes significant constraints on a religious group\u2019s ability to expand.",

The wording of this commitment in Principle 16.3 of the Vienna Concluding Document recognises that the precise form of legal personality varies from legal system to legal system, but access to some form of legal entity is vital to OSCE compliance. This is clearly violated by the refusal to register religious groups that do not satisfy the fifteen-year rule. The drafters of the Russian legislation apparently attempted to remedy this defect by creating limited entity status, but this also fails to satisfy the OSCE commitment, because the limited status does not confer rights to carry out important religious functions. Failure to grant such status constitutes a limitation on manifestation of religion that violates Article 9 of the [European Convention on Human Rights]. It can hardly be said that denial of entity status, simply due to an organisation\u2019s failure to \u2018exist\u2019 under a preceding, anti-religious, communist government, \u2018is necessary in a democratic society\u2019 or a proportionate response to a legitimate State interest ...\u201d",

It has been the Court\u2019s settled case-law that the ability to establish a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. A refusal by the domestic authorities to grant legal-entity status to an association, religious or otherwise, of individuals amounts to an interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of association (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a044158/98, \u00a7 52 et passim, ECHR 2004-I, and Sidiropoulos and Others, cited above, \u00a7 31 et passim). The Court has previously accepted that the authorities\u2019 refusal to register a group directly affects both the group itself and also its presidents, founders or individual members (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 59491/00, \u00a7\u00a053, 19 January 2006; Partidul Comunistilor (Nepeceristi) and Ungureanu v.

Where the organisation of a religious community was in issue, a refusal to recognise it as a legal entity has also been found to constitute interference with the right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the Convention, as exercised by both the community itself and its individual members (see Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80, and Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, \u00a7 105, both cited above).",

The Court, however, has consistently maintained the view that these rights are essential for exercising the right to manifest one\u2019s religion (see Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7 66 in fine; Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, cited above, \u00a7 118; Koretskyy and Others v.

The exclusive rights of religious organisations included, in particular, such fundamental aspects of religious functions as the right to establish places of worship, the right to hold religious services in places accessible to the public, the right to produce, obtain and distribute religious literature, the right to create educational institutions, and the right to maintain contacts for international exchanges and conferences. As noted above, religious groups or non-religious legal entities may not exercise any of these rights. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the declared rights of religious groups to perform services of worship, to teach religion and to guide their followers (see paragraph 52 above) are merely nominal, for their exercise in practice would be severely curtailed or even made impossible without the specific rights which the Religions Act reserved to registered religious organisations. Indeed, it is hardly conceivable that a religious group would be able to teach religion and guide its followers if the law denied it the possibility to acquire or distribute religious literature. Likewise, the right to perform services of worship would be devoid of substance so long as a non-registered religious group could not establish or maintain places of worship. Accordingly, the Court finds that the restricted status afforded to \u201creligious groups\u201d under the Religions Act did not allow members of such a group to enjoy effectively their right to freedom of religion, rendering such a right illusory and theoretical rather than practical and effective, as required by the Convention (see Hasan and Chaush, cited above, \u00a7 62, and Artico v.

Furthermore, in domestic litigation, where a decision refusing legal-entity status to a religious community was contested, the Russian courts have also accepted that without legal personality, a religious group cannot enjoy the \u201ccollective rights that citizens exercise in community with others\u201d (see the judgment of the Chelyabinsk Regional Court cited in paragraph 62 above).",

Finally, the restricted status of a religious group for which they qualified and in which the third applicant existed conveyed no practical or effective benefits to them as such a group was deprived of legal personality, property rights and the legal capacity to protect the interests of its members and was also severely hampered in the fundamental aspects of its religious functions.",

The Court found that such a prolonged period raised concerns under Article 9 and considered that, given the importance of the right to freedom of religion, there was an obligation on the State authorities to keep the time during which an applicant waited for conferment of legal personality reasonably short. Since the respondent Government had not relied on any \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d reasons justifying the failure to grant legal personality in a prompt fashion, the Court found a violation of Article 9 (see Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 78-80).",

In so far as the Government referred to the Sidiropoulos and Others case (cited above), the Court reiterates that in that case it found a violation of Article 11 of the Convention even though the applicant association had been suspected of harbouring unlawful aims and had been denied registration as a preventive measure. The Court pointed out that \u201chaving never existed, the association did not have time to take any action\u201d and that, in any event, the authorities would not have been powerless since a \u201ccourt could order that the association be dissolved if ... its functioning proved to be contrary to law, morality or public order\u201d (see Sidiropoulos and Others, cited above, \u00a7 46).",

The Court also observes in this connection that the contested provision of the Religions Act only targeted base-level religious communities that could not show either their presence in a given Russian region or their affiliation with a centralised religious organisation. It appears therefore that only those newly emerging religious groups that did not form part of a strictly hierarchical church structure were affected by the \u201cfifteen-year rule\u201d.

Russia, no.\u00a018147/02, \u00a7 106, 5 April 2007). In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention. By finding a violation of Article 9 read in the light of Article 11 in the present case, the Court has established that the State is under an obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicants\u2019 particular situation. Whether such measures would involve granting registration to the communities concerned, removing the reference to the \u201cfifteen-year rule\u201d from the Religions Act, reopening of the domestic proceedings or a combination of these and other measures is a decision that falls to the respondent State. The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in its judgment (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2004-II, with further references).",
