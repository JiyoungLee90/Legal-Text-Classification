The prosecutor had determined that a person having a personal interest in the outcome of the expert report concerning A.\u010c.\u2019s death was not appropriate to act as an expert in relation to the preparation of that report, because it was hard to believe that he would remain objective when evaluating the cause of A.\u010c.\u2019s death.

Firstly, he contended that the administration of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison had not guaranteed his son\u2019s safety and that as a result A.\u010c. had been murdered. Secondly, the applicant mentioned that at the time of the administrative proceedings the criminal investigation had been stopped because the person (or persons) who had committed the crime had not been identified. According to the applicant, \u201cthe [authorities] were no longer searching for the perpetrators of the crime\u201d. These two statements are explicitly recorded in each of the administrative court decisions, summing up the applicant\u2019s pleas. In the light of the above, the Court is not able to agree with the Government\u2019s objection (paragraph\u00a059 above) that the applicant failed to raise the procedural aspect of Article\u00a02 of the Convention in respect of civil remedies available.",

The applicant appealed against these decisions, even taking the matter up to the level of the Attorney General. On this last point the Court also notes that in his written complaint of 19\u00a0November\u00a02002 to the Attorney General the applicant asked the latter to take over the investigation, arguing that the regional prosecutor\u2019s office had merely been making a pretence of work. Moreover, as the Government have themselves pointed out, the prosecutors had not even assembled a case against the perpetrators of the crime by 2005 (see paragraph\u00a040 above). Consequently, on the facts of the case the Court cannot see how an additional criminal complaint about the same issues lodged by the applicant before a court in 2002 or 2003 might have reasonably led to a different outcome. The Court also takes notice of the fact that when the prosecutor decided to stop the criminal inquiry on 16\u00a0December\u00a02002, the investigation had already been pending for more than two years. Consequently and in the circumstances of this particular case, it is the Court\u2019s view that it would be too big a burden upon the applicant to require him to perpetually ask that the pre-trial investigation be reopened.",

Bearing in mind the difficulties in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, the Court is also careful, when considering positive obligations, not to interpret Article\u00a02 in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on authorities (see Osman v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October\u00a01998, \u00a7\u00a0116, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII).

The Court draws this conclusion from the fact that the guard on duty that night questioned A.\u010c. and noted that he had injuries on his face (paragraph\u00a06 above). Moreover, the Court pays particular attention to the guards\u2019 reports of the night of the incident about two masks and a metal bar being found at the scene of the crime (paragraphs\u00a07 and\u00a08 above). The Court considers that, irrespective of the seriousness of the injuries A.\u010c. received during the first incident, that finding alone showed sufficient menace to alert the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison authorities as to the clear and present danger A.\u010c. was in. In this context, the fact that A.\u010c. refused to disclose the identities of his attackers is of no particular importance for the Court. As is noted in the prosecutor\u2019s letter of 8\u00a0November\u00a02000, prisoners in the facility adhered to a code of silence. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that A.\u010c. did not dare to identify the inmates who had beaten him. The Court finds that A.\u010c.\u2019s feelings of insecurity could reasonably be based on the fact that, as the Government have themselves admitted, Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison is an open institution where the inmates may move about freely and thus could have had even easier access to A.\u010c. than if he had been confined to a prison cell. In this connection, the Court also notes that A.\u010c. was found sleeping in different blocks of the prison and thus cannot rule out that he had moved from one block to another to be safe. Whilst noting the Government\u2019s argument that the guards had put A.\u010c. in isolation, the Court also observes that this was done for one night only. Afterwards, the authorities must have concluded that A.\u010c. was safe, as they let him out. Moreover, the Court is not ready to give undue preference to the explanation of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison\u2019s governor to the effect that A.\u010c. refused to stay in isolation longer. The Court does not find the explanation given persuasive, as the document was written after A.\u010c.\u2019s death, when the murder investigation had already been opened. Lastly, for the Court, the general situation in Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison is even more strongly illustrated by the fact that another inmate was killed there a year later and the guards failed to report the incident (see paragraph\u00a041 above).",

The Government contended that the fact that A.\u010c. was injured a second time came to light after his death. The Court cannot subscribe to this thesis. It notes that on 6\u00a0August 2000 at about 8:30\u00a0a.m. A.\u010c. went to see T.L., the nurse at Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison, asking her to bandage wounds on his left leg. The Court cannot fail to observe that the nurse was simply satisfied with the explanation about football, the veracity of which was deemed doubtful by the prosecutor (see paragraph\u00a028 above). Moreover, on the question of the probative value of this piece of evidence, the Court draws attention to the fact that the injuries were not recorded in the applicant\u2019s medical file and, even more importantly, that the nurse only disclosed the matter on 5\u00a0October\u00a02000, when the institution where she worked was under investigation. For this reason, the Court has certain reservations as to the accuracy of the nurse\u2019s testimony that A.\u010c.\u2019s injuries were only minor in nature. On this last point it also takes notice of the forensic report, pursuant to which A.\u010c. had sustained numerous blows all over his body between one and three days before his death (see paragraph\u00a018 above).",

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (Anguelova v.\u00a0, no.\u00a038361/97, \u00a7\u00a0137, ECHR 2002-IV).",

However, even in such situations, those concerned are entitled to an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to its effectiveness (see Mikayil Mammadov v.\u00a0, no.\u00a04762/05, \u00a7\u00a0102, 17\u00a0December\u00a02009, and the jurisprudence cited therein). In this regard, the Court would point out that this is not an obligation of result, but of means (see, among other authorities, Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071) and that Article\u00a02 does not entail the right to have others prosecuted or sentenced for an offence, or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0 [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a094 and\u00a096, ECHR 2004-XII). Nevertheless, in this context the Court also recalls that the authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or persons responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard. Whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan v.\u00a0 [GC], no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 2000-VII).",

In their submissions to the Court, the Government themselves admitted that the blood samples of two suspects were unsuitable for expert examination and that new samples had therefore had to be obtained, thus delaying the investigation. In this connection, the Court reiterates its finding, made on a number of occasions, that an investigation should be carried out by competent, qualified and impartial experts (see Premininy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0109).",

As the Court has held on previous occasions, the Convention does not preclude reliance, at the investigation stage, on sources such as anonymous informants. The subsequent use of their statements by a trial court to found a conviction is, however, capable of raising issues under the Convention (see Kostovski v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 20\u00a0November 1989, \u00a7\u00a044, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0166, and Windisch v.\u00a0, 27\u00a0September 1990, \u00a7\u00a030, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0186).",

Such interests of witnesses are in principle protected by other, substantive provisions of the Convention, which imply that Contracting States should organise their criminal proceedings in such a way that those interests are not unjustifiably imperilled (see Doorson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070). In view of the murders of at least two inmates at Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison (see paragraph\u00a041 above), the Court understands the anonymous witnesses\u2019 unwillingness to testify against other inmates. Even so, the Court stresses that there existed various measures, including technical means, allowing the domestic authorities to conduct the questioning of the witnesses without a risk to disclose their identities (see, mutatis mutandis, Birutis and Others v.\u00a0Lithuania, nos.\u00a047698/99 and\u00a048115/99, \u00a7\u00a029, 28\u00a0March\u00a02002).",

Lastly, the Court also gives substantial weight to the Kaunas Regional Prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the anonymous witnesses could have been questioned once they had finished serving their sentences (see paragraph\u00a032 above). Given that more than eleven years have passed since the death of the applicant\u2019s son, it is not unreasonable to assume that at least some of those witnesses are at large by now. Nonetheless, the Government have not provided any information as to whether those witnesses, except for one of them (see paragraph\u00a040 above), have been questioned by the prosecutors again with a view to compelling them to testify.",
