In some cases journalists are obliged to use hidden cameras, for instance where information is difficult to obtain by any other means (cf. De La Flor Cabrera, cited above, \u00a7 40, which concerned a video recording which had been made without the filmed person\u2019s consent in order to gather evidence in judicial proceedings).
