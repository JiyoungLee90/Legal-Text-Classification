The term \u201ceffective\u201d is also considered to mean that the remedy must be adequate and accessible (see Paulino\u00a0Tom\u00e1s v.\u00a0Portugal (dec.), no.\u00a058698/00, ECHR 2003-XIII). Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are \u201ceffective\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Mifsud v.

Lastly, the Court reiterates that the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see Surmeli, cited above, \u00a7 98) and the mere fact that an applicant\u2019s claim fails is not in itself sufficient to render the remedy ineffective (see Amann v.
