The De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp cases - referred to the Court on 24 October 1969 by the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium ("the Government") - have their origin in petitions lodged in 1966 with the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") by three Belgian nationals concerning certain aspects of Belgian legislation on vagrancy and its application to these three persons.
By judgment of 18 June 1971 the Court rejected a number of complaints made by the three applicants with respect to their detention under the vagrancy laws in force in . In particular, the Court held that there had been no breach of Article 5 (1) (art. 5-1) of the Convention, since it had "not found either irregularity or arbitrariness in the placing of the three applicants at the disposal of the Government" and had "no reason to find the resulting detention incompatible with Article 5 (1) (e) (art. 5-1-e) of the Convention" (point II-2 of the operative part of the judgment and paragraphs 66-70 of the reasoning).
On the other hand, the Court held that there had been a breach of Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) in that the applicants had "had no remedy open to them before a court against the decisions ordering their detention" (point II-4 of the operative part of the judgment). On this point the Court found that the proceedings before a magistrate in regard to vagrants prescribed by Belgian law did not by themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) and that a remedy before a court should therefore have been open to the applicants by which the lawfulness of their detention might be determined (paragraphs 74-80 of the reasoning). The Court further reserved for the applicants the right, should the occasion arise, to apply for just satisfaction on this issue (point II-13 of the operative part of the judgment).
On 27 September 1971, the Principal Delegate of the Commission, making reference to point II-13 of the operative part of the judgment, transmitted to the Registrar a letter dated 23 July in which the applicants’ counsel asked the Commission to request the Court to award to his clients damages for "unlawful detention".
After consultation with the members of the Court, the President directed that the examination of this aspect of the cases should be conducted by the Judges who had taken part in the judgment of 18 June 1971. One of these Judges, Mr. Bilge, could not, however, exercise his functions as he has been appointed a member of the Turkish Government (Rule 4 of the Rules of Court).
On the instructions of the President, the Registrar requested the Agent of the Government, and then the Delegates of the Commission, to present their written observations on the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention. The Registrar received these observations on 27 October and 17 December 1971; a memorandum from the applicants’ counsel was appended to the Commission’s observations.
By Order of 4 January 1972, the President of the Court:
- authorised the Agent of the Government to file a second memorial not later than 31 January on the understanding that he could complete it at the oral hearings;
- and, the Delegates of the Commission having intimated that they did not desire to present further written observations, decided that the oral hearings should open on 14 February.
The Government’s second memorial was received at the Registry on 31 January 1972.
On 10 January, the Agent of the Government sent to the Registrar, for the information of the Court, statistics of the appeals presented under the transitional provisions contained in Section 2 of the Act of 6 August 1971 (see paragraph 13 below).
The public hearings took place on 14 February in the Human Rights Building at .
There appeared before the Court:
- for the Government:
		at , Assessor to the Council of State, 							    Agent and Counsel;
- for the Commission:
The Court heard the addresses and submissions of Mr. Sørensen and Mr. De Meyer as well as their replies to questions put by the Court and by individual Judges.
The hearings were declared provisionally closed on 14 February.
After having made final the closure of the hearings and deliberated in private, the Court gives the present judgment.
The Court is called upon to rule only on the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present cases. Thus, as regards the facts the Court will confine itself here to giving a brief outline and for the rest it refers to paragraphs 15 to 43 of its judgment of 18 June 1971.
That judgment concerned the detention of De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp ordered by decisions of the magistrates at Charleroi, Namur and Brussels on 19 April 1966, 21 December 1965 and 4 November 1965 respectively under Sections 13 (in the cases of De Wilde and Versyp) and 16 (in the case of Ooms) of the Act of 27 November 1891 for the suppression of vagrancy and begging. De Wilde regained his freedom after a little less than seven months (three of which he spent serving a prison sentence), Ooms after one year and Versyp after one year, nine months and six days.
In the course of the proceedings before the Commission, the applicants each claimed 500 Belgian francs (BF) damages per day of detention. Their counsel, Me. Magnée, now relies on the judgment of 18 June 1971 to claim, on behalf of each of them, damages of 300 BF per day of "unlawful detention".
With that object, Me. Magnée began by addressing to the Belgian Minister of Justice, on 22 and 30 June 1971, two letters of which the first related to Versyp and the second to Ooms. On 12 July, the Minister replied that the Government could only apply the law as it stood while waiting for the Bill on "social misfits" - which it had introduced even before the judgment of 18 June 1971 - to be passed. Considering this reply to amount to a refusal contrary to the principle of the supremacy of international treaty law over national law, Me. Magnée informed the Minister, on 14 July that he proposed to bring the matter before the "competent authorities" and to notify the Commission.
Counsel for the applicants did in fact write first to the Committee of Ministers - 16 July - to inform them of the Minister of Justice’s refusal which implied, he alleged, a violation of the Court’s judgment; he later wrote, on 23 July, to the Commission referring to Articles 5 (5), 48 and 50 (art. 5-5, art. 48, art. 50) of the Convention and requested the Commission to bring before the Court the claim made by each of his three clients.
On 2 August, he addressed to the Minister of Justice a letter concerning De Wilde which was worded in the same terms as the letters of 22 and 30 June. The Minister acknowledged its receipt on 12 August, noting that along with the other two it had been communicated by Me. Magnée to the Commission.
In its memorial of 27 October 1971, the Government pointed out to the Court that on 17 June 1971 it had tabled in Parliament a Bill on "social misfits" intended to replace the 1891 Act. The Government added that, desiring to comply with the judgment of 18 June 1971 without awaiting the passage of this Bill, it had voted by Parliament an Act of 6 August 1971 amending the 1891 Act and containing two sections. The first, which inserted a new section, numbered 16 bis, in the 1891 Act, provides that decisions taken under Sections 13 and 16 are henceforth made subject to the remedies available under the Code of Criminal Procedure, including appeal. Section 2 was a transitional provision: it specified that vagrants or beggars held in detention on the entry into force of the 1971 Act (4 September 1971) in execution of a decision taken under Section 13 or Section 16 of the 1891 Act, could exercise for a period of one month the remedy provided for at Section 16 bis.
