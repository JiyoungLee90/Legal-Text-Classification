The ancillary matters had been complex in the instant case as the applicant had additional income from company shares and granting loans. Moreover, there was the complicated legal question of a prenuptial agreement concluded between the parties to limit the amount of maintenance. The Government acknowledged that the applicant was interested in a speedy conclusion of the proceedings in order to be able to marry his new partner. They conceded that there had been delays of which two years and three and a half months were attributable to the Schwerin District Court. Those delays were partly due to two changes of the judge responsible for the case, which respectively required some time for the new judge to familiarise with the case. Finally, they pointed out that there was another delay of five months which was not attributable to them but to Mrs S., as it had been caused by the cancellation of the hearing originally scheduled for November 2005 and rescheduled for April 2006, which was necessitated by a change of Mrs S.\u2019s counsel.",
