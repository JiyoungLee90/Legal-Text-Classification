In the middle of July 1984 the [ddp] had removed him from the post of director and in the middle of August [it] had terminated his contract of employment. The circular and newspaper cuttings were sent out about a month later to selected addressees, including - and this is not disputed - important clients of the [ddp]. A few months later the respondent\u2019s new agency was set up. This chronological sequence of events is a further indication of the respondent\u2019s intention to lower the [ddp] in the esteem of potential clients of both parties and thereby make it easier for his own agency to gain a foothold in the market in preparation for competition with the [ddp].",

It is not apparent what else the respondent could have meant when he wrote that he wished to discuss \u2018not only the past but also future developments in the German \"news market\"\u2018. By taking up these unfavourable comments on the [ddp] and distributing them anew as his own statements and assessments, he unnecessarily handicapped the [ddp] as a competitor. In this connection it does not matter whether the unfavourable factual statements concerning the [ddp]\u2019s activities were accurate and whether they justified the unfavourable assessments accompanying them. This is because even true statements may only be used to disparage a competitor where the person making them has sufficient reason to link his own competitive position with disparagement of the competitor and provided that the criticism does not in nature or degree exceed what is necessary (Federal Court of Justice in GRUR 1968, pp. 262 and 265 - F\u00e4lschung).

The findings of fact by the national courts must be assessed with the proper respect due to them, but without excessive deference. It is crucial that the margin of appreciation which is left to national legislatures and courts must remain subject to an effective European supervision.",

He accordingly had an obvious and pressing interest in trying to protect his impugned reputation without delay, especially as he was seeking a new job in the same sector and had to wait almost two months for his right to reply to be recognised and another month for his reply to be published (see paragraphs 12-13 of the judgment). There was a parallel public interest to learn whether the applicant would defend himself against his former employer.",

At the time he sent it, some six weeks had already elapsed since the ddp had issued its press release of 16 August 1984 (see paragraphs 12 and 14 of the judgment). He still did not know whether the courts would eventually grant him a right of reply. Given this situation, there was nothing extreme or improper in the circular at issue. On the contrary, he merely approved in a few lines the substance of thirteen articles from newspapers with a large circulation, which were already in the public domain. Subsequently, the D\u00fcsseldorf Court of Appeal ruled that the applicant should desist from any further such mailings, on pain of a fine, and that he would have to pay compensation for all actual or potential damage suffered by the ddp as a consequence of his action (see paragraph 17 of the judgment). In effect, the German Unfair Competition Act was interpreted so as to make unlawful the distribution of widely circulated newspaper articles, at a time when the applicant had no way to re-establish his impugned reputation and did not know whether any such way would be available to him in the foreseeable future. Thus the D\u00fcsseldorf Court of Appeal accepted that he had acted, among other reasons, in order to correct assertions about him that were \"possibly false\" (see paragraph 17 of the judgment).",

The recipients of the circular, however, were among those who had also received the ddp\u2019s press release of 16 August 1984, in which the applicant had been attacked and to which he had finally secured the right to reply on 11 October 1984 (see paragraphs 12-13 of the judgment). The motives which prompted the applicant\u2019s action - protecting his reputation and securing his future career - appear both legitimate and intertwined. They are so intertwined, in fact, that he could not be expected to justify himself without making reference to both his past and his future professional career. Moreover, as we have stressed, he did not do so in an extreme or improper fashion, since he confined himself to sending out newspaper cuttings, to which he added only a few comments. To put it succinctly, he distributed newspaper articles which were already in the public domain, and added that they gave, on the whole, a fair picture.",

The competitive element cannot be regarded as having played a preponderant role in the particular circumstances of the case. To accept in this case a preponderance of the competitive element amounts to reducing the principle of freedom of expression to the level of an exception and to elevating the Unfair Competition Act to the status of a rule. We cannot agree that this constitutes the proper way of exercising a European supervision.",
