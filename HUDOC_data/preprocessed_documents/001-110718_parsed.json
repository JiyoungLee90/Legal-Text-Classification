The court did not see any evidence that severe pain had been inflicted on Salikhov on 24, 25 June or 1 July 2004, this followed from the statements by the witnesses and Salikhov\u2019s own testimony. The use of handcuffs was permitted under section 45 of the Pre-Trial Detention Act. As the witnesses stated in court, Salikhov had been handcuffed after he had started using obscene language against the nurse and police officers and jerking his hands, that is, they were used for putting an end to his unlawful conduct. Thus, the court finds no violation of Salikhov\u2019s constitutional rights because a blood sample was not taken, because he was not subjected to torture, and because the use of handcuffs was lawful.\u201d",

The defendant did not deny that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with K. on 21 June [2004] in the day-time at the following address ... The findings of a forensic biology report ... corroborated the fact of sexual intercourse by Salikhov and K. The following evidence confirms the non-consensual and violent nature of the intercourse between Salikhov and K.: the statements by the victim K. made during the pre-trial investigation and read out in court; the statements by the witnesses Ms V. and Ms Kar. made during the pre-trial investigation and read out in court; the testimony by the witness Ms M. and the witness Mr V. which were logical and consistent and which the court finds no reason to doubt. An indirect indication of the non-consensual and violent nature of the intercourse follows from the testimony of Mr B. in the part in which he stated: \u2018K. said: Maybe you\u2019ve had enough sex for today? Salikhov replied: [K.] is a smart girl, she\u2019s got it right, - and took her to the bedroom.\u2019 which implies the non-consensual nature of the intercourse between Salikhov and K. Furthermore, the injuries found on K.\u2019s body \u2013 bruises on the outer surface of the hips, neck, shoulders and abrasions on the forearms \u2013 also confirm that Salikhov had had a sexual intercourse with her and forced her to perform oral sex on him; the expert S. stated before court that the timing of injuries did not contradict the information on Salikhov\u2019s criminal acts [sic] and that such injuries might be the product of a non-consensual sexual intercourse... The fact that the forensic study did not uncover any injuries to K.\u2019s genital or anal area does not exclude the possibility that sexual acts had been performed on K.\u2019s against her will; the expert S. explained to the court that a forcible intercourse is possible without injuring the genitals or the anal opening and that she could not categorically exclude that there might be some indications of violent sexual intercourse. The scene of the offence (a fourth-floor flat), the identity of the participants (two men, both recently released from penitentiary facilities, one of them infected with tuberculosis, and a young woman), the number and frequency of sexual intercourse and violent acts demonstrate that the intercourse was carried out against the victim\u2019s will.\u201d",

Rather, those procedures were aimed at securing evidence of a rape. This finding does not of itself warrant the conclusion that the intervention contravened Article 3, as the Convention does not, in principle, prohibit recourse to a forcible medical intervention that will assist in the investigation of an offence (see Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70 and 76). Nevertheless, any interference with a person\u2019s physical integrity carried out with the aim of obtaining evidence must be the subject of rigorous scrutiny, with the following factors being of particular importance: the extent to which forcible medical intervention was necessary to obtain the evidence, the health risks for the suspect, the manner in which the procedure was carried out and the physical pain and mental suffering it caused, the degree of medical supervision available and the effects on the suspect\u2019s health. In the light of all the circumstances of the individual case, the intervention must not attain the minimum level of severity that would bring it within the scope of Article 3.

The purpose of the medical intervention was the collection of biological samples which could be later examined for traces of the victim\u2019s blood or epithelial cells. Such traces being by their nature fragile and perishable, time was of the essence and the procedures had to be carried out urgently. The domestic law did not make the collection of biological samples conditional on the suspect\u2019s consent; nor did it prohibit the investigative authorities from resorting to coercive measures should the suspect refuse to cooperate (see paragraph 62 above). It follows that the forcible intervention was not unlawful in domestic legal terms, however, the question remains whether or not recourse to physical force was necessary to obtain the evidence in the particular circumstances of the case.",

The situation quickly degenerated and violence escalated to the point where the applicant was not invited to submit voluntarily to the clipping of his nails but rather was overpowered and pinned down by force against the table during the procedure. The Court cannot speculate how the events could have unfolded, or whether the applicant would have consented to giving biological samples had the police officers not resorted to violence, but the fact remains that in the circumstances of the case the police violence was gratuitous and that the use of brute force did not appear to have been justified by the applicant\u2019s conduct.

It has been the Court\u2019s constant position that any recourse to physical force in respect of a person deprived of his liberty which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see, among many others, Kopylov v. , no. 3933/04, \u00a7\u00a7 160-165, 29 July 2010; Dedovskiy and Others v. , no.\u00a07178/03, \u00a7 81, 15 May 2008; Sheydayev v.

As the Court has already found above, the applicant appeared to have been initially disposed to cooperate with the police, without making any excessive or unreasonable demands, and nothing in the applicant\u2019s demeanour could be interpreted as an assault upon, or resistance to, the police orders. In these circumstances, the use of a rubber truncheon and handcuffs was not only unnecessary but also in breach of the applicable provisions of Russian law (see paragraph 66 above). The gratuitous violence to which the police officers deliberately resorted was not and could not be conducive to facilitating the collection of forensic evidence. Rather, it was intended to arouse in the applicant feelings of fear and inferiority and to break his psychological resistance. The purpose of that treatment was to debase the applicant and drive him into submission. Moreover, the treatment to which the applicant was subjected in the instant case had an additional element of humiliation, because he was stripped of his underwear and paraded naked from the waist down through the corridors of the police station, with his hands cuffed behind his back.",

The Court reiterates once again that any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the detainee\u2019s own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention. The concept of strict necessity implies that in situations such as the one obtaining in the instant case the use of force should be a means of last resort rather than an automatic reaction on the part of the police officers to any resistance they may encounter from a detainee. In the present case the officers did not make any attempt to negotiate with the applicant by, for example, stating clearly why and where they were going to take him, and for how long, or otherwise to secure his cooperation by non-violent means. Even if they had not managed to cajole him into following them, it would have been sufficient to immobilise him so he could be taken out of the cell. The beatings and punches they inflicted on him amounted to gratuitous violence of a retaliatory nature or a form of reprisal or corporal punishment (see Dedovskiy and Others, \u00a7 83 in fine, cited above).

Switzerland (no. 17549/90) the former Commission determined that the applicant\u2019s wearing of soiled clothing for one day, during a hearing before a judge and on various journeys, resulting from the failure of the authorities to take elementary hygiene measures, was humiliating and debasing and therefore degrading within the meaning of Article 3 (see the former Commission\u2019s report of 8\u00a0July 1993, Series A no. 280-A). The Court considers that the situation was similar in relevance to that obtaining in the present case, and that the treatment suffered by the applicant should likewise be characterised as degrading.",

By the same decision, he was told that a criminal case had been opened against him in connection with his aggressive behaviour and spitting at the policemen. Judging from the contents of the decision, the deputy prosecutor took no independent investigative steps. He did not seek to hear the applicant\u2019s version of events, nor did he obtain any medical certificate attesting to the degree and extent of his injuries. He relied entirely on the statements given by the police officers, who had a vested interest in the outcome of the proceedings. The Court cannot consider that the inquiry was sufficient in scope or that it represented a serious attempt to find out what happened. Nor was the investigation effective in the sense of being capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used by the police was or was not justified in the circumstances (compare Kaya v. , 19 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a087, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I).",

The applicant was not provided with an opportunity to scrutinise the manner in which Ms K. had been questioned by the police, nor was he then or later provided with the opportunity to have questions put to her. Furthermore, as Ms\u00a0K.\u2019s statements to the investigator were not recorded on video, neither the applicant nor the judges were able to observe her demeanour under questioning and thus form their own impression of her reliability (compare Makeyev v. Russia, no. 13769/04, \u00a7 42, 5 February 2009). Finally, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not put in place any counterbalancing arrangements which could have compensated for the difficulties caused to the defence by the admission of untested evidence (compare Bonev v. , no. 60018/00, \u00a7 44, 8 June 2006, and, by contrast, Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 156-158).",
