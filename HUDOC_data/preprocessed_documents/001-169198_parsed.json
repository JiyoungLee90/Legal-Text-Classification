Despite a significant degree of resemblance between these cases and the present case it is clear that the present case falls to be examined under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention, which provides inter alia for detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court: the prosecutor\u2019s application of 4 November 2003 for the applicant to be examined was granted on that day, and after a series of adjournments to the proceedings, the applicant was detained pursuant to the order on 9\u00a0April\u00a02004. In respect of a person ordered by a court to undergo an involuntary psychiatric examination the purpose of the detention under sub-paragraph (b) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 the Convention is to ensure that he or she submits to a psychiatric examination which, in the opinion of the competent national authorities, is necessary to determine whether the person suffers from any mental disorder. This was precisely the rationale behind the order issued by the Town Court on 4 November 2003.",

The Court has previously observed that the phrase \u201cobligation prescribed by law\u201d denotes an obligation of a specific and concrete nature already incumbent on the person concerned (see Ciulla v. Italy, 22 February 1989, \u00a7 36, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0148). In Beiere v. Latvia (no. 30954/05, \u00a7 48, 29 November 2011) the Court clarified that when a legal provision, the source of the \u201cobligation prescribed by law\u201d, referred directly to a requirement for a judge or a court to adopt a decision, the second aspect of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) was not at issue and the case fell to be examined under the first aspect.

While Article 165 of the Code does indeed provide for ex\u00a0parte hearings regarding relevant orders, nothing in the parties\u2019 submissions indicates that the Russian courts would have been prevented from summoning the applicant if they considered her presence necessary. Moreover, the above opinion of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation states clearly that domestic law \u2013 Article 203 of the Code \u2013 provides for the participation of suspects in hearings.",

In this regard, the Court also reiterates that the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe, measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained (see Karamanof v.

The Court had previously held that paragraph 4 of Article 5 of the Convention enshrines a procedural safeguard against the detention, which albeit initially lawfully ordered, later becomes unlawful and unjustified (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a038822/97, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 2003I (extracts) with further references). The continuing detention of a mental health patient should be with reference to the patient\u2019s contemporaneous state of health, and not with reference to past events from the time the initial decision was made (see X\u00a0v.\u00a0Finland, no.\u00a034806/04, \u00a7\u00a7 169-70, ECHR 2012 (extracts); H.W. v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a017167/11, \u00a7 107, 19 September 2013; Ruiz Rivera v.

The hospital order committing the applicant for compulsory treatment became final on 22 December 2004, while the need for such treatment had been established by the medical report adopted eight months prior to that. Despite the passing of this not insignificant period of time, it took the Russian authorities another year and two months to enforce the order, and the applicant was not placed in the psychiatric facility until 23\u00a0March\u00a02006. Nothing in the material available to the Court suggests that the applicant\u2019s state of mental health was re-evaluated within the two year period between her examination in the Forensic Psychiatry Centre on 13\u00a0April 2004 and the enforcement of the hospital order. Equally, nothing in the parties\u2019 submissions indicates that the national authorities considered whether her mental disorder had persisted and still required compulsory treatment. The Court also notes that the applicant\u2019s involuntary hospitalisation was not considered an emergency measure by the national authorities (see Herz v. Germany, no. 44672/98, \u00a7\u00a054, 12 June 2003) and there is no evidence that the applicant\u2019s condition was examined upon her admission to the hospital in March 2006 (compare D\u00f6rr v.
