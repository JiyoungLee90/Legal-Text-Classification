In fact, exactly like in most of those cases, the Latvian courts have simply recounted the grounds for detention provided by law, and did not provide detailed explanation as to how those grounds were relevant to the applicant\u2019s individual case. The Court admits, however, that in the specific circumstances of the case particular weight could be legitimately given to the fact that the applicant had already absconded from justice and tried to hide abroad. Therefore the Court does not exclude that this fact, together with the seriousness of the alleged crime and the fact that the applicant had no fixed residence in Latvia, could provide a valid ground for keeping him in detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Shannon v. Latvia, no.\u00a032214/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a064-68, 24 November 2009). On the other hand, even such special circumstances did not exonerate the State authorities from their obligation of diligence in trying the applicant within a reasonable time, as Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 provides. In the present case, in order to comply with this provision, the Latvian authorities should have\u00a0provided some additional compelling reasons justifying the applicant\u2019s detention for such a long period of time.\u00a0\u00a0This was\u00a0not done; on the contrary, over three years and three months, the courts continued to simply recount the grounds for detention as they are provided by law. In the Court\u2019s view this was certainly not sufficient for the purposes of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 (Gasi\u0146\u0161\u00b8 cited above, \u00a7 64, and Birznieks, cited above, \u00a7 109).",
