So, we saw a lot of police. And so, we saw up to five hundred members of various forces, the police and internal troops in front of [the IDEA building]. And people held discussions in small groups and from time to time small groups united and, for example, shouted slogans. Their main demand was for [the Head of the IDEA] to apologise for these events. Because it is claimed that his relative had caused the initial incident [that sparked the riot]. However, the government representatives consider that the State is not responsible [for these events]. Thereafter we spoke to many people from the local population. All of them were discontent, and the main reason was, of course, last night\u2019s event, that is apparently the car accident [that sparked the riot]. But in reality there are deep social and economic problems at the root of this incident. A few families, a few small groups control the entire economy of the whole region, all of them are one another\u2019s relatives, there can be no talk of any competitive, just economy, social infrastructure is undeveloped, people live from pension to pension. Then, there are many complaints. Ordinary people say, for example, that when cash for pensions is brought [to the region] by a bank car, the cash is put into ATMs and is available for withdrawal a week later. The people suspect that that money is invested for interest during that week and those responsible for this make profit from the interest gained on the social funding of the entire region.\u201d",

In particular, the applicant claimed in his appeal (see paragraph\u00a0117 below) that, in his witness statement, R.N. had said that from around 3\u00a0p.m. on 24 January 2013 he had been at his relative\u2019s home for lunch. After lunch, sometime before 5 p.m., he had gone to the area next to the Regional Education Department, where he had seen the applicant and Tofiq Yaqublu inciting a large crowd of people to riot and that thereafter the crowd had attacked the police with stones. During cross-examination at the trial hearings, in response to a question by the defence, he had stated that, in connection with this criminal case, he had participated as a witness in the questioning by the prosecution authorities only two days after the Ismayilli events, and that he had not been a participant in any other investigative steps and had not signed any other procedural documents relating to this case. Following that response, the defence produced a copy of the record of the inspection of the damage to the Chiraq Hotel and N.A.\u2019s house, which had been conducted from 10 a.m. to 4.10\u00a0p.m. on 24 January 2013 (see paragraph 65 below). According to the record, R.N. had been present during the inspection as an attesting witness and had signed the inspection record. Despite the fact that this had revealed a clear inconsistency between the record and R.N.\u2019s testimony and his responses to the defence\u2019s questions, raising a number of questions as to the witness\u2019s integrity and the truthfulness of his statements, the presiding judge had hastily dismissed the witness without giving the defence an opportunity to ask any more questions.",

Despite the defence\u2019s objections, the trial was held in a very small courtroom. Given that there were eighteen accused, around twenty lawyers had to sit close to each other in cramped conditions. The applicant\u2019s lawyers were forbidden to use tablets, laptops and other electronic devices, which were necessary given the large amount of case material (a total of 7,000 to 8,000 pages in twenty-six volumes, plus video recordings with a total duration of dozens of hours). The prohibition on electronic devices forced the defence to carry huge amounts of paper material, which was unproductive, as it made it more difficult to quickly find material relevant to the evidence currently under examination. The first-instance court prevented the defence from cross-examining witnesses properly and often interrupted the cross-examination under various pretexts. Whenever the defence objected to the unfair conduct of the trial or to the court\u2019s unfounded interruptions of the cross-examination, the court qualified it as disruptive behaviour by the defence lawyers and eventually initiated proceedings to disbar the lawyers. One of the lawyers, Mr F. Agayev, was fined and another, Mr K. Bagirov, was eventually disbarred.",

In breach of the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, the domestic courts failed to request and review the \u201cinitial evidence\u201d in the prosecution\u2019s possession and thereby failed to assess the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the applicant\u2019s arrest (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 116-18). Thus, the domestic authorities had not been able to demonstrate that they had acted in good faith when restricting the applicant\u2019s right to liberty (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0141). Having also had regard to the combination of case-specific facts, the Court found that, contrary to the requirements of Article 18 of the Convention, the authorities\u2019 actions had been driven by improper reasons: the actual purpose of the applicant\u2019s detention was to silence or punish him for criticising the Government and attempting to disseminate, in his blog and social media posts, what he believed was the true information that the Government were trying to hide (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 142-44).",

As the Court held in the Ilgar Mammadov judgment, during the pre-trial stage of the proceedings, the accusations against the applicant suffered from a prima facie lack of plausibility. In particular, the Court highlighted the fact that the applicant was accused of arriving in Ismayilli one day after the spontaneous and disorganised \u201cacts of hooliganism\u201d had already taken place and that within the short period of two hours, his overall stay in the town, he managed to seize a significant degree of control over the situation, turn the ongoing disorganised rioting into \u201corganised acts\u201d of disorder, establish himself as a leader of the protestors whom he had not known before and who had already gathered without his involvement, and directly cause all of their subsequent disorderly actions. As already noted, this lack of plausibility of the accusations, coupled with the attitude of the authorities towards the applicant\u2019s political activities, called for a high level of scrutiny of the facts. The circumstances on which this previous finding of the Court was based remain unchanged in the present case. The Court will therefore proceed with analysing under Article 6 whether this deficiency has been compensated by the evidence presented at the trial and the reasons provided by the domestic courts.",

Those police officers testified that they had observed the applicant organising and inciting the protesters to attack, and the protesters then proceeding to attack them. Throughout the proceedings the defence repeatedly raised objections as to the participation of those police officers in the trial as victims and as to the credibility of their statements. In particular, the defence argued that: (a)\u00a0\u00a0for unexplained reasons, those police officers had been questioned for the first time as late as five months after the events in question; (b)\u00a0\u00a0prior to that they had never reported or complained about being injured or attacked by protesters, unlike other police officers injured on 23 January and during the morning of 24 January 2013, who had either immediately reported their injuries, or had been immediately hospitalised and examined by forensic experts; (c)\u00a0\u00a0there was no medical or any other evidence of their injuries; and (d)\u00a0\u00a0their statements were not credible as they were stating that a crowd of protesters had been moving along M.F.

While the Government did not submit the transcripts of the relevant hearings, the information available to the Court suggests also that those police officers were never questioned on all those issues and that the defence was limited in cross-examining them. Moreover, in the absence of any evidence of those police officers being injured or attacked by protesters, the first-instance court accepted their designation as \u201cvictims of crime\u201d without any objective justification and without providing reasons, despite the explicit objections by the defence.

The defence further argued that those police officers had been unable to answer questions seeking to clarify the facts (see, for example, paragraphs 113-14 above), and that the trial court had on some occasions cut their cross-examinations short, depriving them of the opportunity to further challenge the witnesses\u2019 credibility. On the basis of the information available to the Court, it appears that there were discrepancies in the police officers\u2019 statements, for example, with regard to the exact timing of the alleged clashes involving the applicant and the number of protesters (see paragraph 47 above). In view of the short stay of the applicant in Ismayilli and all the other circumstances of the case, those discrepancies were clearly of high relevance.",

The defence repeatedly noted in its appeals that, at the trial hearing, R.N. had stated that he had been at his cousin\u2019s place until around 5\u00a0p.m. on 24 January 2013, after which he had headed in the direction of the town centre where he had seen clashes involving the applicant. When asked by the defence whether he had participated in any investigative steps related to the events of 23 and 24\u00a0January 2013, he answered in the negative. Subsequently, the defence produced a document showing that R.N. had participated as an attesting witness in the inspection of the burned Chirag Hotel and other property from 10 a.m. to 4.10 p.m. on 24 January 2013, essentially exposing the fact that he had lied, firstly, about being at his cousin\u2019s place at that time and, secondly, about not having participated in any investigative steps related to the case. The Court notes that, if R.N. did indeed make false statements as described by the applicant, then the credibility of all his statements would be compromised and could not be directly used by a fair tribunal without additional assessment of their credibility. Although the Sheki Court of Appeal took note of that objection in its judgment of 29\u00a0April 2016, it dismissed it, stating merely that \u201c[R.N.\u2019s] presence during the inspection of the scene of the events as an attesting witness does not make it impossible for him to have observed and witnessed an event occurring one hour later\u201d (see paragraph 139 above). The Court finds such reasoning to be inadequate, because it avoided examining the crux of the objection with respect to R.N., namely the fact that he had made false statements before the first-instance court. In such circumstances, the Court finds that the domestic court\u2019s rejection of the applicant\u2019s objection and its decision to accept R.N.\u2019s testimony as good evidence to be manifestly unreasonable.",

In this connection, it observes, firstly, that in rejecting those witnesses\u2019 statements, the domestic courts essentially focused on the fact that some of the witnesses had not been in close physical proximity to the applicant during the entire time he had spent in Ismayilli, and that therefore they could not say with certainty that the applicant had not incited the crowd to commit acts of disorder (see paragraphs 91 and 132 above). The Court finds this approach taken by the domestic courts excessively stringent and one that does not adequately address the relevant issues. A highly relevant part of those witnesses\u2019 statements was that throughout the afternoon of 24\u00a0January 2013 no crowd of protesters had gathered in the centre of the town and no clashes occurred between protesters and the police. Their statements corroborated the applicant\u2019s version of the events and did not appear to contain any internal inconsistencies. If there was no crowd of protesters present, the applicant could not have incited it to commit any illegal acts, and in such circumstances it was immaterial if some of those witnesses had been unable to closely observe the applicant at every moment of his stay in Ismayilli.",

Even assuming that N.C. and N.M., who travelled together with the applicant to Ismayilli, could arguably have had close professional or friendly relations with the applicant, it is not clear why and on what particular basis the domestic courts found that all the other defence witnesses, mostly journalists, had close relations with the applicant, or why such a finding would lead to an assumption that they would necessarily give untruthful statements in court and risk committing perjury. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the domestic courts\u2019 conclusion that all of the witnesses who testified in the applicant\u2019s favour were untruthful and biased towards the applicant was made without sufficient reasons and without due regard to their individual situations (compare Nemtsov, cited above, \u00a7 91).

The Court notes that the applicant repeatedly objected to the use of those letters as evidence, arguing that it was not clear what the content of those letters was based on. The Court considers that, whereas the applicant\u2019s conviction was based to a certain degree on the factual statements contained in those letters, he should have had an adequate opportunity to challenge the authors of the letters, as witnesses who had made statements against him (see, mutatis mutandis, Insanov v. Azerbaijan, no. 16133/08, \u00a7 161, 14 March 2013). No such opportunity was afforded to him. Moreover, the domestic courts did not independently examine any documentary or other material that may have been in the possession of the Ismayilli RPD and the MNS, which had served as the basis for the factual assertions made in their letters. Whatever form that material might have taken (such as investigative documents, video material, reports of search operations, and so on), it was not referenced in the letters in question and was not presented during the trial. Simply put, the factual allegations made in those letters were unsubstantiated. The fact that the letters were written by law-enforcement authorities was, in itself, of no significance, as it is the task of a court of law, vested with the competence to determine the question of guilt in criminal cases, to examine the relevant original evidence and to establish the facts. Accordingly, the Court considers that, by relying on the letters of the Ismayilli RPD and the MNS to convict the applicant and ignoring the defence\u2019s well-founded objections in respect of them, the domestic courts breached the applicant\u2019s rights to have all the evidence produced in the presence of the accused at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument, and to be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question witnesses against him.",

The impugned posts were made and his interview given either in Ismayilli or after leaving it, and in none of them did the applicant talk about anything that preceded his visit. More importantly, having examined the full content of the applicant\u2019s posts and the interview cited in paragraphs 10 and 11 above, the Court finds that the applicant merely conveyed what he had seen and heard in Ismayilli and offered an interpretation of the events from his own perspective. No intent to commit a criminal offence or any incitement to violence can be discerned from the applicant\u2019s impugned statements. While the applicant\u2019s statements were strongly critical of the authorities, who he thought were responsible for the riots, there is nothing to suggest that he overstepped the limits of protected political speech on a question of significant public interest. The Court reiterates that it has held that there was a violation of Article 18 of the Convention, in conjunction with Article 5 of the Convention, in its previous judgment related to the criminal proceedings against the applicant, finding that the actual purpose of the impugned measures against him was to silence or punish him for criticising the Government and attempting to disseminate what he believed was the true information that the Government were trying to hide (see Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 142-43).

As an example, the Sheki Court of Appeal relied on the fact that nine people had been subjected to administrative arrest between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on 24 January 2013 and found that this was proof that violent clashes had been occurring in the town at that time (see paragraphs 138 and 143-44 above). The court did not look into the details of those administrative cases or examine the relevant case files. However, in the absence of any further details as to the identities of the arrested individuals, the circumstances and reasons for their arrests and specific charges against them, the above information was insufficient to establish that those arrests bore any relevance to the applicant\u2019s case.",

In particular, he submitted, with substantiated argumentation, that the prosecution had edited the original video recording by Obyektiv TV, operated by the IRFS, taken during the morning of 24 January 2013, in order to pass it as proof of alleged clashes that had taken place in the afternoon of that day. He pointed out that there existed a full version of that video and a letter by the chairman of the IRFS confirming that there had been no acts of disorder by protesters during the afternoon of 24 January 2013. He also submitted that, in addition to the above video recording and the Unibank video recording discussed above, there existed another video recording of a similar nature made by the Yeni Musavat newspaper, which had allegedly been admitted as evidence but not examined by the first-instance court (see paragraphs 103-04 above). The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s allegations that the prosecution had tampered with evidence and that the trial court had failed to adequately examine evidence in his favour were serious allegations which were directly relevant to the charges against him. In a case where it was a major point of contention between the parties as to whether any acts of mass disorder had actually taken place while the applicant was in Ismayilli, the principles of a fair trial required the courts to adequately and comprehensively examine all relevant evidence adduced by the parties, particularly evidence as strong as provided in the available video recordings. However, both the Sheki Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which reviewed the applicant\u2019s appeals twice each, remained silent in respect of those allegations.",

The evidence favourable to the applicant was systematically dismissed in an inadequately reasoned or manifestly unreasonable manner. Even though the case was remitted once for a new examination by the Supreme Court and an attempt was made to address some of the defence\u2019s requests and objections, none of the shortcomings noted above were eventually remedied.

Furthermore, the Court has recognised in its jurisprudence several implied limitations. Already in 1975, in the case of Golder\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, no. 4451/70, \u00a7 38, 21 February 1975, the Court acknowledged that the right of access to a court is not absolute and may be subject to implied limitations.

The Grand Chamber has confirmed that there may be restrictions to the right to legal assistance which have to be considered in the light of the overall fairness of the trial (see Salduz v.

This Article was explained as pursuing a global aim, in the aftermath of WWII, of preventing states from imposing internally legal restrictions upon individual freedoms for totalitarian reasons in the interests of its totalitarian grip as opposed to applying them for democratic reasons in the public interest. The object and purpose of Article 18 as demonstrated by the Travaux Pr\u00e9paratoires does not support a narrow application of Article 18, for example, only in relation to articles which expressly provide for restrictions.",
