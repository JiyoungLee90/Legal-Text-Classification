The military personnel serving in those units should have voted in ordinary polling stations already set up in accordance with the Electoral Code. The unlawful creation of special polling stations exclusively for those military units led to a situation where voting was conducted on the premises of the military units, under the supervision of high-ranking officers in closed, non-transparent conditions. The election result was \u201cfalsified in favour of the candidate [M.], who was backed by the ruling party\u201d. In particular, military servicemen were specifically instructed and pressured by superior officers to vote for M., resulting in his victory in the election mainly on the strength of votes received in the polling stations in question.",

This Article would appear at first to differ from the other provisions of the Convention and its Protocols, as it is phrased in terms of the obligation of the High Contracting Parties to hold elections under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people, rather than in terms of a particular right or freedom.

The margin of appreciation is also wide as regards the choice of electoral system (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7 54). There are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe which it is for each Contracting State to mould into its own democratic vision (see Hirst (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 61).",

In this connection, the Court considers that in cases where it is alleged that the breach of the domestic legal rules was such that it seriously undermined the legitimacy of the election as a whole, Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 requires it to assess whether such a breach has taken place and has resulted in a failure to hold free and fair elections. In doing so, the Court may have regard to whether an assessment in this respect has been made by the domestic courts; if it has been made, the Court may confine its own review to whether or not the domestic courts\u2019 finding was arbitrary (see, mutatis mutandis, I.Z. v.\u00a0Greece, cited above, and Babenko v.

The circumstances of the case and the observations made in the OSCE/ODIHR report show that there was a deliberate practice of organising military voting in breach of the requirements of the Electoral Code. The existence of such a practice was further demonstrated by the manner in which the applicant\u2019s complaints were handled by the domestic electoral authorities and courts in the present case. The CEC\u2019s approach was to ignore the applicant\u2019s complaint that Polling Stations nos. 31 and 32 had been created unlawfully, while the domestic courts rejected his complaint without examining its substance and by stating merely that the applicant had failed to present \u201creliable evidence\u201d in support of it. Having regard to the nature of the matter complained of, such a response by the domestic courts can only be assessed as contrived and designed to avoid upholding the law and stating the obvious: that the electoral authorities had conducted the elections in breach of the procedure prescribed by the Electoral Code. The applicant\u2019s complaint aptly disclosed the apparent breach of the requirements of Article\u00a035.5 of the Electoral Code by merely pointing to the existing and undisputed facts; the Court finds it impossible to see what other \u201creliable evidence\u201d he could have been expected to submit to show that there were no lawful grounds for creating special polling stations for military voting. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court considers that the conduct of the electoral commissions and courts in the present case and their respective decisions revealed an apparent lack of genuine concern for upholding the rule of law and protecting the integrity of the election (compare Namat Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7 90).",
