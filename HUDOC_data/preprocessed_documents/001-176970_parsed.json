He had been well aware of the position of the public prosecutor as regards the continuation of his detention. The statement of the Chief Public Prosecutor of 28 January 2011 had not contained any new facts or arguments of which he had been unaware. The principle of equality of arms had not been violated.

The case of Lanz (cited above) had concerned the first review of the lawfulness of applicant\u2019s detention by the Court of Appeal and both the applicant and the public prosecutor, who had sought recognition of further grounds for detention, had lodged appeals against the Review Chamber\u2019s decision.

In Fodale (cited above), the applicant, who had not been in custody at the time, had not been summoned to appear at the hearing before the Court of Cassation, which had been set following an appeal on points of law by the public prosecutor and which had concerned the question of whether his release from detention would become final or whether the decision ordering his release would be quashed.

Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) and 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention were thus no longer applicable to the applicant\u2019s detention (Wemhoff v. Germany, 27 June 1968, \u00a7 9, Series A no.\u00a07). The domestic courts\u2019 assessment whether there was a risk of the applicant absconding to justify his continued detention (see paragraph 10 above) was thus owed to the fact that the applicable domestic law provided that a person was detained on remand, rather than after conviction, until his or her conviction became final, including during appeal procedures (see paragraph 21 above). Under the Court\u2019s case-law, no such assessment of a risk of absconding would have been required, as the applicant\u2019s detention was governed by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention, despite the pending appeal proceedings (Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, \u00a7 99, 1 March 2007). Nothing indicates that the applicant\u2019s detention under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention was per se arbitrary.",

Russia [GC], no. 5826/03, \u00a7 161, 22 May 2012). Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention does not normally come into play as regards detention governed by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention, save where the grounds justifying the person\u2019s deprivation of liberty are susceptible to change with the passage of time (see Kafkaris v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 9644/09, \u00a7 58, 21\u00a0June 2011) or where fresh issues affecting the lawfulness of such detention arise (see Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no. 74012/01, \u00a7 57, 6\u00a0November 2008). In the present case, Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention is applicable because domestic law provided that a person is detained on remand until his or her conviction becomes final, including during appeal proceedings, and accorded the same procedural rights to all remand prisoners (see paragraph 21 above). Where the Contracting States provide for procedures which go beyond the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, the provision\u2019s guarantees, nevertheless, have to be respected in these procedures. The Court observes that, prior to the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 3 February 2011, the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention had previously been assessed eleven times by the domestic authorities since 27\u00a0August 2010.

The defence had no opportunity to comment on them. This specific part of the proceedings was thus not adversarial; equality of arms was not guaranteed. Nevertheless, the defence had a remedy against this deficiency in the procedure and could request a subsequent hearing. This request was declared inadmissible as the court held that the observations of the prosecution had not contained any new information and the court\u2019s decision had not been based on any incorrect factual or procedural considerations (see paragraph 18 of the judgment). That means that the national courts analysed the substance of the complaint, that is to say, whether the formal mistake had any negative consequences for the applicant. This second procedure was however also problematic as, again, the observations of the prosecution were not sent to the defence. The applicant did have another remedy, as he was able to bring his complaint before the Constitutional Court (where he was, however, unsuccessful). Thus, the deficiency in the procedure was reviewed in substance, but part of the review procedure was open to criticism as well.",

Nevertheless, and rightly so, the Court has transposed the guarantees of a fair trial, especially the right to an adversarial procedure and equality of arms, to proceedings under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention. In this context it seems not to be entirely clear whether the adversarial character of the procedure and equality of arms should be understood as formal or substantive guarantees.",

While we agree with this statement, we think that, if a formal mistake has been made and a review procedure is granted to correct it, it is acceptable for this procedure to focus on the substantive question of real disadvantage. This is in line with the Court\u2019s case-law, which interprets the principle of equality of arms in the light of what is essential in challenging a detention order (see, among other authorities and mutatis mutandis, Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7\u00a0124, 9 July 2009).",

Secondly, while legal certainty is very important, it should not be misunderstood as the reduction of substantive guarantees to formal guarantees. Form and procedure matter, but in human rights protection they are not an end in themselves. The Court should always look behind appearances and focus on the substance. Thirdly, we think that it is very important to interpret the Convention in a consistent manner.
