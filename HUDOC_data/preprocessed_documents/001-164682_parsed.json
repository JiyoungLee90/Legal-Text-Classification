The court noted that the termination of the pre-trial investigation against the applicant did not make the investigation unlawful ab initio, and found that there had been sufficient grounds for suspicions against her: plastic bags had been found in the apartment where she lived together with her son V.\u017d., and remnants of drugs had been found in the applicant\u2019s daughter V.B.\u2019s apartment. Furthermore, while detained, V.\u017d. had unlawfully been in possession of a mobile phone, and the police officers had had grounds to believe that he had warned the applicant to hide the drugs which had been stored in V.B.\u2019s apartment. Accordingly, the court found that the applicant\u2019s provisional arrest had been well-founded. The court also noted that the applicant had not appealed against the district prosecutor\u2019s decision of 5 March 2010 to refuse her release (see paragraph 17 above), which meant that the decision to arrest her had not been declared unlawful. Lastly, the court held that the medical documents submitted by the applicant did not prove that the deterioration of her health had been caused by the provisional arrest.

Neither is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or discontinuing suspicions which provide the grounds for detention (see Yagublu v. Azerbaijan, no. 31709/13, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54, 5 November 2015, and the cases cited therein). However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. The fact that a suspicion is held in good faith is insufficient. The words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d mean the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (see Gusinskiy v.

During police searches, several items corroborating that suspicion were found in the apartment where V.\u017d. lived together with the applicant, as well as in the apartment of V.\u017d.\u2019s sister, V.B., to which the applicant held the keys. Most importantly, the officers also discovered that V.\u017d. had a mobile phone in detention, and the text messages found on that phone (see paragraph 9 above) indicated that the applicant may have been involved in the distribution of drugs together with her son, or that, at the very least, she may have acted under his instructions and hidden the drugs stored in V.B.\u2019s apartment.
