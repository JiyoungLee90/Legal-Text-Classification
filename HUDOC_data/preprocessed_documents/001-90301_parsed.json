However, during the court hearing they stated that the applicant was the shorter one and had been wearing a velvet shirt. The court also doubted that either of them could have seen P. kicking one of the attackers: according to both witnesses, the two attackers had mounted the truck\u2019s ladder, but in that case the witnesses could not have seen anything in the cabin. C.I.\u2019s and C.D.\u2019s statements also contradicted Z.\u2019s statement, according to which one attacker had climbed into the truck from the passenger side, while the other threatened him with a knife. The person wearing dark clothes had shot P., but Z. did not recognise the applicant as being that person, nor as being the other attacker. Besides, both C.I. and C.D. stated that the shots had been fired from a short distance, when both attackers were on the truck\u2019s ladder. However, the expert report could not prove the distance from which the shots had been fired, except to find that they had not been made from a short distance (of under one metre). Another report showed that the shots had been fired upwards at a 45\u00ba angle. Hence, the shot could not have been fired from the truck\u2019s ladder, contrary to the testimony of these two witnesses.",

At the beginning of the investigation he stated that he had not realised that a crime was being committed and did not think he could identify any of the attackers. He had seen one attacker from the side and the other from the back. Both had been wearing dark clothes; one had medium-length dark hair and was aged around 30. He gave similar statements on 4\u00a0January and 19 April 2000. On 7 May 2000 he was able to remember details such as the colour and material of the attackers\u2019 shirts; the colour of their hair and hairstyles; their approximate height; and that the shorter attacker wore a light coloured shirt (as opposed to his earlier statement that both had worn dark clothes). The court considered that his statements were not reliable since they contradicted his own earlier statements and those made by witnesses C.I. and C.D. U.E.\u2019s statement was videotaped but was not shown to him after the event as required by Article 115 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d, see below). Moreover, the court questioned U.E.\u2019s actions since he, as a police officer, had not reacted to a number of signs that a crime was being committed, such as the sound of shots, the fact that the truck\u2019s driver had fled in one direction while two other persons ran in another, and that someone had fallen to the ground from the truck.",

The Court found that there had been a breach of Article 6 because the Supreme Court of Justice, in the event, reversed Mr Popovici\u2019s acquittal without rehearing the case. In the present case the Supreme Court of Justice acted as a third-instance court under the provisions of the old Code of Criminal Procedure and was prevented by law from directly examining witnesses (see paragraph 51 above), although it could have heard the applicant in person. The Court notes in this latter connection that the Government have not argued that the applicant had waived his right to appear before the Supreme Court of Justice and there is nothing in the file which would support that the applicant had unequivocally waived his right.",

All other evidence, such as various technical reports, only showed the manner in which the crime had been committed, but did not prove the applicant\u2019s involvement in it. In overturning the lower courts\u2019 judgment, the Supreme Court of Justice dealt extensively with the witness statements. It found, for instance, that several witnesses whose statements provided the applicant with an alibi were not coherent or credible enough to constitute an acceptable defence. It did not deal with the lower courts\u2019 findings that the witnesses for the prosecution had made inconsistent statements which were partly contradicted by objective evidence and that those statements were unreliable since the witnesses had been influenced by seeing a video recording before the identity parade. The Supreme Court of Justice therefore disagreed with the assessment of the witnesses made by the lower courts, while it was prevented by law from directly examining those witnesses.",
