Once it was established that the applicant was unable to attend court due to his poor health, it was not the court's task to enquire about his capacity to act. However, since the applicant's lawyer was present at every hearing, there were no procedural obstacles to continuing the case and taking other evidence, as indicated in the District Court's decision. Moreover, the court could have read to the record the applicant's statement given in 2002 (section 263 of the CPA), or invited him to submit any other information in writing, if this had been vital for deciding the merits of the case. Finally, it was for the court to assess the applicant's failure to give a statement in the proceedings (section 267 of the CPA).
