Having examined the specific conditions and procedures under which the State had alienated its assets to private individuals, the Court noted that they were within the State\u2019s exclusive competence and held that the defects in those procedures resulting in the loss by the State of its real property should not have been remedied at the expense of bona fide owners. The Court further reasoned that such restitution of property to the State or municipality, in the absence of any compensation paid to the bona fide owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the individuals\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

The Court notes that the flat left the municipality\u2019s \u201cpossession\u201d as a result of the alleged fraud committed by a third party. The Court further observes that there were safeguards in place to ensure that the flat changed hands in accordance with the domestic law. The lawfulness of each transaction and title in respect of the flat were subject to control by registration authorities. The Government, however, did not proffer any explanation, as to why those safeguards had not been effective in detecting the fraud and protecting the municipality\u2019s interests. In particular, neither the domestic judicial authorities nor the Government clarified how it had been possible for the authorities to approve the transfer of title to the flat to the second applicant while the flat was officially listed as the property for which the owners had received a compensation from the State and the latter was well aware of the fraudulent sale of the flat by M.\u2019s husband. In such circumstances, the Court considers that it was not for the second applicant to assume the risk of the title to the flat being revoked on account of the said omissions on the part of the authorities in procedures specially designed to prevent fraud in real-property transactions. The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors on the part of State authorities should serve to benefit the persons affected. In other words, the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a049). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the flat by the second applicant and the transfer of the ownership of the flat to the Town of Grozny, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on her. There has therefore been a violation of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention.",

Belgium (Article\u00a050), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case and to the fact that the second applicant did not receive compensation for loss of title to the flat in the domestic proceedings, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore her title to the flat and to annul the eviction order.
