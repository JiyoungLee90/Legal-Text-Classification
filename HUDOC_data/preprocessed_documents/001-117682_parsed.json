When forty or fifty minutes had passed, the seventh applicant asked how long they had to stand like that. He was rudely reminded that he had been told to shut up and not to turn his head. Then he was grabbed by the legs so that he fell and hit his head. Two policemen pushed his legs apart and a third one kicked him between the legs. He cried out in pain.

He described a situation where a youngster had called on people to stand up to protest against what was going on. Most of the people who could, had stood up. Then the policemen had started to beat everyone and almost twenty more policemen had rushed in. The protesters were thrown down or forced to sit. By 1 a.m. there were nearly 350 people being held in D-terminal.

Thus, the allegations by the applicants about the circumstances in which they had sustained their injuries were not in themselves sufficient to establish a causal link between the alleged acts and the consequences.

The Supreme Court considered that stopping a vehicle and checking documents were usually acts forming part of supervisory proceedings in the course of which a police officer collected additional necessary information about the elements of an offence in order to establish whether a basis for misdemeanour proceedings existed. The Supreme Court held that the use of force and special equipment within supervisory proceedings could be challenged before an administrative court, whereas in the event of complaints concerning measures applied in misdemeanour proceedings a county court had jurisdiction over the matter, pursuant to Articles 76 to 80 of the Code of Misdemeanour Procedure.",

Criminal proceedings against the police, which the applicants had sought, did not have the same essential objective, and were therefore not alternative remedies, as means of establishing the lawfulness or otherwise of measures taken, with the objective of satisfaction of claims for damages.

Despite that, the first, fourth and fifth applicants had been arrested in the second night of the disorder and the seventh applicant during the third night of the disorder, late in the evening or at night in the middle of the \u201chottest\u201d action. In a situation in which rioting, destruction and violence were taking place in the centre of Tallinn, accompanied by attacks against the police, the public interest in combating offences and ending the mass disorder was obvious and the police had been entitled in that situation to use special equipment to these ends. The domestic authorities had established that the applicants\u2019 behaviour had not been law-abiding and they had not complied with lawful orders by the police to leave the site of an unauthorised and violent mass gathering. The Government emphasised that considering the extent of the disorder, stabilising the situation had not been possible without detaining individuals for identification and removing them from the site of the mass gathering. The Government considered that neither handcuffing the applicants nor having recourse to physical force, which had been made absolutely necessary by their own conduct, had given rise to an issue under Article 3. There had been no systematic humiliation of individuals in places of detention. The applicants\u2019 detention had been of short duration and had not exceeded the limit which a person was required to tolerate in situations of mass disorder. The Government also noted that the ambulance service had been constantly present in places of detention, and that where needed medical care had been provided immediately.",

He was already at the hospital one hour after his arrest, prior to which he had been examined by a nurse and his head had been bandaged.

In the Government\u2019s opinion the minor nature of his injury and the maliciousness of his claims was proved by the fact that the very next evening the fourth applicant committed a misdemeanour by violating public order in the course of the mass disorder (see paragraph 29 above).",

When during the riots thousands of people were gathered in a small area and were behaving aggressively, it was extremely likely that they would hurt each other. Therefore, there was no proof that there had been inhuman or degrading treatment of the applicants by the police. In addition, none of the applicants had a health problem qualifying as inhuman or degrading treatment. The fifth applicant\u2019s fractured arm had been the only somewhat more serious injury, but as no proof of police responsibility for the injury had been found, this could not be considered a violation of Article 3 by the State.",

In their complaints or subsequent appeals they referred to pertinent provisions of the Penal Code (see paragraph 48 above). Having regard to the fact that physical abuse, torture, abuse of authority and unlawful treatment of prisoners or persons in detention or custody indeed constituted criminal offences under the Penal Code, the Court does not consider the applicants\u2019 choice of procedure in the circumstances of the present case unreasonable, regard also being had to the fact that in some cases the applicants\u2019 complaints were forwarded to the prosecuting authorities by the Chancellor of Justice. The applicants thereby sought the punishment of those they believed to be guilty of criminal conduct towards them. In the Court\u2019s view the applicants were not required to embark on another set of proceedings before the administrative courts which served substantially the same purpose. It is not the Court\u2019s task to assess in the abstract whether administrative court proceedings would have offered them better prospects of success. The Court finds that, given the nature of the applicants\u2019 complaints, it cannot be said that they chose an inappropriate remedy (see also Julin v.

The major riots took place late in the evening and at night. They involved assaults against police officers, vandalising public and private property and looting businesses. Conflicts also occurred between private individuals present in the city centre \u2013 there were fights in the streets and one person was stabbed to death (see, respectively, paragraphs 35 and 13 above). The authorities resorted to the use of force in order to quell the disorder. The Court further observes that while there was no formal ban on visiting the city centre, the authorities widely disseminated their appeal to the people to stay at home, in an apparent attempt to put an end to the disorder and calm down the situation. The events were also widely covered by the media, so that at least during the second and third nights of the riots hardly anyone could be seen as having been taken by surprise by the rioting situation and the force used in response by the law-enforcement agencies.

The Court further notes that according to the statements of Zh., the first applicant\u2019s friend together with whom he was arrested and detained, the first applicant had been told to squat. It appears that it was only when he had failed to comply with this order and had challenged the authority of the person in charge that he was forced to the floor (see paragraph 18 above). The Court observes, in this context, that the number of persons arrested over the three days of the riots was 1,160 (see paragraph 13 above) surpassing the number of police officers on duty (see paragraph 12 above). The forces tasked with keeping order in the temporary detention facilities were scarce. Indeed, according to the first applicant\u2019s submissions in his complaints to the domestic authorities, there were 200, and later 350, detainees in the Dterminal warehouse, with just twenty-five police officers keeping order (see paragraph 47 above). When the detainees, who outnumbered law-enforcement officers tenfold, made an attempt at collective disobedience, additional forces were brought in to put an end to the rebellious behaviour and force the detainees down (ibid., see also K.\u2019s statements in paragraph 34 above). The Court also notes that in his domestic statements the first applicant did not mention being personally hit with truncheons; nor was this alleged in Zh.\u2019s statements to the Court (see paragraph 18 above). As regards the medical evidence, the Court notes that according to the medical report the first applicant had a haematoma and was diagnosed with pelvic contusion in the right side of the lumbo-sacral region (see paragraph\u00a017 above). The Court observes that no other bruises or further injuries that would match the applicant\u2019s description of being beaten and kicked were described in the medical report. Rather, it would appear that the applicant\u2019s injuries resulted from him being forced on to the floor following his unruly behaviour.

According to the fourth applicant his arm had been hit by a rubber bullet and he had been hit on the head with a truncheon and also hit on the knee (see paragraph 26 above). It observes that the applicant\u2019s medical examination in hospital within the hour identified only a haematoma on his skull (see paragraph 27 above). There is no information concerning injuries caused by the applicant\u2019s allegedly being hit by a rubber bullet and struck on the knee. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the use of force against him are not supported by any witness statements or other pertinent evidence. The written statements of N.R., submitted to the Court, present a general description of the situation in  at the material time, without personally mentioning the fourth applicant. According to N.R., the law-enforcement officers had ordered the people to step back or lie down and force was used against those who resisted. In N.R.\u2019s submissions, in some cases people were hit while on the ground and even if already bound (see paragraph 28 above). However, the Court notes that the fourth applicant did not allege that he was hit when he had already been immobilised. The fourth applicant\u2019s submissions, considered in the context of the statements of N.R. about the general situation, do not allow the conclusion to be drawn that the force used in respect of the fourth applicant was excessive. The Court has also had regard to the Government\u2019s submissions, which state that the fourth applicant was fined in misdemeanour proceedings for a breach of public order committed late in the evening of the following day (28 April 2007, the third day of the riots, see paragraph 29 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion the latter fact is indicative of the relative lack of seriousness of the fourth applicant\u2019s injury, as well as of his behaviour in general during the nights of rioting.

In his submissions he had been kicked to the ground and hit on the head with truncheons and also kicked in the head (see paragraph 30 above). According to him his arm was broken when he tried to protect his head. The Court observes that neither Z. nor K. mentioned the fifth applicant having been kicked in the head although both of them confirmed that he had been hit on the head with truncheons, having already been forced to the ground (see paragraphs\u00a033 and 34 above). According to the medical certificate, the fifth applicant was diagnosed with a fractured forearm (see paragraph 31 above). The medical certificate does not mention any other injuries he could have sustained, whether to his head or other parts of his body, when he was allegedly hit with truncheons and kicked. Thus, the Court cannot but conclude that the fifth applicant\u2019s arm was broken as a result of the use of force by the law- enforcement officers. The Court further considers that the probable circumstances of the fifth applicant\u2019s sustaining the injury in question do not appear to have justified the extent of the force used. Even if it may have been necessary to continue the use of force in respect of individuals already forced to the ground in order to immobilise and handcuff them, the Court notes that in the present instance three officers appear to have been engaged in taking control over the fifth applicant. This predominance appears to have been sufficient to overpower the fifth applicant\u2019s resistance, if any, without having recourse to such a degree of force as was apparently used in the present case.",

After being apprehended he was taken to a court building where there were many people, some of whom were standing facing the wall and some were on the floor, as described in the seventh applicant\u2019s complaints to the domestic authorities (see paragraph 47 above). This description appears to correspond to a corridor or some other large open space, as only after the end of the subsequent physical confrontation was the seventh applicant taken to a cell (see paragraphs 40 and 42 above). Furthermore, it appears that the seventh applicant, who had been ordered to stand against the wall, started \u201cstretching\u201d his legs and questioning the length of the detainees\u2019 placement in this situation. It was then that he was abruptly forced on the floor. According to the seventh applicant he was hit on the head (see paragraphs 40 and 47 above). However, in the statements of R. no hitting on the head is mentioned (see paragraph 42 above). As regards hitting in the genitals, alleged by the applicant in his submissions to the Court and in R.\u2019s statements (see paragraphs 40 and 42 above), the Court notes that in his domestic complaints the seventh applicant made no mention of that (see paragraph 47 above). According to the medical report the seventh applicant had an abrasion on the right side of his face and a small abrasion on his forehead. While he also complained of severe pain in his right thigh, there were no signs of any trauma (see paragraph 41 above). In the context of the seventh applicant\u2019s arrest under suspicion of a breach of public order indicating at least a certain degree of aggressiveness on his part, the presence of a large number of detained persons in the room of the court-house where the detainees were being held, his movements and vocal expressions which apparently gave the law-enforcement officers grounds to believe that he was about to display a degree of insubordination, and also considering the relatively minor injuries he sustained, blows to the genitals and in the head having been disproved by the medical report, the Court is unable to conclude that excessive force was used to immobilise the seventh applicant.",

In addition, the first, fourth, fifth and seventh applicants submitted medical reports to substantiate their allegations. The fifth applicant also provided the names and personal details of two individuals who had witnessed his arrest, and the seventh applicant identified one person as a witness. The district prosecutor\u2019s office declined to initiate criminal proceedings, and the applicants\u2019 appeals against these decisions were dismissed by the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Tallinn Court of Appeal. The authorities found that there was not sufficient evidence to support the applicants\u2019 allegations, and that the use of force by the police officers had been lawful. The Court notes, however, that the authorities made no attempt to obtain any additional evidence, be it by questioning the applicants in person in order to obtain more detailed information about their version of the events in addition to their written complaints, or by interviewing the witnesses referred to by the fifth and seventh applicants. Nor does it appear that the authorities sought any additional information about the events complained of from other possible sources, such as police files or any photos or video recordings of the events. The Court is aware of the difficulties involved in quelling large-scale violence and investigating alleged abuses of power in such circumstances. However, the Court is not convinced that the authorities made every reasonable effort to collect evidence in the present case. The Court notes in this context that the first and seventh applicants also complained about their treatment in detention, that is in circumstances where an attempt to identify potential witnesses or to obtain any recordings of security cameras that might have been present in the premises concerned would have had more prospects of success, compared to the events that had taken place during the clashes in the streets. Furthermore, in the case of the fourth applicant, the medical staff who gave him first aid and transported him to hospital could potentially have served as witnesses. Indeed, it would appear that the authorities\u2019 response to the applicants\u2019 complaints was limited to stating that there was not sufficient evidence to support the applicants\u2019 allegations, and no further investigation was undertaken at all.",

All the applicants apart from the second applicant had been arrested between 9.30 p.m. and 2. a.m., that is late in the evening or at night.

In view of the particular situation at the time, there had been reasonable suspicion that anyone present at the site of the mass disorder could have a connection with the offences which had been or were being committed. As the applicants had been present in this area and had not left, despite being instructed to do so, there was a basis for their detention and for their identity to be checked. As the primary task of the police was to restore order in the area of the riots in general, and there were also thousands of people present in the area, immediate identification had not been possible; in the interests of a speedy solution they had been taken away from the area of the disorder and identified in places of detention. When the situation had calmed down and after the identity of the detained persons had been established, and when it had become clear that they no longer posed a danger to public order, they had been released at the earliest opportunity.

According to the Court\u2019s case-law in the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact already been used, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, for example, Akdivar and Others v.

However, it observes that the arrests and detentions during the April events were part of a major police operation aimed at quelling the large-scale rioting that lasted for several days, and as such can hardly be seen as an arbitrary exercise of authority or unlawful deprivation of liberty within the meaning of the criminal law. According to the official sources referred to by the applicants, 1,160 people were arrested during the April events; sixty-five criminal cases were opened, involving 300 suspects, mostly concerning serious breaches of public order and disregard of lawful orders (see paragraph 13 above). The Court notes that there is no information as to how far the 1,160 people arrested and the 300 suspects in criminal cases overlapped. However, having regard to the ratio of the people in respect of whom criminal proceedings were initiated to those arrested, the Court is unable to conclude, in the circumstances, that the arrests were arbitrary and unlawful and could be considered prima facie criminal offences committed by the police officers involved. Therefore, it cannot agree that a criminal complaint could be considered a remedy with a reasonable prospect of success in the present case. The Court finds force in the Government\u2019s argument that any deficiencies in the legal basis and procedure related to the arrests and detentions in question \u2013 which in broad terms, no doubt, pursued the aims of national security, public safety and prevention of crime \u2013 should have been addressed either in administrative court proceedings or in complaints procedures within criminal or misdemeanour proceedings in cases where such proceedings had been initiated in respect of the persons concerned.
