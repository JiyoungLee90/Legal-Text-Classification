On the other hand, it considers that the major delays were caused by the domestic courts. In particular, it notes the unexplained periods of procedural inactivity between 25 November 2002 and 8 April 2004 (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above) and the period of the examination of the case by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 13 above). As to the legislative measures referred to by the Government, they were introduced in February 2007, while the Supreme Court examined the case in November 2006 (see Marchenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a024857/07, \u00a7 30, 10 February 2011). As to the period during which the proceedings were suspended, the Court notes that the civil courts eventually decided not to wait until the outcome of the criminal proceedings, which finalized on 17 November 2001, and resumed their own proceedings already on 5 September 2001 (see paragraphs 6 and 8 above).
