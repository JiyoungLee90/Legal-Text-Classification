The interference was made pursuant to a remedy requested by a State organ, which was not a party to the proceedings (see Roseltrans v. Russia, no. 60974/00, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 27, 21 July 2005). In addition, the public prosecutor had full discretion in deciding whether to lodge the legality review request with the Supreme Court (see Lepoji\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no.\u00a013909/05, \u00a7\u00a054, 6\u00a0November 2007, and Dimitrovska v. the  (dec.), no. 21466/03, 30\u00a0September\u00a02008).
