The court came to the conclusion that the proposed repeal would be contrary to the principles of legal certainty and minimal restrictions on human rights as women would lose preferential treatment whereas men would not receive the same benefits.

Firstly, the extensive development of the economy necessitated the full involvement of women in the labour process. Secondly, under the Communist regime, women were primarily responsible for the functioning of families and almost entirely responsible for children. In that period, the foundations for the family model (persisting until the present time) were laid; under that model, women were expected to work on a fulltime basis and at the same time to take care of children and the household. As a result of the combination of those two factors, mothers found themselves under an enormous burden. At the same time, the then legislature took into account the biological perspective because the child-raising requirement set forth in the Act implied from the outset not only the care of the child but also pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding and so on.",

It thus aimed to rectify the inequalities between the social roles of the two sexes in the family and to redress the imbalance created by maternity, which would always constitute a certain disadvantage for mothers in the labour market. Since those disadvantages stemmed from the biological differences between women and men, the Government submitted that the measure challenged by the applicant appeared to be objectively and reasonably justified for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention.",

The lowering of the male pensionable age in relation to the number of children raised would lead to a considerable increase in the expenditure of the Czech Social Security Administration and to an unavoidable increase in the caseload of the courts, which would have to devise a very complicated system for checking which of the parents actually took care of children and was therefore eligible for the lowered retirement age.

Yet it is difficult to pinpoint any particular moment when the unfairness to men begins to outweigh the need to correct the disadvantaged position of women by means of affirmative action. The reluctance of certain political parties and trade unions to support the equalisation of the pension scheme may be indicative in this regard (see paragraph 23 above). The Court cannot but reiterate that the national authorities are better placed than an international judge to determine such a complex issue relating to economic and social policies, which depends on manifold domestic variables and direct knowledge of the society concerned, and that they have to enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere.",

As a consequence the pensionable age is the same for women born after 1968 who have raised no children or one child as the pensionable age for men born after 1968. Women who have raised two or more children continue to have their pensionable age lowered. Nonetheless, the pension reform seems to be heading towards an overall increase in the pensionable age, taking no account of the number of children raised by either women or men (see paragraphs 40-42 above).",

However, the demographic shifts and changes in perceptions of the roles of the sexes are by their nature gradual and, after forty-five years of the existence of the measure at stake, it is necessary to time the amendment accordingly. Therefore, the State cannot be criticised for progressively modifying its pension system to reflect these gradual changes (see also paragraph 51 above) and for not having pushed for complete equalisation at a faster pace. Indeed, the respondent Government have to choose from among different methods of equalising the retirement age. This task is even more demanding and deserves well-thought-out solutions since the State has to place this reform in the wider context of other demographic shifts, such as the ageing of the population or migration, which also warrant adjustment of the welfare system, while preserving the foreseeability of this system for the persons concerned who are obliged to contribute to it.",

However, unlike the pension scheme, parental leave is a short-term measure which does not affect the entire lives of members of society. It is related to today's life of those concerned whereas the pension age reflects and compensates for inequalities of former times. In the Court's opinion, the amendments of the parental leave system referred to in the case of Konstantin Markin do not involve changes to the subtle balance of the pension system, do not have serious financial ramifications and do not alter long-term planning, as might be the case with the pension system, which forms a part of national economic and social strategies.",

In view of the time-demanding pension reform which is still ongoing in the Czech Republic, the Court is not convinced that the timing and the extent of the measures undertaken by the Czech authorities to rectify the inequality in question have been so manifestly unreasonable as to exceed the wide margin of appreciation allowed in such a field (see Stec\u00a0and\u00a0Others, judgment cited above, \u00a7 66).",
