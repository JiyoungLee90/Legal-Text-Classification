Article 2 of the 1944 Decree had never been formally abrogated and it was referred to by courts and administrative authorities in their decisions. However, it was not a decisive factor in assessing whether this provision was still in force. The decisive factor was that it could no longer provide the basis for any substantive changes in ownership. The courts, when referring to this provision, did not apply it in the strict sense of that term; the reference to this provision was merely of a secondary nature and was used to decide whether that provision had been applied, during the expropriation proceedings conducted in the past, in a manner which had flagrantly violated the law (in which case an expropriation decision had to be declared null and void).

However, there was no reply to her complaints and no decisions determining the substance of her complaints were given by the competent administrative authority. In the absence of such decisions, it was not open to the applicant to have recourse to the subsequent hierarchical complaint to the . In addition, the applicant made another complaint on 11 April 2011. The Minister subsequently held that it was ill-founded (paragraph 15). In this connection, it is to be noted that the excessive length of the proceedings in this particular case was not entirely due to inactivity on the part of the administrative authorities but was to a great extent caused by changes and discrepancies arising in the judicial practice as to jurisdiction competent to deal with restitution cases (see paragraphs 8 and 13 above). In these circumstances the Court does not consider that the applicant should have lodged a further complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court in order to fulfil her obligation under Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1.",

However, the Court observes that\u00a0the\u00a0proceedings complained of lasted over eleven years, from 1999 to\u00a02012.

However, the Court is of the view that for the purposes of the present case it is not necessary to examine this part of the application and to assess whether the discrepancies in judicial practice referred to by the applicant had implication for her access to court. It notes that in her case the Minister acting as the highest administrative authority competent to examine the case quashed his previous decision, relying on the resolution of the  that it was for the administrative authorities to examine restitution cases (see paragraph 14 above). It further notes that the applicant subsequently obtained an administrative decision in her favour (see paragraph 17 above) which was ultimately upheld by the Minister.
