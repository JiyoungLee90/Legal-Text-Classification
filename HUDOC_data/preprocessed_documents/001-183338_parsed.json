In his written statement the applicant alleged that on 27 February 2011 at 9.15 a.m. he had been trying to familiarise himself with the ATM in case he would ever need to use his own cards and check the balance of his account. He had, inter alia, a credit card in his name on him and EUR 10,000, which had been given to him by his lawyer at the time, C.H. This was the cash bail that had been returned from the court in another case against him. At 9.20 a.m. he had been suddenly attacked from behind by someone who had been wearing a helmet and who he had not recognised. This person had not identified himself. The applicant had thought that it had been a robbery. This person had choked him from behind. The applicant had been scared and had defended himself. He had then been attacked by a second person in civilian attire. They had started hitting the applicant on the head and the back with a small wooden stick. The applicant had fallen to the ground and lost consciousness. The officers had woken him up by throwing water on his face. He had woken up in a brown jeep, handcuffed. He had then realised that he had been intercepted by the police. The officers had slapped and punched him on the face and body all the way to the police station. They had been asking him about money and credit cards but had not asked him to identify himself. Nor had they shown him any documents in respect of his arrest and informed him of his rights. They had taken everything he had had on him including his asthma inhalers. They had refused to allow him to talk to his lawyer or with an official from the Canadian embassy. He had been taken to the station at approximately 10 a.m. He had been received by the head of the police, \u201cMr\u00a0Y.\u201d, an officer acting as an interviewer, \u201cMr M.\u201d, and two other officers \u201cMr P.\u201d and \u201cMr A.\u201d. In the interview room there had been officers of the CPS and another officer, \u201cV.\u201d. Officer M. had asked him questions. The applicant had refused to reply, saying that he would do so only in the presence of his lawyer. At that point the officer who had attacked him at the ATM had started beating and \u201ctorturing\u201d him while he had been unable to defend himself, as he had still been in handcuffs. He had kept asking them to stop and let him contact his lawyer. They had continued to punch and beat him using the same small wooden stick used before (he clarified that this had been a small baseball bat). He had asked for his asthma inhalers and tried to tell them that he had had back surgery. He had been very scared and had started breathing heavily. They had hit him on the back and on his right knee with a metallic chair with blue handles. They had beaten him with that chair and kicked him savagely on the head while asking him questions. The applicant stated that he had lost consciousness for a while and he had woken up after water had been thrown on his face.",

He had fallen to the floor again with his hands behind his back. One of the officers had stood on his handcuffs while another one had kicked him. Because of the kicks to the head the applicant had become very dizzy, bleeding from his face, nose and mouth. His front tooth had broken from the punches. He had also had a small asthma attack. Although Officer M. had not physically abused him he had not intervened to stop the ill-treatment. Two female officers of the ECID had also witnessed his ill-treatment. The applicant said that he had asked the head of the police to take him to hospital but he had refused. At around 3 p.m. they had taken him to the detention facility in the station. His lawyer had come to visit him and when he had seen the state of him he had made a complaint of ill-treatment to the officers and asked that the applicant be taken immediately to hospital. During his transfer to the hospital the applicant had been punched by one of the two police officers who had been escorting him. The officer had also threatened that his boss Mr Y. would put him in prison if he did not withdraw his complaint. When he had arrived at the hospital at 3.30 pm. one of the officers had lied to the doctor and had told him that he had fallen on his face. The other police officer had then taken the doctor aside and talked to him alone. The doctor had refused to give him painkillers. He had only given those when the Canadian Consul had come to visit him.",

These included, inter alia, photographs from the area near the ATM, CCTV footage from the bank relating to the day of the alleged ill-treatment, copies from police diaries kept at the police station and the record of the criminal proceedings before the District Court of Limassol and the Supreme Court.",

It was not clear whether the injuries had been the result of ill-treatment by the police or whether they could have been caused upon arrest and/or during his detention. None of the medical reports, including that of the private practitioner, had concluded that the applicant\u2019s injuries had been caused by ill-treatment or that they could have been inflicted in the manner alleged by the applicant. This left open the possibility that the applicant\u2019s injuries had been caused during arrest or even when the applicant had fallen to the ground and in circumstances in which the force used had been reasonable. This had indeed been the conclusion drawn by the president of the IAIACAP in his report of 16 November 2011. It would therefore be presumptive to conclude that the injuries had been the result of ill-treatment or the use of disproportionate force (referring to Dzeladinov and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 13252/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a067-68, 10 April 2008). Moreover, apart from the applicant\u2019s statement and the medical report recording that the applicant had a broken tooth, none of the witnesses had been able to state whether the applicant\u2019s tooth had already been broken on arrival at the police station. In this regard, the Government observed that Special Constable G.S. had stated that the applicant had fallen and hit his face on the ground in his attempt to flee arrest; therefore the possibility that the applicant\u2019s tooth had broken when he had fallen could not be excluded.",

The applicant complained of pain during the examination of the movement of his right knee; and sensitivity in the upper thoracic vertebra and the upper lumbar spine (see paragraph 23 above). Dr C.T. ascertained that the applicant had marks from blows mainly on his chest and face (see\u00a0paragraph 24 above).",

The administrative investigation was an internal police investigation ordered by the Limassol divisional police headquarters which appointed a police officer from another police station in Limassol to carry out enquiries into the applicant\u2019s complaint (see\u00a0paragraph 31 above). The officer was therefore part of the same substructure of the police force as the suspects and other police officers implicated in the events. In essence, he was investigating the activities of his colleagues. The final decisions on the case came from the Limassol divisional police headquarters and the Chief of Police (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a039\u00a0above). The investigation therefore lacked the necessary appearance of independence (see, for example, Mihhailov v. Estonia, no.\u00a064418/10, \u00a7 128, 30 August 2016 with further references). Indeed, the investigators in the second IAIACAP investigation observed in their report that this was problematic and complaints should from the very beginning be transferred to the IAIACAP, which was an independent authority (see\u00a0paragraph 79 above).",

The investigator failed to ask the officers about the applicant\u2019s injuries and how they had happened.

This would not only have ensured that he would have been fit for questioning in police custody but would also have enabled the respondent Government to discharge their burden of providing a plausible explanation for those injuries (see, inter alia, Parnov v.

In this connection, the Court notes that a medical examination, together with the right of access to a lawyer and the right to inform a third party of the detention, constitute fundamental safeguards against the ill-treatment of detained persons which should apply from the very outset of deprivation of liberty (see the 2nd General Report of the European Committee for Prevention of Torture, CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 - Rev.\u00a02006, \u00a7 36). The Court also points out that the investigators in the second investigation in their report reproached Inspector I.S for not having ordered photographs to be taken of the applicant\u2019s injuries upon his arrival at the station (see paragraph 78 above).
