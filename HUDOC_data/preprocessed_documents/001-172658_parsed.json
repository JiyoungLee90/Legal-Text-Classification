Referring to police reports, an on-site examination, witness testimonies, decisions on seizure and examinations of various exhibits, the court agreed with the prosecution concerning the reasonable suspicion. It held that pre-trial detention was necessary because the applicant had fled from the police and then turned himself in, but only to avoid criminal liability. Indeed, there was a considerable risk of his absconding. Furthermore, there was evidence that he had tried to influence witnesses to procure an alibi, since the witnesses he had suggested had given false statements about his whereabouts during the robbery. Considering that there was another criminal investigation ongoing against the applicant on a charge of abduction of vehicle and the fact that he had no regular income or employment, there was also a risk of his reoffending. However, the authorities had not disclosed any evidence supporting the applicant\u2019s actual involvement in the robbery.",

The court maintained its previous reasons justifying the need for his detention and emphasised that the investigation regarding a third suspect was still ongoing, so that if released the applicant might jeopardise the procedure. The court took into account that an arrest warrant had had to be issued for the applicant, who was otherwise unemployed, had no apparent source of income and who was also the subject of another criminal investigation. The court held that there was a risk of his absconding (owing to the severity of the possible punishment), reoffending (owing to his unsettled personal circumstances) and interfering with the investigation (if he were to collude with the third suspect).

As regards the specific grounds of his pre-trial detention, the court no longer referred to the fact that he had fled, since he had then voluntarily appeared before the police. It did however repeat the other reasons. To show that there was a risk of his reoffending, the court noted that prior to the opening of the investigations, the applicant had only been employed for a short period of five months, that he had not been living with his parents but probably with some friends, that on 3\u00a0May 2013 he had already been sentenced for the offence of larceny, and that currently he was under investigation in yet another criminal case on a charge of abduction of vehicle.

It considered that the applicant\u2019s absconding for two weeks and failed attempt to secure a false alibi, which both occurred at the beginning of the proceedings, could not be held against him when assessing the future risks if he was released. It also noted that the investigation was almost at an end and, in view of the nature of the investigatory steps yet to be carried out, it found it implausible that the applicant could interfere with its outcome. The High Court therefore held that neither the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding nor his interfering with the investigation was real. However, noting the other pending case conducted against the applicant and his failed attempt to have secured a false alibi and, moreover, considering the \u201cprofessional\u201d nature of the crime and his unsettled personal circumstances, the court held that the most severe coercive measure should continue to be applied on account of the risk of his reoffending.",

Luxembourg, no. 30460/13, \u00a7 79, 9 April 2015). However, this legitimate goal cannot be pursued at the expense of substantial restrictions on the rights of the defence. Therefore, information which is essential for the assessment of the lawfulness of a detention should be made available in an appropriate manner to the suspect\u2019s lawyer (see Garcia Alva v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a023541/94, \u00a7\u00a7 42, 13 February 2001).

Thus, any restrictions on the right of the detainee or his representative to have access to documents in the case file forming the basis of the prosecution case against him must be strictly necessary in the light of a strong countervailing public interest. Where full disclosure is not possible, Article 5 \u00a7 4 requires that the difficulties this causes are counterbalanced in such a way that the individual still has a possibility effectively to challenge the allegations against him (see Piechowicz v.
