However, the applicant, who followed the hearing from a detention facility in  by video link, attempted to refuse her assistance on the grounds that he had never met that counsel other than through the video link immediately before the start of the hearing. It had been noted by the Supreme Court that despite the guarantee of confidentiality of communication with Ms A. offered to the applicant at the beginning of the hearing (which was achieved by ordering everyone out of the courtroom in ), the applicant insisted that he would not accept counsel he had not met in person. The Supreme Court also noted that the applicant had not requested replacement counsel or leave to retain one privately and concluded that the applicant's refusal had been unreasonable, confirming his representation by Ms A.",

The Court considers that the lack of personal contact with the applicant at the hearing and the absence of any discussion with him in advance of the hearing, combined with the fact that she had to plead the case on the basis of the points of appeal lodged five years earlier by another lawyer, reduced Ms A.'s appearance at the appeal hearing to a mere formality.",

However we cannot agree with the majority's conclusion that the applicant's rights under Article 6 of the Convention \u201cin the earlier proceedings\u201d (paragraph 52) were not sufficiently redressed. Indeed, we do not look at the trial as a whole. In our view, the authorities properly redressed the shortcomings of the appeal proceedings that led to the judgment of 31 October 2002, but they committed a new violation of Article\u00a06 during the proceedings held after the quashing, as presented in paragraphs 21 to 25 of the judgment. This approach was taken by the Court, for example, in the case of Ponushkov v. Russia (no. 30209/04, 6 November 2008). It is in the interest of the subsidiary nature of the system established under the European Convention of Human Rights that national authorities are to be encouraged to redress procedural shortcomings at domestic level.",
