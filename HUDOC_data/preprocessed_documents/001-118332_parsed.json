In their decisions, the domestic courts repeatedly relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, the serious nature of the offences, the complexity of the case which involved many individuals and the risk that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings, for example, by inducing witnesses to give false testimony. The domestic courts considered the latter argument particularly relevant in light of the fact that the penalty which the applicant faced was severe. In addition, the domestic courts invoked the difficulties in obtaining evidence, including from abroad, and the need to examine several hundred witnesses and many accounting, tax and auditing experts.

However, in the present case the Government offered no explanation as to why it was necessary on these three occasions to require the applicant and his close family members to be separated by a physical barrier. In particular, no arguments have been adduced regarding the legitimacy of the aim pursued, nor as regards the necessity of imposing the measure on these specific occasions. The Court can but note that such measure had never been imposed during any of the other twenty-nine visits. The Court finds it difficult to discern any coherent pattern of application of the above-mentioned restrictions and considers that they have been applied by the domestic authorities in an arbitrary and random manner. For these reasons alone, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life has been breached.",
