The authorities have to show a certain level of tolerance, irrespective of the legality of a gathering. The Government argued that there had been several warnings, and the level of force used was only gradually increased, once it was clear that the people present were not willing to disperse. Moreover, the Government argued that the demonstrators had begun to march towards . Further, the representatives of the trade unions were able to make a press statement, and they decided to disperse. The applicants did not respond to the Government\u2019s observations in the form required by Rule\u00a034\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Rules of Court.

The level of force used in the dispersion was such that it could have had a chilling effect on the applicants and other participants in the assemblies.

A demonstration is not, at least in the typical case, an occasional coming together of randomly participating individuals. Thirdly, the freedom of assembly of the applicant organisations has been breached directly and indirectly in view of their trade union status. Trade unions have a right to represent members without a specific mandate in matters related to the functions of the given union. A trade union must be considered to be entitled to act in its own name as well as on behalf of its members and represent their rights. In the present case, to celebrate Labour Day and commemorate friends of the trade union and its members who had lost their lives during the demonstrations of 1 May 1977 clearly entered into the general mandate of the two trade unions concerned.",

In other words, where a court establishes that there has been a breach of an international obligation by a State, it must assess how best that breach should be repaired. This is a different question from that of establishing whether there has been a violation. Normally, any violation would give rise to some award of damages. It is only in highly exceptional circumstances that the Court may decide not to award moral damages if, in its opinion, various relevant factual circumstances preclude such an award.
