In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).
