As to the inmates who had been taken to the main block, according to the officials, they had incited the hunger strike and would not be detained in that prison any longer. The remaining prisoners from block no. 7 were then taken to work in the workshop, from where they could see the entrance to the high security wing. They saw around fifty officers wearing masks running inside. The officers\u2019 appearance and equipment suggested that they belonged to a special forces unit.

In that room an official from the Prisons Department started a speech in general terms. About two minutes later special forces unit officers wearing masks stormed into the room and commanded everybody to lie on the floor with their faces down and with their hands behind their heads. Mass beating followed. According to Mr O., he witnessed the officers knock the ninth applicant\u2019s teeth out. The floor and the walls of the room were covered with blood. The inmates were handcuffed and dragged out to the corridor, where they had to pass between two lines of officers constantly hitting and kicking them. The prisoners were then loaded into a van and taken to the checkpoint. Once there they were taken to the shower premises and strip-searched. The beating continued. After a body search, the prisoners were again thrown into the van, with their hands still handcuffed, and taken to Rivne SIZO. Upon their arrival there, they were beaten again and forced to sign waivers of any complaints. Mr O. was released three days later, having served his sentence in full.",

He submitted that the sixth applicant had been among the prisoners beaten in Izyaslav Prison on 22 January 2007. According to him, the sixth applicant had only received a copy of the ruling of 7 February 2007 on 11 July 2008. The lawyer contended that the Shepetivka Prosecutor could not be regarded as an independent and impartial authority, because according to paragraph 58 of the Internal Regulations of Penal Institutions approved by Order no. 275 of 25\u00a0December 2003 (see paragraph 200 below), he had been supposed to be notified of the search of 22 January 2007 and to supervise its implementation. The lawyer also claimed that the investigation had been superficial. He noted, in particular, that the first, the third, the fourth, the tenth, the sixteenth and the eighteenth applicants had also complained to various authorities about the alleged mass beating on 22 January 2007, but that their complaints, as well as the complaints of the sixth applicant, had remained without due consideration. He further submitted that the impugned ruling of 7 February 2007 had been based on statements by the prisoners which had later been retracted by them as having been obtained under duress (such as, for example, that of the tenth applicant). The prosecution authorities had failed to ensure the safety of the prisoners in question, who had continued to be intimidated and ill-treated after the events of 22 January 2007. He noted that the fourth applicant had been so scared that he had denied any force having been applied to him, even though there was a medical certificate in the file proving the opposite. The investigation had not covered the alleged ill-treatment of all the prisoners concerned, including the first, the third, the fourth, the tenth, the sixteenth and the eighteenth applicants, who had also raised similar complaints.",

Thus, the sixth applicant\u2019s allegations had been supported by detailed accounts of the events by the first, the third, the fourth, the sixteenth, and the eighteenth applicants, whose written statements were in the case file but which had remained without assessment. The allegation that the prisoners had been intimidated had not been considered at all. No attempts had been made to clarify whether the prisoners who had been injured according to the official reports had actually demonstrated any resistance to the authorities as stated in those reports. According to the search reports, no forbidden items had been discovered on those persons. So, there had been no apparent reasons for them to show any resistance. Furthermore, while it was acknowledged that some prisoners had been injured, the information in the official reports about the use of physical force and the nature of the injuries in question did not reconcile. Thus, for example, according to the reports regarding the fourth and the eighteenth applicants, physical force and handcuffing had been applied to them. At the same time, the medical examination reports had noted that the fourth applicant had suffered bruises on the right and the left buttocks and on one thigh; the eighteenth applicant had suffered a bruise on the left shoulder blade and the left buttock. The nature of the physical force applied had never been analysed. Lastly, the lawyer contended that the court had ignored the fact that the prosecution authorities had relied exclusively on the documents issued by the prison administration.",

Several prisoners were later transferred to eight facilities across the country, the [State Prisons Department] threatened to extend their prison sentences, and family members of protest leaders received threats. Human rights groups have appealed to the GPO for an investigation, but there were no reports of action taken at year\u2019s end.

It notes that their initial examination took place in Khmelnytskyy SIZO, whose staff had been directly involved in the search and security operation complained of (see paragraphs\u00a018, 129 and 134 above). Furthermore, the applicants alleged that they had been subjected to continuous ill-treatment in that SIZO and their complaints in that regard were never investigated. As to the forensic medical examination of 30 January 2007, the Court has already concluded that it was superficial and cannot be fully relied on (see paragraphs\u00a0266-270 and 276 above). Even assuming that those five applicants indeed had no visible injuries on 30 January 2007, as stated in their forensic medical examination reports (see paragraph 136 above), more than a week had elapsed since the impugned operation, meaning that, depending on their severity, the injuries could have healed in the interval.

Moldova, no.\u00a041088/05, \u00a7 109, 11 July 2006).

France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 102, ECHR 1999V). And, of course, the consequences of any intimidation, or indeed any other form of non-physical abuse, would in any event have left no visible trace (see Hajnal v.

However, as was later acknowledged by the authorities, it was the prisoners\u2019 mass hunger strike in protest at the conditions of their detention and the administration\u2019s wrongdoing that prompted this operation (see paragraphs 115, 122, 149 and 157 above).",

It considers credible the applicants\u2019 submission that its officers had been wearing masks. The Court notes that it was a paramilitary formation equipped and trained for carrying out, in particular, antiterrorist operations. The Court has already established, including through a fact-finding mission, in the case of Davydov and Others, cited above, that a similar security operation had earlier been carried out in Zamkova Prison (neighbouring Izyaslav Prison) with the involvement of officers from special forces units wearing masks. There is no indication, be it in the legislative framework in place or in administrative developments, of a change in that practice. Moreover, the legal provisions providing a basis for the existence of such a special forces unit were eventually repealed as running contrary to the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 222 above). In addition, the Court attaches weight to the categorical statement of the Ukrainian Ombudsman that \u201cthe practice of the use of special forces units [was] in fact systematic resort to torture\u201d (see paragraph 223 above).",

The Court next observes that the prisoners demonstrated willingness to cooperate with and trust towards the Prisons Department\u2019s officials, having terminated the hunger strike immediately after the creation of the special commission tasked with the investigation of their allegations (see paragraph 9 above). It is also noteworthy that the events took place in a minimum security level prison, where all the inmates were serving a first sentence in respect of minor or medium-severity criminal offences (see paragraphs 7 and 197 above).",

Having regard to the presence of the Prisons Department\u2019s officials who had previously started a dialogue with prisoners regarding their complaints, the inmates apparently expected the continuation of that dialogue (see paragraphs 9, 11 and 26 above). Instead, a group of masked paramilitaries stormed into the premises and \u201cconvinced\u201d the prisoners to waive any complaints altogether.

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see Shishkin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 18280/04, \u00a7 87, 7 July 2011, with further references).",
