Within the framework of the proceedings, the applicant was able to put forward all necessary arguments in defence of his interests, and the judicial authorities gave them due consideration. The Court further notes that the court proceedings in Mr Andrusenko\u2019s labour case lasted for three years and in the circumstances of the present case such length did not exceed the \"reasonable time\" requirement referred to in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In particular, there is no discernible period of inactivity which can be attributed to the domestic courts. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",
