The evidence given by witnesses B. and O., who carried out the first search of 24 May 2000, together with the fourth defendant T.J., shows that that search had not been detailed. The witnesses stated that they had not opened the glove compartment in the BMW vehicle at all and that the aim of that search had been to find money, arms and evidence of a crime. Since the search was conducted under the supervision of the fourth defendant, it is to be presumed that he 'neglected details'. Furthermore, even the defence, in submissions of 28 May 2000, stressed that the search of 24 May 2000 had only 'concerned a superficial examination of the inside of the vehicle, which meant that the search was to be continued'.",

However, there was no such atmosphere at the hearing during the investigation and the witness did not know then whether he would be called to the hearing and whether the first defendant would be indicted at all, and even then he pondered over whether or not he should reveal who the driver of the motorboat had reminded him of, using the words 'I might have told'.

They explained that the national courts, in establishing that the applicants had committed a bank robbery, relied to a significant degree on the fact that a plastic mould of a car lock belonging to a vehicle type VW Golf II which was found in the first applicant's vehicle had belonged to the Golf vehicle used in the commission of the bank robbery at issue. The fact that the plastic mould in question had been missing from the Golf vehicle was established during the search of that vehicle carried out by the police on 24 May 2000, without the applicants or their counsel being either informed of or present at that search. Furthermore, during the first search of the BMW vehicle belonging to the first applicant, also carried out on 24 May 2000, the plastic mould in question had not been found; it had only been found during the second search on 27 May 2000. However, it turned out that the police had, without authorisation and without the applicants or their counsel being informed or present, entered the BMW vehicle on 26 May 2000. The applicants argued that the circumstances surrounding the finding of the plastic mould in question in the first applicant's vehicle had cast serious doubts on the authenticity of these findings and indicated a possibility that the evidence in question had been planted by the police.",

The search of the VW Golf II vehicle in the morning of 24 May 2000 was carried out without the presence of the applicants or their counsel and it appears that they had not been informed of it.
