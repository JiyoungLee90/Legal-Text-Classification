That was consistent with the provisions of Article 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provided the same time-limit for lodging an appeal on points of law in a case like the present one. Moreover, both the Prosecutor\u2019s Office in its appeal application and the applicant in his submissions referred to Article 439. In so far as the Government refer to Article 422 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is noted that this provision refers only to decisions adopted by a court of appeal acting as a second-instance court. Since the B\u0103l\u021bi Court of Appeal acted as a first-instance court in the present case, Article 422 does not seem to be relevant.

The Court notes, moreover, that the explanatory judgment was adopted some ten months after the judgment of the B\u0103l\u021bi Court of Appeal and even three days after the judgment of the Supreme Court in the applicant\u2019s case.
