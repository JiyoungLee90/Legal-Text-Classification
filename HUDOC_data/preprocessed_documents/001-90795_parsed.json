Nevertheless, under Article 305 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, the courts could still have ruled on it despite their decision to discontinue the proceedings. Their failure to do so had prevented the applicant from claiming compensation from V.M., owing to the lapse of the civil limitation period.

On this point, it notes that the tort against the applicant was committed on 3 September 1992 (see paragraph 6 above), whereas he lodged his civilparty claim on 22 February 1999 (see paragraph 14 above), more than five years after that. Since under Bulgarian law the limitation period for tort claims is five years, it could be argued that at the time when he made his claim the applicant no longer had a \u201cright\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. However, the Court does not subscribe to that analysis, for three reasons. First, it appears that under national law as it stood when the applicant lodged his claim (see paragraph 31 above), the mere opening of criminal proceedings against the tortfeasor, V.M., had arguably stopped the running of the civil limitation period, with the result that the applicant\u2019s claim could be considered timely. The Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s later interpretative decision to the contrary did not remove retrospectively the arguability of the applicant\u2019s claim (see, mutatis mutandis, Yanakiev v. Bulgaria, no. 40476/98, \u00a7 58 in fine, 10 August 2006, citing Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2001V). Second, the criminal courts twice accepted the claim for examination without expressing any qualms about its timeliness (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above). Third, when the courts eventually failed to examine it by reason of their decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings, they did not say that it had been extinguished. The Court therefore concludes that Article 6 \u00a7 1 is applicable.",

It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. A limitation will furthermore not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 unless it pursues a legitimate aim and there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see, among many other authorities, McElhinney v.

Its role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of its application are compatible with the Convention (see Edificaciones March Gallego S.A. v. Spain, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I). In particular, the Court is not persuaded that it was arbitrary for the national courts to base their rulings about the applicable criminal limitation period on the legal characterisation of the offence given in the indictment drawn up by the public prosecutor. Likewise, the Court cannot subscribe to the applicant\u2019s assertion that these courts were under an obligation to examine his claim despite their decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings. Under the express terms of Article 64 \u00a7 3 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, in its versions both before and after June 2003, if the criminal proceedings were discontinued, this claim was not examined, but could be brought separately in a civil court.

But the applicant himself contributed considerably to the lapse of time by bringing his allegations to the attention of the prosecuting authorities not earlier than one year and five months after the events (paragraph 8 of the judgment), when he could only expect to succeed later on with a civil claim in case investigation and court proceedings would be terminated by a final judgment very speedily within the next one year and seven months. This was not the case.",

However, the Convention does not grant a right to have criminal proceedings instituted, and accordingly Article 6 \u00a7 1 was not applicable in the present case until the claim effectively had been lodged. At that time the prosecution was timebarred as the three years period had expired already in January 1995, (see paragraph 25 of the judgment). When lodging his claim the applicant, who was represented by counsel, must \u2013 or at least should \u2013 have been aware of this and that it was unlikely that the claim would be examined unless the charge was legally qualified as a more serious offence under the Criminal Code. This question is primarily for national courts to determine and as the majority has rightly stated there are no grounds for finding that they arbitrarily refused to qualify the charge in a different way.",
