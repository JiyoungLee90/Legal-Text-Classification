To mount a case against the applicant the authorities had to take evidence from a substantial number of witnesses and collect and examine a very significant volume of materials. The undoubted scale and complexity of the investigation were further compounded by the involvement of other suspects in the fraud. Having regard to these considerations and to the fact that the pre-trial investigation does not disclose any period of inertia on the part of the authorities, the length of this phase of the proceedings cannot be considered unreasonable. As to the applicant\u2019s contention that the investigation conducted by the investigating judge could have been expedited had he been able to question witnesses before the FIOD, it cannot be said with any certainty that this would have reduced significantly the length of the overall pre-trial phase, bearing in mind that it would in all probability have resulted in extending the length of the proceedings before the FIOD and would not necessarily have relieved the investigating judge of the need to examine witnesses.
