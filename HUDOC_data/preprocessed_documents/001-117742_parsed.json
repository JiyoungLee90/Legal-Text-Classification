In other words, the accused cannot maintain that he was acting in good faith. In this connection, the court observes that Mr Herv\u00e9 Eon is an activist and a former Socialist elected representative in the d\u00e9partement of Mayenne, who had recently fought a long-running campaign actively supporting a Turkish family residing unlawfully in national territory; several days before the head of State\u2019s visit to Laval, this political battle had ended in a resounding failure for the support committee as the family had been deported. Mr Eon explained to the court that at the time of the events he had been feeling bitter, to say the least. Accordingly, his political involvement (as corroborated by the fact that the accused called a senator as a witness) and the very nature of the phrase used, which was wholly premeditated, conclusively rule out any notion of good faith. The court will therefore endorse the reasoning of the first-instance judges, who found that the accused could not reasonably maintain that he had no intention of causing offence.",

A number of private members\u2019 bills to abolish the offence were tabled by members of the Senate or the National Assembly after the events in issue in the present case (for instance, the Bill introduced by Senator M\u00e9lenchon in November 2008, or the Bill registered with the Presidency of the National Assembly on 20 May 2010 and tabled by several of its members), the most recent one being registered with the Presidency of the Senate on 20 March 2012. In the explanatory memorandum the sponsor of the Bill (Mr Masson) stated: \u201c... in so far as all citizens can use the provisions of ordinary law concerning the offences of proffering insults or defamation, the offence of insulting the President has no purpose. Moreover, the offence is abnormally extensive in that it may apply to a mere political slur or rather harsh criticism. For these reasons, nearly all modern democracies have removed the notion of insulting the head of State from their criminal codes. Luxembourg, for example, abolished the criminal offence of \u2018malicious attacks against the Grand Duke\u2019 in 2002, replacing it with the provisions of ordinary law.\u201d",

Secondly, the case had been properly examined by domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction and by the Court of Cassation. The fact that the latter court had declared the applicant\u2019s appeal inadmissible was not a denial of justice since he had had the opportunity to submit complaints against the Angers Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment and had never filed pleadings in support of his appeal to the Court of Cassation.

The inability to plead justification was a measure that went beyond what was required to protect a person\u2019s reputation and rights, even when that person was a head of State or government\u201d. In the light of that finding, the applicant urged the Court to conclude that the offence of insulting the President was in breach of the Convention as the relevant procedural rules were exactly the same as those in the repealed section 36: it was impossible to rely on the defence of justification. He suggested that the President should be added to the list of persons covered by special rules protecting them from abuses of freedom of expression, which currently included ministers, members of parliament and civil servants; under these rules, set out in section 31 of the 1881 Act, the penalty was increased where defamatory allegations were made against any of the above but anyone making such allegations had the opportunity to defend himself or herself by proving that they were true.",

In that judgment the Court found that, unlike the position under the ordinary law of defamation, the applicants had been unable to rely on a defence of justification \u2013 that is to say, proving the truth of the allegation \u2013 to escape criminal liability on the charge of insulting a foreign head of State. It held that this peculiarity was a measure that went beyond what was required to protect a person\u2019s reputation and rights, even when that person was a head of State or government. In the present case the applicant, who was accused of using an insulting phrase, did not claim that the head of State had acted or spoken offensively towards him, and the phrase he used was an insult rather than an allegation. That being so, he could not have relied on a defence of either provocation or justification. Furthermore, it should be noted that, as under the ordinary law, the domestic courts examined whether the applicant had acted in good faith, which might have served as justification for his acts, although they ruled out this possibility in view of his political activism and the premeditated nature of the phrase he had used.
