They noted in this connection that, in past cases where the Court had had to reach a decision concerning the impartiality of a court, the comments made had revealed prejudice against the applicant (see Remli v.

Furthermore, the nature of the advocate-general's task in stating the case for the prosecution could not fail, he argued, to give rise to doubt as to the impartiality of the jurors when he had talked to them in the absence of the accused or his counsel. A simple inquiry would have sufficed to establish with certainty whether the conversation had actually taken place and which jurors had been involved. The inter partes hearing was not sufficient, in the applicant's submission, to establish whether the alleged events were capable of casting doubt on the jurors' impartiality. He submitted that it was not possible, simply by asking the parties for their opinion, to determine whether the conversation had taken place and what had been said, and the judgment had not mentioned whether the advocate-general and the jurors had admitted that the conversation had taken place. He further submitted that the vagueness of the facts complained of did not change the fact that it had been the duty of the  to make sure that there was no danger of the communication giving rise to doubt as to the jurors' impartiality. To support that argument, he referred to the Court's position in the Remli case (cited above), in which it had held that it was not called upon to rule on the evidential value of a written statement concerning racist remarks attributed to a member of the jury.",
