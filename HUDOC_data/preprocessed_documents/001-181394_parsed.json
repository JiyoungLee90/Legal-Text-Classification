The arrest warrant was based on the risk of his absconding owing to the possible heavy sentence for the offences in question. He was also married to the co-accused, who, like him, was a national of the Russian Federation, and he did not have a legal residence or other significant ties to Germany. There was also a risk of collusion. On the same day, he was arrested and the District Court ordered his detention on remand.

The judges concerned again gave statements and the applicant\u2019s counsel was given the opportunity to respond. On 30 December 2014 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s first complaint of bias as ill-founded, finding that there were no indications that the judges concerned were partial, even assuming that they had made a procedural mistake in connection with requesting the case file, leading to a delay in deciding on his objection and appeal to be heard.

In that regard, it had to be noted that the criminal proceedings in question were very complex, both in fact and law.

Reiterating that the nature of pre-trial detention calls for short intervals of periodic judicial review because there is an assumption that such detention is to be of a strictly limited duration (see Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7 213, and Bezicheri v. Italy, 25 October 1989, \u00a7 21, Series A no.\u00a0164), the Court considers that this interval between the two decisions cannot be said to have been a \u201creasonable interval\u201d of periodic judicial review of the applicant\u2019s remand detention.",

This lacuna in the legislation was conducive to the excessive prolonging of the review proceedings at issue. Therefore, what is at stake here is the \u201cquality\u201d of the domestic law, which must contain clear and accessible rules governing the circumstances in which deprivation of liberty is permissible, and in particular, must be foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Mooren v.

The time frame in which the Court of Appeal has to take its decision on the deprivation of liberty is not defined. This raises concerns as regards the foreseeability of the provisions governing the periodic review of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s remand detention, and may, in turn, raise concerns as to the lawfulness, for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention, of the remand detention itself.",

This conclusion is corroborated by the fact that the review proceedings were pending before the Court of Appeal for six and a half months, and the applicant\u2019s remand detention was continued without a fresh assessment of its lawfulness for a period of nine and a half months.",

Nevertheless, the interval of nine and a half months between the Court of Appeal\u2019s decisions on the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s remand detention, despite periodic reviews being foreseen by domestic law no later than every three months, without the detainee being afforded effective safeguards against unreasonable delays, raises an issue which goes beyond the shortcomings detected in this specific case in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal.
