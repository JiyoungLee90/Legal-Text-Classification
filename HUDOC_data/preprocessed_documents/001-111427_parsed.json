However, in view of the patient\u2019s age, they had preferred to carry out reconstructive surgery despite the risk of complications. Since the applicant\u2019s uterus was severely damaged, it had been considered certain that a similar situation would occur in any future pregnancy and would pose a\u00a0grave risk to the life of the applicant and her foetus. After the reconstructive surgery, the doctors had therefore decided to sterilise the applicant in accordance with the request she had made prior to the operation.
