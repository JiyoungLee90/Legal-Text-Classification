The Court observes that the Adana Assize Court did not provide an assessment regarding the content of the applicant\u2019s speech in the light of the principles embodied in Article 10. In particular, the Assize Court failed to conduct an assessment as to whether the applicant\u2019s speech could be construed as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising, or being capable of inciting violence. These are essential elements to be taken into account. In the Court\u2019s view, nothing in that speech can be construed as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising.",

In this connection, the Court observes that neither the police report dated 21 March 2007, nor the expert report of 16 April 2007 contains any element demonstrating that people who attended the celebrations chanted slogans immediately after listening the applicant\u2019s speech (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). In any event, there is no evidence in the case file showing that the applicant was the source of the slogans chanted by the demonstrators (see B\u00fclent Kaya v Turkey, no.\u00a052056/08, \u00a7\u00a042, 22 October 2013). Nor was it established that he encouraged or instructed the demonstrators to chant slogans.",
