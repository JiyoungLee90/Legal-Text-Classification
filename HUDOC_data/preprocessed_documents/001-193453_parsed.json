During the interrogation the applicant confirmed to the Police the statement he had given to the expert, noting that something had been done behind his back. In reply to questioning, he stated that another person had the keys to his showroom and that he had not seen a server of a computer network system, neither a video recorder connected to CCTV cameras nor a safedeposit box (which had allegedly been stolen on 29 January 2002) and which were found by the police on 1 February 2002. Confronted with A.F.s version of events, the applicant stated that that was A.F.\u2019s allegation.

Thus, it was irrelevant to consider as a coincidence or otherwise the fact that the police had found the things in the places where A.F. had indicated they would be. The applicant repeatedly stated that he had no difficulty reiterating his version of events, if and when it was needed, should they go to court. When invited to repeat his version of events on the spot the applicant requested that his statement be taperecorded and his request was acceded to. He confirmed that his statement had been made freely and without threats or promises. The questioning session ended at 6.43 pm.",

The applicant gave his particulars, was cautioned and recounted in great detail his version of the events of 29 January 2002. Following that, the applicant was asked questions about his business. In particular he noted that he had no reason to make up such a plan and that it would have been foolish of him to throw out (narmih) his business. The applicant was unable to quantify how much profits he was making, questioning which companies were making profits at the time. He avoided replying to a question concerning any losses and insisted that it was irrelevant whether or not he was making profits, as he had saved up the profits he had made in previous years. The applicant could not recall when he last imported products, but he replied that the last time he had exported was  if he remembered well  in December, probably towards Dubai but he could not remember the value of the transaction. On being asked again, he replied that he probably last imported in December, but was unable to give any details. He stated that local business was doing better than exports, but he was unable to quantify his profits. Upon repeated questioning he replied that during the same year he had made a loss. The applicant denied that he was not doing well also on the local market and was hesitant to accept that his business was facing a downfall. The applicant claimed to have had 70,000 United States dollars (USD) in the safedeposit box which had been stolen. He admitted that neither on the day of the holdup nor earlier that day (1 February 2002) had it been possible to open the safedeposit box (found by the police officers). The applicant admitted dealing in thousands of Maltese liras (MTL), but denied that his last import was more than three months before, although he admitted it could have been in November. He admitted that the photocopier which had been found overturned on the floor had not been working for more than two years; adding that it was moved recently to where it was found only because he adjusted its settings and made it work. He admitted that the repairs had been estimated at MTL\u00a0280 (approximately 650 euros (EUR)), but it happened that he knew how to operate it. A series of questions ensued concerning the photocopier. The applicant then admitted that the items allegedly stolen (the safedeposit box, the server and the CCTV recorder) were found earlier at the premises (on the same day  1 February 2002) and he insisted that if the police were to watch the CCTV video, they would see the four men. A series of questions concerning the functioning of the CCTV and the movements of A.F., his only employee, ensued, as well as a series of questions concerning the details of the actual robbery, the money stolen, i.e. allegedly USD\u00a070,000 which were in the safedeposit box and MTL\u00a034,000 (approximately EUR\u00a079,000) which were in a suitcase and other cash from his wallet. The applicant stated that he could provide some paper invoices in connection with some of the money. The police questioned why he had said the opposite earlier, i.e. that he could not provide proof in the absence of the server which had been stolen. Again questioned about his profits, the applicant was unable to say how much profit or sales he made on a daily basis, admitting that it had been a long time since he had made MTL\u00a0100,000 (EUR 233,000) a day. He was also unable to give details about the local sales and admitted that he had problems with the bank. A series of questions and answers concerning A.F., and in particular how he was paid his monthly salary, ensued. At a point A.F. was also brought to the room for questioning in the presence of the applicant. Throughout the questioning the applicant repeatedly reiterated that he was not insured for theft of cash, but in as far as he recalled only for theft of apparatus. On further questioning he could not remember details of his insurance policy. The applicant stated that he had more money than he owed the bank, but did not know how much exactly he owed in payment of rents for various properties he had on the island. In any event he declared that he could pay such rent as the bank had recently reopened his accounts. The questioning ended with a series of factual questioning concerning the events on the day of the alleged robbery.",

He confirmed that the police had, on the previous day, seized a video recorder (of the brand GYYR) and a video tape which was in it, and that upon the applicant\u2019s request, the police, the applicant and the courtappointed expert had viewed the content of the video tape together that same evening. He confirmed that the video recordings showed that it started on 9 October 2000 and ended on 24 October 2000, and that he had requested the viewing of the video for the police to confirm and see the four individuals who had robbed him. However, it had not shown the four persons who robbed him. The applicant explained that he could not confirm that the video recorder was the same one connected to the system, and the second tape inside it was surely not the same type that recorded the events of 29\u00a0January 2002. He could not remember how many video recorders of the brand GYYR he possessed noting that the new ones used to be in the stores and others could be in the repair room or in another room. He answered that when the previous day, on site, he had replied to the police that he had no idea where the video recorder would be, he had done so because he had no video recorder except for that attached to the system which had been stolen. When the police pointed out the inconsistency with his previous answer the applicant replied that he had been speaking about the repair room. When he was asked whether the CCTV worked, the applicant had responded that the last time he had needed to check something (at Christmas time), it had been functioning properly. He confirmed that he did not know where the things were located and, in his view, this had been a frame up against him or against his company, by someone close to him or someone who had worked for him, or a competitor. The questioning was concluded at 11.16 am.",

It had also held that for there to be a violation of Article 6 of the Convention, one must consider the proceedings as a whole and not the statements in isolation. The court noted, however, that the firstinstance judgment in that case had been overturned by the Constitutional Court which, on 12 April 2011, found a violation of the rights of the individual concerned as the lack of legal assistance deprived objectively the applicant of a fair trial. However, the Constitutional Court in that judgment had also made it clear that the ECtHR\u2019s caselaw should not have retroactive effect and should not be applicable to judgments that had become res judicata \u2013 it had not been so in the case of Lombardi since proceedings had still been pending. The situation was different in the present case, which had ended. In conclusion, relying on the Constitutional Court\u2019s position on res judicata in the case of Lombardi, cited above, the court, in the instant case, dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim.",

He had never alleged that the statement was taken abusively. Moreover, he had not even raised this complaint when filing the constitutional application on 15 June 2011. It was only on 23 March 2012, more than eleven years after making the statement, that the applicant requested a correction in the constitutional redress application to add the complaint concerning his statement, possibly because the applicant had become aware of the Court\u2019s judgment in Salduz v.\u00a0Turkey ([GC], no. 36391/02, ECHR 2008), of 27 November 2008, and realised that it could give him another means of defence. The Constitutional Court held that the fact that the applicant had never raised a complaint before the courts of criminal jurisdiction, when he had every opportunity to do so, was proof that he did not feel that this was of prejudice to him or that his statement was taken abusively. Thus, the applicant could not now, without abusing the judicial process, expect to reopen a closed case which had become res judicata, once he had not raised the issue previously. According to the Constitutional Court, it was also relevant that the Court of Criminal Appeal had not relied solely on the applicant\u2019s statement, but also on other means of corroboration. Consequently, in the Constitutional Court\u2019s view the applicant\u2019s statement was not determinative to the finding of guilt and the firstinstance court had been right not to disturb a judgment which had become res judicata.",

In the absence of such risk no breach would occur. Having examined the ECtHR case law from Imbrioscia v.

During the criminal proceedings he had only contested that his statement did not reflect the truth and he testified again to give another version which he claimed was the truth. At no point had he alleged that he had been coerced to sign such statement or that the statement had breached his fundamental human rights.

Constitutional redress proceedings are in the Maltese context not considered to be extraordinary remedies and have always been considered by this Court as the ordinary remedy for the purposes of Article\u00a035 (see, by implication, amongst many others, Micallef v.\u00a0Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2009 and Mercieca and Others v.\u00a0Malta, no. 21974/07, \u00a7 29, 14 June 2011, and compare and contrast Lang and Hastie v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 19/11 and 36395/11, 22\u00a0May 2012, where an application to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time enabling applicants to raise their claims following the Salduz v.\u00a0Turkey ([GC], no. 36391/02, ECHR 2008) judgment, was considered to be an extraordinary remedy, and thus could not bring all the affected persons within the six months\u2019 limit for the purposes of the Convention). This has been so despite the fact that, according to Maltese law and established practice constitutional redress proceedings are not subject to a time bar (see, for example Apap Bologna v. Malta, no.\u00a046931/12, \u00a7 46, 30\u00a0August 2016). In other words, there is no time-limit within which to bring a constitutional redress application before the constitutional jurisdictions. The legislator leaves the choice of timing to the applicant, as a result of which the legal framework appears to give great latitude to individuals seeking redress for human rights violations (ibid.). This method of complaining is independent of a person\u2019s right to raise Constitutional or Conventional complaints by way of a request for referral to the constitutional jurisdictions lodged during the pendency of ordinary proceedings.",

Indeed, there was only one case - not relied on by the Government - delivered three weeks before the applicant lodged his constitutional complaint, which in an obiter dictum, held that Salduz should not apply retroactively to cases which had become res judicata (see paragraph 43 above). The Court considers that such dictum was not, at the time, enough for the applicant to be able to consider that such remedy would not be effective on this basis. As to the caselaw relied on by the Government, while the Xuereb judgment appears to substantiate the Government\u2019s allegation, that in Eyre leaves room for debate. In any event, both these judgments were only delivered in 2012 pending the applicant\u2019s constitutional redress proceedings, and Pace, the only other judgment to this effect relied on by the Government, was delivered in 2014, i.e. after the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment in the applicant\u2019s case.

A finding of compelling reasons cannot stem from the mere existence of legislation precluding the presence of a lawyer. The fact that there is a general and mandatory restriction on the right of access to a lawyer, having a statutory basis, does not remove the need for the national authorities to ascertain, through an individual and casespecific assessment, whether there are any compelling reasons. Where a respondent Government have convincingly demonstrated the existence of an urgent need to avert serious adverse consequences for life, liberty or physical integrity in a given case, this can amount to a compelling reason to restrict access to legal advice for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention (see Beuze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 142-143).",

Nor did it have any other utility in the present case given that the Court of Criminal Appeal - the only court which pronounced the applicant\u2019s guilt - did not hear the recording. Thus, in the present case, this safeguard had no compensatory effect in practical terms. In the circumstances of the present case the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s conduct during the police interviews was capable of having such consequences for the prospects of his defence that there was no guarantee that either the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer or the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings could cure the defects which had occurred during the period of police custody (see, mutatis mutandis, Beuze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0171).

The Court notes that they did not contain any confessions nor was their content self-incriminating. However, the privilege against selfincrimination is not confined to actual confessions or to remarks which are directly incriminating; for statements to be regarded as selfincriminating it is sufficient for them to have substantially affected the accused\u2019s position (see, for example, Schmid-Laffer v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a041269/08, \u00a7 37, 16\u00a0June 2015). Indeed, the statements given by the applicant, at pre-trial stage in the absence of a lawyer, were relied on by the Court of Criminal Appeal in connection with the applicant\u2019s credibility. In particular, in its judgment the Court of Criminal Appeal had noted certain inconsistencies in his statements of 1 and 2 February 2002 (see paragraph\u00a022 above) and it had considered that he was not reliable as the applicant had replied in an evasive and hesitant way to police questions concerning his business, profitability, rent, and profits of the previous year (see paragraph 26 above). Nevertheless, the Court cannot but note that the Court of Criminal Appeal had found that A.F.\u2019s statements had been enough to determine the applicant\u2019s guilt. In consequence its assessment of the applicant\u2019s credibility on the basis of his pre-trial statements can be considered as having been made ex abundanti cautela (out of an abundance of caution). In the light of the Court of Criminal Appeal\u2019s finding concerning the sufficiency of A.F.\u2019s statements, the Court considers that the use it made of the applicant\u2019s statements to assess his credibility cannot be considered as having substantially affected his position.",

Yet they dismiss the importance of this fact with the argument that \u201cthere was at least some public interest in prosecuting the applicant for the crime at issue\u201d. This argument is unfounded. Listing this argument among those relevant to assessing the fairness of proceedings is very troubling. We note that the majority did not refer to the public interest in the investigation and punishment of \u201cthe kind of offence in issue\u201d, but of \u201cthe applicant for the crime at issue\u201d. This could be read as implying that defendants are entitled to different degrees of fairness in the procedures against them not only because of the kind of offence they are indicted for, but also because of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d their specific cases happened to arouse. This would be the ultimate paradigm of \u201cstreet justice\u201d, more akin to vigilante punishment than to a lawful trial. If there is some social uproar around a specific case, the defendant may be deprived of his or her right to a lawyer at the pre-trial stage of the criminal procedure.",

We also stress that the majority implicitly reproached the Court of Criminal Appeal for not having listened to the recording of the defendant\u2019s statement. Hence, the safeguard of recording had \u201cno compensatory effect in practical terms\u201d, as the majority themselves recognise. As a matter of fact, the Court of Criminal Appeal did not hear the viva voce recording of the applicant\u2019s statement, and thus his hesitations could not be verified; nor did it hear A.F.",

We were already persuaded that, under the first approach, his conviction should not stand. It is clear from the above analysis that all the arguments used by the majority in applying the second approach are unfounded. After concluding this analysis, we are further strengthened in our firm conviction that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention in the present case. Having found such a violation, we would obviously award the applicant a sum in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",
