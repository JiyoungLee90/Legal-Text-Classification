In the present case it had not been necessary to order an opinion from an expert on linguistics. As correctly noted by the Court of Appeal the decisive factor for interpretation was the understanding of an average reader. The newspaper Rzeczpospolita was addressed to a wide group of recipients and therefore these articles should have been interpreted according to widely acceptable interpretation rules. Lastly, the court explained that the phrase in question had not ceased to be informative with reference to the personality of the parties. Furthermore, it could not have been perceived differently, because it had been made in the context of a public debate on lustration of journalists. The way an article was perceived depended on the choice of words rather than its political context or publication in a particular column.

In such cases one factor the Court has taken into account is the position of the person concerned by the publication: whether or not he or she was a \u201cpublic figure\u201d or had otherwise \u201centered the public scene\u201d Another important factor is whether the statement in question contributed to a debate of general interest (see Krone Verlag GmbH v.\u00a0Austria, no. 27306/07, \u00a7 53, 19\u00a0June 2012).",

The Court has already held that journalists and publicists, like other persons actively involved in public life, should display a greater degree of tolerance for criticism against them (see Kurski v.

With regard to classification of the statement at issue, the applicant argued before the domestic courts that his statement had been an acceptable paraphrase of A.M.\u2019s views and opinions presented in numerous public declarations (see paragraph 15 above). The domestic courts considered that the use of a colon after \u201cA.M. repeatedly said: ...\u201d indicated that the phrase was a direct quote (see paragraphs 16, 17\u00a0above). The Court is unpersuaded by the above approach of the domestic courts. It notes that the phrase at issue does not lend itself to a clear categorisation. It is neither a simple statement of fact nor a value judgment. In the Court\u2019s view the impugned phrase could be understood as the applicant\u2019s interpretation of statements made by A.M. and his stance in the public debate. Consequently, the critical issue for the proportionality of the interference is the question of a reasonable basis for the impugned interpretation, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2001II). The Court notes in this respect that the applicant submitted in the domestic proceedings numerous quotes from A.M.\u2019s public appearances in which A.M. referred to his stay in prison during the communist-era (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above). However, the domestic courts failed to take into account the particular nature of the impugned utterance and consequently did not examine the question whether the material available to them could be considered as a reasonable basis for the interpretation proposed by the applicant.",
