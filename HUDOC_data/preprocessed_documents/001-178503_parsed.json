While this obligation does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case (see, for instance, Ciecho\u0144ska v. Poland, no. 19776/04, \u00a7 66, 14\u00a0June 2011), when lives have been lost as a result of events occurring under the responsibility of public authorities in the context of \u201cdangerous activities\u201d, Article 2 requires the authorities to conduct an official investigation (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7 93 and Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 188).

In the absence of any explanation from the Government, this delay remains unjustified. The Court secondly notes that the criminal proceedings at issue did not present any particular complexities: it concerned the death of fifteen people following the collapse of only one building (compare with the circumstances in M. \u00d6zel and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 195, where the criminal proceedings against the real estate developers concerned the death of 195 people following the collapse of some seventeen buildings). The defects and other factors leading to the collapse of the building in question, as well as the corresponding responsibilities, had been largely established by expert reports by the end of 1999. Nevertheless, it took the firstinstance court another six years to deliver a final judgment in respect of S.D. and T.A., and the remaining defendant (H.E.) benefited from the statute of limitations. The Court finds it noteworthy that although the involvement of T.A. in the construction of the building in question had been identified as early as 26 August 1999, it was only on 14 August 2003 that he was included in the proceedings by way of an additional indictment. The Court cannot but observe in this connection that the second quashing of the assize court\u2019s judgment on 6\u00a0July 2004 was related to the procedural problems brought about by the subsequent inclusion of T.A. in the case as a defendant.",

This is despite the applicant\u2019s persistent requests for an investigation into the responsibility of the various public authorities in connection with the collapse of the building that claimed his daughter\u2019s life (see paragraph\u00a013 above). Consequently, and contrary to the requirements of Article 2 as noted in paragraph 37 above, the responsibility of the relevant State authorities for the incident remained undetermined.

These proceedings resulted in the establishment of the responsibility of the Municipality of D\u00fczce for the collapse of the building in question and the award of some compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage. The Court reiterates that in the specific context of establishing a State\u2019s liability for the damage caused by a natural disaster, it has previously found that successful administrative proceedings could be considered sufficient to deprive the applicant of his victim status (see Murillo Saldias and Others v. Spain (dec.), no. 76973/01, 28 November 2006, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 111). The Court considers, however, that in the present case the administrative proceedings were far from satisfying the requirements of Article\u00a02 and removing the applicant\u2019s victim status, given that they lasted approximately twelve years (see, similarly, M. \u00d6zel and Others, cited\u00a0above, \u00a7 199). The length of the administrative proceedings had therefore detracted from their capacity to provide the applicant with effective redress in respect of his grievance (see, a contrario, Zaharieva v.

The Court is aware that the applicant received his compensation payment approximately five years before actual finalisation of the compensation proceedings (see paragraphs 29 above); however, given the amount of time that had already passed before the date of payment, the Court maintains its conclusion in respect of the applicant\u2019s victim status and the ineffectiveness of the relevant proceedings.",
