The case originated in two applications (nos. 28368/09 and 28636/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, whose personal details appear in the Appendix.
The applicant in application no. 28636/09 was represented by Mr Z.S. Salimov, a lawyer practising in Makhachkala. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 24 April 2017 the complaints concerning the extension of the time limits for lodging appeals and subsequent quashing of the final judgments in the applicants’ favour were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application no. 28368/09 was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
In 2008 the applicants applied for recalculation of the social benefits they were entitled to as persons who took part in the clean-up operation at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site. Their claims were granted by domestic courts.
Further developments in their cases are summarised in the Appendix.
The relevant domestic law and practice governing the restoration of the time-limits for appeal is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Magomedov and Others v. Russia (nos. 33636/09 and 9 others, §§ 35-43, 28 March 2017).
