The Court notes that Cell 309 and 310, where the applicant was most recently held, were extremely overcrowded, in particular in the second half of 2014 when more detainees were transferred into Cell 310 from the upper floors. The floor space per detainee was significantly below the relevant minimum standard of 3 sq. m in multioccupancy accommodation. The Government did not demonstrate the existence of any counterbalancing factors capable of rebutting a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 (see Mur\u0161i\u0107 v. Croatia [GC], no.\u00a07334/13, \u00a7\u00a7 136-37, ECHR 2016, and Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, \u00a7\u00a7 165-67 and 170, ECHR 2016 (extracts)). Further aspects of the applicant\u2019s detention which, taken cumulatively with the problem of overcrowding, the Court considers incompatible with the protection against inhuman and degrading treatment were the virtually non-existent outdoor exercise and the complete absence of any meaningful activities, whether inside or outside the cell (see Dimitrov and Ribov v.

It does not appear that there was any progress in the enforcement proceedings after 14 April 2014 and until the applicant\u2019s release more than seven months later. The Government did not provide evidence of any efforts having been made to secure the applicant\u2019s admission to a third country.
