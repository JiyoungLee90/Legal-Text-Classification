Although the proceedings before the Supreme Court proceeded with reasonable expediency, the Court notes that the conduct and the inactivity of the administrative bodies, especially of the Ministry, contributed significantly to the length of the proceedings in a case which was simple. Thus, the Court emphasises that after the applicant had re-introduced his complaint on 21 July 1997 with the Ministry following the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, the Bureau rejected it on admissibility grounds instead of transmitting it to the Ministry for consideration. The case was decided nearly two years later by the Supreme Court which instructed the Ministry to decide upon the applicant\u2019s appeal. The Court is also struck by the failure of the Ministry to decide upon the applicant\u2019s complaint despite being instructed to do so by the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 28 April 1999. The Ministry also failed to decide upon the applicant\u2019s appeal of 2 December 1999 and his second referral of 7\u00a0February 2000.
