Referring to the case Mattoccia v.\u00a0Italy (no. 23969/94, ECHR 2000IX), he stated that the accusations against him were vague, in particular, they did not contain any information about the dates on which he had allegedly raped between September 2004 and April 2005. For this reason he could not provide an alibi for those dates. The applicant submitted that the courts had disregarded the statements of M. (see paragraph 20 above).",

Article 6 of the Convention, read as a whole, guarantees the right of an accused to participate effectively in a criminal trial. In general, that includes, inter alia, his right to be present. That right is implicit in the very notion of an adversarial procedure and can also be derived from the guarantees contained in sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of paragraph 3 of Article 6 - to defend himself in person, to examine or have examined witnesses, and to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court (see, inter alia, Lazariu v.

The manner of application of Article 6 to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7\u00a056, Series A no. 115; Ekbatani v. Sweden, 26 May 1988, \u00a7 27, Series\u00a0A no. 134; and Hermi, cited above, \u00a7 60). Nevertheless, the Court has held that where an appellate court is called upon to examine a case as to the facts and the law and to make a full assessment of the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence, it cannot, as a matter of fair trial, properly determine those issues without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by an accused who claims that he has not committed the act alleged to constitute a criminal offence (see Ekbatani, cited above, \u00a7 32; Dondarini v. San Marino, \u00a7 27, 6\u00a0July 2004; Marcello Viola v. Italy, \u00a7 58, 5 October 2006; Popovici v.\u00a0Moldova, nos. 289/04 and 41194/04, \u00a7 68, 27\u00a0November 2007; and Selwiak v. Poland, no. 3818/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a055-57, 21 July 2009).",

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2010, and AlKhawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom\u00a0[GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and\u00a022228/06, \u00a7\u00a0118, ECHR 2011).",

The Court of Appeal granted his request and ordered the bailiffs to bring him to the court hearing. He was taken to the court-house and kept there in a cell the entire day of the appeal hearing, but was not brought to the hearing itself. On the same date, the Court of Appeal, in the presence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer, upheld the first-instance judgment (see paragraphs 31-33 of the judgment).",

However, the Court of Appeal was called upon to make a full assessment of the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence. In our view, it follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that this required a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the applicant, who claimed that he had not committed the acts of which he had been convicted, and that the Court of Appeal was under a duty to guarantee his right to be present in the courtroom (see paragraphs 2 and 3 above). This was important in view of contradictions in the evidentiary material, such as in the exact dates of the rapes, which had not been clarified (see paragraph 27 of the judgment). It is not for the applicant to demonstrate that there was any necessity to question him during the hearing or that his absence from the courtroom prejudiced his defence. As he had clearly expressed his wish to personally participate, it was not sufficient for the lawyer alone to be present.",

Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 200l, and Hermi, cited above, \u00a7 73). However, such a waiver must, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance (see Poitrimol, cited above, \u00a7 31). In the present case there is no statement to that effect and no information as to why the applicant was not brought from the cell in the court-house to attend the hearing in the courtroom.",

Furthermore, the Court of Appeal did not question any of the witnesses whose credibility the applicant had challenged in his appeal (see paragraphs 27 and 33 of the judgment).",
