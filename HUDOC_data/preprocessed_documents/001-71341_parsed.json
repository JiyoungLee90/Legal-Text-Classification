Accordingly, it must primarily have regard to the general situation prevailing in the region at the time of the alleged events. In this connection it observes that at the relevant time violent confrontations had taken place between the security forces and members of the PKK in the stateofemergency region of . This twofold violence resulting from the acts of the two parties to the conflict forced many people to flee their homes. Moreover, the national authorities had evicted the inhabitants of a number of settlements to ensure the safety of the population in the region (Do\u011fan and Others v.

However, it considers that such an exercise would not yield sufficient evidence capable of establishing the true circumstances of the case, given that the passage of a substantial period of time, almost eleven years in the instant case, makes it more difficult to find witnesses to give testimony and takes a toll on a witness\u2019 capacity to recall events in detail and with accuracy (see \u0130pek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116). Accordingly, the Court must reach its decision on the basis of the available evidence submitted by the parties (see Pardo v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-B, p. 31, \u00a7 28, cited in \u00c7a\u00e7an v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 33646/96, \u00a7 61, 26 October 2004).

In this connection, it is to be pointed out that the statements made by Masum Tosin, Hasan Kaya and Mevlude U\u00e7ar do not go beyond hearsay statements in view of their admission that they had left the village six or seven months before the fire in September 1994, and that they had heard about the burning down of the houses on 22 December 1995 from their acquaintances living in neighbouring villages (see paragraph 48 above).",

In this respect, it is noteworthy that the applicant failed to submit any expert opinion as to the nature of such destruction.

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Dula\u015f and Y\u00f6yler, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 87 respectively).",

The gendarme captain conducted an on-site inspection, took statements from a total of fourteen witnesses, including inhabitants of nearby villages, gendarmes and fire fighters, and concluded that the applicant\u2019s allegations were unfounded (see paragraphs 70-78 above). Relying on the findings and conclusion of the gendarme captain, the Administrative Council decided that no proceedings should be brought against the security forces and village guards.",

In this connection, it points out that the investigating authorities visited the scene of the incident one and a half years after they had received the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint (see paragraphs 32 and 35 above). The gendarme officer in charge of the investigation did not attempt to take statements from the inhabitants of the applicant\u2019s village. He was content to rely on the testimonies of gendarmes, firemen and persons from neighbouring villages who all seemed to be village guards. Moreover, some of the witnesses denied the content and accuracy of their statements taken by the gendarme captain, alleging that they had been asked to sign some documents without being aware of their content (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). In this context, the Court recalls that in a similar Turkish case it had already established a practice by the gendarmerie authorities of making witnesses sign blank sheets and filling them in themselves afterwards (see Y\u00f6yler, cited above, \u00a7 57). On that account, the Court had observed that statements taken from those witnesses had been of a stereotyped nature \u2013 giving the impression that they had been prepared by the investigating authorities \u2013 and that therefore no weight could be attached to them (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 57 and 91). Likewise, in the instant case, the Court has serious doubts about the credibility of the investigation carried out by the gendarme captain, given the denial of some of the witnesses that they made such statements. In particular, it considers this practice incompatible with the notion of the investigation required by Article 13 of the Convention.",
