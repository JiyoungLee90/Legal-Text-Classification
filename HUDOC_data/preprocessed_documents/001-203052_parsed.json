The applicant, who was a minor, was represented by a guardian, a lawyer from Zrenjanin, who had been appointed by the local social care centre (organ starateljstva) in order to protect his interests. In its reasoning, the District Court held that Mr A and the applicant\u2019s mother had met between 10 and 13 July 1969. It further noted that they had got married on 11 August 1969 and that the applicant had been born on 25 December 1969, some four months later. Since the available medical documentation did not indicate that the birth had been premature, it followed, according to the District Court, that Mr A could not have been the applicant\u2019s biological father. The court essentially reached that conclusion on the basis of witness testimony as to when the applicant\u2019s mother and Mr A had met. The applicant\u2019s mother, for her part, maintained throughout the proceedings that she had had sexual relations with Mr A from the spring of 1969 onwards, that is before they were married. A number of other witnesses were also examined by the court, but their statements were deemed irrelevant. Lastly, although blood tests were carried out, they were ultimately considered inconclusive in terms of establishing whether Mr A was the applicant\u2019s biological father.",

The Supreme Court also noted, inter alia, that it had not been necessary to examine one witness, even though she had apparently been invited to the wedding of Mr A and the applicant\u2019s mother, which had allegedly been initially planned for 1\u00a0May 1969. In the Supreme Court\u2019s view, this witness\u2019s testimony would have been irrelevant as her statement would have had no bearing on when the sexual relations between Mr A and the applicant\u2019s mother might have taken place.

Since the applicant\u2019s purported father had died, the request was directed against his legal heirs. The applicant and his mother informed the court as to when and how the applicant had learned of the existence of that judgment and of the Zrenjanin District Court\u2019s judgment of 23 November 1971 (see paragraphs 4 and 7 above), and noted that notwithstanding those judgments, Mr A had always been recognised as the applicant\u2019s father in the official register of births (mati\u010dna knjiga ro\u0111enih). Neither Mr A nor the applicant\u2019s mother had ever informed the applicant of the judgments. Finally, the applicant and his mother observed that DNA testing had not been possible in the 1970s, but that such a test could now be carried out on the basis of a court order. All of the above, according to them, warranted the reopening of the civil proceedings in question in order to confirm that Mr A was the applicant\u2019s biological father.",

Finally, the applicant and his mother noted that Mr A had never attempted to amend the information contained in the official register of births, in which he was still recognised as the applicant\u2019s father, and that the applicant\u2019s State-appointed guardian himself had also failed to inform the applicant subsequently of his rights regarding the establishment of Mr A\u2019s paternity.",

Secondly, the Constitutional Court noted that the applicant\u2019s request for the reopening of the proceedings in question had been considered at two levels of jurisdiction and that the Constitution did not guarantee a favourable outcome in each and every case. Thirdly, as regards the applicant\u2019s complaint with respect to the equal protection of his rights before the courts and the right of a child to know the identity of his or her father, the Constitutional Court held that these rights could not, considered constitutionally, be deemed to have been impacted in any way by the impugned court decisions, given both their content and their legal nature.",

The judgment in Jevremevi\u0107, referred to by the Government (see paragraph\u00a029 above), and where the Court found that the only avenue by which one of the applicants could have established whether or not the respondent was her biological father was through a civil suit is likewise of no relevance to the present case since it concerned regular paternity proceedings where there was no prior final court ruling on the matter. Furthermore, Article 279 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Procedure Act, which was in force at the time when the applicant would have brought his new paternity suit, provided that a civil court would reject a claim as inadmissible were it to conclude that the matter before it had already been adjudicated by means of a final court decision (see paragraph\u00a019 above). In those circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant was not obliged to make use of the avenue of redress indicated by the Government, which, at best, could be described as merely theoretical (see the case-law cited in paragraph 33 above).

In fact, since the applicable statutory deadlines had all long since expired, the courts had had no choice but to reject the request for reopening as time-barred, the deadlines in question having themselves been both reasonable in terms of their duration and necessary in order to preserve legal certainty.

However, the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole, and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Keegan v.\u00a0Ireland, 26 May 1994, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 290, and Backlund, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039).",

On 31 January 2012 the Novi Sad Court of Appeal endorsed that reasoning and added that the applicant\u2019s assertion that he had been informed of the impugned judgments only recently was irrelevant since in the original proceedings his rights had been properly secured through the appointment of a legal guardian (see paragraph 11 above). In those circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that there is no evidence of arbitrariness in the reasoning of the Zrenjanin High Court or indeed of the Novi Sad Court of Appeal.",

Apart from weighing the interests of the individual vis-\u00e0-vis the general interest of the community as a whole, a balancing exercise is also required with regard to competing private interests. In this connection, it should be observed that the expression \u201ceveryone\u201d in Article 8 of the Convention applies to both the child and the putative father. On the one hand, people have a right to know their origins, that right being derived from a wide interpretation of the scope of the notion of private life (see Odi\u00e8vre, cited above, \u00a7 42). Indeed, persons seeking to establish the identity of their ascendants have a vital interest, protected by the Convention, in receiving the information necessary to uncover the truth about an important aspect of their personal identity and eliminate any uncertainty in this respect (see Mikuli\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65, and J\u00e4ggi, cited above, \u00a7 38). On the other hand, a putative father\u2019s interest in being protected from claims concerning facts that go back many years cannot be denied. In addition to that conflict of interest, other interests may come into play, such as those of third parties, essentially the putative father\u2019s family, and the general interest of legal certainty (see Backlund, cited above, \u00a7 46). Finally, with regard to the deceased\u2019s own right to respect for his private life, the Court would reiterate that the private life of a deceased person from whom a DNA sample is to be taken cannot be adversely affected by a request to that effect made after his death (see, for example, J\u00e4ggi, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

For instance, the particular point in time when an applicant becomes aware of the biological reality is pertinent. The Court will therefore examine whether the circumstances substantiating a particular paternity claim are met before or after the expiry of the applicable time-limit (see, for instance, Mizzi v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a026111/02, \u00a7\u00a7 109-11, ECHR 2006I (extracts), and Shofman v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a074826/01, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 43, 24\u00a0November 2005, concerning disavowal of paternity claims). Furthermore, the Court will examine whether or not an alternative means of redress exists in the event the proceedings in question are time-barred. This would include, for example, the availability of effective domestic remedies to secure the reopening of the time-limit (see, for example, Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7 111) or exceptions to the application of a time-limit in situations where a person becomes aware of the biological reality after the time-limit has expired (see Shofman, cited above, \u00a7 43, and Backlund, cited above, \u00a7 47).",

For example, the Court has found that rigid limitation periods or other obstacles to actions contesting paternity that apply irrespective of a putative father\u2019s awareness of the circumstances casting doubt on his paternity, without allowing for any exceptions, violated Article 8 of the Convention (see Shofman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43-45; Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080 and 111-13; and Backlund, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

Secondly, the applicant became aware of the final judgment regarding his parentage in 2011 or 2012, decades after the applicable deadline for the reopening of the proceedings in question had already expired (see paragraphs 7 and 46 above) but had then, on 4 January 2012, within a year at the most and possibly much sooner, lodged his request for reopening (see paragraphs 7-8 above; compare and contrast to, for example and mutatis mutandis, Silva and Mondim Correia v. Portugal, nos.\u00a072105/14 and 20415/15, \u00a7 68, 3 October 2017, where the applicants had waited fifty and twenty-six years respectively, after reaching the age of majority, to bring their paternity suits). There was also no legal way for the applicant in the present case, notwithstanding his very specific situation, to have the deadline for the submission of his request for reopening extended (see paragraphs 20-21 and the case-law cited in paragraph 51 above). After the expiry of the deadline in question, domestic law did not therefore allow for the relevant elements of the applicant\u2019s specific situation to be taken into account or for a balancing of the relevant interests to be carried out. Thirdly, as already noted above, the private life of a deceased person \u2013 that is, the applicant\u2019s purported biological father in the present case \u2013 from whom a DNA sample would have had to be taken could not have been adversely affected by a request to that effect made following his death (see the case-law cited in paragraph 50 in fine above). Fourthly, there is no indication in the case file as to what the position of the deceased\u2019s family would have been in respect of a DNA test and the Court does not wish to speculate on this specific point. In any event, the applicant\u2019s complaint in the present case concerned his being denied the opportunity to prove that Mr A was indeed his biological father. After all, as far as he knew, that fact was not in doubt until 2011 or 2012 and he has continued to seek certainty in terms of his personal identity ever since. In fact, while it is understandable that Mr A was recorded as the applicant\u2019s father immediately after his birth, since he was at that time married to the applicant\u2019s mother, even in birth certificates issued much later, in 2014 and 2019, Mr A was still identified as the applicant\u2019s father (see paragraphs 5 and 14 above). Finally, for the reasons mentioned in the ambit of the examination of the non-exhaustion plea (see paragraph 38 above), the Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant should have lodged a new civil claim based on Article 55 of the Family Act (see paragraph 43 above).",

Indeed, the Government themselves acknowledged, in their observations, that the domestic courts in the present case had been unable to deal with the substantive issue of whether Mr A was indeed the applicant\u2019s biological father given the existing temporal limitations concerning the attempted reopening of the earlier proceedings (see paragraph 43 above). It follows that, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the overriding interest at stake for the applicant, the Serbian authorities did not, regardless of the margin of appreciation afforded to them in this context, secure to him respect for his private life as guaranteed under the Convention (compare and contrast, for example and mutatis mutandis, A.L. v.\u00a0Poland, no. 28609/08, 18 February 2014, and R.L. and Others v.\u00a0Denmark, no. 52629/11, 7 March 2017, where the finding of no violation of Article 8 was largely based on an analysis of what was in the best interests of the children who were not the applicants in those cases).",

This in turn may, depending on the specific circumstances, lead the Court to adopt different conclusions in those cases, provided that they are consistent with the general principles outlined in paragraphs 50-53 above.",
