The Court further recalls that the costs of the domestic proceedings can be awarded if they are incurred by applicants in order to try to prevent the violation found by the Court or to obtain redress therefor (see, among other authorities, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 18 October 1982, Series A no. 54, \u00a7 17) and that costs in respect of the domestic proceedings were in fact awarded at paragraphs\u00a030-33 of the above-cited case of Lustig-Prean and Beckett (just satisfaction).",

As such, the Court finds that both the time spent and the division of labour used on the first applicant\u2019s case was reasonable. The Court, has, however, taken into account the Government\u2019s submission that the charging rate of GBP 75 plus VAT for a trainee was high. The Court further considers that, notwithstanding the second applicant\u2019s contention that her case was prepared first, the number of hours spent on the preparation of her Convention proceedings appears high. In relation to the second applicant\u2019s domestic proceedings, the Court notes that a total of 10\u00a0hours and 10 minutes at a charging rate of GBP 100 plus VAT per hour amounts to less than the GBP 1,611.47 that she claimed and that she has not provided any evidence of any other costs incurred.",
