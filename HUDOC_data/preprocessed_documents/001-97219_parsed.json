It follows from the independence of the legal profession from the State that the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his counsel, whether counsel be appointed under a legal-aid scheme or be privately financed (see Cuscani v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a032771/96, \u00a7 39, 24 September 2002). The competent national authorities are required under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) to intervene only if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, Series A no. 168, \u00a7 65, and Daud v. Portugal, 21 April 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, \u00a7\u00a038).",

In the Court's opinion, counsel G. did not perform his duties properly with respect to the applicant's defence and his failure to do so was manifest to the Supreme Court. Accordingly, in such circumstances, it was incumbent on the court to intervene, especially in view of the prosecutor's presence and his request for reclassification of the charges against the applicant.",
