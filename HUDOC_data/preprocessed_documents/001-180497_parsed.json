The Court observes that although he filed objections against his detention on remand on several occasions during this period, his objections were examined by the courts without holding a hearing (see paragraph 13 above). Thus, the Court finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned judgments and considers that the applicant\u2019s inability to appear before courts dealing with his requests of release for approximately five months is not compatible with the requirement to hold a hearing at regular intervals, as required by Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04.",
