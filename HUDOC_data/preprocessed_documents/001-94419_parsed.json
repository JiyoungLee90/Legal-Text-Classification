The Court considers that ensuring a much more prompt medical examination would have been a straightforward matter for the authorities but they nevertheless failed to do so, partly because of the lengthy communications between prosecutors in determining in whose area of jurisdiction the applicant was being detained (see paragraph 12 above). The Court considers it highly regrettably that the authorities\u2019 own delays in obtaining these reports were then used against the applicant when dismissing his allegations of ill-treatment (see paragraph 27 above).",
