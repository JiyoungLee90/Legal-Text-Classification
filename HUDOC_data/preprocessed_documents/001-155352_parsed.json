The court further found that the fact that Vincent Lambert had had a conflictual relationship with his parents, since he did not share their moral values and religious commitment, did not mean that he could be considered to have expressed a clear wish to refuse all forms of treatment, and added that no unequivocal conclusion as to his desire or otherwise to be kept alive could be drawn from his apparent resistance to the care provided.

Accordingly, the administering of artificial nutrition and hydration was not aimed at keeping him alive artificially. Lastly, the court considered that, as long as the treatment did not cause any stress or suffering, it could not be characterised as futile or disproportionate. It therefore held that Dr Kariger\u2019s decision had constituted a serious and manifestly unlawful breach of Vincent Lambert\u2019s right to life.

They added that the lengthy period of progression, the patient\u2019s clinical deterioration since July 2011, his current vegetative state, the destructive nature and extent of the brain damage and the results of the functional tests, coupled with the severity of the motor impairment of all four limbs, pointed to a poor clinical prognosis.",

The exchanges which took place in the adversarial proceedings before the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat subsequent to submission of the experts\u2019 report do nothing to invalidate the experts\u2019 conclusions.

The tenor of those remarks, reported by Mrs Rachel Lambert in precise detail and with the corresponding dates, was confirmed by one of Mr\u00a0Lambert\u2019s brothers. While these remarks were not made in the presence of Mr\u00a0Lambert\u2019s parents, the latter did not claim that their son could not have made them or that he would have expressed wishes to the contrary, and several of Mr Lambert\u2019s siblings stated that the remarks concerned were in keeping with their brother\u2019s personality, past experience and personal opinions.

While Mr Lambert\u2019s parents and some of his brothers and sisters opposed the discontinuing of treatment, Mr\u00a0Lambert\u2019s wife and his other siblings stated their support for the proposal to withdraw treatment. Dr Kariger took these different opinions into account.

The Court considers that the converse also applies: in a case such as the present one reference should be made, in examining a possible violation of Article 2, to Article 8 of the Convention and to the right to respect for private life and the notion of personal autonomy which it encompasses. In Pretty (cited above, \u00a7 67) the Court was not prepared to exclude that preventing the applicant by law from exercising her choice to avoid what she considered would be an undignified and distressing end to her life constituted an interference with her right to respect for her private life as guaranteed under Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

According to the Guide, artificial nutrition and hydration are given to a patient following a medical indication and imply choices concerning medical procedures and devices (perfusion, feeding tubes). The Guide observes that differences in approach exist between countries. Some regard artificial nutrition and hydration as a form of treatment that may be limited or withdrawn in the circumstances and in accordance with the guarantees provided for in domestic law. The considerations to be taken into account in this regard are the patient\u2019s wishes and whether or not the treatment is appropriate in the situation in question. In other countries they are regarded as a form of care meeting the individual\u2019s basic needs which cannot be withdrawn unless the patient, in the terminal phase of an endoflife situation, has expressed a wish to that effect (see paragraph 61 above).",

Its review encompassed the lawfulness of the collective procedure and compliance with the substantive conditions laid down by law, which it considered \u2013 particularly in the light of the findings of the expert report \u2013 to have been satisfied. It noted in particular that it was clear from the experts\u2019 findings that Vincent Lambert\u2019s clinical condition corresponded to a chronic vegetative state, that he had sustained serious and extensive injuries whose severity, coupled with the period of five and a half years that had passed since the accident, led to the conclusion that it was irreversible and that there was a \u201cpoor clinical prognosis\u201d.

As the latter had not drawn up any advance directives or designated a person of trust, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat took into consideration the testimony of his wife, Rachel Lambert. It noted that she and her husband, who were both nurses with experience of patients in resuscitation and those with multiple disabilities, had often discussed their professional experiences and that on several such occasions Vincent Lambert had voiced the wish not to be kept alive artificially in a highly dependent state (see paragraph 50 above). The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat found that those remarks \u2013 the tenor of which was confirmed by one of Vincent Lambert\u2019s brothers \u2013 had been reported by Rachel Lambert in precise detail and with the corresponding dates. It also took account of the fact that several of Vincent Lambert\u2019s other siblings had stated that these remarks were in keeping with their brother\u2019s personality, past experience and views, and noted that the applicants did not claim that he would have expressed remarks to the contrary.

This statement would be correct only if \u2013 and in so far as \u2013 the applicants alleged a violation of Vincent Lambert\u2019s right to personal autonomy under Article 8 of the Convention, which, according to our Court\u2019s case-law, comprises the individual\u2019s right to decide in which way and at which time his or her life should end (see Haas v. Switzerland, no. 31322/07, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2011). However, although the applicants do rely on Article 8, they do so in a completely different context; it is Vincent Lambert\u2019s physical integrity, and not his personal autonomy, that they seek to defend before the Court. Their main complaints raised on behalf of Vincent Lambert are based on Articles\u00a02 and 3 of the Convention. Unlike Article 8, which protects an extremely wide panoply of human actions based on personal choices and going in various directions, Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention are clearly unidirectional in that they do not involve any negative aspect. Article 2 protects the right to life but not the right to die (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, ECHR 2002-III). Likewise, Article 3 guarantees a positive right not to be subjected to ill-treatment, but no \u201cright\u201d whatsoever to waive this right and to be, for example, beaten, tortured or starved to death. To put it simply, both Article 2 and Article 3 are \u201cone-way avenues\u201d. The right not to be starved to death being the only right that Vincent Lambert himself could have validly claimed under Articles 2 and 3, we fail to see how it is logically possible to find any lack of \u201cconvergence of interests\u201d between him and the applicants in the present case, or even entertain the slightest doubt on this point.",

The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, in its decision of 24 June 2014, made much of the evidently casual conversations that Vincent Lambert had had with his wife (and apparently on one occasion also with his brother, Joseph Lambert) and came to the conclusion that \u201cDr Kariger [could not] be regarded as having incorrectly interpreted the wishes expressed by the patient before the accident\u201d.

In other words, the patient\u2019s wishes are, in such a situation, in no way determinative of the final outcome. The three criteria set out in Article L. 1110-5 of the Public Health Code \u2013 futility, disproportion and sustaining life artificially \u2013 are the only relevant criteria. As the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat has stated, account must be taken of any wishes expressed by the patient and particular importance must be attached to those wishes (see paragraphs 47-48 of the present judgment), but those wishes are never decisive. In other words, once the doctor in charge has, as in the instant case, decided that the third criterion applies, the die is cast and the collective procedure is essentially a mere formality.",

Every form of feeding \u2013 whether it is placing a feeding bottle in a baby\u2019s mouth, or using cutlery in the refectory to put food in one\u2019s mouth \u2013 is, to some extent, artificial, as the ingestion of the food is being mediated. But when it comes to a patient in Vincent Lambert\u2019s condition, the real question that must be asked (in the context of the concepts of proportionality and reasonableness that underpin the notion of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 2) is this: is the hydration and nutrition of benefit to the person without causing any undue burden of pain or suffering or excessive expenditure of resources? If the answer is yes, then there is a positive obligation to preserve life. If the burdens surpass the benefits, then the State\u2019s obligation may, in appropriate cases, cease. In this context we would add, moreover, that a State\u2019s margin of appreciation, referred to in paragraph 148 of the present judgment, is not unlimited, and, broad as it may be, must always be viewed in the light of the values underpinning the Convention, chief among which is the value of life. The Court has often stated that the Convention must be read as a whole (a principle referred to in paragraph\u00a0142) and interpreted (and we would say also applied) in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions and the various values enshrined therein (see, albeit in different contexts, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2005-X, and Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2012). In assessing this margin of appreciation in the circumstances of the instant case, and the method chosen by the French authorities to \u201cbalance\u201d any competing interests, the Court should therefore have given more weight to the value of life. It should also be recalled that we are not in a situation here where one can legitimately say that there may be some doubt as to whether or not there is life or \u201chuman life\u201d (such as in cases dealing with fertility and human embryos \u2013 the \u201cwhen does human life begin\u201d question). Nor is it a case where there is any doubt as to whether or not Vincent Lambert is alive. To our mind, a person in Vincent Lambert\u2019s condition is a person with fundamental human dignity and must therefore, in accordance with the principles underpinning Article 2, receive ordinary and proportionate care or treatment which includes the administering of water and food.",

It is true that this Court should not act as a fourth-instance court and that the principle of subsidiarity must be respected, but not to the point of refraining from affirming the value of life and the inherent dignity even of persons who are in a vegetative state, severely paralysed and who cannot communicate their wishes to others.",

The case before this Court is one of euthanasia, even if under a different name. In principle it is never advisable to use strong adjectives or adverbs in judicial documents, but in the instant case it certainly is utterly contradictory for the respondent Government to insist that French law prohibits euthanasia and that therefore euthanasia does not enter into the equation in this case. We cannot hold otherwise when it is clear that the criteria of the Leonetti Act, as interpreted by the highest administrative court, when applied to a person who is unconscious and undergoing \u201ctreatment\u201d which is not really therapeutic but simply a matter of nursing care, actually results in precipitating death which would not otherwise occur in the foreseeable future.",

This is particularly important for care staff, whose role is not to take life\u201d. Much has been made of this statement both by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat and by this Court. We beg to differ. Apart from the fact that, as we have already said, there is no evidence in the instant case that Mr Lambert is suffering in any way, that statement would be correct if, and only if, a proper distinction were made between ordinary care (or treatment) and extraordinary care (or treatment). Feeding a person, even enterally, is an act of ordinary care, and by withholding or withdrawing food and water death inevitably follows (which would not otherwise have occurred in the foreseeable future). One may not will the death of the subject in question, but by willing the act or omission which one knows will in all likelihood lead to that death, one actually intends to kill that subject nonetheless.
