On 28 March 2006 at around 7 a.m., the remains were taken to a mosque where around 1,5002,000 people had gathered. The crowd blocked the traffic as they carried the coffins, chanted separatist, hostile slogans in Turkish and Kurdish in support of the organisation and Abdullah \u00d6calan, the leader of the PKK, and waved PKK posters and banners. The crowd then walked to a cemetery for the burial of the deceased. The security forces did not intervene as there were relatives of the deceased, including children and old people, in the crowd. The police report stated that after the burial ceremony had been completed, a group of about 1,000 people continued to march. They were warned by the police that they were not allowed to chant illegal slogans, disseminate propaganda in support of the organisation or wave illegal flags. However, the crowd became agitated and started throwing stones at the police officers on duty, injuring a number of them and causing extensive damage to State buildings and vehicles, banks, shops and other vehicles belonging to private individuals. According to the police report, more people later joined the illegal demonstration, which continued on 29, 30 and 31 March and 1 April. The report further stated that prior to those events some media organs controlled by the PKK had called for mass protests.",

The dissenting judge noted that such an offence should be capable of producing a result for a terrorist organisation and its aims, such as the offences of aggravated injury, kidnapping, deprivation of liberty, murder or bombing. He also noted that such an offence should have devastating repercussions for society when the way of committing the offence, the time of the offence and its effects were taken into consideration. He finally opined that in order to conclude that non-members of an illegal organisation had committed an offence on behalf of that illegal organisation, there should be a decision to commit an offence on behalf of that organisation and an intention to join the organisation in question. The judge therefore concluded that the applicant should only have been convicted under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713.",

On 21 February 2007 the Ninth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation quashed the first-instance judgment, holding that F.\u00d6.\u2019s acts had constituted not only the offences for which he had been found guilty, but also membership of an illegal organisation under Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 \u00a7 3, as he had committed the offences on behalf of the organisation. The Ninth Criminal Division therefore considered that F.\u00d6. should be punished for the offence of membership of an illegal organisation and the other offences proscribed by section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 and section 32(1) and (3) of Law no. 2911.\u00a0On 31 May 2007 the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court reiterated its previous judgment that F.\u00d6.\u2019s acts had not constituted the offence proscribed by Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. The Assize Court noted, inter alia, that in order for a court to conclude that a crime had been committed on behalf of an organisation, the latter must have issued a call for action to an individual who was capable of directly committing that act, rather than to an undefined collective group. As a result of the disagreement between the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court and the Ninth Criminal Division, the case was transferred to the Plenary Court of Cassation (Criminal Divisions). On 4\u00a0March 2008 the Plenary Court decided to quash the Assize Court judgment. It held that participation in unauthorised demonstrations held after appeals by an illegal organisation and acts which constituted independent offences committed during those demonstrations could be considered as having been carried out on behalf of the organisation. The Plenary Court considered that such acts should therefore also be sanctioned under Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code on the basis of Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 \u00a7 3, along with the other criminal-law provisions. In the view of the Court of Cassation, appeals by an illegal organisation made in concrete terms through broadcasts by its media outlets did not need to target identified individuals.",

Thus, the Court has found in a number of cases that penalties imposed for taking part in a rally amounted to an interference with the right to freedom of assembly (see, for example, Ezelin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041; Osmani\u00a0and Others v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d (dec.), no.\u00a050841/99, ECHR 2001X; Mkrtchyan v.

In that connection, the Court observes that the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court, in convicting the applicant, referred to a decision of the Ninth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation of 22 March 2007 (see paragraph 20 above). The Court further notes that the same line of legal reasoning was confirmed by the decision of the Plenary Court of Cassation (Criminal Divisions) on 4 March 2008 (decision no. 2008/44) (see G\u00fclc\u00fc, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-59, and paragraph 33 above). According to Article 220 \u00a7 6, anyone who commits a crime on behalf of an illegal organisation will be punished as a member of that organisation under Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, even if he is not. In its aforementioned decisions dated 22\u00a0March 2007 and 4 March 2008, the Court of Cassation considered that Article\u00a0220 \u00a7\u00a06 of the Criminal Code imposed further criminal liability for offences committed in line with an illegal organisation\u2019s activities (see paragraphs 20 and 33 above). The Court of Cassation also held that if a person participated in a demonstration which had been called by an illegal armed organisation, there was no need for such calls to target particular individuals. It found that under Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, any offence during such a demonstration meant the offender should be considered as having acted on behalf of the organisation concerned, with its knowledge and in line with its wishes and, as a result, be punished for being a member of that organisation.",

The mere fact of being present at a demonstration, called for by an illegal organisation, and openly acting in a manner expressing a positive opinion towards the organisation in question, is sufficient to be considered acting \u201con behalf of\u201d the organisation authorising the punishing of the person in question as an actual member. The Court notes in contrast that when Article 314 of the Criminal Code is applied alone, the domestic courts must have regard to the \u201ccontinuity, diversity and intensity\u201d of the acts of the accused (see paragraph 100 of the Opinion on Articles 216, 299, 301 and 314 of the Penal Code of Turkey of the Venice Commission, in paragraph 34 above), whereas when the same Article was applied in connection with Article 220 \u00a7 6, in the applicant\u2019s case, he was convicted of membership of an armed organisation merely on account of his attendance at two public meetings, which, according to the first-instance court, were held in line with the instructions by the PKK, and his acts therein, that is to say, walking close to coffins and making a \u201cV\u201d sign during the funeral and applauding during the demonstration. Hence, the Court finds that when applied in connection with Article 220 \u00a7 6, the criteria for a conviction under Article 314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code were extensively applied to the detriment of the applicant.",

The Court does not underestimate the difficulties to which the fight against terrorism has given rise (see Incal v.\u00a0Turkey, 9 June 1998, \u00a7 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV, and D\u00f6ner and Others v.

The Court notes that when demonstrators, such as the applicant, face the charge of membership of an illegal armed organisation, they risk an additional sentence of between five and ten years in prison, a sanction which is strikingly severe and grossly disproportionate to their conduct. The Court finds therefore that Article 220 \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code, as applied in the instant case, would inevitably have a particularly chilling effect on the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. Moreover, the application of the provision at issue was not only likely to deter those who were found criminally liable from reexercising their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention, but also had a great deal of potential to deter other members of the public from attending demonstrations and, more generally, from participating in open political debate (see, mutatis mutandis, Huseynli and Others v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos.\u00a067360/11 and 2 others, \u00a7 99, 11 February 2016; S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi and Others v.

The discretion granted could be wide or narrow. In order for the individual to be able to foresee the consequences of his or her conduct, the Court has held that \u201cit would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power\u201d (see Malone v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, \u00a7 68, 2 August 1984, Series A no. 82; see also, in the more recent case-law of the Grand Chamber, Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v.\u00a0the Netherlands [GC], no. 38224/03, \u00a7 82, 14 September 2010, and Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, \u00a7 230, ECHR 2015).

Instead, it found that his conviction, in part because of his participation in a march called by the PKK, had not been necessary in a democratic society. We see no reason why the same approach should not have been followed in the present case.
