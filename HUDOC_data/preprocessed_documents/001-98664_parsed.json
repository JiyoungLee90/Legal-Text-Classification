The Istanbul State Security Court dismissed this request, stating that the accused could lodge their complaints themselves with the public prosecutor's office and that there was no need for the court to do so (see paragraph 18 above). Furthermore, in its decision of 2 March 2000, the  made no reference to the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment. It is also noted that in his appeal petition the applicant solely challenged the use by the domestic court of his police statement obtained allegedly under torture, and did not repeat or give any details regarding his alleged torture with a view to requesting the authorities to initiate a criminal investigation. In the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the failure of the judicial authorities to act must have become gradually apparent to the applicant by 2 March 2000, the date on which the  rendered its decision on the matter. Therefore the applicant should have been aware of the ineffectiveness of remedies in domestic law by that date. Accordingly, the six-month period provided for in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention should be considered to have started running no later than 2\u00a0March 2000 (see Kanat v.

This involves an examination of the \u201cunlawfulness\u201d in question and, where violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see, among others, Jalloh v.

This right presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained by coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100, and Kolu, \u00a7 51, both cited above). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054).",

These elements were subsequently relied upon by the  to convict her. In this connection, the Court reiterates that incriminating evidence \u2013 whether in the form of a confession or material evidence \u2013 obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment which can be characterised as torture, should never be relied on as proof of the victim's guilt, irrespective of its probative value. Any other conclusion would only serve to legitimate indirectly the sort of morally reprehensible conduct which the authors of Article 3 of the Convention sought to proscribe or, in other words, to \u201cafford brutality the cloak of law\u201d (see Harutyunyan v. , no. 36549/03, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2007VIII).",

In this connection, the Court notes that, even though the applicant denied the accuracy of the contents of the statement taken from him in the absence of legal assistance, and alleged, by referring to the medical reports contained in the case file, that he had been ill-treated in police custody where the statement had been extracted from him, the Istanbul Assize Court relied on that statement when convicting him, despite the fact that Turkish legislation does not usually attach consequences to any confessions obtained during questioning, but later denied in court, which are decisive for the prospects of the defence (see paragraph\u00a039 above).",

They submitted that the State Security Court had been biased, had invented facts, refused their requests for additional investigations and the confrontation of witnesses, and had been unduly influenced by prejudicial reports prepared by the police in breach of the right to be presumed innocent.
