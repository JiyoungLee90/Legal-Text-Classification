The case originated in an application (no. 46218/09) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a company registered under Hungarian law, Turul Kft (“the applicant”), on 25 August 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr I. Barbalics, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 3 January 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant is a limited liability company with its seat in Lovas.
The Veszprém County Administrative Office rejected the request of the applicant, a real-estate developer, for a building permit to construct a three-flat condominium. The Office was of the view that the project was irreconcilable with the planned location, the historical neighbourhood of Veszprém town.
On 21 June 2001 the applicant challenged this decision in court.
On 25 March 2003 the Veszprém County Regional Court quashed the administrative decision and remitted the case to the administrative authorities.
In the resumed administrative proceedings, on 2 March 2007 the applicant’s request was again dismissed.
On 18 April 2007 the applicant renewed its action.
On 31 October 2007 the Regional Court dismissed the action, holding that the administrative decisions had been given in compliance with the law.
On 25 February 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed, on the merits, the applicant’s petition for review (service: 14 April 2009).
