The case originated in an application (no. 10636/06) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Ms Maria Violeta Lăzărescu (“the applicant”), on 8 March 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr George Tudor Laurenţiu, a lawyer practising in . The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu.
On 23 March 2007 the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

In 1950 the State seized under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation the building situated in , Cobălcescu no. 36, property of the applicant's ancestor.
On 1 June 1999 company R.V., a State-owned company responsible for the management of property belonging to the State, sold a 104,98 sq. m. flat of the building and the appurtenant land to the tenants, V.D and D.M., under Law no. 112/1995.
On 20 November 2002, the applicant sought annulment of the contract before the Bucharest Court of First Instance requesting the court to declare the nationalisation of her property unlawful and to order its return to her.
On 9 September 2005, the Bucharest Court of Appeal, in the operative part of a final decision, dismissed as groundless an appeal on points of law by the applicant. In the reasoning of the judgment the court considered that although the seizure was null and void the bona fide principle should apply to the tenants who bought the flat from the State, who at that time was its legal owner.
On an unknown date the applicant lodged an application with the administrative authorities for restitution in kind of the property under Law no. 10/2001 governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the State. Since she had not received any answer, she brought court proceedings against the Mayor of Bucharest seeking to have him ordered to issue a reasoned decision upon her request.

On 22 May 2007 the Bucharest Court of Appeal dismissed the Mayor appeal. There is no evidence in the file as to the course of the proceedings.
