Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25; and, recently, Uzeyir Jafarov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 54204/08, \u00a7 57, 29\u00a0January 2015; and Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7 82, 28 September 2015). However, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999\u2011V). Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000VII, and Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7 83).",

Such an investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible.

The Government, however, did not comment on the applicant\u2019s other injuries. Apart from the injury on the face, the applicant had bruises on the scalp which, according to the forensic medical expert, could have been inflicted by hard blunt objects shortly before he was taken to hospital on 15\u00a0February 2005 (see paragraph 33 above). The expert\u2019s finding is consistent with the allegation of the applicant being punched on the head. Neither the Government\u2019s submissions nor the evidence in the case file suggest that all of the \u201cbruises\u201d (plural) on the scalp could have been sustained as a result of a single impact of the applicant\u2019s head with the glass. As regards the concussion, according to the forensic medical expert opinion it could have been caused either by the applicant hitting the bookcase with his head or by being punched on the head (see the expert\u2019s statements in paragraph\u00a041 above). The Court notes that the ambulance medical assistant N., who examined the applicant shortly after his head had been hit against the glass of the bookcase, did not detect symptoms of concussion (see N.\u2019s statements in paragraph 37 above). This gives some credence to the applicant\u2019s assertion that he had been punched on the head after being seen by the ambulance team.",

The mere fact of an investigating authority\u2019s refusal to open a criminal investigation into credible allegations of serious illtreatment in police custody is indicative of the State\u2019s failure to comply with its obligation under Article\u00a03 to carry out an effective investigation (see Lyapin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a046956/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0129 and\u00a0132-36, 24\u00a0July 2014).",

While the applicant made a credible assertion of ill-treatment by police officers, the investigating authority dismissed his allegations as manifestly illfounded on the basis of the results of the preliminary inquiry, and refused to open a criminal investigation. As regards the judicial review of the investigating authority\u2019s refusal to open a criminal case, while noting that such important investigative measure as an identity parade, which would enable the applicant to identify the police officers who had allegedly subjected him to ill-treatment, could only be carried out once a criminal case was opened, the domestic courts did not indicate why they regarded the investigator\u2019s refusal to open a criminal case as \u201creasoned and logical\u201d (see paragraphs 44-45 above). The Court would further note that despite being alerted promptly about the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment at the police station (see paragraphs 19-21 above), the authorities carried out the applicant\u2019s forensic medical examination only with a month\u2019s delay (see paragraph 33 above).

Though that information was later communicated to the expert and his opinion was sought (see paragraph 41 above), such an important question \u2013 as to whether all of the bruises on the applicant\u2019s head could have been sustained as a result of a single impact against the glass \u2013 was never put to a medical expert. Furthermore, it does not appear that the police premises were searched for the objects \u2013 a rope and metal bar \u2013 allegedly used for the applicant\u2019s illtreatment.",

What it did imply was that the act and harm, if inflicted, did not fall within the sphere of interests protected by the criminal law. However, the act and harm in question could fall within the sphere of interests protected by the law on administrative offences or civil law on tort. Accordingly, decisions for termination of criminal proceedings or refusal to initiate criminal proceedings did not prevent the lodging of a civil-law action seeking compensation for the harm sustained. In civil proceedings a court would establish the fact of harm and the causal link between the harm and the acts of the respondent. The right to bring a civil action where, as in the present case, a decision not to initiate criminal proceedings had been taken, followed from the constitutional interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
