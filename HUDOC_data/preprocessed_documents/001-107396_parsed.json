The initial refusal to initiate criminal proceedings did not contain any reference at all to the available medical evidence. The Court further observes that none of the eight refusals to initiate criminal proceedings contained any objective analysis of the medical findings as to the origin and the time of infliction with regard to each particular group of injuries. The Court also finds it hard to explain why the report on the applicant\u2019s additional forensic medical examination, finalised already in July 2003, was not taken into consideration by the investigation authority until 19\u00a0May 2006. At the same time, the Court cannot help but notice that the results of this additional report were quite important to the inquiry as they invalidated the hospital diagnosis of brain concussion, altered the supposed time of infliction of the abrasions and reviewed the assessment of the severity of the sustained injuries (in particular, the abrasions, see paragraph 20 above).",
