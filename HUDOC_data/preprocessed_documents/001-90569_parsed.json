The Court considers that the normal use of an applicant\u2019s procedural rights, without the appearance of overusing them or lodging numerous manifestly ill-founded or trivial requests, cannot lead to the conclusion that the responsibility for the excessive length of proceedings is attributable to the applicant (see, by contrast, Malicka-W\u0105sowska no. 41413/98 (dec.) and Buchholz v.\u00a0Germany, judgment of 6\u00a0May\u00a01981, Series\u00a0A\u00a0no.\u00a042, pp.\u00a021-22,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a063).
