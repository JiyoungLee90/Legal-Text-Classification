However, it ruled in the applicant\u2019s favour because it found that pursuant to her employment contract, her job as director of the company had ended on 1\u00a0October 2007, when the company had been required to transfer her to another job. That meant that she could not have been dismissed from her job as director, let alone dismissed with retroactive effect, as the decision to remove her had indicated. Furthermore, since the decision to dismiss her had specifically related only to her job as director, it could not be assumed that it had also entailed the termination of her entire employment relationship with the company, including the job to which she was supposed to have been transferred after 1\u00a0October 2007. The court thus found that the dismissal had been wrongful and that the applicant\u2019s employment relationship had not been terminated. It accordingly ordered that she be reinstated and assigned to another job within the company.",

However, it had soon become apparent that the land on which certain of the parking lots (\u017durkovo and Viktor Lenac) had been built or planned was not owned by the Municipality but by third parties. The applicant, as the director of the company, had therefore notified the Municipality that the collection of parking fees and the carrying out of some other projects (such as the construction of a dry dock marina) on such land could not commence until the property issues had been resolved, that is until the Municipality had become the owner of the land.",

However, that had resulted in two civil proceedings (for repayment of parking fees and for a declaration of ownership) with the owner of the parking lot (see paragraphs 19-20 above), both of which the company had lost. The applicant had stopped charging parking fees for that land as soon as the company had been sued to repay the fees it had collected.",

He had publicly criticised the quality of her performance as the director of the company by stressing that the company had stagnated under her leadership, an opinion which he had illustrated by mentioning some of her business decisions which he had considered unsound (see paragraph 7 above). In other words, when making the impugned statements and revealing the alleged unlawful activities of the company she had headed, the applicant had been motivated exclusively by a wish to protect her public image rather than by a genuine concern for the company\u2019s business interests or the interests of those who used its services. For that reason the present case should not be regarded as a so-called whistle-blower case, nor should her detailed explanation for the origin of her conflict with M.U. (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a028-30 above) be of any relevance. In that connection the Government referred to the Court\u2019s case-law (see Guja v. Moldova [GC], no. 14277/04, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR 2008) under which acts motivated by a personal grievance or personal antagonism did not justify a particularly strong level of protection under Article 10 of the Convention.",

In particular, the two sets of civil proceedings referred to by the applicant (see paragraphs 19-20 and 29 above) were still ongoing. The Government also noted that the applicant had offered no evidence of such alleged unlawfulness before the courts that had decided on the lawfulness of her dismissal. In the Government\u2019s view those allegations thus remained nothing but arbitrary and unproven assertions detrimental to the business reputation of the municipal utility company. That view was further reinforced by the fact that in her observations to the Court the applicant had not even attempted to explain why she had believed that the prosecuting authorities should have intervened over the allegedly unlawful charging for parking. On the contrary, she had submitted that there had been no grounds to lodge a criminal complaint in that regard (see\u00a0paragraph 32 above). That suggested that the applicant had been aware that no crime had been committed but had nevertheless called for the intervention of the prosecuting authorities. That further meant that she had deliberately misled the public to believe that the company she had headed had been involved in criminal activities.",

Therefore, even though KD Kostrena primarily provided public utility services (see paragraph 6 above) that did not mean that it had no commercial interests to protect, which could be jeopardised by tarnishing its business reputation. That was especially so because, apart from public utility services, the company also provided some commercial services (such as leasing sports facilities) and as such competed on the open market. Tarnishing its business reputation could therefore lead to difficulties in charging for the public utility services and to reduced interest in its commercial services. The Government stressed that the applicant\u2019s statements insinuating that the company had been engaged in criminal activities had been particularly harmful for its business reputation and, consequently, for its commercial interests because she had been the company\u2019s director and as such, in the eyes of the average reader, a trustworthy source of information.",

Her only motivation for doing so had been to protect her own interests in the public debate with the mayor of the municipality, which had been the company\u2019s sole shareholder. In his media statements M.U. had criticised the applicant only for unsound business decisions rather than for any unlawfulness in doing business, meaning she had not needed to defend herself. The applicant had indisputably had the right to publicly deny media allegations which harmed her reputation, or institute the relevant proceedings, or do both of those things. However, in response to M.U.\u2019s criticism the applicant had picked as her \u201cweapon of choice\u201d in the public debate the alleged unlawful charging for parking, which she had also mentioned as being of interest to the prosecuting authorities. That was how she had involved the company of which she had been the director in her media debate with the mayor, causing harm to its business reputation. That was also why she had been dismissed from her job, a measure which, albeit severe, had not been disproportionate in the circumstances and which had therefore been \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, it being understood that no employer should tolerate being slandered in public by its employees.",

In particular, the Court cannot disregard the fact that the applicant made the impugned statements only after she had herself been criticised in the media by the chairman of the company\u2019s General Meeting. It is true that \u201ca duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion\u201d normally prevents employees from publicly criticising the work of their employers (see, for example, Wojtas-Kaleta, cited above, \u00a7 43, 16\u00a0July\u00a02009, and Guja, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070). However, in the present case it was another officer of the company, namely the chairman of the company\u2019s General Meeting, who had been the first to resort to the media and had publicly criticised the applicant\u2019s work. The Court considers that in such specific circumstances it could not have been expected of the applicant that she should remain silent and not defend her reputation in the same way. To do so would overstretch her duty of loyalty, contrary to Article 10 of the Convention which, inter alia, requires that an employee\u2019s freedom of expression is secured against unreasonable demands of loyalty by his or her employer (see Predota v. Austria (dec.), no. 28962/95, 18\u00a0January 2000, and Rommelfanger v. Germany, no. 12242/86, Commission decision of 6\u00a0September 1989, Decisions and Reports (DR) 62, pp. 151 and 161).",

For example, in the case of Nilsen and Johnsen v.

The Court further considers that the operation of a municipal public utility company is a matter of general interest for the local community. The Court therefore agrees with the applicant that even though the main aim of her statements had been to deny M.U.\u2019s accusations rather than to point to irregularities, the information she gave in reply was of public interest (see paragraph 34 above).",

Rather, she stated that the company had been charging for parking on land which was not owned by Kostrena Municipality (see paragraph 8 above). The Government did not seem to call into question the fact that the company had indeed been collecting fees from the parking lots at issue. Likewise, apart from submitting that the relevant proceedings were ongoing (see paragraph 39 above), the Government did not challenge the fact that those parking lots had been located on someone else\u2019s land. That being so, and having regard to the information in the land register (see paragraphs 19 and 30 above), the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s statement concerning the collection of parking fees did not contain factual inaccuracies.",

Even though both parties seem to agree that that was a statement of fact (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the Court disagrees because the use of the adjective \u201cunlawful\u201d suggests that the applicant was merely drawing an inference from the facts discussed above (see\u00a0the\u00a0preceding paragraph). The Court reiterates that drawing inferences from existing facts is generally intended to convey opinions, and is thus more akin to value judgments (see Stojanovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 23160/09, \u00a7\u00a069, 19\u00a0September 2013). Therefore, the applicant\u2019s statement implying that the company had been unlawfully charging for parking is to be seen as a value judgment which had a sufficient factual basis because it could reasonably be argued that collecting parking fees on someone else\u2019s land was unlawful.",

The applicant stated, in particular (see paragraph 8 above): \u201cGiven that my work has been called into question I demand an audit of KD Kostrena, and the involvement of [the prosecuting authorities].\u201d That sentence, taken together with the general defensive tone of her other statements in the same article, cannot, in the Court\u2019s view, leave an impression in the mind of the average reader that the company was involved in criminal activities. That statement holds true if for no other reason than that the applicant, being the company\u2019s director, would otherwise have effectively implicated herself in such activities. On the contrary, reading the impugned article, and that sentence in particular, leaves the impression that the applicant was so firmly persuaded that there was nothing wrong in the way she had been running the company that she was even ready to submit to an audit and an investigation by the prosecuting authorities with a view to definitively dispelling any uncertainty in that respect. Therefore, contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s view, which was reiterated by the Government (see paragraphs 16 and 42-43 above), the Court does not find that the applicant insinuated that what, in her view, had amounted to unlawful charging for parking by the company had also constituted a criminal offence.",

If national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate (see Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, ECHR 2000-XI). In this connection the Court notes that under section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 24 above) an applicant may seek the reopening of the civil proceedings in respect of which the Court has found a violation of the Convention. Given the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention and the reasons for which it has found a violation of that Article, the Court considers that in the present case the most appropriate way to repair the consequences of that violation would be to reopen the proceedings complained of. As domestic law allows such reparation to be made, the Court considers that there is no call to award the applicant any sum in respect of pecuniary damage. It therefore rejects that claim.",
