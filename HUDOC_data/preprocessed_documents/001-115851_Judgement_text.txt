The case originated in an application (no. 30544/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Nikolay Ivanov Dimitrov (“the applicant”), on 26 April 2006.
The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Kotseva, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 19 May 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Silistra.
On 3 September 1997 the applicant was charged with fraud.
Between 3 September and 12 December 1997 he was in custody.
On 27 March 2000 the  found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment.
On 12 October 2000 the  Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and remitted the case for further investigation.
On 31 October 2002 the prosecuting authorities terminated the proceedings as it had not been established that the applicant had committed a criminal offence.
On 4 December 2002 the applicant brought an action for damages under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (“the SMRDA”). He initially sought 60,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN), later reduced to BGN 40,000 (equivalent to 20,450 euros (EUR)), in nonpecuniary damages stemming from his pre-trial detention and the criminal proceedings against him.
On 27 October 2003 the  found that compensation was due under section 2(2) SMRDA as it had not been established that the applicant had committed a criminal offence. It awarded the applicant BGN 6,000 (EUR 3,067) in non-pecuniary damages.
On 6 April 2004 the Varna Court of Appeal upheld the judgment.
In a final judgment of 28 October 2005 the Supreme Court of Cassation increased the amount of damages awarded to BGN 9,000 (EUR 4,601).
The courts further applied section 10 § 2 of the SMRDA and ordered the applicant to pay in total BGN 2,480 (EUR 1,268) in court fees, which represented 4% of the dismissed part of his claim.
The relevant provisions of the SMRDA in respect of the court fees are summarised in paragraphs §§ 19-21 of the Court’s judgment in the case of Stankov v. Bulgaria, no. 68490/01, 12 July 2007.
Following that judgment, the SMRDA was amended with effect from 30 May 2008, introducing, in the new section 9a, a simple court fee, irrespective of the amount of the claim.
