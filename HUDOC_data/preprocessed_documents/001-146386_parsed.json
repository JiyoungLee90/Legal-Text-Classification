The avenue suggested by the Government, that is, a public-law complaint in civil proceedings, would not be an effective remedy because such proceedings would not have any bearing on the validity of the judicial decision of 22 March 2006, which authorised an unlawful search at the applicant\u2019s home. For as long as the decision of 22\u00a0March 2006 remained in force, it would be futile to seek a declaration of unlawfulness of the search. In so far as section 5 of the Operational-Search Activities Act provides that an appeal against the actions of the police lay to the same District Court as that which issued the authorisation, it essentially required another judge of the same level of jurisdiction to give legal assessment to a valid decision of his or her fellow judge. Such an assessment would be unavoidable since the police would base a justification of the search on the judicial authorisation which allowed them to proceed as they did. In these circumstances, the procedure under section 5 of the Operational-Search Activities Act would be a mere formality and would not meet the criteria of an effective remedy. The applicant pointed out that the Russian courts at two levels of jurisdiction replied to him that the decision of 22 March 2006 was not amenable to judicial review. His application to the Constitutional Court was likewise fruitless. Lastly, the applicant emphasised that the existing legislation allowed the courts to authorise operational-search activities in respect of any person and on any grounds, without incurring a risk that the authorisation would later be quashed or set aside by a higher court.",

Both section 5 of the Operational-Search Activities Act and Article 245 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for judicial review of the actions of State officials, that is, the way in which they acted while opening an operative file against the individual concerned and took operational-search measures (see the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 14 July 1998, cited in paragraph 16 above). Such review does not touch upon the validity of the underlying judicial authorisation of such measures.

The Court is also sensitive to the applicant\u2019s argument that a judge of the same level of jurisdiction in civil proceedings can neither review the substance of a judicial act which has not been appealed against, nor set it aside. In those proceedings, the domestic courts are not capable of providing a remedy because it is not open to them to deal with the substance of the Convention complaint that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his home was not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d; still less is it open to them to grant appropriate relief in connection with the complaint (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2001IX).",

The Court does not consider that the fact that the warrant was obtained in an ex parte procedure was problematic in itself. However, the mere fact that an application for a warrant has been subject to initial judicial scrutiny will not in itself necessarily amount to a sufficient safeguard against abuse (see Gerashchenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 20602/05, \u00a7 130, 7 November 2013; Iliya Stefanov, cited above, \u00a7 39; and Tamosius (dec.), cited above). The Court must rather examine the particular circumstances and evaluate whether the legal framework and the limits on the powers exercised were an adequate protection against arbitrary interference by the authorities. In previous Russian cases it was the vagueness and excessively broad terms of search warrants giving the authority executing them unrestricted discretion in determining the scope of the search that were considered to be the decisive element for the finding of a violation of Article 8 (see Kolesnichenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 19856/04, \u00a7 33, 9\u00a0April 2009; Aleksanyan v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a046468/06, \u00a7 216, 22 December 2008; and Smirnov v. Russia, no.\u00a071362/01, \u00a7 47, 7 June 2007).",

                                                "content": "44.\u00a0\u00a0The failure to delineate the scope of the search and a lack of any safeguards which would confine the impact of the measure to reasonable bounds were particularly salient in the instant case. The judicial authorisation of 22 March 2006 did not refer to any pending proceedings or identify the offence or offences the applicant was suspected of, any reasons for raising such a suspicion or any evidence capable of corroborating it. This was in breach of the requirements of section 8 of the Operational-Search Activities Act, which established that operational-search measures interfering with an individual\u2019s right to respect for his home could only be taken if there was information about a criminal offence or its perpetrators. Furthermore, the judge did not specify what objects or items \u201cprohibited from free circulation or criminally acquired\u201d might be located at the applicant\u2019s house and what facts allowed him to reach the conclusion that the applicant was in possession of any such objects. Finally, the decision did not contain any information about the purpose of the search or the reasons why it was believed that a search of the applicant\u2019s house would enable evidence of an offence to be obtained. In sum, the Court finds that the decision of 22 March 2006 did not state any reasons for the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his home which it could describe as \u201crelevant\u201d and still less as \u201csufficient\u201d. That decision, which was moreover not amenable to further review, did not impose any meaningful limits on the power exercised by the police and was too lax and full of loopholes for the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to have been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Smirnov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47).",
