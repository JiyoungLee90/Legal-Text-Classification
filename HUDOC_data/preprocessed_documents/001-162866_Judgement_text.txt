The case originated in an application (no. 7159/12) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Australian national, Mr James John McInnes (“the applicant”), on 30 December 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr D. Ninković, a lawyer practising in Belgrade. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Ms V. Rodić, their Agent at the time.
On 18 November 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Cres Salisbury East, Australia.
On 19 March 1985 the applicant sustained injuries in a traffic accident caused by the vehicles owned by the Danilo Bošković A.D. - Grdelica and Srbijatrans – Niš, both State/socially-owned companies (the debtors).
On 23 November 2001 and 1 July 2008 the First Municipal Court in Belgrade rendered two separate judgments ordering the debtors to pay the applicant certain sums as compensation for the sustained damages.
Due to the debtors’ failure to fulfil their obligations from these decisions, the applicant submitted enforcement requests. On 7 October 2005 and 18 October 2010, respectively, the First Municipal Court in Belgrade issued enforcement orders to that effect. The enforcement proceedings are still pending and the above decisions remain unenforced.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially owned companies, as well as the enforcement and insolvency proceedings is outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and §§ 71-76, 15 January 2008 and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia (dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013. Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional appeals and the privatisation of socially owned companies, are outlined in the admissibility decision in Marinković v. Serbia (dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26-29 and §§ 3144, 29 January 2013; and the judgment in Marinković v. Serbia, no. 5353/11, §§ 29-32, 22 October 2013.
