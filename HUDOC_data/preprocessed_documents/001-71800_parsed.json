The method of assessment adopted by the applicant presupposed that the property would increase in value, that it could fetch the rent that the applicant had actually sought, or that she would have leased her house in normal conditions. No examples of comparative sales and rents in the area had been supplied. The calculations were based on the assumption that at the material time there had been development potential in the area where the property was situated. The assumption that the property market would have continued to flourish with sustained growth during the material time was highly questionable. In the Government\u2019s view the Court should not accept the percentage increases put forward by the applicant. To claim damages now for loss of use on the basis of the rent that the property could have fetched if it had been leased would mean enrichment on an inequitable basis.
