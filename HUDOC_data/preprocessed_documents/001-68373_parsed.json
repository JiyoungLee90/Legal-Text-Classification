The Court notes that the applicant raised before the courts the issue of the damage caused by the entry into his flat and his prolonged inability to use the flat, and that his request therefore went beyond the confines of a simple landlord-tenant dispute.",

In the Court's view, however, that question was clearly and indisputably relevant to the assessment of the applicant's claim for damages.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that its task is not to take the place of the domestic authorities in determining the most appropriate way of proceeding in this case, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions that the authorities have taken in the exercise of their powers of appreciation (see Cvijeti\u0107 v.

In particular, the Institute could have taken note of the fact that since January 1996 the applicant and his wife had been living, not in Vladimir, in , but with relatives in Kotovsk.",

This applies all the more to the period following the delivery of the final, enforceable judgment of 6 January 1999. On the basis of all the evidence before it, the Court can detect no sign of any such initiative on the part of the Institute (see also L\u00f3pez Ostra, cited above, p. 47, \u00a7 21, p. 55, \u00a7 53, and p. 56, \u00a7 57).",

In particular, it meant that a separate set of proceedings had to be opened seeking to set aside the decision granting T. private ownership of the flat and to have him evicted (see paragraphs 25 and 28 above). The Court notes that the Melitopol City Court found the Institute's decision to transfer the flat into private ownership to be unlawful. That being so, the Court is surprised that the Government should have criticised the applicant for not requesting the eviction at the outset (see paragraph 60 above).",
