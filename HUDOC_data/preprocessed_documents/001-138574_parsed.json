It notes that despite the substantial number of investigative measures taken, the investigation was criticised by the national authorities themselves for a lack of efficiency (see paragraph 38 above). Furthermore, the criminal proceedings in question were marked by numerous referrals for additional investigation caused, inter alia, by the investigator\u2019s failure to follow the instructions of the supervisory authorities (ibid). The criminal proceedings in question were also marked by numerous changes of investigator and an unusually high number of repeated expert examinations. It may be that in certain circumstances a repeated expert examination might be required to clarify the circumstances of the case. In the present case, however, the fact that the same type of forensic examination was ordered several times (see paragraphs 23, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 39 above) within the same criminal case suggests a lack of a comprehensive approach to the collection of evidence during the pre-trial investigation phase. The Court considers that a delay of seven years in bringing to accountability the person responsible for the death of the applicants\u2019 next of kin was incompatible with the State\u2019s obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation of suspicious deaths.",
