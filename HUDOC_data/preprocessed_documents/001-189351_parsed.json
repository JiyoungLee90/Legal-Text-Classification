The article stated that dozens of children from the orphanage in which the applicants had been placed in Bulgaria had been subjected to systematic sexual abuse by staff members and outsiders, in particular at a discotheque in a holiday village. The article described an organised network, with acts of paedophilia and violence, including threatening with weapons, being carried out by masked men, and stated that some scenes had been videoed. It stated that the youngest children had been the victims of one of the older children, who had entered their dormitory, and that the first applicant had reported the incidents to the director of the orphanage, who had done nothing. The author of the article said that he had travelled to Bulgaria in December 2012 and had visited the places described by the applicants, which, he said, matched their descriptions. He had made informal contact with a police officer and had passed on the information given to him by the applicants\u2019 parents.

She found that the investigation carried out appeared to have been comprehensive and did not reveal that the applicants had been subjected to ill-treatment in the orphanage. She noted that the applicants\u2019 initial statements to the psychologists and their replies when questioned by the prosecutor at the Italian Youth Court had been at variance with each other and that the circumstances in which they had allegedly witnessed acts of a sexual nature were not clear. She considered it likely that the applicants had witnessed touching of a sexual nature between other children and had repeated similar acts between themselves, and that in view of their adoptive parents\u2019 disapproval of such behaviour and in order to avoid upsetting them, they had made up a story in which they were victims of abuse.",

The public prosecutor\u2019s office ordered an inspection to be carried out by the police and the Svishtov child protection department. A further check was carried out by the Strahilovo social services, on the orders of the mayor, concerning the same report.

The Court notes that in the present case the prosecuting authorities were faced with two contradictory versions: on the one hand, that of the applicants\u2019 parents, and on the other hand that of the orphanage staff and the other persons questioned in the course of the investigation, including the children living in the orphanage. While the genuineness of the applicants\u2019 testimony, which the Italian psychologists and prosecuting authorities deemed credible, cannot be called into question, the fact remains that their statements, which were the only direct evidence available to the Bulgarian authorities, were succinctly worded and contained few factual details, in particular owing to the applicants\u2019 young age and their weak command of Italian at the time the statements were taken (see paragraphs 7-11 above). The Court further notes that the Bulgarian authorities did not have an opportunity to question the applicants (see paragraph 36 above). Furthermore, the applicants\u2019 allegations of violence were not corroborated by any medical certificate. In these circumstances, the Bulgarian authorities\u2019 conclusion that the investigative measures carried out had not disclosed sufficient evidence to establish that any abuse had occurred does not appear arbitrary or unreasonable.",

As regards the third investigation, which was opened following the request made by the Italian authorities in January 2014, the Court notes that the latter were informed of the investigation\u2019s findings. It is true that the information was transmitted after several months\u2019 delay and only after the Italian authorities had made a fresh request for information in January 2015. Nevertheless, the Court considers that this fact does not constitute grounds for finding that the applicants\u2019 parents were deprived of the possibility of participating in the investigation. It notes that, under domestic law, it was open to the parents to appeal against the discontinuance order. Moreover, the letter which they wrote and which was transmitted by the Italian Ministry of Justice was treated as an appeal and was duly examined by the higherranking prosecutor\u2019s office (see paragraphs 43-49 above).",

In particular, the reports noted that access to the orphanage by outside visitors was subject to checks; that outsiders and male employees could enter the parts of the premises reserved for the children only where necessary and when accompanied by a female member of staff; that the children were seen regularly by an outside general practitioner and by the orphanage\u2019s psychologist; and that they had access to a telephone and to the number of a helpline for children in danger.",

As regards the allegation that the first applicant had told the director and that the latter had failed to take action, the investigation established that, contrary to the applicants\u2019 statements, the director of the orphanage was not called E., and that another employee who had that forename denied having been informed of any incidents of that nature. Likewise, the children\u2019s files and the statements made by the general practitioner and the orphanage\u2019s psychologist did not disclose any evidence of such abuse. In view of the investigators\u2019 findings, the Court is not in a position to draw a different conclusion in this regard. Moreover, it is clear from the documents in the case file that, contrary to the applicants\u2019 assertions, the criminal investigation instituted following complaints made by other children from the orphanage, notably by M., did not concern similar facts to those complained of by the applicants (see paragraph 52 above). As to the situation regarding other children adopted in Italy (see paragraph 70 above in fine), even assuming it to be proven, there is nothing to indicate that the Bulgarian authorities were aware of any acts of abuse committed against other children at the material time.",
