The case originated in an application (no. 66742/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by thirty-nine Greek nationals (“the applicants”), whose names appear in the list annexed hereto, on 6 December 2000.
In a judgment delivered on 8 July 2004 (“the principal judgment”), the Court held unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. More specifically, it held that no reasonable balance had been struck between the public interest and the requirements of the protection of the applicants’ rights. The Court also held unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the Convention as regards the length of the proceedings (see Katsoulis and Others v. Greece, no. 66742/01, §§ 35 and 42, 8 July 2004).
Under Article 41 of the Convention the applicants sought just satisfaction of several million euros for damage sustained and costs and expenses.
Since the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicants to submit, within six months from the date on which the principal judgment would become final, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., § 48, and point 3 of the operative provisions).
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
The Government filed their observations on the applicants’ claims for just satisfaction on 30 March 2005. On 6 July 2005 the President of the Chamber concerned refused to include in the case file the applicants’ observations in reply of 7 June 2005, filed outside the time-limit (Rule 38 § 1).
