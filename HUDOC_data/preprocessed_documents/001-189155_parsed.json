In particular, as established by the Judicial System Act and confirmed by the Constitutional Court, only retired judges who have served for at least ten years can be re-appointed as acting judges in accordance with the procedure set out in the Judicial Status Act (see paragraphs 30 and 32 above). The Court notes that the said Federal Constitutional Law was in force at the relevant time and its provisions should have been applied to the reappointment of retired judges Ms\u00a0G. and Ms\u00a0Ch. to the office of justice of the peace. However, the Court discerns nothing in the Government\u2019s submissions to support their argument that the re-appointment of Ms\u00a0G. and Ms\u00a0Ch. to the office was in compliance with the legislative requirements. Prior to their retirement, Ms\u00a0G. and Ms\u00a0Ch. had served in office for approximately eight years and nine and a half years respectively. Nevertheless, despite the insufficient length of service, both of them were re-appointed to serve as justices of the peace. Neither the domestic courts nor the Government referred to any domestic provision that would justify the exemption from the rule set forth by the Federal Constitutional Law. The Government\u2019s argument that the Judicial Status Act, at the relevant time, did not indicate the requirement as to the minimum term of office necessary for the re-appointment of a retired judge has no bearing in the circumstances of the case. As noted above, the requirement as regards the minimum term of office for a retired judge to be re-appointed was clearly provided for by the Judicial System Act in force at the relevant time.",
