According to a general principle of law in , a decision by the Supreme Court rejecting, in full or in part, a claim by an individual to be granted a benefit from a public authority has legal force (lainvoima, laga kraft), in the sense that it may not be the subject of a further appeal. However, it is not res judicata (oikeusvoima, r\u00e4ttskraft). The claimant may at any time, by means of a fresh application, request the competent authority to reconsider the claim (see, inter alia, Jaakko Uotila, Seppo Laakso, Teuvo Pohjolainen, Jarmo Vuorinen, pp. 186-89 in Yleishallinto-oikeus p\u00e4\u00e4piirteitt\u00e4in,  1989). This principle also applies to a request for compensation under the 1948 Act.",

The notion of \"fair hearing\" required that the applicant himself should have been given the opportunity to assess their relevance and weight and to formulate any such comments as he deemed appropriate.

The applicant could not be criticised for the fact that he did not complain to the Supreme Court about the non-communication.

Such a principle, however desirable it might seem, would be hard to implement in practice. In the first place, the jurisdiction of courts of appeal in the Contracting States is usually limited to the claims made in the appeal. Moreover, such courts normally have an enormous case-load and were they in addition to be obliged under Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention to perform of their own motion the role described above, they would be faced with a task which they could not realistically be expected to carry out and which might seriously obstruct the effective administration of justice.
