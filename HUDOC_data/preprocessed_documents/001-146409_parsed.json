In this regard, the Court has previously held that a patient compulsorily detained for psychiatric treatment must have the right to seek judicial review of his or her own motion (see Gorshkov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a067531/01, \u00a7\u00a044, 8\u00a0November\u00a02005, Rakevich v. Russia, no. 58973/00, \u00a7\u00a743-44, 28\u00a0October\u00a02003 and Raudevs v. Latvia, no.\u00a024086/03, \u00a7\u00a082, 17\u00a0December\u00a02013). More generally, the Court has indicated that it would be inconceivable that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should afford procedural guarantees to a party whose detention matter is pending before a court without also protecting what makes it in fact possible to benefit from such guarantees \u2013 that is, the possibility to access the court by making an application to review the lawfulness of the detention (see Proshkin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 28869/03, \u00a7\u00a092, 7\u00a0February 2012). It is without doubt that situations can be envisaged where a detainee\u2019s mental state or other circumstances would render his personal involvement in detention proceedings impossible. However, the Court has been unwilling to accept the state of mind of a detained person, on its own, as an implied and blanket limitation on his right to institute judicial review proceedings for the purpose of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention, particularly when no assessment of his ability to be personally involved in the proceedings leading to his detention has been performed by the court (ibid.).",

In such circumstances and absent domestic case-law to the contrary, it is not sufficiently certain that indeed a possibility of appeal was available to the applicant in practice. The Court observes that the decision in question was taken by the Regional Court under section\u00a0607(4) of the Criminal Procedure Law on its own initiative. In that connection, Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention requires that it should be the person deprived of his liberty who \u201cshall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided\u201d (see X.

Denmark, no.\u00a052792/99, \u00a7\u00a033, 25\u00a0September 2003). Furthermore, detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is justified only as a last resort where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013229/03, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR\u00a02008, and C.B. v.

The Court observes that in the Nowicka case the applicant\u2019s obligation to submit to a psychiatric examination had been prescribed by several court orders. That case is therefore to be seen as pertaining more to non-compliance with a court order, considering that the Court has previously held that the phrase \u201cobligation prescribed by law\u201d denotes an obligation of a specific and concrete nature already incumbent on the person concerned (see Ciulla v.\u00a0Italy, 22\u00a0February 1989, \u00a7\u00a036, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0148). The Court considers that, given the wording of section\u00a0592(1) of the Criminal Procedure Law, which appears to be the source of the \u201cobligation prescribed by law\u201d invoked by the Government, and which directly refers to the requirement for a court to adopt a corresponding decision (see paragraph\u00a042 above), the second aspect of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(b) is not at issue in the present case.",

Latvia, no.\u00a030954/05, \u00a7\u00a049, 29\u00a0November\u00a02011). It logically follows that a person cannot be held accountable for \u201cnon-compliance\u201d with a court order if he or she has never been informed of it (ibid., \u00a7\u00a050). The Court has already found that prior to being taken to the psychiatric hospital the applicant had not been officially informed of the contents of the decision of the Riga Regional Court of 20\u00a0August 2008 and was therefore not given any chance to comply with it voluntarily.",

Georgia [GC], no.\u00a071503/01, \u00a7\u00a0170, ECHR\u00a02004II, and H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a045508/99, \u00a7\u00a0115, ECHR\u00a02004IX). This objective, and the broader condition that detention be \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, require the existence in domestic law of adequate legal protection and fair and proper procedures (see Winterwerp v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 24\u00a0October 1979, \u00a7\u00a045, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a033). In other words, the Court has to examine the quality of the domestic law, verifying its compliance with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Amuur v. France, 25\u00a0June 1996, \u00a7\u00a050, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III).",

Contrary to the requirements of the domestic law (sections\u00a0607(1) and 608(1) of the Criminal Procedure Law; see paragraphs\u00a046 and 47 above), the Riga Regional Court did not make any decision in this regard within fourteen\u00a0days. Secondly, after the applicant was eventually admitted to hospital, taking into account that more than six months had elapsed since the adoption of the original decision, section\u00a0635(3) of the Criminal Procedure Law (see paragraph\u00a048 above) permitted the applicant\u2019s admission, but prohibited his involuntary medical treatment prior to receiving a fresh report of a medical panel. Judge I.\u0160. requested such a report on 29\u00a0October 2009 and it was prepared on 3\u00a0November 2009.

Taking into account that, as the Court has already found, the applicant had never been officially served with a copy of the decision of 20\u00a0August 2008 and that his subsequent actions appear to suggest that he believed that the said decision had ordered his outpatient treatment, he cannot be blamed for failing to voluntarily admit himself to the hospital. It was thus the responsibility of the domestic authorities to ensure that the decision of the Regional Court was adequately enforced. Since it had not been done for more than fourteen months, the domestic authorities had an obligation to display particular diligence in verifying that the applicant\u2019s state of health did indeed still warrant the deprivation of his liberty.
