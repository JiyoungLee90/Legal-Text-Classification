The applicant insisted that on 20\u00a0September 2011 V. had secretly moved with the child from the flat and destroyed the stability of the child\u2019s everyday life.

The applicant emphasised that on 1 December 2011 he had lawfully taken the child back to his flat since the child had previously been permanently living in his flat and he had never given any consent for V. to change the child\u2019s place of residence. In his opinion, the court had paid no attention to the fact that the child had been attached to the paternal grandparents and that her separation from them would be detrimental to her interests. Furthermore, the respective financial capacity of the applicant and V., as well as the residential conditions, had not been properly assessed. Important pieces of evidence had not been included in the case file and part of the evidence had been assessed wrongly \u2013 namely, the certificate issued by the Bezdryk child-minding centre regarding the child\u2019s good state of health was a fabricated document that had been discredited by the forensic medical expert report of 2 December 2011.",

However, this provision does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there are positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see S\u00f6derman v. Sweden [GC], no. 5786/08, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2013). The choice of the means calculated to secure compliance with Article 8 of the Convention in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting States\u2019 margin of appreciation, whether the obligations on the State are positive or negative. There are different ways of ensuring respect for private life and the nature of the State\u2019s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private life that is in issue. Where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, or where the activities at stake involve a most intimate aspect of private life, the margin allowed to the State is correspondingly narrowed (ibid., \u00a7 79, with further references).",

However, the Court has held in other contexts that that investigative procedure did not comply with the principles of an effective remedy because the inquiring officer could only take a limited number of steps and the victim had no formal status, meaning her effective participation in the procedure was excluded (see, for example, Savitskyy v. Ukraine, no.\u00a038773/05, \u00a7 105, 26\u00a0July 2012). In the present case the inquiry proved to be ineffective indeed because it was insufficiently thorough, which is confirmed by the repeated remittals for further inquiries after the decisions closing the previous inquiries had been quashed as unsubstantiated (see\u00a0paragraph 22 above).",

During the course of those investigative measures the child confirmed the statements that she had made previously in person to the authorities as early as April 2012 \u2013 in other words about half a year after the alleged events (see paragraph 21 above); furthermore, the experts concluded that she was able to make truthful statements regarding the alleged facts (while acknowledging that the young age of the girl did not allow her to understand the meaning of the actions at issue). There is no justification for such a delay in securing this important evidence. It is relevant to mention here that Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (a) of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse specifies that in cases of this type interviews with the child should take place without unjustified delay (see paragraph 50 above). Therefore, it is doubtful whether the investigator had provided sufficient reasons for discarding the child\u2019s statements considering that she had made them after the expiry of a long period of time and that her young age undermined the veracity of the statements (see paragraph 32 above).",

It is therefore not surprising that that decision was reversed as unsubstantiated and the case was remitted for further investigation. It cannot be overlooked, however, that this was the third unfounded decision discontinuing the investigation of the case. Apart from the investigator\u2019s repeated failure to carry out a thorough investigation, the authorities noted that the proceedings had been excessively lengthy and instructed the investigator to speed up the proceedings immediately (see paragraph 29 above). According to the information provided to the Court by the parties, the domestic authorities had been dealing with the case for more than three years and three months and the investigation was still ongoing.

In the present case the courts found that, until the conflict between the parents, the child had continually lived not only with both parents but also with the paternal grandparents. The courts also established that the grandparents had taken care of the child when the parents had been outside the country for a considerable period of time. It was never disputed that the child had developed close ties with the paternal grandparents. However, the fact that the grandparents constituted an important part of the child\u2019s family life was not examined by the first-instance court; the Court of Appeal only noted that the role of parents was more important than that of grandparents in the upbringing of a child. While the Court agrees with this observation, it considers that in the specific circumstances of the case it was insufficient as it remained unclear how such a general observation fitted the individual situation of the applicant\u2019s child and whether the separation of the child from the grandparents would be detrimental to the child\u2019s interests.",
