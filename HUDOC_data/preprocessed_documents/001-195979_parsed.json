In respect of each of the cases, investigations were formally pending when the applications were lodged with the Court. The criminal proceedings in respect of all the cases were suspended and resumed on several occasions throughout the periods concerned. The applicants maintained reasonable contact with the authorities, cooperated with each investigation, and, where appropriate, took steps to inform themselves of the progress of the proceedings and to speed them up, in the hope of securing a more effective outcome (see paragraphs\u00a018, 21-23, 48, 49, 63, 85-88 and 109 above). Given the time that passed between each of the abductions and the initiation of the relevant criminal proceedings \u2013 as well as the active stance taken by the applicants in respect of those proceedings \u2013 the Court is satisfied that the applicants lodged their applications within a reasonable amount of time (see Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7 166, ECHR\u00a02009).",

In such circumstances, and noting the absence over the years of any tangible progress in the criminal investigations into the abductions of the applicants\u2019 relatives, the Court concludes that this objection must be dismissed since the remedy indicated by the Government has been ineffective in the circumstances (see, for similar reasoning, Khachukayevy v.
