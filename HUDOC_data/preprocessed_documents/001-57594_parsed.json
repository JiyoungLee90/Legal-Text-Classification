The Learned Judge, quite rightly in the view of this Court, took the view that this was not a case for borstal because borstal for one reason would not be a sufficiently secure place to send such a dangerous young man. The Judge was therefore - since he could not send him to a mental institution for lack of evidence - faced with a difficult decision on whether he should give him what he did, namely life imprisonment, or sentence him to some long term, some definite term of imprisonment for a number of years. As he was at pains to point out, he in mercy really to the boy took the former course. Now life imprisonment in this case at any rate means an indeterminate sentence. If when he gets to prison it then appears after he has been there some time that there are grounds for transferring him to a mental institution for treatment, there are ample powers under the Act which will enable the Home Secretary to do so. Moreover, as soon as it becomes apparent, and it is to be hoped that it may not be long, but one cannot tell, that it is safe from the public point of view and from his own point of view to do so, this boy will be released. At first sight a sentence of life imprisonment, particularly having regard to his age, sounds terrible, but when the factors to which reference has been made are considered it will be seen that this is really in mercy to the boy and will perhaps enable him to be released much sooner than if a long term of imprisonment had been imposed, which was the only other alternative.\"",

So there is some information to which he is entitled, but to my mind that is the only distinction between the two cases.

The Government drew a distinction between liberty, properly understood, and a life prisoner being permitted to live on licence outside prison. In the latter case, the Government explained, the prisoner was still serving his sentence, albeit outside prison as a result of a privilege granted to him by the Home Secretary, but his right to liberty had not been restored to him. In sum, it was one and the same deprivation of liberty in June 1977 as in December 1966, based on his original conviction and sentence, and no new issue arose under Article 5 (art. 5).",

He was lawfully \"at large\", to use the terms of section 62(9) of the 1967 Act (see paragraph 26 in fine above) when outside prison on licence. Admittedly, for persons sentenced to life imprisonment, any release under the 1967 Act is granted as an act of clemency and is always conditional (see paragraphs 20 in fine and 27 above). The freedom enjoyed by a life prisoner, such as Mr. Weeks, released on licence is thus more circumscribed in law and more precarious than the freedom enjoyed by the ordinary citizen. Nevertheless, the restrictions to which Mr. Weeks\u2019 freedom outside prison was subject under the law are not sufficient to prevent its being qualified as a state of \"liberty\" for the purposes of Article 5 (art. 5). Hence, when recalling Mr. Weeks to prison in 1977, the Home Secretary was ordering his removal from an actual state of liberty, albeit one enjoyed in law as a privilege and not as of right, to a state of custody.",

The \"lawfulness\" required by the Convention presupposes not only conformity with domestic law but also, as confirmed by Article 18 (art. 18), conformity with the purposes of the deprivation of liberty permitted by sub-paragraph (a) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-a) (see, as the most recent authority, the Bozano judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 23, para. 54). Furthermore, the word \"after\" in sub-paragraph (a) does not simply mean that the detention must follow the \"conviction\" in point of time: in addition, the \"detention\" must result from, \"follow and depend upon\" or occur \"by virtue of\" the \"conviction\" (ibid., pp. 22-23, para. 53, and the Van Droogenbroeck judgment of 24 June 1982, Series A no. 50, p. 19, para. 35).

The contested decision of the Home Secretary was taken within the legal framework set by the life sentence passed by the \"competent court\" in 1966, taken together with the provisions in the 1967 Act governing the release on licence and recall to prison of persons sentenced to life imprisonment. A life sentence can never be terminated, save by pardon or in the event of being commuted, and except in those circumstances any release after sentence will always be conditional (see paragraph 27 above). The 1967 Act confers on the Home Secretary the power to order both release on licence and recall, but the discretion granted is not unfettered, as it was under the system in force when the applicant was sentenced (see paragraph 25 above). The Home Secretary can only release on the recommendation of the Parole Board and, in the case of a life prisoner, only after consulting the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge if available (section 61(1) - see paragraph 26 above). Similarly, he may revoke the licence if recommended to do so by the Parole Board (section 62(1)). He also has the power to revoke the licence without consulting the Board \"where it appears to him that it is expedient in the public interest to recall the person before such consultation is practicable\" (section 62(2)). However, a further constraint upon his power of recall is that his decision may be overruled by the Parole Board (section 62(5)). The revocation of the licence reactivates the original sentence of life imprisonment by making the recalled prisoner \"liable to be detained in pursuance of his sentence\" (section 62(9)).",

According to the very words of Mr. Justice Thesiger and Lord Justice Salmon, they accordingly had recourse to an \"indeterminate sentence\": this would enable the appropriate authority, namely the Home Secretary, to monitor his progress and release him back into the community when he was no longer judged to represent a danger to society or to himself, and thus hopefully sooner than would have been possible if he had been sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. In the absence of sufficient medical evidence justifying an order sending him to a mental institution, the only means available under the British sentencing machinery to achieve this purpose was a life sentence. In substance, Mr. Weeks was being put at the disposal of the State because he needed continued supervision in custody for an unforeseeable length of time and, as a corollary, periodic reassessment in order to ascertain the most appropriate manner of dealing with him.",

It is true that in this connection the judges emphasised that the sentence was \"indeterminate\", in that it did not predetermine the period for which Mr. Weeks should remain in custody but left this to the discretion of the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt whatever that both the sentencing judge and the Court of Appeal were fully aware and must be understood to have intended that, in the absence of the exercise of the Royal Prerogative to pardon Mr. Weeks or to remit or reduce his sentence, he would remain subject thereto with its consequences for the restriction of his liberty for the rest of his life. As a matter of English law therefore and for all practical purposes, the life sentence imposed on Mr. Weeks is indistinguishable from any other sentence of life imprisonment imposed by the English courts. Consequently, we are unable to agree with the majority of the Court that it was in a special category distinguishing it from other life sentences (paragraph 46 of the judgment) and was comparable, for the purposes of Article 5 paras. 1 (a) and 4 (art. 5-1-a, art. 5-4) of the Convention, to the Belgian measure at issue in the Van Droogenbroeck case, that is the placing of a recidivist or habitual offender at the disposal of the Government (paragraph 47 of the judgment).",

In that case, the Court agreed with the Commission that the Belgian system for the treatment of recidivists which was at issue was \"fundamentally different from that ... of the conditional release of prisoners sentenced by a court to a period of imprisonment imposed by the court as being appropriate to the case\" (ibid., p. 25, para. 47).

Nor is it contested that his recall to prison in 1977 and subsequent detention were in accordance with domestic law. In the terms of section 62(9) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, he was re-detained \"in pursuance of\" his original life sentence.
