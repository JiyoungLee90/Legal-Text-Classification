Moreover, the judge accepted the applicant's complaint concerning the overcrowded conditions in cell no. 8 and ordered the Vara\u017edin Prison authorities to take measures to provide him with adequate conditions. The prison authorities, however, had already removed the applicant from cell no. 8 on 11 March 2004 and placed him in cell no. 5, where there was an area of 4.47 square metres per prisoner. In this connection the Court notes that in its decision in \u0160titi\u0107 v.  ((dec.), no. 9660/03, 9 November 2006) it found that the applicant, whose situation in prison had been remedied by a decision of a judge responsible for execution of sentences and who, following such a decision, had been transferred to an adequate cell, could have brought a civil action against the State claiming damages for the suffering hitherto sustained. Whilst the institution of civil proceedings for damages in itself could not be regarded as an effective remedy for addressing adverse prison conditions, such proceedings in combination with an urgent decision of a judge responsible for execution of sentences, with an immediate effect on the actual conditions of an individual applicant, did satisfy the requirements of effectiveness. Since the applicant in that case had failed to institute civil proceedings against the State, his complaint under Article 3 of the Convention concerning the prison conditions was declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",
