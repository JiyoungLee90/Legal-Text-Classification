The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (Immobiliare Saffi v.  [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7\u00a7 44-46, ECHR 1999V).",

The measure thus amounted to control of the use of property; and accordingly, the second paragraph of Article 1 is applicable (cf. Tendam v. , no. 25720/05, \u00a7 47, 13 July 2010).",

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, and therefore also in its second paragraph. There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question. In spheres such as housing, which plays a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, the Court will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Immobiliare Saffi v.

However, it notes that this measure was in place for some fourteen years, parallel to a trial whose length amounted to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 16 above) and which resulted in the acquittal of the applicant. Moreover, there appears to be no domestic mechanism available to compensate the applicant for the protracted immobilisation of his assets and the eventual losses he may have suffered on that account. In these circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the prohibition at issue imposed an excessive burden on the applicant and accordingly upset the balance that must be struck between the protection of the right of property and the requirements of the general interest. Consequently, there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",
