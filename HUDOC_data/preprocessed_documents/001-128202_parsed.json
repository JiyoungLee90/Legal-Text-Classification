The limitation of access to the Constitutional Court was proportionate and served a legitimate purpose.

Although the impugned decisions were final, they did not involve a final \u201cdetermination\u201d of the applicants\u2019 civil rights and obligations. While the Constitutional Court took formal decisions on the applicants\u2019 appeals, it effectively declined to decide on their admissibility and/or merits. The impugned decisions contained reasons both for and against the finding of a violation and the only reason why the applicants\u2019 appeals were rejected was the court\u2019s failure to reach a majority on any of the issues which would determine the applicants\u2019 civil rights and obligations. In other words, there was no majority for either accepting or rejecting their appeals. When there is no real \u201cdetermination\u201d of civil rights and obligations, the right of access to court remains illusory (see Marini, cited above, \u00a7 122).",

Although this \u201cother legislation\u201d made provision in the event of a tied vote, the Court noted that in the case before it there could in reality have been no tied vote since the Albanian Constitutional Court had sat in a seven-judge formation (see paragraph 119 of that judgment).

The Constitutional Court (of Bosnia and Herzegovina) is composed of nine members (paragraph 17). According to the Constitution, a majority of all the members of the court, i.e. 5, shall constitute a quorum (ibid.). The Constitution is silent on how decisions are to be taken, and in particular on whether decisions of the Constitutional Court are to be taken by simple or by qualified majority. The Constitution also provides that the Constitutional Court shall adopt its own rules of court.",

                        "content": "4.\u00a0\u00a0A fundamental principle of both constitutional and administrative law is that, in the absence of an express provision to do so, subsidiary legislation (whether delegated to an authority of the executive branch of government or, as in this case, to an authority of the judicial branch) should never go against the parent legislation, whether directly or indirectly. In providing for a quorum of five judges, the Constitution clearly intended to establish the minimum number of judges for the Constitutional Court to function and to get on with its business. There is no suggestion in the Constitution that applicants should face more or less difficulties in the determination of their applications by that court depending on the number of judges hearing a particular application. The rules of court, which were adopted by the Constitutional Court itself and which are therefore, by their very nature, subsidiary legislation, while providing that the plenary court should take decisions by a majority of all its members, introduced a qualified majority in the case of any formation other than the full nine. In other words, the smaller the composition of the Constitutional Court (five, six, seven or eight members), the more difficult it would be for an applicant to have the case resolved in his favour. No provision was made in the said rules in the event of a tie when the formation was an even one. Moreover, as if this were not enough, when the qualified majority was not attained, the rules provided that \u201cit shall be considered that the decision is taken to reject [the appeal]\u201d (see paragraph 18). In other words, the appeal is \u201cdeemed to have been\u201d rejected even though, in reality, there was no actual determination on the merits (paragraph 36). It was thus sufficient for a judge to fail to turn up for deliberations because of, say, illness, for the procedural hurdle to be put in place. Considering that a reduced composition could also be due to the failure of one or more of the selecting bodies to do their duty, the element of prejudice to applicants before the Constitutional Court through the application of Rule 40(3) assumes the cloak of sheer arbitrariness.",
