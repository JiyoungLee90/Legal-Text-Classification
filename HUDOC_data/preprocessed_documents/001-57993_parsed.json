Sigurj\u00f3nsson v. Iceland judgment of 30 June 1993, Series A no. 264, pp. 15-16, para. 35), the applicant in the present case had not been compelled to join an association.  The union action had primarily been aimed at making the applicant apply to his employees a certain agreement negotiated by the relevant labour organisations.  This could have been achieved not only by the applicant joining one of the two employers\u2019 associations in the trade - the Swedish Hotel and Restaurant Entrepreneurs\u2019 Union (\"HRAF\") and the Employers\u2019 Association of the Swedish Union of Restaurant Owners (\"SRA\") - but also by his signing with the Hotel and Restaurant Workers\u2019 Union (\"HRF\") a substitute agreement to the existing collective agreements applied in the restaurant trade (see paragraph 10 above).  He could have avoided the union action by availing himself of the possibility of entering into negotiations with the union with a view to reaching a solution based on a substitute agreement drafted in a way that was adapted to the special character of the business run by the applicant (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above).  The conclusion of such an agreement might have affected the applicant\u2019s freedom as an employer to conclude contracts with his employees, but this freedom was not as such guaranteed by the Convention.",

Admittedly, had the applicant concluded a substitute agreement, the primary purpose of the action, namely to achieve the largest possible acceptance and the widest possible application of the collective agreement to which HRF was a party, could have been attained without the applicant becoming a member of HRAF or SRA.  However, the applicant objected not only to formal membership but also to participation in the collective-bargaining system, since in both cases he would have become bound by a collective agreement with HRF.  One of the most important effects of membership of an employers\u2019 association in  was the members\u2019 participation, through the association, in collective bargaining and their undertaking to be bound by any collective agreement concluded by the association.  Therefore, even though the applicant had had the possibility of accepting these obligations without formally joining HRAF or any other association, it would be artificial and formalistic to deny that his negative freedom of association had been affected.",

He had two alternative means of doing so: either by joining an employers\u2019 association, which would have made him automatically bound by a collective agreement, or by signing a substitute agreement (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).  The Court accepts that, to a degree, the enjoyment of his freedom of association was thereby affected.  Article 11 (art. 11) is thus applicable in the present case.  The Court will therefore examine whether there was an infringement of his right to freedom of association for which the respondent State was responsible.",

The Government stated that in  most major employers were affiliated to an employers\u2019 organisation bound by a collective agreement and about 85% of employees were unionised.  An essential and long-standing feature of the Swedish model was that industrial relations were determined primarily by the parties to the labour-market rather than by State intervention.  Thus, wages, working hours, leave entitlements and various other kinds of terms of employment were governed by collective agreements, covering 90% of the labour-market, rather than by legislation.  Another important feature was that employers should not be able to gain a competitive advantage over their competitors by offering less favourable working conditions than those provided for by collective agreements.",

Sigurj\u00f3nsson v.  judgment of 30 June 1993, Series A no. 264, pp. 15-16, para. 35).  The Contracting States have a duty under Article 11 (art. 11) to put in place a legal framework enabling proper enjoyment of this negative right.  It is apparent, however, from the Court\u2019s case-law that Article 11 (art. 11) is not a vehicle for regulating industrial relations in general or for generally protecting against prejudice suffered as a result of industrial action taken by one of the actors in the labour-market against another.  The Court has thus held that the right to collective bargaining is not an inherent component of freedom of association under Article 11 (art. 11) (see the Swedish Engine Drivers\u2019 Union v. Sweden judgment of 6 February 1976, Series A no. 20, p.15, para. 39).  In our view, neither does compulsion aimed at making an employer enter into a collective agreement in itself - that is to say, in the absence of compulsion to join an association - come within the safeguard afforded by Article 11 (art. 11).",

Consequently, it may well be that for the final balancing exercise in such cases it is material whether the negative freedom of an employee or that of an employer is at stake. Social solidarity does not always have the same content or the same value. In other words, it may make a difference whether the conflict of rights concerns a friction within the same camp (a dissension between a trade union and an individual employee) or one between camps (a dissension between a trade union and an individual employer); just as, where the conflict concerns only one camp, it may make a difference what is the object of the dissension.",

The rule of law - that essential protection of the individual to which the Preamble of the Convention refers and which the European Court is bound to take into account - not only requires that the individual should be enabled to have a court review the lawfulness and proportionality of interferences in his rights by the executive, but also that he be secured similar protection against other powerful entities created or allowed by the State.

It may be that under the \"Swedish model\" the democratic legislature was convinced that granting trade unions an (almost) unrestricted right to promote their members\u2019 interests would best benefit the community as a whole, but the rule of law - and, moreover, legal equality within the Council of Europe - make it impossible to accept, even on the part of a democratic legislature, that for whatever reasons a trade union should have the privilege of being the sole and ultimate arbiter between the interests of its members and those of a small employer who objects to joining the system",

In the above-cited Swedish Engine Drivers\u2019 Union judgment (in paragraphs 39 and 40), the Court states the terms of collective agreements between employers and a trade union representing the employees (Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention) and emphasises that the European Social Charter (Article 6 para. 2) \"affirms the voluntary nature of collective bargaining and collective agreements\".  The right of trade unions under Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention to strive for the protection of their members\u2019 interests \"under national law\" cannot, in my view, embrace measures so inconsistent with the very substance of the right to freedom of association, and the aim to achieve \"industrial peace\" seems to me also incompatible with such a right under the Convention.",

Employer and employees had obviously opted not to adhere to any union in conformity with the fundamental right underlying Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention.  Both considered that it was in their respective interests that they stay out, as going in would in fact have meant that their relationship would be covered by a general collective agreement, which they both considered to be less advantageous than the terms on which they had mutually agreed.
