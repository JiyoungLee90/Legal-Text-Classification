In order to claim to be a victim of a violation, a person must be directly affected by the impugned measure (see, for example, Buckley v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 25\u00a0September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV, p.\u00a0128, \u00a7\u00a7 56-59). The concept of \u201cvictim\u201d in Article 34 must be interpreted autonomously and independently of domestic law concepts, such as a capacity to bring or take part in legal proceedings (Greek Federation of Customs Officers, Gialouris and others v. Greece, no.\u00a024581/94, Commission decision of 6 April 1995, DR 81-B, p.\u00a0127).
