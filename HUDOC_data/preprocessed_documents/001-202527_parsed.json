She suffered from a moderate mental disability and from epilepsy. She was highly restricted in her ability to comprehend, concentrate and memorise things, as well as in her sense of orientation. Her ability to communicate was limited to word fragments, which rendered impossible any meaningful communication. She had no ability to make judgments, as her intellectual development corresponded to that of a four-year-old child (whereas her physical development corresponded to that of a 14- or 15-year-old).",

She was not able to build up lasting relationships, had no sense of the appropriateness (or otherwise) of social situations or time, and no sense of responsibility or the needs of others. She had no comprehension of sexual relationships, marriage or even her pregnancy. Moreover, owing to the events leading up to her pregnancy, she had become significantly distracted.

The court suggested that condition, as it had established that \u2013 irrespective of whether it was determined that V. had been able to resist (which required an assessment of whether any consent given by her could be considered to have had legal effect) \u2013 it could not be ruled out that the applicant had inevitably erred in his assessment of the legality of his acts. In particular, it could not be ruled out that the applicant was not accountable for relying on the assessment of the public prosecutor of 10 December 2009, according to which it would not be possible to establish that V. was incapable of resisting invitations to engage in sexual intercourse. As a result, criminal liability pursuant to section 179 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 43 below) was ruled out in these proceedings. The Regional Court, however, drew particular attention to the fact that this December 2009 assessment had been proved wrong, given the findings in the present proceedings. It added that criminal liability pursuant to section 174 c \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 43 below) had to be considered as the applicant had taken advantage of the special relationship of confidence between V. and her mother. However, in view of the circumstances and, in particular, the existence of claims for child support and inheritance, the public interest in prosecuting could be satisfied with the payment of the sums indicated to non-profit organisations.",

Moreover it seemed likely that P.B.\u2019s subsequently expressed wish that the parties be allowed to engage in a normal family life (including a wedding) had been rooted in her fear that she and the applicant would be held criminally liable for aiding and abetting the sexual abuse of a person incapable of resistance.",

V. had not wished to have contact with the applicant; her guardian ad litem had also agreed that there was no necessity or purpose \u2013 nor any wish on V.\u2019s part \u2013 for any written or personal contact with the applicant. Therefore contact with the applicant not only was not in V\u2019s best interest, but would put her interest severely and durably into danger.

A broad construction of Article 8 does not mean, however, that it protects every activity a person might seek to engage in with other human beings in order to establish and develop such relationships (Friend and others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 16072/06 and 27809/08, \u00a7 41, 24 November 2009; Gough v. the United Kingdom, no. 49327/11, \u00a7 183, 28 October 2014).",

They based their decision to ban contact not on V.\u2019s status as a person with a disability, but rather on the finding that her disability was of such a nature as to render her unable to understand adequately the significance and implications of the contact at issue, as well as the particularities of their relationship given the fact, inter alia, that the applicant had previously been her mother\u2019s partner, and finally on the fact that any other form of contact would not be to her benefit either. Moreover, V. was heard in person several times and there were effective safeguards to prevent any kind of abuse during the course of the domestic proceedings \u2013 in particular the participation of the guardian and the guardian ad litem.

The Court has already ruled on cases in which precedence was given to superior national interests when denying a party full adversarial proceedings and has recognised that the Contracting States had a certain margin of appreciation in this area (compare Regner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0146147).",

In cases where evidence has been withheld from the applicant party on public interest grounds, the Court must scrutinise the decision-making procedure to ensure that, as far as possible, it complied with the requirements to provide adversarial proceedings and equality of arms and incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the person concerned (ibid, \u00a7 149).",

Applying its standard analysis under the civil limb of Article 6, the Court has found Article 6 to be applicable with respect to social-security contributions, concluding that they have sufficient elements of private contractual relations. By contrast, the Court has held with respect to tax obligations that they fall within the \u201cthe normal civic duties\u201d in a democratic society and thus are of an entirely public character and not \u201ccivil\u201d within the meaning of Article 6.",

However, the latter provision provides as follows: \u201cThe care of the child also encompasses the right to determine contact in respect of the child, including with effect for and against third parties\u201d. It is clear that this provision refers to contact, and the right to determine contact, with a child. V. was not a child, and the applicant would therefore have no right to contact.

In addition, the capacity of Article 8 to expand, thereby extending the reach of the Convention, has been repeatedly, and sometimes legitimately, criticised. However, in the present case it should have been possible to examine the applicant\u2019s complaints through the lens of the Court\u2019s existing Article 8 case-law \u2013 which has repeatedly held that private life can embrace multiple aspects of a person\u2019s \u201cphysical and social identity\u201d (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, \u00a7 95, 25 September 2018). By this I do not mean that the applicant could rely on a right to contact with a specific other person, such a right having been found to constitute an element of Article 8 essentially under the family life limb. In addition, I am certainly not suggesting that Article 8 forms the basis for a person such as the applicant to insist on contact with a person where that person does not share the wish for contact. Furthermore, the Court has rightly held that Article 8 cannot be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation which is the foreseeable consequence of one\u2019s own actions, such as, for example, the commission of a criminal offence. However, the difficulty in the present case is that the purpose of the disputed proceedings was precisely to establish whether V. genuinely did not wish to continue contact with the applicant and the domestic courts failed to establish that the applicant had committed a criminal offence. Furthermore, the applicant was not complaining of a loss of reputation but about the effects which the contact ban had on what he regarded as his inner circle and on his right to develop relationships with the outside world, including and specifically V.",

The inclusion by the German Act on Procedure in Family matters in proceedings before domestic courts of persons such as the applicant whose rights would be directly affected by decisions taken thereunder seems to constitute recognition of this limited right. The latter could even be described as a \u201creflexive\u201d right; relating to the applicant and his desired external exercise of his social identity and not as such impinging on V. When concluding that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was applicable in the instant case \u2013 not because the applicant had a \u201cright\u201d to contact under domestic law, but because a State authority imposed an obligation on the applicant to avoid all contact with a given person which, if not respected, would have led to the imposition of a penalty or enforcement detention, the majority has surely identified under Article 6 what the applicant also relied on under Article 8. In my view, the engagement of the latter article of the Convention could have been accepted in these circumstances, without expanding the scope of that article or giving rise to the clearly unacceptable proposition that the applicant was entitled to assert a right to the company of another person, against that person\u2019s will.",

In so far as the applicant argued before this Court that he did not understand the District Court\u2019s invitation for him to submit comments, he had been informed of the contact ban by the guardian on 4 September 2012, that is before the District Court began the proceedings examining whether it should be confirmed and he had replied to the guardian\u2019s letter (see paragraph 21 of the judgment).

He also sought access to the full case file in the guardianship proceedings concerning V., including highly personal and sensitive data relating to her, and explicitly requested a personal hearing. However, the Regional Court held that in the circumstances of the case, and given the available material, there was no need to hold a hearing in order to decide the case and that the applicant had had sufficient opportunity to be heard by other means (see\u00a0paragraph 36 of the judgment). Domestic law provided for the possibility of a personal hearing but granted the courts discretion as to whether to hear the applicant in person (see paragraph 43 of the judgment). Such a hearing had to be held only when it was \u201cnecessary to ensure a fair legal hearing for the participants\u201d. It is vital, in my view, both for the assessment under Article 8 and any alternative assessment under Article 6 of the Convention to understand that this discretion stemmed from the nature of the guardianship proceedings. As the respondent Government explained, in such cases the domestic courts did not have to resolve a dispute between two parties in an adversarial procedure, but had to assess, throughout guardianship proceedings characterised by the principle of ex\u00a0officio investigations, whether the contact ban was in accordance with V.\u2019s wishes and best interests. The other basis for the compulsory holding of an in-person hearing was, pursuant to Article 34 \u00a7 1(2) of the Act, \u201cwhen so required by the provisions of this or another statute\u201d. However, the applicant\u2019s arguments in the present case to the effect that the normal provisions of German civil law should have applied have not been endorsed by the domestic courts, the respondent Government\u2019s account of domestic law or by the majority in the Chamber. Article 37 of the Act provides that a court may only support a decision that impacts the rights of a participant based on the facts and evidence that this participant could comment upon. However, in view of the limited (reflexive) Article 8 interest on which the applicant sought to rely, he was provided every opportunity to comment on the facts and evidence on which the judicial decision confirming the contact ban was based.",

However, it was surely important to recognise that the latter\u2019s position did not have the same weight in the proceedings as V.\u2019s interests and did not attract or require the same procedural rights. In that capacity, the domestic courts had to ensure primarily that the applicant had sufficient opportunity to present his arguments concerning the contact ban and for those arguments to be taken duly into account. The domestic courts essentially based their decisions on the fact that contact with the applicant would be detrimental to V. This was determined, inter alia, by an assessment the report drafted by the staff of V.\u2019s residential home, the expert opinions and the applicant\u2019s written submissions, which were all in the case file. Moreover, in his reply to the guardian\u2019s letter informing him of his request for a contact ban, the applicant had expressly requested an end to the supply of contraceptive medication to V. The applicant thereby signalled \u2013 despite the clear indication of the criminal court of 26 July 2012 that, according to the file, V. had no capacity to resist (see paragraph 15 of the judgment) \u2013 that he maintained his claim to a right to involvement in questions concerning V.\u2019s sexuality. In addition, the contact ban was ordered within the framework of the guardianship proceedings in which the District Court (presided over by the same judge) had already personally heard the applicant in September\u00a02010, when V. had initially been placed in care. Against this background, it is difficult to see, as the domestic courts pointed out, how an oral hearing involving the applicant would have broadened the basis of the contact decision. Such a hearing was not necessary in order to safeguard the applicant\u2019s interests. Furthermore, according to the applicant\u2019s submissions before the Court, what he principally sought was \u201ca court hearing for all participants\u201d during which he wished to subject V. and her guardian to questions.",

As in all Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, the aim to be achieved is a fair \u201ctrial\u201d and when considering whether domestic courts were justified in proceeding without an oral hearing, the Court has to consider \u201cthe special features of the proceedings viewed as a whole\u201d (see Axen v. Germany, no.\u00a08273/78, \u00a7 28, 8\u00a0December 1983).",

However, there is also no doubt, based on the material before the Court, that the applicant was afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case and was not placed at a disadvantage vis\u00e0vis another party. Furthermore, as highlighted above, the guardianship proceedings were not run of the mill adversarial proceedings, involving opposing parties which have been the circumstances in which the Court\u2019s case-law on the right to an oral hearing originated and developed. The majority judgment rightly asserts the importance of that right but applies the case-law in absolute terms. In doing so, little regard was paid to the careful assessment by the domestic courts of what the fairness of the concrete proceedings demanded.",

The applicants had not been denied the possibility of requesting an oral hearing but it was for the courts to decide if one was necessary. The administrative courts had given the question consideration and provided reasons for their refusal. Since the applicants in that case had been given ample opportunity to put forward their case in writing and to comment on the submissions of the other party, the Court found that the requirements of fairness had been complied with. The strict approach by the majority in this case is not born out by other examples from the Court\u2019s case-law either. While it is true that the Court has stressed the exceptional character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing, it has also stressed that this \u201cdoes not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases\u201d (Miller v. Sweden, no. 55853/00, \u00a7 29, 8 February 2005). In addition, the Court has applied a less strict standard if an oral hearing has been waived at first instance and requested only on appeal (see the authorities cited ibid, \u00a7 31).",

However, as indicated previously, they were not allowed to do so. Viewing the case before the Court through the lens of Article 6 meant the applicant\u2019s right to be heard took centre stage because pursuant to this article he was the \u201cvictim\u201d, the \u201clitigant\u201d, the \u201cparty\u201d whose rights were at issue. V. was thus largely forgotten, as was the nature and purpose of the proceedings in which her guardian, guardian ad litem, the District and Regional Court were all engaged. As indicated previously, the discretion of the domestic courts stemmed from the fact that they did not have to resolve a dispute between two parties in an adversarial procedure, but had to assess, throughout guardianship proceedings characterised by the principle of ex officio investigations, whether the contact ban was in accordance with V.\u2019s wishes and best interests. If Article 6 of the Convention was to be the preferred route to assess the applicant\u2019s complaint, it was essential that the Chamber take into account the particular background and nature of the proceedings at issue against which the domestic courts\u2019 decision not to hear the applicant in personam had to been seen.",

He did not do so; nor did he request the District Court to hear him personally. If this was not a waiver, with consequences for his subsequent request for an oral hearing at the appellate stage, the majority should have been explained why. In addition, the applicant had been heard, at an earlier stage in the guardianship proceedings, by the same judge and he had maintained, throughout, his insistence on V. not being prescribed contraception, a position which was clearly at odds with the assessment of V.\u2019s capability/ability to resist by the Regional Court when discontinuing the second set of criminal proceedings against the applicant. In such circumstances, and given the evidence on which the contact ban was based, it is difficult to understand what issues relating to the credibility of the applicant remained to be resolved.",

It may have been preferable for the Regional Court to have heard the applicant in-person, if only to avoid the risk of Strasbourg proceedings.
