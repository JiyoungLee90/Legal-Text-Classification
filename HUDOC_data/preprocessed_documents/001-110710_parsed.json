The latter was based on official notes concerning interviews held by officer S.P from Podlehnik Police Station with officers J.\u0160., G.K., B.H. and M.B. It would appear that in the context of the police inquiry, statements were taken by an officer from Maribor Police from five persons who had been present in the two bars but had not witnessed the relevant events outside the bar. The police report noted that witness A.K. had not been questioned, as he was working in . The public prosecutor found that the police officers, who were identified as J.\u0160. and G.K., had acted in accordance with the law. In the decision dismissing the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint the public prosecutor found that the applicant had allegedly breached the peace in bar B., where he had threatened customers with a gun. Further to that allegation, which had been communicated to the police by a person from that bar, the two officers attempted to find the applicant. They entered bar \u0160. for that purpose. As regards the subsequent events, the public prosecutor found in her decision that the applicant had refused to cooperate with the officers and had taken a metal tool out of his car in an attempt to attack officer J.\u0160. She concluded that this, and the fact that the applicant had presumably been carrying a gun, justified the use of force and the injuries the applicant had sustained as a result. The applicant was not heard by the public prosecutor or involved in those proceedings in any way. The public prosecutor\u2019s decision was served on his representative on 16\u00a0November 2001.",

The haematoma on the forehead was caused by a blow or a kick from the heel of a shoe while the applicant was either kneeling or lying down. Expert V.T. testified that the bruises on the applicant\u2019s forehead and the right side of his face could have been caused by a blow from a closed fist. Furthermore, he said that the damage to the eye socket was very unlikely to have been caused by the pressure employed during the professional throw, but must have been the result of a direct blow with a fist or a kick to this area. Expert L.\u0160. testified that being thrown down, or pressure on the thorax, would be very unlikely to cause perforation of the eardrum. He further stated that in his opinion there had been two or more blows to the applicant\u2019s face.

Slovenia, (no. 43393/98, 2 November 2006), noted that it had reached the decision independently of the findings of the initial police inquiry and the public prosecutor\u2019s decision, which had not complied with the requirement of an effective investigation. The court accepted the accused officers\u2019 assertion that the applicant had attempted to attack them with a tool, which, however had not been seized. It also accepted the accused officers\u2019 explanation that they had used a professional hit and a professional throw to overcome his resistance, which was lawful. It also considered that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant had been hit while he was in the car, an allegation that had, moreover not been made consistently. On the other hand the court found, on the basis of the evidence gathered in the criminal investigation and during the trial, in particular from the testimony of A.K. and the forensic medical reports, that the applicant had not been subjected only to the above-mentioned use of force. In particular, the court concluded, referring to the opinions of forensic experts, which it found to be consistent, that the applicant had received several blows to the head, not just one. As regards witness A.K., who had passed the scene of the incident when leaving the bar, the court noted that although A.K. had known the applicant, there was no close relationship between them which could call into question A.K.\u2019s credibility as a witness. It further noted that A.K. had first stated during the investigation that he had seen the applicant being beaten up by the officers while he was lying on the ground, but that subsequently, at the hearing at which the two accused officers had been present in their uniforms, he had modified his statement by saying that he had seen one of them kick the applicant. The court, which took into account the evidence concerning the visibility at the scene of the incident and heard witnesses for the defence, who failed to undermine A.K.\u2019s credibility, concluded that it was to be believed that A.K. had seen the applicant being kicked by at least one of the officers. It also rejected the accused officers\u2019 assertion that, given the circumstances, they had been entitled to use even lethal force. It noted in this respect that the officers outnumbered the applicant, were in excellent physical condition and were trained in fighting techniques. In addition, they had been aware of the possibility that the applicant might be carrying a gun and could therefore have predicted his behaviour. The court concluded that the accused officers had ill-treated the applicant in breach of Article 3 of the Convention and Article 18 of the Slovenian Constitution and committed the criminal offence under Article 270 of the Penal Code. As regards the charges of aggravated bodily harm, the court found that it could not determine with the degree of certainty required in criminal cases whether the injuries with long-term consequences, namely, the fracture of the left humerus and rupture of the eardrum, had been caused intentionally by the unlawful use of force. Finally the court ordered the applicant to pay court fees in the amount of 400 euros (EUR).",

However, referring to sections 392 (5) and 394 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act, it was of the opinion that a reassessment of the evidence could be done without a remittal of the case or a fresh hearing. The  then found that the defence statements of the accused officers were consistent and credible and should be fully followed and that the operation had not been a random one, as the applicant had a reputation as a dangerous person and had attacked the officers with a tool. The court found that the applicant\u2019s statements had not been consistent and called into question the credibility of witness A.K. In this connection it rejected the reasoning given by the first-instance court, that the change in A.K.\u2019s testimony had been understandable. It found that \u201cthe conduct of both accused officers, who had ultimately managed to get the applicant under control, had therefore proved to be correct and lawful\u201d.

Secondly, the possibility of seeking and obtaining compensation for the damage sustained as a result of the ill-treatment should be available to the applicant (see G\u00e4fgen v.

However, the Court notes that the focal point of the applicant\u2019s complaint concerns the alleged inadequacy of the criminal proceedings, and recalls that in cases of wilful ill-treatment a breach of Article 3 cannot be remedied merely by an award of compensation to the victim (see, among many other authorities, Krastanov v. Bulgaria, no. 50222/99, \u00a7\u00a7 48 and 60, 30\u00a0September 2004, and Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no. 41461/02, \u00a7 78, 24 July 2008). The Court must therefore determine whether the State carried out a thorough and effective investigation in respect of those responsible (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 121). However, since this is an issue which is closely linked to the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the procedural aspect of Article\u00a03, the Court considers that its examination should be joined to the merits of the case.",

However, when an applicant, such as the present one, takes over the prosecution and moreover is successful in obtaining a judicial investigation and later a trial against the officers accused of ill-treatment, these proceedings, which clearly concern the substance of his Article 3 complaint, as well as the evidence produced therein, become an inherent part of the case and shall be taken into account (see V.D. v.

The medical experts appointed in the civil and criminal proceedings concluded that the applicant could have sustained a fracture of the left humerus as a result of a fall on to hard ground or a blow. The report of the Commission of the Faculty of Medicine noted that the excoriation and lesions on the thorax, neck and head could have been caused by a fall on to hard ground or by kicks or punches (see paragraphs 40-41 above). As regards the injuries to the applicant\u2019s head, a forensic expert S.T., appointed in the civil proceedings, noted that the applicant had received several hard blows to the right side of the face and that the rupture of the eardrum was likely to have been caused by a slap. He was also of the opinion that most of the applicant\u2019s injuries had been caused by punches or kicks (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). Further to questioning during the investigation and/or the criminal trial the medical experts specified the most likely cause of the injuries. The expert in general surgery, L.T., said that the applicant had received at least two blows to the head, and had possibly also been kicked while he was on the ground. He was of the opinion that the ruptured eardrum could only be the result of a slap (see paragraphs 19 and 23 above). Similarly, the expert in otorhinolaryngology L.\u0160., who was a member of the Commission of the Faculty of Medicine, ruled out as very unlikely that the rupture of the eardrum could have been caused by being thrown down, or by pressure on the thorax.

The criminal court accepted that the hit and throw described were lawfully employed in order to overcome the applicant\u2019s resistance. However, trial courts in criminal and civil proceedings found that the applicant had sustained injuries which were not explained by the aforementioned methods admittedly used by the police. In particular, the courts found that the applicant had received kicks or blows, possibly when lying or kneeling on the ground. The criminal court, referring to the consistent statements of experts, found that the applicant had received more than one blow to the head. It found the officers guilty of violating the applicant\u2019s dignity by abuse of powers or official position (see paragraphs 24, 34 and 37 above). The higher criminal court, on the other hand, acquitted the officers. This court found it impossible to conclude with certainty that the accused had committed the alleged criminal offence.

It notes in particular that the conclusion of the higher criminal court was based on the explanation that the applicant had resisted arrest and that the officers were entitled to use force against him. The higher criminal court, however, did not address the discrepancy between the injuries which could have occurred as a result of the means allegedly used by the police and the injuries the applicant actually received at the hands of police. The Government, likewise, submitted no arguments which would provide an explanation for the aforementioned discrepancy.",
