Like the District Court I find that the requirements for imposing security measures are fulfilled. [The applicant], who must be considered to have, as required by Article 39 [of the Penal Code], a deviant character, represents a serious danger regarding new offences, including threatening behaviour under Article 227. I may add that it cannot be considered disproportionate to impose security measures on such a clearly dangerous offender. In my view, the protection of society requires that the authorities should be able to impose such security measures as are considered necessary in order to prevent [the applicant] from committing further serious offences. In view of the summing-up of counsel for the defence, I would point out that I find no basis for arguing that the decision of a Norwegian court concerning the authorisation to use security measures in a case like the present one would violate [Article 3] of the ... Convention (art. 3). It is for the implementing authorities to ensure that the security measure takes a form which in practice not only protects the interests of society but also seeks to promote those of [the applicant], including his need for psychiatric treatment.\"",

Since 23 December 1988 [the applicant] has been placed in a cell of his own in section G since, for security reasons, it could not be justified to offer him a place in the open ward. Furthermore, [the applicant] has not been granted leave of absence since I fear that, due to [his] behaviour in prison, similar incidents might occur during such leave. I refer to the fact that he has been convicted several times for threatening behaviour and physical assault, most recently by a judgment of [11] January 1989 convicting him of similar offences committed while on leave in 1988. ... [The applicant] has disclosed a deviant character from a very young age. His behaviour and conduct do not appear to have changed essentially since 1965 when he suffered brain damage. In 1988 he was on three occasions transferred to Skien under preventive supervision but every time it was discontinued due to circumstances relating to [the applicant]. Therefore I consider it probable - or rather very likely - that he will commit new offences involving violence if he were to be released when the security measure authorisation expires. The possibility also exists that he would then commit far more serious offences than those of which he has previously been convicted. It has turned out to be impossible to make other arrangements acceptable to [the applicant]. As recently as 9\u00a0March and 23 May 1989 the Ministry of Justice refused [the applicant\u2019s] requests to replace the detention with preventive supervision.

In addition, the second paragraph in fine of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorises detention on remand in cases where such detention is needed pending a new decision on security measures, on the condition that continuing the use of security measures is the most likely outcome of the case and that one of the specific conditions for detention under the first paragraph of Article 171 is fulfilled. In this case it is the condition in the third sub-paragraph of the first paragraph which is relevant, namely the risk of new criminal offences punishable by more than six months\u2019 imprisonment. ... The security measure issue cannot be examined before 25 February 1990. This is due to the fact that the necessary expert opinion will not be ready before that date. ... The Court finds reason to grant the prosecutor\u2019s request, see [the above-mentioned provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure]. The Court finds it very likely that [the applicant] - if released in two weeks - would commit criminal offences such as threatening behaviour (Article 227 of the Penal Code) and physical assault (Article\u00a0228). He has without doubt strong character deviations, little tolerance and he easily makes threats, and also attacks people. Today he is opposed to any arrangement for supervision. In its assessment the Court refers first of all to what has happened earlier. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 1985 contains a thorough account of the previous period. Since 1985 he has been convicted twice for violations of Articles 227 and 228. Dr Heitun, psychiatrist, too must be understood as considering that [the applicant], due to his weak impulse control and impaired capacity to control himself, will find himself in situations where he reacts with verbal threats if he is released and that things will - despite his good intentions - go wrong. Furthermore, it is likely that the case to be brought before the district court will end with the granting of an authorisation to use security measures against [the applicant] - for one or more years and with one or more of the measures mentioned in Article 39 para. 1 (a) to (f) of the Penal Code. It suffices here to refer to the fact that this has been recommended by Ila prison authorities and that Dr Heitun has drawn up a new plan for security measures. In the present circumstances, the Court cannot see that the detention constitutes a disproportionate measure. [The applicant\u2019s] case is sad and tragic, but the Court cannot have regard solely to his interests but must also take into account the risk of the applicant\u2019s exposing others to fear and danger. As far as the Court can see from the case documents, it appears that the outcome will be the use of security measures to be implemented at Skien which should work better than the last programme and which would provide him with far better living conditions than he has experienced during the last fourteen months.\"",

The statutory requirement that the Court must fix a maximum period for security measures is based, inter alia, on concern for the convicted person, namely to afford him after a certain period judicial review of the necessity of continued security measures ... The High Court has no particular reason to doubt that there is a very imminent risk that [the applicant] would commit new criminal offences were he to be released at the end of the period of security measures, without the prison or the prosecuting authorities having any control over him ...

Accordingly, there is a need for detention on remand and a very high probability that a further authorisation to use security measures will be granted ...

The fact that the request for detention on remand of [7] February 1990 ... was based on the ground that time was needed in order to obtain an additional expert opinion is, in the High Court\u2019s view, of no relevance to the question of detention.

A decision to prolong an authorisation does not mean that the person in question is convicted or punished again for the offences which constituted the basis for the judgment allowing the use of security measures. The fact that these offences constitute the basis for using security measures has already been decided in this judgment. What is relevant for the question whether the use of security measures should be prolonged beyond the initial maximum period fixed is an assessment of the other circumstances which provide the reasons for using security measures, the person\u2019s mental capacity and the risk of further criminal offences being committed. It follows from the judgment allowing the use of security measures, read in conjunction with Article 39 para. 3, second sub-paragraph, that the period of security measures may be prolonged, if there is reason to do so after such an evaluation. In view of the above, it does not appear that the High Court based its decision on an incorrect interpretation of Article 4 para. 1 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention (P7-4-1) by assuming that a prolongation of the period of security measures in accordance with Article 39 para. 3, second sub-paragraph, of the Penal Code would not be contrary to the Convention provision (P7-4-1). The Court does not find either that the High Court\u2019s decision is based on an incorrect interpretation of Articles 3 or 6 of the Convention (art. 3, art. 6).\"",

                                        "content": "\"The connection between the criminal acts that provided the grounds for security measures, and the new - extended - authorisation of such supervision is quite crucial to the question whether the second paragraph, cf. the first paragraph, of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that there must be a justified suspicion of a new criminal act punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding six months. The Supreme Court cannot see that any such requirement can be read into the provision. Since the original criminal act can be the offence that provides grounds for continued security measures, it must also be possible for it to be the offence that forms the basic condition for a remand in custody pursuant to the said provision, which moreover will also in this instance require tha the general conditions for a remand in custody, e.g. a risk of repetition of an offence, are fulfilled (see Norsk Retstidende 1992, p. 136). This interpretation is supported by the legislative background of this provision. Before the 1981 Code of Criminal Procedure the provision concerning a remand in custody in connection with proceedings relating to security measures was contained in Article 39 para. 1 (b), item 4, of the Penal Code. There was nothing in that provision which indicated a new criminal act as a condition for a remand in custody in connection with proceedings for an extension of security measures. There is nothing in the legislative history in connection with the inclusion of this provision among the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning remanding in custody which indicates that any change on this point was intended. Nor is it indicated by any considerations of policy. It is conceivable that the need for an extension of security measures will first become clear close to the expiry of the period of the security measures without there being any reason to criticise the prosecuting authority for not raising the question earlier, and without the need that has become apparent having any basis in the commission of a new criminal act punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding six months. In such cases it may appear to be unconditionally necessary in order to prevent the commission of new serious criminal acts that the offender should be remanded in custody until a new legally enforceable authorisation for security measures subsists. The Supreme Court cannot see that this interpretation of the second paragraph of Article 171, cf. the first paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure - to the effect that a new criminal act punishable by imprisonment for more than six months is not required - is contrary to the provision in the European Convention on Human Rights. The provision in the Convention which might conceivably be applicable must be Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c). The European Court of Human Rights has interpreted this provision (art. 5-1-c) to the effect that it \u2018permits deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings\u2019 (see, inter alia, the Court\u2019s judgment of 22 February 1989 in the Ciulla case). The rule must be that a person who is convicted of a criminal act cannot, after having served his sentence, be subjected to a new remand in custody on the basis of the matters that have been adjudicated because there is reason to fear the commission of new criminal acts. In cases of security measures, however, the situation is - as the Court has stated - that an authorisation of limited duration is given to apply specific security measures, which can be extended if the conditions for such extension subsist. The extension will be a part of the reaction system - see Article 5 para. 1 (a) of the Convention (art. 5-1-a). When a decision is made to remand an offender in custody as a step in proceedings for the extension of security measures, because he is dangerous and it is necessary to protect vulnerable persons - in this case children against sexual assaults - the Supreme Court can take no other view than that the remand in custody, in the same way as when a remand in custody is otherwise used pending a sentence becoming legally enforceable, has the necessary connection with the criminal acts committed and the lawful prosecution thereof. The Supreme Court also finds it necessary to consider the restriction which the European Court of Human Rights has read into Article 5 para.\u00a01\u00a0(c) of the Convention (art. 5-1-c) as regards the condition \u2018necessary to prevent him from committing a criminal act\u2019, i.e. that a remand in custody must be to \u2018prevent a concrete and specific offence\u2019 (see, inter alia, the Court\u2019s judgment of 6 November 1980 in the Guzzardi case). This need for concretisation is significant. A more general risk of punishable offences would not be sufficient ... In the opinion of the Supreme Court, the risk of a criminal act [in this case] was concrete and specific for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) ...\"",

The chief of police\u2019s request of 7 February 1990 had relied merely on the need to obtain a medical opinion pending the hearing on the Article 39 issue (see paragraph 35 above). The Delegate, in any event, pointed out that, to the extent that the detention was linked to the applicant\u2019s conviction in 1984, which the Commission disputed, it was subparagraph (a) (art. 5-1-a), not (c) (art. 5-1-c), which would be relevant.

This fact, together with his dangerousness, suggested that he suffered from a true mental disorder warranting compulsory confinement. The Government stressed that, in view of the interim character of the detention in issue, a treatment on a comprehensive basis for the applicant could not reasonably have been expected. In any event his dangerousness at the relevant time had made it difficult to treat him while in detention. There had been a proposed programme for his release but, in the light of previous experience, there had been reason to fear that it would fail (see paragraphs 22-30 and 32 above). That fear had been reinforced by the fact that the applicant had objected to supervision at liberty, although close supervision would have been a prerequisite for providing security and, probably, adequate treatment.

His detention under Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure from 25 February to 15 May 1990 had not entailed any particular treatment and had in fact been unrelated to his mental condition. It had been imposed simply on the ground that the public prosecutor and the courts had not managed to prepare for, and to take, in good time the decision whether to prolong the authorisation to use security measures under Article 39 of the Penal Code, although they had known for five years when the authorisation would expire (see paragraphs 19, 35 and 36 above).

Admittedly, with the passage of time, the link between the initial conviction and a prolongation may become less strong and may eventually be broken, where the prolongation no longer has any connection with the objectives of the initial decision or was based on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Van Droogenbroeck judgment, pp. 21-22, para. 40).",

For this reason the second paragraph of Article\u00a0171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the person concerned may be detained on remand when it is proposed to extend the maximum period for using security measures, subject, inter alia, to the proviso that detention be necessary in order to prevent his recommitting an offence punishable by over six months\u2019 imprisonment, as provided in the third sub-paragraph of the first paragraph of that Article (see paragraph 54 above).",

However, the Court observes that, in a decision of 26 January 1996 in a similar case, the Norwegian Supreme Court stressed the importance of the connection between the initial offence grounding an authorisation to use security measures and any prolongation of such measures. The Supreme Court emphasised that one could not read into the second paragraph of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure a requirement of reasonable suspicion of a new criminal offence having been committed. Since the initial criminal offence could justify prolongation of an authorisation to use security measures, that offence could also furnish the basis for remand in custody under that provision provided that the other conditions, such as the risk of reoffending, were met. Where a decision to remand an offender in custody was made as a step in the proceedings concerning prolongation of security measures, the Supreme Court considered that the remand in custody had the necessary connection with the criminal acts committed (and their lawful prosecution). This interpretation of Article 171 would not in the Supreme Court\u2019s view contravene the Convention; in this respect it referred to Article 5 para. 1 (a) and (c) (art. 5-1-a, art. 5-1-c) (see paragraph 57 above).",

Under sub-paragraph (a) (art. 5-1-a) on the other hand, a person may be detained only after conviction and the imposition of a penalty or other measure depriving him of his liberty. The word \"after\" does not simply mean that the detention must follow the conviction in point of time: in addition, the detention must result from, follow and depend upon or occur by virtue of the conviction. In short, there must be a sufficient causal link between the conviction and the detention. Where the conviction and sentence are not yet final and enforceable, the Court has found such a link to exist where the imposition of a penalty or other measure entailing deprivation of liberty justified (unlike, for example, an acquittal) ordering the detention or continued detention of the person concerned.",

There no longer remained any causal link between the initial \"conviction\" and the detention. Besides, the Court has not said what the causal link between the conviction and the detention was (see paragraph 85 of the judgment).",

A decision to continue the measure must also be a \"conviction\". The situation is similar to that obtaining in systems where there is a gap in criminal proceedings between the finding of guilt (conviction) and the imposition of a penalty or other measure (sentence). The detention in issue was therefore ordered in the context of criminal proceedings before any second \"conviction\", the validity of the first order having expired. There was a connection between the detention and the offence for which the criminal proceedings were continuing, but no causal link with the initial \"conviction\", as the detention did not result from, follow or depend upon or occur by virtue of it.",
