The effect of Article 420 bis, second paragraph, of the CCP was that appellants were dependent on the speed with which the respondent acted if they were to have the opportunity to file supplementary pleadings; in practice, it proved impossible to do so. State Counsel was not subject to any time-limit either, and was therefore able merely to make oral submissions on the day of the hearing. ",

In the instant case the applicants\u2019 supplementary pleadings had been filed after that point. The Government considered that the provision in issue belonged to the measures taken in domestic law to regulate legal remedies and to lay down conditions for their use, with a view to ensuring the proper administration of justice. In practical terms, the provision in issue served to limit the number of pleadings that could be submitted by the various parties, thereby preventing them from being able to continue replying to each other\u2019s submissions right up to the day before the hearing, a scenario that would paralyse the Court of Cassation\u2019s functioning to an unacceptable extent. In any event, measures of that kind fell within the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the authorities in such matters, as they did not impair the effectiveness of the applicants\u2019 right of appeal to an extent incompatible with the requirements of Article 6. The Government relied in that connection on the Commission\u2019s decision in Kaufman v. Belgium (no. 10938/84, 9 December 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 50, p. 98).",

Cases are brought before it after the merits have already been examined at two levels of jurisdiction (in the present case, the first-instance court and the appellate court), on which occasions the parties have had every opportunity to make submissions. The Court of Cassation is able to deal only with arguments that have already been submitted in the trial and appellate courts, with the exception, of course, of new grounds based on public policy, which the court may also raise of its own motion. In order to ensure that proceedings in the Court of Cassation are not prolonged unnecessarily by allowing a succession of written replies to any pleadings filed, as the Government observed, the appellant must submit all his grounds in his pleadings in support of the appeal, and the respondent must raise all its objections and grounds of defence in its pleadings in reply.
