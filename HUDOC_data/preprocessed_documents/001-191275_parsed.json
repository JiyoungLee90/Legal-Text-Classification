According to the report, the applicant had a fracture of the fifth metatarsus bone of his right foot which, given the absence of external injuries in the area of the fracture, could have been sustained without the application of external force to the applicant, for example by twisting the foot while walking or running. The experts found that the injury could not have been sustained in the circumstances described by the applicant or by falling from a height. They further noted that the abrasions on both his hands had been caused by a blunt object, but that there was insufficient information in the file to identify the object. The experts concluded that both injuries could have been sustained between 6 and 12\u00a0February 2008 and stated that it was not possible to establish the date more precisely.

The clear and substantiated conclusion of this examination was put at doubt by the prosecutor without providing any convincing reasons and a new expert examination requested (see paragraph 49 above). The new examination - which was conducted years after the impugned events \u2013 resulted in a different conclusion and was accepted by the prosecutor, again without any reasoning for such a decision (see paragraph 51 above). No justification for the prosecutor\u2019s preference has been provided by the Government either. The Court further notes that the second expert opinion justified its conclusion that the fracture was likely the result of the applicant twisting his foot, by the absence of an external injury corresponding to the fracture. Whether the applicant did or did not have such an external injury on the foot, however, was never established, as his medical examination of 21 February 2008 simply noted that his foot is in a plaster (see paragraph\u00a025). In these circumstances, the Court is not ready to accept the experts\u2019 conclusion referred to by the Government as evidence convincingly establishing the fact that the applicant twisted his foot.",

According to the detailed and consistent description provided by the applicant of the treatment, confirmed as to the blows on his foot by the first expert opinion, this treatment was administered behind closed doors in the police where the applicant had no means of resisting. Further, following the foot fracture caused to the applicant, he was provided no medical assistance, but instead was subjected to another round of questioning, this time in the presence of an investigator (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). In these circumstances his physical pain associated with the above injury must have been exacerbated by feelings of helplessness, acute stress and anxiety. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s illtreatment was intentional and was aimed at extracting evidence from him in relation with the crime of which he was suspected (see, similarly, Belousov v. Ukraine, no. 4494/07 \u00a7 67, 7 November 2013).",
