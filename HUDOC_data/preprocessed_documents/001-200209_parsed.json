It held that in 2006 section 6 of the 2006 Act had been suspended by the State Budget Act 2006. In return amendments to the latter Act, which had entered into force on 1 April 2006, had empowered the Cabinet of Ministers to set up a mechanism for a pension increase. However, in 2006 no such mechanism had been set up and the applicant\u2019s claims relating to 2006 had to be rejected. As to her claims relating to 2007 and 2008, the court noted that in 2007 and 2008 section 6 of the 2006 Act had been suspended and modified respectively by the 2007 and 2008 State Budget Acts. However, on 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008 the Constitutional Court had found that suspension and modification unconstitutional. The court consequently held that the State Pension Fund should recalculate the applicant\u2019s pension, but only for the periods from 9\u00a0July to 31 December 2007, and from 22 May to 31\u00a0December 2008.",
