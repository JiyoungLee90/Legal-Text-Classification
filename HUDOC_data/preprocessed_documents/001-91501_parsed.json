However, the Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a law-governed State, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties. It may therefore prove necessary to protect that confidence against destructive attacks which are essentially unfounded, especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26\u00a0April 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 313). The phrase \u201cauthority of the judiciary\u201d includes, in particular, the notion that the courts are, and are accepted by the public at large as being, the proper forum for the settlement of legal disputes and for the determination of a person\u2019s guilt or innocence on a criminal charge (see Worm v. Austria, 29 August 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports 1997-V). What is at stake as regards protection of the judiciary\u2019s authority is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the accused, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, and also in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, Fey v. Austria, 24 February 1993, Series A no. 255-A). For this reason the Court has found it incumbent on public officials serving in the judiciary that they should show restraint in exercising their freedom of expression in all cases where the authority and impartiality of the judiciary are likely to be called into question (see Wille, cited above, \u00a7 64).",

The Panel found itself short of evidence to prove that Ms Yegorova had attempted to influence the applicant, or to ascertain the absence of such attempts (see the internal report by judge S., paragraph 29 above). While the Court might accept the difficulties of establishing the content of communications between the applicant and Ms\u00a0Yegorova in private, it notes that the applicant\u2019s account has support in the statements of the lay assessors and the court secretary. Furthermore, the Court cannot but note the Panel\u2019s overlooking of irregularities in the ensuing transfer of the case to another judge. The Court notes that pursuant to Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the case must be examined by the same court composition except when one of the judges is no longer able to take part in the hearing. However, it follows from the report by judge S. that Ms Yegorova decided to withdraw the case from the applicant because of her disapproval of the applicant\u2019s conduct of the hearing and \u201cthe existence of confidential reports by relevant agencies\u201d on the applicant\u2019s examination of Zaytsev\u2019s case. In the Court\u2019s view, the mere suggestion that such considerations may have triggered the transfer of a case under judicial examination from one judge to another should have warranted support for the applicant\u2019s allegations. Having overlooked this point, the qualification panel failed to secure a reliable factual foundation for their assessment, and this omission has not been made up for by any of the ensuing instances. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s allegations of pressure have not been convincingly dispelled in the domestic proceedings.",

Political speech, on the contrary, enjoys special protection under Article 10 (see the case-law cited in paragraph 87 above).

However, even if the applicant allowed herself a certain degree of exaggeration and generalisation, characteristic of the pre-election agitation, her statements were not entirely devoid of any factual grounds (see paragraph 92 above), and therefore were not to be regarded as a gratuitous personal attack but as a fair comment on a matter of great public importance.",

A judge has specific responsibilities in the field of administration of justice, a sphere in which States exercise sovereign powers. Consequently, a judge participates directly in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and performs duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State. In the Pitketich case the Court concluded, in line with its Pellegrin judgment (Pellegrin v. France [GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999VIII), that the dispute concerning the judge\u2019s dismissal did not concern her \u201ccivil\u201d rights or obligations within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention, and that her dismissal pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, with a view to protecting the rights of others and maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.",

Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 38, 29 February 2000). However, the right to freedom of expression as such is not without limits and the Court in the same Guja judgment warns against an entirely \u201cpermissive\u201d reading of Article 10: \u201cAt the same time, the Court is mindful that employees owe to their employer a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion. This is particularly so in the case of civil servants since the very nature of civil service requires that a civil servant is bound by a duty of loyalty and discretion\u201d (see Guja, cited above, \u00a7 70; Vogt, cited above, \u00a7 53; Ahmed and Others, cited above, \u00a7 55; De Diego Natria v. Spain, no.\u00a046833/99, \u00a7 37, 14 March 2002).

In addition, in view of the very nature of their position, civil servants often have access to information which the government, for various legitimate reasons, may have an interest in keeping confidential or secret.

Disclosure by civil and public servants of information obtained in the course of their work, even on matters of public interest, must be examined in the light of their duty of loyalty and discretion. Once again, I would point out that in the case of Guja (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-78) the Court held that, in deciding whether the signalling of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace enjoyed the protection of Article 10, account must be had to whether there was available to the civil servant in question any other effective means of remedying the wrongdoing which he or she intended to uncover, such as disclosure to the person\u2019s superior or other competent authority or body ... The applicant preferred to do so publicly some months later, during her electoral campaign (see paragraph 19) and only after this did she lodge the complaint with the High Judiciary Qualification Panel (see paragraph 24): this was clearly done in order to achieve her personal goals, as the Government has submitted.",

The central moral issue in this story is that, through her conduct, former judge Kudeshkina excluded herself from the community of judges prior to the imposition of the disciplinary penalty. Thus, there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the measures applied against the applicant and the legitimate aim of protection of the authority of the judiciary as provided by paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention (see Vogt, cited above, \u00a7 53). These measures were \u201cprescribed by law\u201d (see paragraphs 45-47 of the judgment), pursued a legitimate aim as provided by the last sentence of Article 10 \u00a7 2 (\u201cpreventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary\u201d) and were \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference was proportionate to the above aim (see, among other authorities, Vogt, cited above, \u00a7 53).",

It was, apparently, in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 6.2 that in the instant case the Moscow City Court President withdrew the case from the applicant. Initially, this was on the pretext that if the case had remained with the applicant an unacceptable delay would have ensued. But this was later changed.

His conclusion that there was insufficient evidence in support of the applicant\u2019s allegations, merely because they were denied by the person against whom they were made, cannot be regarded as satisfactory.

She asserted, without any qualifying words and without specifying other instances, that Moscow courts are, in both their civil and criminal jurisdictions, systematically used as an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation; she spoke of brutal manipulation of judges, of outrageous scandals and of extensive corruption in the Moscow courts; and she concluded that if all judges kept quiet the country might soon end up in \u201cjudicial lawlessness\u201d. As I read them, her statements clearly imply that she knew of particular instances which justified what she was describing as the magnitude of the problem.

Further, in so far as the majority judgment makes reference to the applicant\u2019s statements generally, I am unable to agree that the statements consisted essentially of value judgments requiring no substantiation, though I recognise the flexibility of the Court\u2019s case-law on the matter.",

In short, she condemned indiscriminately all judges, demolishing in this way the whole judicial system.

At the time that the impugned statements were made, the applicant\u2019s judicial functions had already been suspended to enable her to conduct her political campaign. She could, consequently, express herself much more freely. But she still remained a judge. She was still bound by the Law on the Status of Judges and she should have had regard to the Code of Honour of a Judge, whether this latter had legislative effect or not. So her speech had to be tempered by discretion. Instead, she went to unacceptable extremes. In my opinion, therefore, it was reasonably open to the domestic authorities to find, as they did, that \u201cthe actions of judge Kudeshkina have degraded the honour and dignity of a judge, discredited the authority of the judiciary [and] caused substantial damage to the prestige of the judicial profession, thus constituting a disciplinary offence\u201d.

In any event the involvement of the Moscow City Court could not have had a determinative influence on the outcome of the proceedings as a whole, given that the substantive findings and the final review of the sanction lay with bodies whose impartiality was not called into question.",
