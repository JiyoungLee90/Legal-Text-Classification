The Court observes that Article 5 \u00a7 4 deals with judicial proceedings; it does not guarantee access to non-judicial forms of review of the lawfulness of detention. A prior complaint to the prosecutor under Russian law was not a pre-requisite for the judicial review of the lawfulness of the detention: those remedies could have been pursued in parallel. In such a situation Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 starts to apply from the time when the applicant has recourse to judicial remedies \u2013 in the present case, that starting point was 17 April 2001, when the applicant lodged his application for release with the Kashira Town Court.",

There are two aspects to this \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement: firstly, an opportunity for legal review must be provided soon after the person is taken into detention and, if necessary, at reasonable intervals thereafter (see Herczegfalvy v. , September 1992, \u00a7 75, Series A no. 244). Secondly, the review proceedings must be conducted with due expedition (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 78, 25 October 2007). The applicant's complaint in the present case concerns this second aspect of the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement.",

In Baranowski v. Poland (no. 28358/95, ECHR 2000-III), it took the domestic courts five months to examine an application for release. In that case the Government showed that the domestic court had commenced the examination of the first application for release as early as the day after it had been submitted and that, subsequently, it had on five occasions adjourned the examination of the relevant applications because evidence had to be taken from three experts. However, despite these arguments, the Court found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4. In the Samy v. the Netherlands case (no.\u00a036499/97, decision of 4\u00a0December 2001) concerning the detention of aliens for the purposes of expulsion, the Court found that a period of twenty-five days was compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 4. By contrast, in the Rehbock v. Slovenia case (no.\u00a029462/95, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2000-XII), the Court found that\u00a0the application for release had been examined twenty-three days after it had been introduced before the first-instance court, and that that was not a \u201cspeedy\u201d examination as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4. A delay of seventeen days has also been declared incompatible with this provision (see Kadem v. Malta, no.\u00a055263/00, \u00a7 43, 9\u00a0January 2003).",

This delay cannot be explained by the complexity of the case: the court's ruling on the application for release was very short and did not address most of the arguments raised by the defence. The Government did not refer to any factors which might account for the delay. Furthermore, it took the  another thirty days to examine the appeal (if calculated from the date when the appeal was lodged). For want of any explanation from the Government, this period by itself raises an issue under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 102). Finally, the Court notes that it took the domestic authorities over seven and a half months to notify the applicant of the decision taken.",
