An example of that trend was SIZO No 1 in , which had registered a 30% decrease in the remand prison population over a period of three years.",

Although this fact in itself does not imply a violation of Article 3 given, in particular, the fact that the applicant received treatment (see Alver v. , no. 64812/01, \u00a7\u00a054, 8\u00a0November 2005 and, mutatis mutandis, Khokhlich v. Ukraine, no. 41707/98, 29 April 2003) and that he fully recovered, the Court considers that these aspects, while not in themselves capable of justifying the notion of \u201cinhuman\u201d treatment, are relevant in addition to the pivotal factor of severe overcrowding in demonstrating that the applicant's conditions of detention went beyond the threshold tolerated by Article 3 of the Convention (compare Novoselov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044).",
