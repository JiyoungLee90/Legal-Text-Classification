The case originated in an application (no. 33331/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Greek national, Mr Mehmet Agga (“the applicant”), on 6 August 2002.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Emin, a lawyer practising in Komotini (northern ). The Greek Government (“the Government”) are represented by Mr V. Kyriazopoulos, Adviser at the State Legal Council and Mrs M. Papida, Legal Assistant at the State Legal Council.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his conviction for usurping the functions of a minister of a “known religion” amounted to a violation of his rights under Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention.
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 26 May 2005 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
On 17 August 1990 the applicant was chosen to be the Mufti of Xanthi by the Muslims who attended prayers at the mosques of that prefectural district. The  appointed another Mufti. However, the applicant refused to step down.
In 1997 three sets of criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant under Article 175 of the Criminal Code for having usurped the functions of a minister of a “known religion” on the ground that on 30 October 1997, 20 November 1996 and 21 December 1997 he had issued and signed messages in the capacity of the Mufti of Xanthi.
The applicant was legally represented throughout the proceedings by lawyers of his own choice. The courts heard a number of prosecution and defence witnesses.
On 24 March 1999 the single-member first instance criminal court (monomeles plimmeliodikio) of Serres found the applicant guilty in the three sets of proceedings on the ground that he had issued and signed messages in the capacity of the Mufti of Xanthi. The proceedings were joined because they concerned the same offence (decision no. 1407/1999).
On 2 November 2000 the three-member first instance criminal court (trimeles plimmeliodikio) of Serres upheld the applicant’s conviction. It imposed, as a whole, a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment and converted it into a fine (decision no. 2687/2000). The applicant appealed in cassation. He alleged that this conviction amounted to a violation of Articles 6, 9 and 10 of the Convention.
On 21 March 2002 the Court of Cassation rejected the applicants’ appeal. It considered that the offence in Article 175 of the Criminal Code was committed “when somebody appeared as a minister of a known religion and when he discharged the functions of the minister’s office including any of the administrative functions pertaining thereto”. The court considered that the applicant had committed this offence because he behaved and appeared as the Mufti of Xanthi. It further considered that the applicant’s conviction was not contrary to Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention, because the applicant had not been punished for his religious beliefs or for expressing certain views but for usurping the functions of a Mufti. As regards Article 6 of the Convention, the Court of Cassation considered that the applicant was legally represented by lawyers of his own choice throughout the proceedings and that he had exercised all his defence rights (judgment no. 708/2002).
The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the judgment of 17 October 2002 in the case of Agga v.  (no. 2), nos. 50776/99 and 52912/99, §§ 33-44.
