The director reportedly showed them the documents necessary to register their children. According to the same documents, on 23 September 2004, the Departmental Director of Education of the Attica region convened an informal meeting with the competent authorities of the municipality of Aspropyrgos to address the problem of additional enrolment of students of Romani origin and the capacity of Aspropyrgos\u2019 primary schools. On one hand, it was decided that the students who had reached the age of first schooling would be accommodated into the existing premises of the 10th and 11th primary schools in Aspropyrgos. On the other hand, the meeting considered that integration of children who had reached an age higher than that of preliminary education into normal classes would be detrimental from a psychopedagogical point of view: the difference of age would not permit them to have an effective schooling. On this basis, the informal meeting decided to provide two additional preparatory classes in preparation for the integration of these students into ordinary classes. \t",

On 3 January 2005, the Ombudsman replied in writing that three representatives of his cabinet had, on an unspecified date, visited the Roma camp in Psari. In his response, the Ombudsman noted that there was not, on the part of the competent services, any systematic and unjustified refusal to enrol children of Romani origin in primary education. He noted that he had already informed teachers at Aspropyrgos\u2019 primary schools that domestic legislation provided for the possibility to enrol children in primary school with the simple declaration of those bearing parental authority, provided that they submit birth certificates in due course. The Ombudsman also referred to the conclusions of several meetings with the leaders of the municipality of Aspropyrgos and, more specifically, to their intention to build a separate building from the school closest to the Roma camp to accommodate the older Romani children in view of bringing them up to standard. The Ombudsman mentioned lastly the tensions that existed between the population of Aspropyrgos, composed mainly of those repatriated from states of the former Soviet Union, and the Romani minority, as an additional element preventing the integration of Romani children into the educational environment. \t",

In this respect, he notes that segregation within the education system is a common characteristic of many member States of the Council of Europe. In some countries, there are isolated schools in isolated camps, in others special classes for Romani children in ordinary schools, or a clear overrepresentation of Romani children in classes for children with special needs. It is frequent that Romani children are placed in classes for children with special needs, without adequate psychological or pedagogical evaluation, the real criteria being their ethnicity. Placement in special schools or classes means that these children often have a less ambitious curriculum than those in normal classes, which reduces their educational prospects and hence their chances of finding a job at a later stage. Automatic placement of Romani children in classes for children with special needs specifically reinforces social stigma by labelling Romani children as less intelligent and less capable. At the same time, segregated education deprives Romani children and non-Romani children of the opportunity to know each other and to learn to live as equal citizens. It excludes Romani children from normal society from a very early age, increasing the risk of them being caught in the vicious cycle of marginalisation.",

According to him, when segregation in education still exists in one form or another, it must be replaced by an ordinary integrated education and, if necessary, prohibited by legislation. Adequate resources should be allocated to pre-school education, language training, and the training of school assistants to ensure the success of desegregation efforts. Then, an adequate assessment should be made before placing children in special classes, so that the only criteria for placement are the objective needs of the child and not his or her ethnicity.\u201d",

As for the steps taken by the school authorities during the summer of 2005 to register Romani students in primary school, the applicants claim that these were inappropriate: the Roma would not have had electrical facilities in their camp to listen to the radio, they would be illiterate, and finally, the postal service would not serve their camp.",

They consider that it would have been possible for their children to attend morning classes, given the limited number of students (from eight to twelve) who attended afternoon class in the main building of the school. In addition, the applicants hold that the special school did not actually work to prepare the Romani students to integrate, since none of these students subsequently joined ordinary classes. The applicants note on this point that today none of the Romani students attend an ordinary or preparatory class; on the other hand, the preparatory classes are abolished, and Romani students have been transferred to the 12th primary school of Aspropyrgos, a newly created establishment which is not yet operational.",

United Kingdom, No. 10233/83, Commission Decision of 6 March 1984, Decisions and Reports (DR) 37, page 109). In addition, the Court more recently underlined the importance of children\u2019s schooling in primary schools, not only to acquire knowledge but also to integrate children into society. The Court has also recognised the usefulness of the system of compulsory schooling to avoid the emergence of a society of two entities with different philosophical convictions (Konrad and others v. Germany (dec.), no. 35504/030, 11 September 2006). In light of this, the Court underlines the particular importance, in systems where school attendance in public or private schools is obligatory, of school enrolment for all school-aged children, which is all the more important for children belonging to minority groups.\t",

The Court notes on this point that Greek law recognises the particularity of the situation of Roma, by facilitating the procedure of enrolling their children in school (see paragraph 32 above).

According to the letter from the 1st Office of Primary Education of West Attica dated 5 June 2007, facing the additional enrolment of students of Romani origin for the 2005-2006 school year, it was age that was used to determine the students who had to attend special classes. However, in its letter \tof 17 March 2006, the Directorate of Primary Education of West Attica informed the Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs that the new students of Romani origin had been welcomed into an Annex of the 10th Aspropyrgos Primary School due to a lack of space in the main building of the school. Finally, in its letter of 20 June 2006, the 3rd district of the Educational Council for Primary Education of Attica declared explicitly to have used the criteria of Romani origin of the interested \u201cwith a view to assure their adaptation to the school environment, taking into account the deficiencies they suffer and diverse other reasons rendering their integration into ordinary classes impossible.\u201d (paragraph 29 above).",
