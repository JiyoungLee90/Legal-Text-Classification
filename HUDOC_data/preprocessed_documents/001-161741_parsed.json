Even in the context of allegations of sexual assault, the Court has left some room for flexibility as to the appropriate remedy. As far back as its judgment in X and Y v. the Netherlands the Court held that, when it comes to providing protection of rights guaranteed under Article 8, \u201cthere are different ways of ensuring \u2018respect for private life\u2019, and the nature of the State\u2019s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private life that is at issue. Recourse to the criminal law is not necessarily the only answer\u201d (see X and Y v. the\u00a0Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 91). Where the right allegedly infringed is not one of a person\u2019s physical integrity but one of personal autonomy, as in the present case, the freedom which respondent States enjoy in choosing the appropriate remedy is in my view indisputable. In the present case Article 8 is applicable, and only at the lower end of it spectrum \u2013 if one can borrow from Article 3 this approach to defining the level of severity of the interference \u2013 and thus the option of providing a non-criminal remedy could not be denied to the respondent State.",

This inevitably places the focus of the analysis as to whether the applicants were afforded effective protection on the criminal investigation, without excluding the possibility that the civil lawsuit might have remedied certain shortcomings in the criminal investigation. In any case, the two sets of proceedings taken as a whole should be assessed as to whether they addressed sufficiently the core of the applicants\u2019 complaint, namely that they had been compelled to parade themselves naked and be massaged by an adult man. It is precisely on this question, whether the criminal investigation combined with the subsequent civil lawsuit addressed the relevant issues with sufficient thoroughness and provided clear and satisfactory answers, that I part with the majority.",

Both their statements (see paragraphs 24 et seq. of the judgment) and the psychological report (see paragraphs 37 et seq.) clearly attest to that. Circumstantial evidence, like the age of the applicants, the fact that their coach was in a strong position of authority and the fact that boys were attending the sauna in their swimsuits, was also relevant. Given the subject of the complaint, the national remedy or remedies should have focused on the issue of consent, and the evidence should have been assessed from this perspective. In my view, however, neither the criminal proceedings nor the subsequent civil proceedings provided a satisfactory assessment of the applicants\u2019 consent or lack thereof. The criminal investigation seems to have only briefly touched upon the issue, choosing instead to focus on the subjective issue, that is, the state of mind of the coach and whether he acted with a \u201csexual purpose\u201d as this term was defined by national law. The lack of such \u201csexual purpose\u201d seems to have been decisive for the termination of the criminal proceedings. As to the consent of the applicants, while the investigation did not challenge the veracity of their statements it reached a conclusion directly opposed to those statements, namely that the applicants had voluntarily attended the sauna naked and had voluntarily requested to be massaged naked. There was no effort to resolve and/or explain this apparent contradiction between this finding and the statements of the applicants and the other evidence. Crucially, there was no effort to address the key issue of the coach being in a position of authority over the applicants. This failure to address the issue which, from the perspective of Article 8 of the Convention, was central, was not remedied by the civil proceedings either. The civil court explicitly rejected the argument that the applicants\u2019 decision to attend the sauna had been influenced by their coach, again without an analysis of the available evidence, and it relied in awarding damages on the more general notion that such a practice was unethical and in contravention of general moral principles. As a result, taken as a whole, the two sets of proceedings did not provide sufficient protection of the applicants\u2019 right to personal autonomy as a component of the right to respect for private life guaranteed by Article\u00a08.\n",

Finland, no. 2872/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045-47, ECHR 2008). In Remetin v.
