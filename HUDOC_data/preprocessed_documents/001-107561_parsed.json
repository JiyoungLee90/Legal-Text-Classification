A person charged with a criminal offence who does not wish to defend himself in person must be able to have recourse to legal assistance of his own choosing (see Han\u017eeva\u010dki v. , no. 17182/07, \u00a7 21, 16 April 2009, with further references). However, this latter right cannot be considered to be absolute either and, consequently, the national courts may override that person\u2019s choice when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (see Croissant v. Germany, 25 September 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no.\u00a0237B). Furthermore, the legal requirement for defence counsel to hold a law degree is not in violation of the above provision (see Shabelnik v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 16404/03, \u00a7 39, 19 February 2009).",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, such a restriction on the free choice of defence counsel may not in itself raise an issue under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c) of the Convention, since the particular legal qualifications can be required to ensure the efficient defence of a person (see Mayzit v. , no. 63378/00, \u00a7 68, 20 January 2005) and the smooth operation of the justice system (see Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96, 35237/97 and 34595/97, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002VII). However, as the applicant argued such restriction had been found unconstitutional as early as November 2000 (see paragraph 37 above), the relevant domestic legislation had to be brought in compliance with the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision. The legislative amendments to this end had been introduced in June 2001, but, according to the Government, further legislative actions were required (see paragraph 48 above). On this latter point, the applicant had disagreed with the Government, considering that the existing legislation did not provide for the restriction on his choice of a lawyer and his choice had been restricted due to wrong interpretation of the criminal procedural law by the Supreme Court.

The Court considers that, even assuming that the restriction results, as the Government suggested, from a yet to be completed process of bringing the criminal procedural legislation in line with the decision of the Constitutional Court, such situation of continuous uncertainty in the relevant domestic legislation presently remains. The Resolution of the Plenary Supreme Court adopted in 2003 did not bring about consistent and uniform application of the law. The Court previously held that an interference with the Convention rights cannot be considered lawful merely because of the absence of any legal provision with which it may conflict. The interference itself must have sufficient basis in domestic law to avoid being arbitrary (see, mutatis mutandis, Svershov v. , no. 35231/02, \u00a7 48, 27 November 2008, and Garkavyy v. Ukraine, no.\u00a025978/07, \u00a7 74, 18 February 2010).",
