Moreover, their licences to sell merchandise subject to excise tax (a\u00a0licence different from the one instituted by the impugned legislation, issued by the Tax Authority as a pre-condition for engaging in tobacco retail) were non-transferable and revocable permits, which did not constitute possessions.

In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, the impugned legislation did not prejudice the essence of the right to pursue an entrepreneurial activity, namely it did not permanently deprive the complainants of the possibility to continue their tobacco retail business, let alone to pursue entrepreneurial activities in general. It only subjected that activity to conditions, which they were not unable to meet. The Constitutional Court found that limitation to be in the public interest and to be sufficiently proportionate to the underlying public health considerations, all the more so since the goods merchandised by the complainants represented well-known health risks and the treatment of smoking-related diseases put a considerable burden on the State \u2013 which, in the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in the regulation of the matter in question.",

For the Court, it is hardly conceivable not to regard this licence, once guaranteeing an important share of the applicant\u2019s turnover (see paragraph 6 above), as a \u201cpossession\u201d for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7\u00a7 177-178, ECHR 2012). It further recalls that the withdrawal of a licence to carry on business activities amounts to an interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions as enshrined in Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, \u00a7 130, ECHR 2005XII (extracts); Rosenzweig and Bonded Warehouses Ltd v. Poland, no.\u00a051728/99, \u00a7\u00a049, 28 July 2005; and Bimer S.A. v. Moldova, no. 15084/03, \u00a7 49, 10 July 2007). Given the obvious economic interests connecting tobacco retail with the applicant\u2019s business in general, the Court is satisfied that the statutory removal of the applicant\u2019s long-standing tobacco licence amounted to an interference with his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see in particular Tre Trakt\u00f6rer AB v. Sweden, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 53, Series A no. 159), and this notwithstanding the harmful consequences of smoking as facilitated by tobacco retail.",

This sentence has been interpreted by the Court as including the requirement that a measure of interference should strike a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights (see, inter alia, Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, \u00a7 69, Series A no. 52). The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole (ibid.) and hence also in the second paragraph. There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see James and Others, cited above, p. 34). A proper balance between the general interest and the individual\u2019s rights will not be found if the person concerned has had to bear an individual and excessive burden (see Rosenzweig, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

The Court has previously found that proceedings related to the renewal or invalidation of licences that are arbitrary, discriminatory, or disproportionately harsh violate the second paragraph of Article 1 of the Protocol. Furthermore, authorities must follow a \u201cgenuine and consistent policy\u201d regarding licensing (see Megadat.com SRL, cited above, \u00a7 79).

Pye (Oxford) Ltd., loc. cit.), a disproportionate and arbitrary control measure does not satisfy the requirements of protection of possession under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It is noteworthy that the applicant\u2019s licence was extinguished without compensation (see, a\u00a0contrario, Pinnacle Meat Processors Company and 8 Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a033298/96, 21 October 1998; and Ian Edgar (Liverpool) Ltd v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a037683/97, ECHR 2000I) or the possibility of judicial redress. The very short period provided to licence holders to make adequate arrangements to respond to the impending change to their source of livelihood was not alleviated by any positive measures on behalf of the State, for example, the adoption of a scheme of reasonable compensation. Moreover, it has not been suggested that the applicant, although his family enterprise was active in the lawful selling of products harmful for the health, was in any breach of the law (compare and contrast, Tre Trakt\u00f6rer, loc. cit.). The measure was introduced by way of constant changes of the law and with remarkable hastiness, the loss of the old licence was automatic, and the non-acquisition of a new one was not subject to any public scrutiny or legal remedy.",
