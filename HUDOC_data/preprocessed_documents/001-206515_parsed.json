The Court considers that the language used by an individual necessarily forms part of that person\u2019s ethnic identity (see in this sense paragraph 28 above), which has already been found to constitute an essential aspect of an individual\u2019s private life (see Ciubotaru v. Moldova, no. 27138/04, \u00a7 53, 27\u00a0April 2010). Moreover, a person\u2019s age obviously forms part of a person\u2019s physical identity (see J.B. and others, cited above, \u00a7 131). Both were underpinning reasons for the impugned measure (see Hudorovi\u010d and Others v. Slovenia, nos. 24816/14 and 25140/14, \u00a7 115, 10 March 2020).

The Court observes in this connection that in his constitutional complaint the applicant indeed never expressly relied on Article 8 of the Convention or Article 35 of the Croatian Constitution. He did, however, complain that he had been unlawfully dismissed from work on the basis of his ethnic origin, and that that had violated his constitutional right to work and prevented him from exercising his professional activity which he had pursued for over twenty-five years (see paragraph 5 above). In view of the link between the applicant\u2019s personal characteristics and the reason for his dismissal, as explained above (see paragraphs 48-49 above), the Court is thus satisfied that the applicant raised, at least in substance, an Article 8 complaint before the Constitutional Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Klauz v. Croatia, no. 28963/10, \u00a7\u00a7 52-53, 18 July 2013). The applicant thereby provided the national authorities with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, namely that of putting right the violations alleged against them (see, for instance, Arps v. Croatia, no. 23444/12, \u00a7 20, 25 October 2016).",

In this connection, the Court notes that the expected language of instruction at the School at the material time does not appear to have been a clear-cut issue. Indeed, the domestic authorities \u2013administrative and civil courts \u2013 had difficulties in establishing in which language the applicant had been expected to teach at the material time. While it is true that under the Secondary Education Act, as a general rule (see paragraph 25 above), all schools were to provide classes in the Croatian language (see paragraph 24 above), in view of the specificity of the peaceful reintegration process in the region (see paragraph 6 above), certain schools in Eastern Slavonia at the material time were providing classes in minority languages, including Serbian (see paragraph 8 above). The Court notes that the Administrative Court was unable to conclusively establish which language the applicant had been expected to teach in (see paragraph 11 above). Furthermore, according to the letter from the then principal of the School and her testimony before the first-instance court, it would appear that an oral directive that all classes should be taught exclusively in the Croatian language had been given to the School only about a month before the relevant inspection took place (see paragraph 12 above). The civil courts ultimately accepted that conclusion (see paragraph 15 above).",

As the applicant pointed out, no teachers of Croatian origin were subjected to an inspection in order to establish whether their use of language during their classes was appropriate, or indeed whether they complied with other statutory regulations in the performance of their teaching duties. While it is true that the pupils\u2019 complaint was lodged only against teachers of Serbian origin (see paragraph\u00a09 above), in the specific post-war context of the Eastern Slavonia region at the material time, singling out a certain group of persons on the basis of language, which is closely related to their ethnic origin, could justifiably raise an issue of compatibility with the prohibition of discrimination guaranteed by both the Convention and the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (see, mutatis mutandis, Or\u0161u\u0161 and Others v.

The Court finds it particularly striking that the possibility of offering additional education or training was simply rejected by the School in the applicant\u2019s case, purely on the grounds of his age and years of service.

That case concerned a bartender working at a bar located on a bus main station, who had been dismissed owing to his employer ceasing the bar\u2019s operation. The only other job he could have been trained for had been that of a professional bus driver, which, as the superior national court explained, required a certain number of years of work experience.
