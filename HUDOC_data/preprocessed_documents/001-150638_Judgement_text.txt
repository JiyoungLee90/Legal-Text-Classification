The case originated in six applications (nos. 79867/12, 79873/12, 80027/12, 80182/12, 80203/12 and 115/13) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by 18 citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ms Stojanka Đurić, Ms Željka Đurić, Mr Miloš Đurić, Ms Cvijeta Bošnjak, Ms Mira Bošnjak, Ms Biljana Bošnjak, Ms Dragana Bošnjak, Mr Boro Bojanić, Ms Zorka Bojanić, Ms Danijela Banjac, Ms Đuja Čolić, Ms Smilja Čolić, Ms Dijana Čolić, Mr Duško Čolić, Ms Dejana Čolić, Mr Neđo Lazarević, Mr Rajko Komljenović and Ms Jevrosima Komljenović (“the applicants”), on 4 and 5 December 2012.
The applicants were represented by Ms R. Plavšić, a lawyer practising in Banja Luka. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Mijić.
This case, like Čolić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 1218/07 et al., 10 November 2009, concerns the non-enforcement of final and enforceable domestic judgments awarding war damages to the applicants.
On 2 September 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government.
By six judgments of the Banja Luka Court of First Instance (“the Court of First Instance”) of 17 February 2000, 25 October 2000, 12 December 2008, 8 July 2003, 11 February 2003 and 31 August 1999, which became final on 15 May 2001, 18 March 2004, 12 January 2009, 30 June 2005 and 4 December 2000 respectively, the Republika Srpska (an Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) was ordered to pay, within 15 days, the following amounts in respect of war damage together with default interest at the statutory rate:
(i)  BAM 21,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, BAM 2,300 in respect of pecuniary damage and BAM 2,350 in respect of legal costs to the Đurićs;
(ii)  BAM 31,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, BAM 2,500 in respect of pecuniary damage and BAM 3,570 in respect of legal costs to the Bošnjaks;
(iii)  BAM 28,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, BAM 2,500 in respect of pecuniary damage and BAM 4,470.60 in respect of legal costs to the Bojanićs and Ms Banjac;
(iv)  BAM 40,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and BAM 2,835 in respect of legal costs to the Čolićs;
(v)  BAM 19,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and BAM 600 in respect of legal costs to Mr Lazarević;
(vi)  BAM 14,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, BAM 2,500 in respect of pecuniary damage and BAM 1,810 in respect of legal costs to the Komljenovićs.
The Court of First Instance issued writs of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) on 24 August 2001, 16 August 2004, 4 April 2011, 8 August 2007, 27 April 2009 and 28 March 2001.
The applicants complained of the non-enforcement to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”).
On 16 January 2013 the Constitutional Court found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the cases of the Đurićs, Mr Lazarević, the Bojanićs and Ms Banjac. In line with its established practice in cases of this type, it refused the applicantsʼ compensation claims, holding that a finding of a violation constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction.
The cases of the Čolićs, the Komljenovićs and the Bošnjaks are still pending before the Constitutional Court.
On 10 April 2008, 12 November 2010, 13 December 2010 and 18 July 2008 respectively the Đurićs, the Bošnjaks, the Čolićs, Mr Lazarević and the Komljenovićs were paid legal costs and default interest.
Under the new settlement plan (see paragraph 16 below) the Đurićsʼ case was scheduled for enforcement in 2014; the Bošnjaksʼ in 2019; the Bojanićsʼ and Ms Banjacʼs in 2030; the Čolićsʼ in 2024; Mr Lazarevićʼs in 2026; and the Komljenovićsʼ in 2017.
In view of the large number of civil actions brought under the ordinary rules of tort law on 29 November 2005 the Republika Srpska created a general compensation scheme for war damage and extinguished the pending civil actions under the terms of the War Damage Act 2005 (Zakon o ostvarivanju prava na naknadu materijalne i nematerijalne štete nastale u periodu ratnih dejstava od 20. maja 1992. do 19. juna 1996. godine, Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska (“OG RS”) nos. 103/05, 1/09 and 49/09). Compensation awarded under this scheme was to be paid in government bonds, which were to be amortised in ten annual instalments.
Some 9,000 judgments became final by 29 November 2005. The Republika Srpska was ordered to pay approximately BAM 140,000,000 in total plus default interest. Their enforcement has been suspended since 28 May 2002 pursuant to the Postponement of Enforcement Act 2002, the Temporary Postponement of Enforcement Act 2003 and the Domestic Debt Act 2004 (Zakon o odlaganju od izvršenja sudskih odluka na teret sredstava budžeta Republike Srpske po osnovu isplate naknade materijalne i nematerijalne štete nastale uslijed ratnih dejstava i po osnovu isplate stare devizne štednje, OG RS nos. 25/02 and 51/03; Zakon o privremenom odlaganju od izvršenja potraživanja iz budžeta Republike Srpske, OG RS nos. 110/03 and 63/04; Zakon o utvrđivanju i načinu izmirenja unutrašnjeg duga Republike Srpske, OG RS nos. 63/04, 47/06, 68/07, 17/08, 64/08 and 34/09).
.  In accordance with the settlement plan envisaged under the Domestic Debt Act 2004, principal debt and associated default interest were to be paid in ten annual instalments between 2014 and 2023 (Odluka o emisiji obveznica Republike Srpske za izmirenje obaveza po osnovu materijalne i nematerijalne štete nastale u periodu ratnih dejstava od 20. maja 1992. do 19. juna 1996. godine, OG RS no. 62/08). The bonds earned interest at an annual rate of 1.5% and could be sold on the Stock Exchange.
Following Čolić and Others, cited above, on 13 January 2012 the Domestic Debt Act 2012 entered into force, thereby repealing the Domestic Debt Act 2004 (Zakon o unutrašnjem dugu Republike Srpske, OG RS nos. 1/12, 28/13 and 59/13). As regards the payment of war damage, it envisages that the judgments will be enforced in cash and in government bonds, if the creditors so accept. The maturity of the bonds is now 13 years. They can be sold at the Stock Exchange, used to pay direct taxes accrued by 31 December 2007, used to finance up to 60% of the purchase price of State-owned flats, commercial buildings, garages and business premises, and for paying a fee for certain administrative decisions (odobrenje legalizacije objekta).
In December 2010 the Action Plan (Odluka o usvajanju Akcionog plana za utvrđivanje ukupnih obaveza po osnovu materijalne i nematerijalne štete nastale u periodu ratnih dejstava od 20. maja 1992. do 19. juna 1996. godine, OG RS, no. 136/10) was introduced in order to implement general measures ordered in Čolić and Others. On 9 October 2012, after the identification of the exact number of unenforced judgments and the aggregate debt (10,257 judgments and 149,285,957.37 convertible marks (BAM)), the Republika Srpska introduced the new settlement plan for the payment of war damages. It envisaged the enforcement of final judgments ordering payment of war damages in cash within 13 years starting from 2013, in the order in which they were received at the Ministry of Finance of the Republika Srpska, provided the creditors had submitted all necessary documents. Furthermore, the Republika Srpska undertook to pay 50 euros (EUR; to be converted into convertible marks at the rate applicable at the date of payment) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. This amount was to be paid first in respect of final judgments which had already been enforced in the form of government bonds. The non-pecuniary damage in respect of other judgments was to be paid in the same year in which the judgment in question would be enforced in accordance with the settlement plan.
In July 2013 the time-frame for the enforcement was extended to 20 years starting from 2013 (Plan isplate obaveza po osnovu materijalne i nematerijalne štete nastale u periodu ratnih dejstava od 20. maja 1992. do 19. juna 1996.godine koje se izmiruju u gotovini).
Furthermore, after Čolić and Others, the War Damage Act 2005 was amended in that any civil actions previously extinguished could be resumed before the competent courts (see paragraph 12 above; Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Zakona o ostvarivanju prava na naknadu materijalne i nematerijalne štete nastale u periodu ratnih dejstava od 20. maja 1992. do 19. juna 1996. godine, OG RS no. 118/09). There are around 3,030 pending cases before the domestic courts.
