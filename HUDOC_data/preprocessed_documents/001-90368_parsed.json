The rights to a trial within a reasonable time and to appeal were often in conflict; in order to strike a balance, the Court had to accept that the duration of the proceedings in cases where the applicants had availed themselves of remedies was inevitably longer. Further, the higher courts were bound by domestic law to remit a case for re-examination if the nature of the errors committed by the lower courts so required.

Further to the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law the Supreme Court quashed the lower courts\u2019 judgments and the case was again sent to the first-instance court for re-examination. On 31 January 2002 the first-instance court delivered a new judgment, which on 26 September 2002 was again quashed, this time by the second-instance court, and the case remitted to the first-instance court for re-examination. On 14 September 2004, seven years and three months after the first judgment in the re-opened proceedings, the first-instance court delivered a judgment which remained effective after being challenged before the higher courts (see paragraphs 11- 22 above) .",

That deficiency is attributable to the\u00a0authorities, not the applicant (see Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25\u00a0November\u00a02003, and Matica v.
