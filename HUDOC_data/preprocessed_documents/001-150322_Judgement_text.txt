The case originated in an application (no. 16086/04) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Alexandr Anatolyevich Kalinin (“the applicant”), on 24 March 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 22 April 2008 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
In accordance with the pilot judgment Burdov v. Russia (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, ECHR 2009), the application was adjourned pending its resolution at the domestic level.
On 29 April 2010 the Government informed the Court that the domestic judgment in the applicant’s favour had been enforced and requested the Court to consider the application on the merits, arguing, in particular, that the applicant had failed to comply with the minimum cooperation requirement. The Court therefore decided to resume examination of the present case.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in YoshkarOla, the MariEl Republic.
The applicant, a military serviceman at the material time, was dismissed from military service on 28 October 1999. He challenged in court his superior’s orders related to the dismissal.
On 22 February 2001 the 101st Garrison Military Court, referring inter alia to Article 239.7 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the R.S.F.S.R. (see paragraph 12 below), allowed the applicant’s challenge of his dismissal from military service in part. The court annulled the respective orders of the commander of the military unit no. 69795 and obliged the commander to change the date of the applicant’s dismissal to 6 March 2000 and to pay him all the allowances due over the period between 28 October 1999 and 6 March 2000 without listing them. The court specified that the allowances were to be calculated in accordance with the instructions and rates applicable on the date of the actual payment. It further ordered the military unit to reimburse the applicant’s legal expenses in the amount of 212.52 Russian roubles (RUB). The court rejected the remainder of the claims as unfounded. The respondent was represented at the court room.
On 25 May 2001 the judgment was upheld on appeal by the 3rd Garrison Military Court and entered into force.
On several occasions, notably on 11 June, 20 July and 29 August 2001 and on 4 March and 22 June 2002, the applicant sent complaints to various authorities arguing that the above–mentioned judgments in his favour had been unfair. On 20 July 2001 and 4 March 2002 he requested the Presidium of the Supreme Court of Russia to quash those judgments by way of supervisory review and to suspend their execution. On 22 June 2002 he submitted, in his complaint to the Constitutional Court, that the judicial award had not been enforced.
On 8 July 2008 the amounts awarded were paid to the applicant in part. According to the Government, on 16 January 2009 the judgment was enforced in full.
Chapter 34.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the R.S.F.S.R., as in force at the material time, set out the procedure for examination of the complaints against State bodies, public organisations and authorities violating rights and freedoms of the citizens. Article 239.7 of the Code provided that a copy of the judicial decision was to be forwarded, for rectification of violations established by a domestic court, to the head of the respondent organisation or authority. Article 239.8 of the Code provided that the judicial decision which had entered into force had binding force on the authority or the organisation concerned. Copies of the decision were to be sent to the respondent authority, as well as an individual concerned, within ten days.
On 30 April 2010 the Russian Parliament adopted the Compensation Act, which entered into force on 4 May 2010. For the relevant provisions of the Compensation Act see Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev v. Russia (dec.), nos. 27451/09 and 60650/09, §§ 29-30, 23 September 2010.
