In particular, the Court notes the prolonged periods of procedural inactivity and the failure to schedule the proceedings regularly (see paragraphs 13-17 above). The Court observes in that connection that it is the role of the domestic courts to manage the proceedings before them so that they are expeditious and effective (see Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 183, ECHR 2006...).",
