On 3 October, the Minister gave instructions to that effect; he also stipulated that the applicant\u2019s release should be subject to a series of condition similar to those previously laid down by the Minister, namely submitting to the \"guidance\" of the Brussels Social Rehabilitation Office, working regularly, not changing employer or address without that Office\u2019s consent, refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and not associating with former criminals. It proved impossible to implement this decision, since Mr. Van Droogenbroeck failed to satisfy any of the conditions attached thereto. On 14 March 1979, he appeared once more before the Recidivists Board, which confirmed the advice it had tendered on 13 September 1978.",

This application was granted on 18 March 1980: after considering the submissions to the contrary on the part of the minist\u00e8re public and although the Court rejected, as in 1976, the arguments based on the Convention, it held that there were by then reasons for releasing Mr. Van Droogenbroeck from the effects of the decision placing him at the Government\u2019s disposal. He was set free on the same day, but shortly afterwards was again deprived of his liberty, the Brussels criminal court and the Ghent Court of Appeal having sentenced him on 10 September 1980 and 3 June 1981 to one month\u2019s and to one year\u2019s imprisonment for aggravated theft, though without applying to him the Social Protection Act.",

There are two components to the judgment: the first is a penalty involving deprivation of liberty which the offender must undergo for a period specified in the court decision, and the second is the placing of the offender at the Government\u2019s disposal, the execution of which may take different forms ranging from remaining at liberty under supervision to detention.",

Attempting to achieve these objectives requires that account be taken of circumstances that, by their nature, differ from case to case and are susceptible of modification. At the time of its decision, the court can, in the nature of things, do no more than estimate how the individual will develop in the future. The Minister of Justice, for his part, is able, through and with the assistance of his officials, to monitor that development more closely and at frequent intervals but this very fact means that with the passage of time the link between his decisions not to release or to re-detain and the initial judgment gradually becomes less strong. The link might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which those decisions were based on grounds that had no connection with the objectives of the legislature and the court or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives.

The placing of recidivists and habitual offenders at the Government\u2019s disposal presented none of the features that called for the application of these precedents. It amounted to a deprivation of liberty ordered by a court of law for a prescribed period. It would not be valid unless objective conditions, which were exhaustively listed in sections 22 and 23 of the 1964 Act and were, in principle, not susceptible of modification with the course of time, were met on the day when the penalty was imposed; its validity could not be brought into question by any subsequent event. The measure thus authorised by the legislature, utilised by the courts and implemented by the Minister of Justice in pursuance of his role of \"individualising this penalty\" was certainly based on the need to protect society against the activities of recidivists and habitual offenders, but neither Belgian law nor the Convention stipulated that detention could continue only if a danger to society would persist in the event of the individual\u2019s release. The Commission\u2019s opinion to the contrary confuses lawfulness with appropriateness, two radically different concepts, and would mean that every convicted criminal ought to be entitled to contest at some point of time the appropriateness of his detention, a position that did not obtain in any country.",

The system of placing recidivists and habitual offenders at the Government\u2019s disposal was established with specific objectives in mind. The position taken by the Court of Cassation is that the measure in question, although assimilated to a penalty, is designed not only to protect society but also to provide the executive with an opportunity of endeavouring to reform the individuals concerned (see paragraph 40 above). Except in the case of the commission of one indictable offence after another (section 22 of the Act), the court ordering the penalty must give reasons for its decision (section 24) and must, in particular, indicate \"in specific and precise terms\" why it considers that the accused, who in the eyes of the law is classified as a recidivist, manifests \"a persistent tendency to crime\", within the meaning of section 23 of the Act (Court of Cassation, 3 January 1962, Pasicrisie 1962, I, p. 526; see paragraph 9 above). In practice, the court\u2019s decision provides the Minister of Justice \"with initial authority for detention for a period ... whose actual duration\" - \"from nothing to ten years\" - is striking for it relatively indeterminate character and will vary, in principle, according to the treatment required by the offender and the demands of the protection of society (paragraph 64 of the Commission\u2019s report and final decision of 5 July 1979 on the admissibility of the application). The detention which may be entailed by a placing at the Government\u2019s disposal occurs only \"if necessary\" (section 25 of the Act), words which the Court of Cassation has taken as synonymous with the phrase \"if the protection of society so requires\" (4 April 1978, Pasicrisie 1978, I, p. 861).",

To a certain extent this was recognised both by the Belgian legislature when it made it possible for the Court of Appeal to grant release from the effects of the initial judgment (section 26 of the Act; see paragraph 23 above) and by the Government when they set up the Recidivists Board and associated \"medical officers specialised in psychology\" with the decisions taken by the Minister (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above).",

However, for the purposes of Article 5 par. 4 (art. 5-4), the \"lawfulness\" of an \"arrest or detention\" has to be determined in the light not only of domestic law but also of the text of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 par. 1 (art. 5-1) (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned X v. the United Kingdom, judgment, Series A no. 46, p. 25, par. 57, to be read in conjunction with the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, Series A no. 33, p. 17, par. 39, and pp. 19-20, par. 45).",

This is the limit which the Minister of Justice must not exceed in the exercise of the wide discretion he enjoys in executing, or implementing, the initial court decision. This requirement is rendered all the more compelling by the seriousness of what is at stake, namely the possibility that the individual may be deprived of his liberty for up to ten years (section 23 of the Act) or even longer (section 22). This type of detention would no longer be in conformity with the Convention if it ceased to be based on reasons that are plausible and consistent with the objectives of the Social Protection Act; for the purposes of Article 5 (art. 5), it would become \"unlawful\". It follows that the individual concerned must be entitled to apply to a \"court\" having jurisdiction to determine whether or not there has been a violation of that kind; this possibility must be open to him during the course of his detention - once a certain period has elapsed since the detention began and thereafter at reasonable intervals (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned X v. the United Kingdom judgment, Series A no. 46, pp. 22-23, par. 52) - and also at the moment of any return to detention after being at liberty.",

It is therefore the measure in its entirety which will be reviewed and not just the question of detention, and the issue will be not so much the \"lawfulness\" of the detention as \"the expediency of early termination of the penalty\" imposed by a judgment which is no longer open te appeal (paragraph 33 of the Government\u2019s supplementary memorial, and Court of Cassation, 15 February 1977 - paragraph 14 above). As the Commission (paragraph 74 in fine of the report) and the applicant (written observations of February 1982) pointed out, the Court of Appeal would not be in a position to \"make a distinction between the deprivation of liberty and such measures of guidance, assistance or supervision\" as might still be necessary, \"even if the current behaviour of the individual concerned were no longer in any way such as to justify in law continuation of the detention\". Moreover, the intervals of three, or even five, years that must elapse between two applications to the court appear too long to be regarded as \"reasonable\" for the purposes of Article 5 par. 4 (art. 5-4) (see paragraph 48 above). The Court notes incidentally that the examination of Mr. Van Droogenbroeck\u2019s applications took seven months on the first occasion (12 May - 13 December 1976, see paragraph 14 above) and six months on the second (16 September 1979 - 18 March 1980, see paragraph 18 above), a fact that sits ill with the notion of \"speedily\".",

Those precedents stated that the powers of those courts were not derived from \"current domestic legislation\" but were a \"creation of case-law\", the origin whereof lay \"in an international treaty and in the principle that priority must be accorded to rules of international treaty law\"; accordingly, the scope of those powers did not go beyond the requirements of Article 5 par. 4 (art. 5-4) (review of lawfulness, but not of expediency).",
