While the Government pointed out that the applicant's solicitors applied to adjourn the appeal hearing listed to follow on 8\u00a0January\u00a01999, due to unavailability of counsel in that week, this does not explain why there was in fact a lapse of another five months before the case came back for its final hearing on 24 June 1999.",
