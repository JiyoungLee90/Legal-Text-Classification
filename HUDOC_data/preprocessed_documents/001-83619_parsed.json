Nonetheless, several elements cast doubt on the veracity of the applicants' claims. The Court observes that the doctor, who examined the applicants on the last day of their police custody, reported that there were no signs of ill-treatment on their bodies. It further notes that Oya Aslan, Ula\u015f Aday and \u015eerif G\u00fcney were released from police custody on 4 May 2001 and the remaining three applicants were released pending trial on 4 July 2001. Thus the applicants could have obtained medical reports in support of their allegations after their release. They failed to do so. Furthermore, they have not adduced any material which could add probative weight to their allegations.

The grievance must be an arguable one in terms of the Convention (see, in particular, Boyle and Rice\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, \u00a7\u00a052). In view of its conclusions above (paragraphs 22 and 23), the Court considers that the applicants have no arguable claim of a violation of their rights under Article 3, which would have required a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 (see K\u00fcnk\u00fcl v. Turkey (dec.), no. 57177/00, 30 November 2006).
