Moreover, the proceedings remained dormant for approximately three months pending the establishment of the whereabouts of the defaulting defendants (paragraphs 17-18 above). Although the delay caused by private persons cannot in itself be imputed to the respondent State (cf. Foley v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a039197/98, \u00a7\u00a038, 22\u00a0October 2002), the Court considers that, in the circumstances of the case, particularly given the applicant\u2019s detention on remand in poor conditions (he had by that time already spent almost two years in custody), this postponement appears unreasonable. The more so, since, as the applicant\u2019s subsequent conviction showed, the presence of these co-defendants was not indispensable for the determination of the applicant\u2019s case.",
