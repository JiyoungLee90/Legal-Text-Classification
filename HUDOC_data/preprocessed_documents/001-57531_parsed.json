After the case had been submitted, prosecution of the \u2018regulatory offence\u2019 became time-barred under section 26(4) of the Road Traffic Act. The proceedings must therefore be stayed by reason of there being a technical bar to prosecution (Verfolgungshindernis), in accordance with Article 206a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, taken together with section 46 of the Act on \u2018regulatory offences\u2019 (Gesetz \u00fcber Ordnungswidrigkeiten) [see paragraph 19 below].",

As it had already explained at length in an earlier decision, Article 6 (art. 6) protected the individual only from possible hazards in civil or criminal trials. This was clear beyond a peradventure from the wording of the provision itself. There was no reason to give Article 6 \u00a7 2 (art. 6-2) a broad interpretation such as would extend its application to other proceedings. The Article (art. 6-2) consequently could not apply to proceedings in connection with \"regulatory offences\", as these had been excluded from the category of criminal offences, and procedure relating to them was quite distinct from criminal procedure. On the basis that Article 6 \u00a7 2 (art. 6-2) was not applicable, the District Court had therefore been right to order the defendant to bear his own necessary costs and expenses (under Article 467 \u00a7 3, second sentence, sub-paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure) because had the prosecution not been statute-barred, \"the defendant would almost certainly (mit ann\u00e4hernder Sicherheit) have been found guilty of an offence\". He had himself admitted to the police that he was not expecting the car which was moving out to the left onto the road in front of him to make a U-turn; and that he had consequently attempted to overtake it but had been unable to avoid a collision despite his efforts to brake. Mr. Lutz had thus broken the basic rule in Regulation 1(2) of the Road Traffic Regulations and, in particular, had disregarded his duty under Regulation 5(3)(1) not to overtake where the traffic situation was unclear. The court held that in such circumstances it would have been unjust to award the defendant\u2019s necessary costs and expenses against the Treasury, especially as the prosecution had become time-barred only during the course of the court proceedings, so that until that moment the defendant was rightly being proceeded against.",

However, with regard to the introductory sentence of paragraph 3 (art. 6-3), the Court referred to paragraph 1 of the same Article (art. 6-1), the reason being that it had consistently held paragraph 1 (art. 6-1) to embody the basic rule of which paragraphs 2 and 3 (art. 6-2, art. 6-3) represented specific applications (see the \u00d6zt\u00fcrk judgment previously cited, p. 17, \u00a7 47). After affirming the \"autonomy\" of the concept of \"criminal\" in Article 6 (art. 6), the Court concluded that the contravention with which Mr. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was charged \"was criminal\" for the purposes of that Article (art. 6) (ibid., pp. 18 and 21, \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 54).",

It held that there was consequently no need to examine Mr. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s contravention \"also in the light of the final criterion stated ...\", for \"the relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake ... cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character\" (ibid., p. 21, \u00a7 54).",

Having regard to the large number of minor offences - notably in relation to road traffic - which are not so discreditable that the offenders deserve the stigma of a criminal penalty, a Contracting State may have good reasons for introducing a system which relieves its courts of the task of dealing with the great majority of them.

What is decisive is that at the end of the day one is left with the impression that the courts did consider that the applicant was in fact guilty. The net result is in my view a surrogate conviction of the accused without the benefit of the protection afforded by Article 6 \u00a7 2 (art. 6-2).",

The principle of the presumption of innocence can be violated independently of the application of such penalty or measure. That presumption accompanies a person charged with a criminal offence throughout the whole trial until conviction. Indeed this cardinal principle of the modern criminal trial would have been lamentably improvident if its scope had to be confined to the non-application of a penalty or, to use again the wording of the judgment, a measure which can be equated with one. Punishment is usually only the last stage in the unfolding of a criminal trial and modern criminal legislation also envisages convictions without punishment or a measure which can be equated with it (cf. for instance in the British system \"absolute discharge\").",
