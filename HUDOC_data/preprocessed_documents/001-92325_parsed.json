It has held on many occasions that, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused. The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of an individual within their control is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (see, among other authorities, Orhan v. Turkey, no.\u00a025656/94, \u00a7\u00a0326, 18 June 2002, and the authorities cited therein). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000-VII, and \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 85, ECHR\u00a01999IV).",

In this connection, the Court cannot but accept the applicants' argument that heavy military vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers were presumably in the exclusive possession of the State. It further notes the applicants' argument that during the period under examination the village of Duba-Yurt had been under the firm control of the federal forces, that check-points had been established at all roads leading to and from the village, and that the perpetrators must have passed through those check-points, none of these facts having been disputed by the Government. In a situation where a group of armed men was able to move freely in heavy military vehicles during night hours in a village secured by federal check-points and to apprehend village residents at their homes, the Court cannot but reach the conclusion that those were State agents.

They pointed out at the outset that the Government had withheld information regarding the investigation by refusing to provide the file of the criminal investigation. They further insisted that the investigation had been superficial, even though it had been promptly commenced and certain investigative actions had been taken at the beginning. In particular, the investigating authorities had questioned Messrs Suliman and Ibragim Elmurzayev, two of the three men who had been detained and then released on 27 March 2004, whereas Mr Umar Elmurzayev, the third man released, did not seem ever to have been questioned, although he could be considered as a very important witness in the case. Moreover, the questioning of Messrs Suliman and Ibragim Elmurzayev appeared to have been superficial and had not gone into any details. Similarly, it does not appear that the authorities attempted to find out from the local residents whether there had been any insignia on the military uniforms of the perpetrators, or whether they had had any distinctive marks. Furthermore, the authorities do not seem to have questioned servicemen who had been on duty on the check-points on the night of the incident. The applicants also submitted that the authorities had carried out only a preliminary medical examination of the bodies found, failing to perform an in-depth forensic examination, to extract bullets from the corpses and to send them for ballistic tests. The authorities also did not seem to have made efforts to establish exactly where the applicants' relatives had been killed. The applicants further pointed out that, as could be ascertained from the Government's observations, the latest investigative action had been taken in April 2004 and the Government had not submitted any information regarding further developments in the investigation.",

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur v.  [GC], no.\u00a021594/93, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 1999III). In particular, there is an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa v. , 2\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7\u00a0102-04, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, and Mahmut Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022535/93, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-07, ECHR 2000-III). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan\u00a0v. the , no.\u00a037715/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-92, 4 May 2001).",

Turkey, no.\u00a026129/95, \u00a7\u00a0159, ECHR 2001III (extracts)). In such cases the Court would normally limit its findings to Article 2. However, if a period of initial disappearance is long it may in certain circumstances give rise to a separate issue under Article 3 (see Luluyev and Others\u00a0v. , no.\u00a069480/01, \u00a7\u00a0114, ECHR 2006... (extracts), or Kukayev, cited above, \u00a7 107). The Court further reiterates that the question whether a member of the family of a \u201cdisappeared person\u201d is a victim of treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 will depend on the existence of special factors which give the suffering of the applicant a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress which may be regarded as inevitably caused to relatives of a victim of a serious human-rights violation. The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities' reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities' conduct (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7 358).",

The Court also notes its above finding that at least some investigative actions were taken at the early stage of the investigation, which the applicants have acknowledged (see paragraphs 85 and 89 above). It cannot therefore conclude that during the period under consideration the authorities remained totally passive. Overall, while having no doubt of the profound suffering caused to the applicants by the abduction and deaths of their relatives, the Court does not consider that the present complaint raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention in the circumstances of the instant case.",

In that context, it has repeatedly stressed that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. To minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104).",

In view of the Court's findings above with regard to Articles 2 and 5 as well as in respect of the applicants' complaint concerning the alleged ill-treatment of their relatives under Article 3 of the Convention, the applicants clearly had an arguable claim for the purposes of Article\u00a013 (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, 27\u00a0April 1988, \u00a7\u00a052, Series A no.\u00a0131). The Court therefore notes that the applicants' complaints under Article 13 in conjunction with Articles 2, 3, in so far as the alleged ill-treatment of the applicants' relatives was concerned, and Article 5 of the Convention are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.

Accordingly, the applicants did not have an \u201carguable claim\u201d of a violation of substantive Convention provisions and, therefore, Article 13 of the Convention is inapplicable to this part of the application.

In view of its above finding that the applicants' complaint under Article 8 was lodged out of time (see paragraph 117 above), the Court further finds that the applicants' complaint under Article 13 in conjunction with Article 8 is also time barred.

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention.

Having regard to the applicants' submissions, the Court does not consider the amounts sought by them excessive, and finds it appropriate to grant the applicants' claims under this head in full. It therefore awards the following amounts, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants:",
