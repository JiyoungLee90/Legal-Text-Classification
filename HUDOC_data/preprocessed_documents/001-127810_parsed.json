This interpretation, however, was disputed at the domestic level. In particular, the Court notes that on 15 April 2011 the Leninskiy District Court found for the applicant and ordered the District Department of the Pension Fund to resume payment of pension to the applicant with effect from 7 October 2009, the date of the Constitutional Court decision. This decision was upheld on appeal, but the applicant did not inform the Court whether it was further appealed in cassation by the Pension Fund Department.

Moreover, it is difficult to draw any genuine comparison between the pensioners within the country and those living elsewhere, because of the range of economic and social variables which apply from country to country (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 85 and 86). Furthermore, the Court established that the States had the right to enter into reciprocal agreement in social security sphere and the fact that a State entered in such agreement with one country could not create an obligation for that State to confer the same social security advantages to persons living in other countries (ibid, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 and 89)",

In the present case, however, the entitlement to the pension itself had been made dependent on the applicant\u2019s place of residence, resulting in a situation in which the applicant, having worked for many years in his country and having contributed to the pension scheme, had been deprived of it altogether, on the sole ground that he no longer lived in Ukraine. Indeed, the applicant, who had been economically active in Ukraine from 1956 to 1996, had a right to a pension after he retired and, as the domestic law provided at the material time, he would again receive his pension upon his return to Ukraine. The Court therefore concludes that, with respect to the entitlement to the pension itself, the applicant was in a relevantly similar situation as the pensioners who resided in Ukraine.",

The Court has frequently reiterated that the Convention is a living instrument which must be interpreted \u201cin the light of present-day conditions\u201d (see Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, 25 April 1978, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 26). The rise of population mobility, the higher levels of international cooperation and integration, as well as developments in the area of banking services and information technologies no longer justify largely technically motivated restrictions in respect of beneficiaries of social security payments living abroad, which may have been considered reasonable in the early 1950s when the 1952 ILO Convention, mentioned in paragraph 26, was drafted.",
