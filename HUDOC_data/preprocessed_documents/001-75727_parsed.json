In this regard the mitigation of a sentence on the ground of the excessive length of proceedings does not in principle deprive the individual concerned of his status as a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. However, this general rule is subject to an exception when the national authorities have acknowledged in a sufficiently clear way the failure to observe the reasonable time requirement and have afforded redress by reducing the sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Eckle v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 66, Beck v. Norway, no.\u00a026390/95, \u00a7\u00a027, 26 June 2001 and Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR 2006...).",

As the applicant pointed out, the court significantly increased the sentence from one year and ten months\u2019 conditional imprisonment to four year and a half years\u2019 unconditional punishment. Since the Court of Appeal also had regard to the systematic nature of the applicant\u2019s offending as an aggravating factor, it is not evident from the text of its judgment what reduction was in fact made for length. The Government\u2019s calculation that the likely sentence but for the length aspect would have been six years, indicating a reduction of one and a half years is speculative. It is not an automatic or necessary conclusion that can be drawn from the court\u2019s judgment. It cannot, therefore, be said that the applicant has been afforded express and quantifiable redress for the alleged breach of the reasonable time requirement (see, mutatis mutandis, Beck\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 27-29; also Jensen v.

The Court sees no indication that the applicant contributed to the length at this stage, either through the submissions which he made to the court or through his apparent acceptance of the timetabling proposed by the District Court.
