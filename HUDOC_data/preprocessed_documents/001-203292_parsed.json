It considered that the applicants had been suffering a disproportionate burden as a result of the huge discrepancy between the low amount of rent paid to them in connection with the requisition and the market value of the property. It noted that while the applicants had been paid a lump sum in 2001 they had been suffering such interference for forty years. Thus, no fair balance had been reached. The court awarded the applicants EUR\u00a050,000 in compensation bearing in mind the value of the property, the public interest behind the interference, the fact that the applicants only complained after several decades, the payment made in 2001, and the fact that the Convention was applicable to Malta only post 1987.

Concerning remedial action, it held that while only one Government entity continued occupying a small part of the property and the keys to the rest of the property had been returned to the applicants, the requisition was still in force. It was thus for the authorities to derequisition the property in its entirety. Given such an order it considered that compensation was less relevant and that in any event it was not for the Constitutional Court to award civil pecuniary damage which was available before the ordinary courts. In its view its function was limited to awarding fair compensation for the period during which the applicants were denied the peaceful possession of their property against an inadequate amount of compensation.",

Thus, in the Constitutional Court\u2019s view the aggregate sum of EUR 117,432 and the return of the property constituted an effective remedy for the breach suffered. However, given that the property had not yet been derequisitioned, interest was due from the date of the judgment appealed against.

The applicants submitted that in 1974 the rent being paid by the Government was EUR 256.23 (slightly more than the Government had been paying in 1939, which was approximately EUR\u00a0210) and that the rent had not been adjusted to meet inflation or other costs, at any point in the forty years that followed. They noted that, according to their expert\u2019s valuation - which was accepted by the domestic court in the absence of any other expert report being submitted by the Government - the value of the property in 2012 was EUR\u00a0127,700 annually. Thus, adjusting that rental value to the previous years, over the forty years during which the property had been requisitioned, they should have received rent of over EUR\u00a03,000,000. In reality they had only made EUR 6,661.98 in rent. They had then been granted a sum by the Ombudsman and later the domestic courts (totalling EUR\u00a0117,431.70) which in all, however, amounted to twenty-five times less than what was due to them (and this without factoring other issues such as interest on the amounts and the damage caused to the property). The applicants also added that over time some of the entities making use of the property had been privatised and used for private and commercial purposes. They further submitted that the partial derequisition order issued in 2014 (of three basement rooms), whereby the areas occupied by the Local Councils Association were derequisitioned, had a negligible effect on the possession of the property as the applicants were not free to use and enjoy the property as they wished. They, thus, considered that the measure had been clearly disproportionate.",

Dividing that sum over the relevant period meant that over forty-four years the applicants were obtaining around EUR\u00a02,669 annually, but given that the applicants only complained about rent in 1991, this would mean that the total compensation over the relevant period would amount to EUR\u00a04,349 annually which the Government considered was sufficient compensation given that the measure was lawful and in the general interest.",

Nevertheless, that discretion, however considerable, is not unlimited and its exercise cannot entail consequences at variance with the Convention standards (see Fleri Soler and Camilleri v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a035349/05, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR\u00a02006X). However, these principles do not necessarily apply in the same manner where, as in the present case, the requisition of property belonging to private individuals is not aimed at securing the social welfare of tenants or preventing homelessness (ibid. \u00a7\u00a077). In the Court\u2019s view, in cases such as the present one the effects of the rent-control measures are subject to closer scrutiny at the European level (ibid., in connection with property requisitioned for use as government offices). Furthermore, the use of property for reasons other than to secure the social welfare of tenants and prevent homelessness has an impact on the compensation due to the owner (see Fleri Soler and Camilleri v.\u00a0Malta (just satisfaction), no.\u00a035349/05, \u00a7\u00a018, 17 July 2008).",
