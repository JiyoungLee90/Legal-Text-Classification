The Court acknowledges the complexity of the situation, but it observes that the applicant was able to appeal against this decision and was served with reasoned decisions from both the High Court of Justice and the Constitutional Court from which it could be clearly inferred that the issue of his contact rights would not be definitely settled until the High Court of Justice had decided the appeal lodged by the applicant against the divorce judgment.",

Re-establishing contact between father and children in the circumstances of the case required effort from all concerned persons, including the applicant, whose inactivity seems to have contributed to his lack of contact with his children. The Court draws attention to the fact that, from the documents provided, there is no evidence that following the first suspension of his contact rights the applicant sought to have them restored until five months later, that he never deposited the total sum required by the separation judge in security for the cost of the psychotherapeutic examination of his son and both parents, and that he did not voluntarily deposit the sum required by the judge dealing with the enforcement of the divorce judgment in security for the cost of carrying out the psychological treatment of his son, the enforcement judge even having tried to have the applicant\u2019s assets seized for this purpose but to no avail.",

As the court stated in its decisions of 19 June 2008 and 12 February 2009 and the divorce judge implicitly assumed in issuing the judgment of 21 October 2008, the competence to decide on parent-child contact once a divorce has been granted falls to the courts dealing with the divorce. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant was able to appeal both of those decisions (which he did) and that the divorce judge and the appeal courts provided the applicant with reasoned decisions that cannot be deemed unreasonable or arbitrary. The divorce judgment introduced a new contact schedule in favour of the applicant that superseded all previous judicial decisions on the matter. This new contact schedule remained suspended as a result of the suspensive effect of the applicant\u2019s appeal against it until the judgment of 23 July 2009 was delivered by the High Court of Justice, which upheld the divorce judgment in its entirety. There is no evidence, as has already been mentioned, that the applicant requested any interim measures from the High Court of Justice in his appeal against the divorce judgment or at any later stage prior to the High Court of Justice issuing a decision in his appeal. In these circumstances, the Court cannot conclude that the domestic courts failed to fulfil their positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention, the applicant contributing to his lack of contact with his children.",
