The Supreme Court referred the case to the Szczecin Court of Appeal.
The applicant sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings before the  had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN).

It awarded the applicant PLN 3,000 in just satisfaction. The court observed that the claim for just satisfaction in the amount of PLN 10,000 was excessive.
The court did not take into consideration the delays that had occurred before the Szczecin Court of Appeal (between August 1998 and 7 March 2000), nor did it consider the period between 12 June 2000 and 14 February 2002, when the case was pending before the Supreme Court.

On an unknown date in 1994 the police instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of threatening behaviour. On 9 January 1995, by a decision of the district prosecutor, the applicant was made subject to a police supervision order. The applicant appealed.
On 10 February 1995 the Szczecin Regional Prosecutor amended the decision and the police supervision order was quashed.
On 29 March 1996 the Goleniów District Court issued a penal order imposing a fine on the applicant. It appears that the applicant lodged an appeal. The proceedings were terminated by a final decision of 5 June 1996 (the applicant has not produced a copy of it).
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.
