In 1998-1999 the court could not hear the case because of the prolonged illness of the applicant's wife, which prevented her from attending. It was not possible to proceed with the case, which involved delicate and personal matters, without the presence of both parties. The court verified the reasons for the adjournment requests of the applicant's wife by requesting information about her state of health and her ability to participate in the proceedings. As soon as her health improved, the court decided on the divorce at the first hearing on 1 December 1999. The hearings on the property issue in September 2000 were adjourned at the request of the parties. It was submitted that the lack of legal representation of both parties contributed to the delay in the proceedings.",
