There has been extensive discussion on the issue and it continues to be the subject of lively debate in Turkish society. Those in favour of the headscarf see wearing it as a duty and/or a form of expression linked to religious identity. However, the supporters of secularism, who draw a distinction between the ba\u015f\u00f6rt\u00fcs\u00fc (traditional Anatolian headscarf, worn loosely) and the t\u00fcrban (tight, knotted headscarf hiding the hair and the throat), see the Islamic headscarf as a symbol of a political Islam. As a result of the accession to power on 28 June 1996 of a coalition government comprising the Islamist Refah Partisi, and the centre-right Do\u011fru Yol Partisi, the debate has taken on strong political overtones. The ambivalence displayed by the leaders of the Refah Partisi, including the then Prime Minister, over their attachment to democratic values, and their advocacy of a plurality of legal systems functioning according to different religious rules for each religious community was perceived in Turkish society as a genuine threat to republican values and civil peace (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, ECHR 2003-II).",

In addition, the resolution adopted by  on 9 July 1998 shows that various other forms of religious attire are also forbidden on the university premises (see paragraph 47 above).",

Arguing that calls for permission to wear the Islamic headscarf in all parts of the university premises were misconceived and pointing to the public-order constraints applicable to medical courses, he asked the students to abide by the rules, which were consistent with both the legislation and the case-law of the higher courts (see paragraphs 43-44 above).",

The two highest courts, the  and the , have managed to establish settled case-law on this issue (see paragraphs 37, 39 and 41 above). It is quite clear that throughout that decision-making process the university authorities sought to adapt to the evolving situation in a way that would not bar access to the university to students wearing the veil, through continued dialogue with those concerned, while at the same time ensuring that order was maintained and in particular that the requirements imposed by the nature of the course in question were complied with.",

As to how compliance with the internal rules should have been secured, it is not for the Court to substitute its view for that of the university authorities. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the education community, the university authorities are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions or the requirements of a particular course (see, mutatis mutandis, Valsamis v.\u00a0Greece, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996VI, p. 2325, \u00a7 32). Besides, having found that the regulations pursued a legitimate aim, it is not open to the Court to apply the criterion of proportionality in a way that would make the notion of an institution\u2019s \u201cinternal rules\u201d devoid of purpose.

However, it is of crucial importance that the Convention is interpreted and applied in a manner which renders its rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory. Moreover, the Convention is a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions (see Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13\u00a0June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 19, \u00a7 41; Airey v.

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2005-I). While the first sentence of Article 2 essentially establishes access to primary and secondary education, there is no watertight division separating higher education from other forms of education. In a number of recently adopted instruments, the Council of Europe has stressed the key role and importance of higher education in the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the strengthening of democracy (see, inter alia, Recommendation No. R (98) 3 and Recommendation 1353 (1998) \u2013 cited in paragraphs 68 and 69 above).

Firstly, the measures in question manifestly did not hinder the students in performing the duties imposed by the habitual forms of religious observance. Secondly, the decision-making process for applying the internal regulations satisfied, so far as was possible, the requirement to weigh up the various interests at stake. The university authorities judiciously sought a means whereby they could avoid having to turn away students wearing the headscarf and at the same time honour their obligation to protect the rights of others and the interests of the education system. Lastly, the process also appears to have been accompanied by safeguards \u2013 the rule requiring conformity with statute and judicial review \u2013 that were apt to protect the students\u2019 interests (see paragraph 95 above).",

The right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention is a \u201cprecious asset\u201d not only for believers, but also for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. It is true that Article 9 of the Convention does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief and that in democratic societies, in which several religions coexist, it may be necessary to place restrictions on freedom to manifest one\u2019s religion in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone\u2019s beliefs are respected (see paragraph 106 of the judgment). Further, pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a democratic society and this entails certain consequences. The first is that these ideals and values of a democratic society must also be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise, which necessarily entails mutual concessions on the part of individuals. The second is that the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of the tensions by eliminating pluralism, but, as the Court again reiterated only recently, to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Ouranio Toxo and Others v. Greece, no. 74989/01, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2005-X).",

The comparative-law materials do not allow of such a conclusion, as in none of the member States has the ban on wearing religious symbols extended to university education, which is intended for young adults, who are less amenable to pressure. The second factor concerns the European supervision that must accompany the margin of appreciation and which, even though less extensive than in cases in which the national authorities have no margin of appreciation, goes hand in hand with it. However, other than in connection with \u2019s specific historical background, European supervision seems quite simply to be absent from the judgment. However, the issue raised in the application, whose significance to the right to freedom of religion guaranteed by the Convention is evident, is not merely a \u201clocal\u201d issue, but one of importance to all the member States.

While I fully and totally subscribe to each of these principles, I disagree with the manner in which they were applied here and to the way they were interpreted in relation to the practice of wearing the headscarf.

Religious freedom is, however, also a founding principle of democratic societies. Accordingly, the fact that the Grand Chamber recognised the force of the principle of secularism did not release it from its obligation to establish that the ban on wearing the Islamic headscarf to which the applicant was subject was necessary to secure compliance with that principle and, therefore, met a \u201cpressing social need\u201d. Only indisputable facts and reasons whose legitimacy is beyond doubt \u2013 not mere worries or fears \u2013 are capable of satisfying that requirement and justifying interference with a right guaranteed by the Convention. Moreover, where there has been interference with a fundamental right, the Court\u2019s case-law clearly establishes that mere affirmations do not suffice: they must be supported by concrete examples (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 89, ECHR 1999-VI).

Firstly, the judgment does not address the applicant\u2019s argument \u2013 which the Government did not dispute \u2013 that she had no intention of calling the principle of secularism, a principle with which she agreed, into question. Secondly, there is no evidence to show that the applicant, through her attitude, conduct or acts, contravened that principle. This is a test the Court has always applied in its case-law (see Kokkinakis v.\u00a0Greece, judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, and United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports 1998-I). Lastly, the judgment makes no distinction between teachers and students, whereas in Dahlab (decision cited above), which concerned a teacher, the Court expressly noted the role-model aspect which the teacher\u2019s wearing the headscarf had. While the principle of secularism requires education to be provided without any manifestation of religion and while it has to be compulsory for teachers and all public servants, as they have voluntarily taken up posts in a neutral environment, the position of pupils and students seems to me to be different.",

Mutatis mutandis, in the sphere of freedom of expression (Article 10), the Court has never accepted that interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression can be justified by the fact that the ideas or views concerned are not shared by everyone and may even offend some people. Recently, in G\u00fcnd\u00fcz v. Turkey (no. 35071/97, ECHR 2003-XI), the Court held that there had been a violation of freedom of expression where a Muslim religious leader had been convicted for violently criticising the secular regime in Turkey, calling for the introduction of the sharia and referring to children born of marriages celebrated solely before the secular authorities as \u201cbastards\u201d.

As the  noted in its judgment of 24 September 2003, wearing the headscarf has no single meaning; it is a practice that is engaged in for a variety of reasons.

The applicant, a young adult university student, said \u2013 and there is nothing to suggest that she was not telling the truth \u2013 that she wore the headscarf of her own free will. In this connection, I fail to see how the principle of sexual equality can justify prohibiting a woman from following a practice which, in the absence of proof to the contrary, she must be taken to have freely adopted. Equality and non-discrimination are subjective rights which must remain under the control of those who are entitled to benefit from them. \u201cPaternalism\u201d of this sort runs counter to the case-law of the Court, which has developed a real right to personal autonomy on the basis of Article 8 (see Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2001-III; Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, ECHR 2002-III; and Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028957/95, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2002-VI).

The fact of the matter is that no attempt was made to try measures that would have had a less drastic effect on the applicant\u2019s right to education in the instant case. My second point is that it is common ground that by making the applicant\u2019s pursuit of her studies conditional on removing the headscarf and by refusing her access to the university if she failed to comply with this requirement, the authorities forced the applicant to leave the country and complete her studies at . She was thus left with no alternative.

University affords practical access to knowledge that is free and independent of all authority. Experience of this kind is far more effective a means of raising awareness of the principles of secularism and equality than an obligation that is not assumed voluntarily, but imposed. A tolerance-based dialogue between religions and cultures is an education in itself, so it is ironic that young women should be deprived of that education on account of the headscarf. Advocating freedom and equality for women cannot mean depriving them of the chance to decide on their future. Bans and exclusions echo that very fundamentalism these measures are intended to combat. Here, as elsewhere, the risks are familiar: radicalisation of beliefs, silent exclusion, a return to religious schools.
