When further charges had been later added to the bill of indictment, the applicant had stood accused of a number of offences, including a particularly serious one. The Government further argued that the applicant\u2019s continued detention had been the result of the courts\u2019 assessment of the likelihood that he would abscond, reoffend or pervert the course of justice, given the gravity of the charges against him and the fact that prior to his arrest, he had been a high-ranking police official. They observed that the applicant had had friendly relations with other parties to the criminal proceedings and thus had been likely to pervert the course of justice. They stressed that the pre-trial investigation had been lengthy because of the complexity of the case and the need to take a large number of investigative steps. The Government noted that more than twenty trial hearings had been held by the Leninskiy District Court. The proceedings had been stayed a number of times because it had been necessary to ensure the witnesses\u2019 or experts\u2019 attendance. It had also been necessary to collect additional evidence following motions put forward by the defence. The Government drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that the applicant had been detained pending the pre-trial investigation for less than twelve months and had remained in custody for slightly more than a year while the trial proceedings had been pending. The Government concluded by noting that the authorities had taken effective action in dealing with the case, that there had been no delays for which they could be held liable, and that the applicant\u2019s detention had been based on relevant and sufficient grounds.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant, the authorities could justifiably have considered that such an initial risk was established (see Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26 July 2001). However, the Court reiterates that the possibility of a severe sentence alone is not sufficient after a certain lapse of time to justify continued detention based on the danger of flight (see Wemhoff v. Germany, 27 June 1968, \u00a7 14, Series A no. 7, and B.\u00a0v. Austria, 28 March 1990, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 175).",

In particular, regard must be had to the character of the person involved, his morals, his assets, etc. (see W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 254A). Having said that, the Court would emphasise that there is a general rule that the domestic courts, in particular the trial court, are better placed to examine all the circumstances of the case and take all the necessary decisions, including those in respect of pre-trial detention. The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see B\u0105k v. Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007II (extracts)). In the present case the national courts also relied on other circumstances, including the applicant\u2019s previous service as a high-ranking police officer and the flowing inside knowledge of domestic criminal proceedings and police work, as well as his close and, even, friendly relations with the parties to the criminal proceedings. While the Court doubts whether those circumstances, taken on their own, could have justified the domestic courts\u2019 finding about the necessity of the applicant\u2019s detention, it is satisfied that the totality of those factors combined with other relevant grounds could have provided the domestic courts with an understanding of the pattern of the applicant\u2019s behaviour and the persistence of the risks preventing his release.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that one of the main grounds invoked by the domestic courts in their justification for the applicant\u2019s detention was the likelihood of his perverting the course of justice. By having tried to bribe the police officer, the applicant attempted to obstruct the investigation. There was a risk that, if released, he would continue his attempts to interfere with the proceedings. Therefore, the domestic courts could justifiably consider it necessary to keep the applicant in custody (compare with Yudayev v. Russia, no.\u00a040258/03, \u00a7 70, 15 January). The Court is also mindful of the courts\u2019 findings about the applicant\u2019s potential, given his previous service in the police, to influence witnesses. The Court reiterates that, as regards the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses, the judicial authorities appeared to presume that such a risk existed on the ground that the applicant was closely acquainted with all the witnesses in his case and that the nature of his ties to the witnesses facilitated the task of possible connivance with them. The Court accepts that, in the special circumstances of the case, the risk stemming from the nature of the applicant\u2019s relations with witnesses actually existed and justified holding him in custody (compare with Ra\u017cniak v. Poland, no. 6767/03, \u00a7 31, 7 October 2008, and also see Contrada v.\u00a0Italy, 24 August 1998, \u00a7 58, Reports 1998V). In order to demonstrate that a substantial risk of collusion existed and continued to exist, the District Court further referred to the scope of the case and the necessity to perform a number of procedural steps with which the applicant could have interfered, if released. The Court observes that the domestic courts carefully balanced the interests of justice against the applicant\u2019s right to liberty. On the basis of the information in their possession at the time when the detention orders were issued, the domestic courts could have reasonably considered that the danger posed by the applicant to the proper administration of justice was real and that it warranted his detention.",

Russia, no. 72967/01, \u00a7\u00a7 99 et seq., 1 March 2007; Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, \u00a7\u00a7 103 et seq., ECHR 2006-... (extracts); and Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7\u00a7 72 et seq., 1\u00a0June 2006). In the present case, the domestic courts cited specific facts in support of their conclusion that the applicant might interfere with the proceedings. The Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s behaviour as described in the decisions of the domestic courts justified his detention. The applicant\u2019s detention was therefore based on \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds.",

The applicant did not argue, and the Court has no reason to conclude otherwise, that any delay in the proceedings had been attributable to the investigative authorities or the courts. In the present case the investigation was completed within approximately ten months. There is no evidence of any significant periods of inactivity on the part of the prosecution authorities. The materials presented by the parties show that within ten months the prosecution had obtained several expert opinions, questioned the applicant, confronted him with witnesses and drawn up the bill of indictment. While the Court does not lose sight of the fact that it took the trial court approximately a year to examine the applicant\u2019s case, it reiterates that the right of an accused in detention to have his case examined with particular expedition must not hinder the efforts of the courts to carry out their tasks with proper care (see among other authorities, W. v. Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7 42). While an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the efforts of the authorities to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide the defence with all the necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed. The Court does not observe any delays in the course of the trial proceedings. Hearings were scheduled and held at regular intervals. It appears that the trial court took steps to ensure that the hearings were attended by the parties and other participants to the proceedings, to avoid any unjustified adjournments. The Court is of the opinion that the trial proceedings were conducted with due expedition, having regard to the complexity of the case and the amount of evidence which needed to be thoroughly examined by the trial court. The Court considers that the domestic authorities handled the applicant\u2019s case with the requisite diligence.",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State that institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v. France, 23 November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series\u00a0A no. 273-B, and Toth v. Austria, 12 December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee and Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2003-IV). In this context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v. Poland, no. 27504/95, \u00a7 76, 4 October 2001).",
