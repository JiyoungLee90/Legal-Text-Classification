The fact that she had not been in occupation for as long as the family in Connors is not, in my judgment, of much significance.

He found that the main reason for the narrowing of the margin of appreciation in Connors itself was that the complete absence of any procedural safeguards was a serious interference with the applicant\u2019s Article\u00a08 rights in that case, which called for particularly weighty reasons of public interest in justification. However, the precise scope of these safeguards was in his view, a matter for the national authorities to determine.

Absent a public law challenge, the occupant had no opportunity to challenge the reasons given by the local authority for seeking possession and the court had no jurisdiction to take the reasons into account in deciding whether to order the occupant\u2019s eviction. The local authority\u2019s reasons were irrelevant as were the occupant\u2019s personal circumstances. Nor did the court have power to suspend an order for possession even in circumstances of extreme hardship which indicated that eviction would not be justified under article 8(2).

Regarding her procedural complaint, they explained that under the statutory scheme in place at the time, the applicant had the right to contest when any possession order could take effect. The domestic courts were under a duty to exercise their power to suspend in accordance with the requirements of the Convention. Moreover, having obtained a suspension of the possession order for a period of up to twelve months, she was entitled before the expiry of that period to argue that a further period of suspension should be granted. It was clear from the terms of the County Court judgment that in ordering suspension, the judge considered the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances and he granted the full suspension period sought. The Court of Appeal subsequently found that the applicant\u2019s case was not a wholly exceptional one requiring examination, within the meaning of McCann v. the , no. 19009/04, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2008; and Kay and Others v. the , no. 37341/06, \u00a7 73, 21 September 2010. The Government considered that the scheme itself and the manner in which it was applied in the applicant\u2019s case were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a08 of the Convention. They distinguished the Court\u2019s judgment in Connors, cited above, on the basis that since that case was decided, section 4 of the 1968 Act had been amended (see paragraph\u00a036 above) which, they argued, resulted in the necessary degree of procedural protection being afforded to the present applicant.",

An interference will be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for a legitimate aim if it answers a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of necessity, the final evaluation as to whether the reasons cited for the interference are relevant and sufficient remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention (see Connors, cited above, \u00a7 81). In making their initial assessment of the necessity of the measure, the national authorities enjoy a margin of appreciation in recognition of the fact that they are better placed than international courts to evaluate local needs and conditions (see Kay, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66).",

Although further suspensions may be granted, suspension merely delays, and does not remove, the threat of eviction. The Court cannot accept that the fact that an individual may effectively be able to remain in her home in the long-term by making repeated applications to extend suspension of a possession order removes any incompatibility of the procedure with Article\u00a08. It is further significant that in the present case the County Court judge considered the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances to be such that suspension was justified and he granted a suspension for the full period sought. In the circumstances it is not possible for the Court to predict what decision he might have reached on the granting of the possession order had he considered it open to him to refuse the grant on the basis of personal circumstances.",

This sentence is a verbatim reproduction of what is found in \u00a7 50 of McCann and in \u00a7 68 of Kay (the sentence was slightly modified, but not in substance, in \u00a7 43 of Pauli\u0107). However, all the cases quoted in support of the principle as thus formulated (including, indirectly, Connors) are cases where the landlord was either the Government or a local authority. None were cases where the landlord was a private individual. In my view while it is perfectly reasonable to require that an eviction or repossession notice issued by the Government or by a local authority \u2013 both of which are normally under a public law obligation to provide accommodation for people within their jurisdiction \u2013 or possibly even by a private entity in receipt of public funds, should be capable of being challenged on the grounds of proportionality, when the landlord is a private individual the tenant\u2019s right should in principle be limited to challenging whether the occupation \u2013 tenancy, lease, encroachment concession, et cetera \u2013 has in fact come to an end according to law. In this latter case the proportionality of the eviction or repossession in light of the relevant principles under Article 8 should not come into the equation. This is not to say, of course, that the Government may not, by legislation, impose restrictions on the use of the property by the landlord upon or after the termination of the occupancy, from which restrictions the last tenant or occupant might even benefit (see, by way of analogy, James and Others v the United Kingdom, no. 8793/79, 21 February 1986; Hutten-Czapska v. Poland, [GC] no. 35014/97, 19 June 2006); but this is a totally different issue from what is being proposed in the second sentence of paragraph\u00a065.",

Goodhart said, \u2018The principle of a case is not to be found in the reasons given in the opinion\u2019; it should, instead, be found by taking account of the facts treated by the judge as material, and his decision based on those facts. It is precisely to prevent what we have said in the second sentence of paragraph\u00a065 from being extrapolated to a different context that I would have preferred that the principle should have been qualified or otherwise restated.",
