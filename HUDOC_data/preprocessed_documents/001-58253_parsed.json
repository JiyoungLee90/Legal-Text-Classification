He further alleged that, owing to the composition of the \u0130zmir National Security Court, he had not had a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1. He considered, moreover, that there had been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 2 and Article 8 on account of the fact that \u0130zmir police headquarters had informed his father of his arrest and the reasons for it. He went on to submit that, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c), he had not had a lawyer while in police custody and that the National Security Court\u2019s refusal to hear certain witnesses had been contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d). Lastly, he alleged a violation of Articles 9, 10 and 11 due to his criminal conviction for having taken part in a demonstration whose purpose had been to protest against the repression of Iraq\u2019s Kurdish population.",
