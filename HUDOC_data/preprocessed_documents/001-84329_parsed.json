Even though she revoked this consent on \n30 July 2001, the Court considers that the period of some thirteen month which elapsed until the failure of psychotherapy on 5 March 2002 cannot be held imputable to the District Court, as it would have been contrary to the child\u2019s best interests prematurely to abort psychotherapy.",

It notes, however, that the District Court, with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings, undertook time-consuming efforts to improve the personal relationship between the applicant and her daughter. Furthermore, the District Court judge encouraged regular personal contacts between the child and her parents in order to avoid alienation. \nThe Court further observes that visiting contacts were instituted under the Youth Office\u2019s supervision as early as April 1999 and appear to have been continued on a more or less regular basis throughout most of the proceedings before the District Court. Having regard to S.\u2019s consistent resistance to contacts with her mother, which she only gave up during the hearing before the Berlin Court of Appeal, the Court considers that the instigation of visiting contacts was essential for eventually deciding the question of access rights in the applicant\u2019s favour.",

Undoubtedly, consideration of what lies in the best interest of the child is of crucial importance in every case of this kind. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned. It follows from these considerations that the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities regarding custody and access issues, but rather to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see Sahin and Sommerfeld v.

However, a stricter scrutiny is called for as regards any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights of access, and as regards any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the rights of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed (see Elsholz v. Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2000-VIII; Kutzner v. Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2002-I; and G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

Thus, where the existence of a family tie has been established, the State must in principle act in a manner calculated to enable that tie to be developed and take measures that will enable parent and child to be reunited (see Margareta and Roger Andersson v. Sweden, judgment of \n25 February 1992, Series A no. 226A, p. 30 \u00a7 91; Olsson v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 27 November 1992, Series A no. 250, pp. 35-36, \u00a7 90; Ignaccolo-Zenide v.

Referring to expert opinion, that court considered that it would cause the child serious psychological damage if she were removed from the foster family against her will. The Court of Appeal further observed that the applicant was not ready to accept the child\u2019s remaining with the foster family, while the father was ready to accept the child\u2019s continued stay with them. The Court of Appeal thus considered that the child\u2019s father was better placed to exercise parental authority. The Court further observes that the Court of Appeal, unlike the District Court, did not transfer parental authority to the Youth Office, but to the child\u2019s father. In view of this, the Court is satisfied that the domestic courts\u2019 decisions can be taken to have been in S.\u2019s best interests which, due to their serious nature, must override the applicant\u2019s interest in maintaining parental authority.",

The Court notes that the applicant, assisted by counsel, was in a position to put forward all her arguments in favour of retaining parental authority both personally and in written form. The evidential basis for the District Court\u2019s decision further included the statements of S., the curator ad litem, the father, the foster parents, and the Youth Office. Furthermore, the District Court based its decision on expert opinion and on the written comments submitted by the psychological expert L. The Court of Appeal based its decision on the content of the case-file and on a fresh hearing of all interested parties. The Court finally observes that the length of the proceedings before the family courts was acceptable under the circumstances of this specific case, as set out above (see \u00a7\u00a7 77-86, above). Accordingly, the Court considers that the decision making process, seen as a whole, provided the applicant with the requisite protection of her interests.",

However, when assessing the length of the proceedings it must not be overlooked that the applicant\u2019s daughter had been placed in a foster family at the initial stage of the divorce proceedings and that this placement was originally planned only as a \nshort-time measure.
