It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case.

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions. To construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to the courts and the conduct of proceedings would indeed be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby v.\u00a0Greece, 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports 1997-II, and Immobiliare Saffi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 1999V).",
