It considers that the applicant might legitimately have felt ill at ease when communicating with State-appointed counsel via a video link. The Government did not explain why it was impossible to provide for different arrangements for the conduct of the appeal hearing. The Court notes that the appeal hearing was held in Moscow. The applicant and counsel R. were also in Moscow. It is obvious that R. would not have encountered any difficulty in being in the same room with the applicant during the appeal hearing.
