They had then locked his wife and two younger children in the room, having blocked the door with a sofa. Once the applicants had managed to get outside, they realised that their eldest son Imran had been taken away. After the abductors had left, the second applicant had run into the street and seen a group of men walking away, but had not at that time seen the APCs and vehicles. His wife, the first applicant, had pursued the men on foot, while he had taken his car and followed two APCs and the UAZ vehicle along  towards the exit to Urus-Martan. He had then decided to go to the head of the local administration in order to ask him to notify the military at the roadblock, but had not managed to find him. The guards at the house had told him that they had no radios and could not contact the roadblock. He had then gone to the house of the local policeman, who told him to wait at the roadblock leading to Goyty, at the eastern side of the village.

Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be taken.\u00a0Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
