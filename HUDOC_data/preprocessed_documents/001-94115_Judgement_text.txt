On 20 January 2004 the court awarded the applicant company compensation. Both parties appealed. On 18 April 2005 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment on procedural grounds.
On 17 November 2005 the  8th  made the procedural corrections and ordered the bank to pay compensation to the applicant company. Both parties appealed. On 13 March 2006 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant company’s appeal for having been lodged outside the statutory time-limit. However, the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment in respect of the bank, both on the procedure and the merits. On 30 June 2006 the applicant company requested rectification of the judgment. On 19 June 2006 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant company’s request.
