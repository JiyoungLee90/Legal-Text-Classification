I do not agree with counsel for the defence that the accused has discharged the burden of proof where both alternatives, on the basis of the available evidence, appear to be equally likely. In this assessment the ordinary standards of evidence shall apply and the requirements in respect of the strength of the evidence must then to some extent be adapted to the possibilities for the accused to show that he did not carry out the act. Given the manner in which the provision has been formulated the situation may easily arise that an acquittal is not sufficient to justify a compensation claim when the accused is unable to discharge this burden of proof. I should like to stress that the refusal of a compensation claim does not entail that the previous acquittal is undermined or that the acquittal is open to doubt. The compensation case must be determined on an independent basis and the rules on evidence applying in such compensation cases do not differ from those which apply to ordinary compensation claims. The legislator has as a starting point opted for a solution whereby the financial burden caused by the institution of criminal proceedings, which are discontinued or which end with an acquittal, must be borne by the accused unless he is able to show that it is probable that he did not commit the act.\u201d",

The test was solely whether, in view of the particular rule of evidence applying in such cases, it was more likely than not that the claimant had committed the act which had grounded the charge. The subject matter touched upon only one of the four conditions for establishing criminal liability, namely the objective breach of a penal provision, and thus could not reasonably be interpreted as a supposition of criminal guilt. In the applicant's case the national courts kept their reasoning strictly within these bounds. This fact was underlined by the Supreme Court's reference to the 1994 precedent, according to which a refusal of a compensation claim did not undermine or question an acquittal, but must be based on a separate assessment using the evidentiary standard applicable to ordinary compensation claims made independently of the criminal matter. At no point in their reasoning did the national courts discuss the applicant's acquittal in the criminal proceedings.",

According to its established case-law, there are three criteria to be taken into account when deciding whether a person was \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d for the purposes of Article 6, namely the classification of the proceedings under national law, their essential nature and the type and severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring (see Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, \u00a7 31, 5 July 2001; A.P., M.P. and T.P. v. Switzerland, judgment of 29\u00a0August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V, \u00a7 39). Moreover, the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 2 is not limited to criminal proceedings that are pending (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no.\u00a0308, p.16, \u00a7 35). In certain instances, the Court has also found the provision applicable to judicial decisions taken after the discontinuation of such proceedings (see in particular the following judgments: Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62, and Lutz, Englert and N\u00f6lkenbockhoff v.

It observes that in its decision of 25 February 1995, the relevant parts of which were quoted by the Appeals Selection Committee of the Supreme Court, the High Court reiterated the conclusions of the medical experts, \u201cimply[ing] a very high degree of probability that the 10 children referred to in the indictment have been exposed to sexual abuse\u201d and summarised at length the different types of evidence pointing to Mr\u00a0Hammern as the perpetrator of the acts described in the indictment (paragraph 23 above). On the basis of the evidence presented both during the criminal trial hearing and the compensation hearing, the High Court reached the conclusion that the applicant had failed to show that it was probable that he had not perpetrated the acts which formed the basis of the charges, and rejected his compensation claim under Article 444 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the view of the Court, the High Court's reasoning clearly amounted to the voicing of suspicion against the applicant with respect to the charges of sexual abuse for which he had been acquitted.",

At the same time, applicants in the latter group invoke the principle of presumption of innocence in an attempt to ensure that the courts trying their cases conclude that, on the balance of probabilities, they were not guilty. The result is that a well-meant provision \u2013 which has proved valuable in a significant number of the cases which it was intended to cover \u2013 turns out to be ill-advised and not compatible with the presumption of innocence. This is so even though Article 444 was never intended to result in the slightest question being raised about an acquittal or a discontinuation of proceedings. The latter can readily be seen from the Norwegian courts' reasoning in the present case, in which the courts made every possible effort to emphasise that their finding in the compensation proceedings \u2013 the refusal of the compensation claim \u2013 did not mean that the earlier acquittal was undermined or laid open to doubt.",
