Bulgaria, nos.\u00a02033/04 et al., \u00a7 107, 25 October 2011). Moreover, the Government have not specified the respondent to such a claim, or cited any decisions of the Bulgarian courts showing its practicability in the present context. As to the delays in the restitution process, the Court refers to its findings in cases against Bulgaria concerning similar complaints (see Vasilev and Doycheva v. Bulgaria, no. 14966/04, \u00a7\u00a7 26-30, 31 May 2012, with further references) that a tort claim could not be considered an effective remedy, as it was of a purely compensatory nature and could not bring about the completion of the restitution process.

Bulgaria ((just satisfaction), no. 18967/03, \u00a7 38, 28 February 2012) it urged the respondent State to introduce a remedy permitting any aggrieved person to effectively obtain compensation in cases of delays in the restitution proceedings.",
