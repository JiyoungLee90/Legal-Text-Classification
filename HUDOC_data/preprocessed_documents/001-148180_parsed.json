The Court cannot accept this view. As early as in 1968 it rejected a similar objection by the Austrian Government, noting that the applicant complained not of an isolated act but rather of a situation in which he had been for some time and which was to last until it ends. It would be excessively formalistic to demand that an applicant denouncing such a situation should file a new application after each final decision rejecting a request for release or, as the case may be, after each further order extending his detention (see Neumeister v. Austria, 27 June 1968, \u00a7 7, Series A no. 8). In the subsequent St\u00f6gm\u00fcller v.

Where the applicants had been remanded in custody at the moment of communication but were subsequently released, the Court held itself competent to examine the period of pre-trial detention until the date of release (see, among others, Mikhail Grishin v. Russia, no. 14807/08, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and\u00a0137, 24 July 2012; Chumakov v. Russia, no. 41794/04, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 154, 24\u00a0April 2012; Pe\u0161a v.

Similarly, in cases in which the applicants were detained at the moment of communication but were convicted prior to delivery of the Court\u2019s judgment, the period taken into consideration spanned until the date of conviction (see, among others, Arutyunyan v. Russia, no. 48977/09, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and\u00a0102, 10 January 2012; Rafig Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 45875/06, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 89, 6 December 2011; Tsarenko v.

Finally, where the applicants were in custody both on the date of communication and on the date of delivery of the judgment, the Court examined the State\u2019s compliance with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of the detention period up until the judgment date (see Mkhitaryan v. Russia, no. 46108/11, \u00a7\u00a089, 5 February 2013; \u015eahap Do\u011fan v. Turkey, no. 29361/07, \u00a7 26, 27 May 2010; Polonskiy v.
