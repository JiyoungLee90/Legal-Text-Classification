The ill-treatment alleged was frequently of such a severity that it could be considered to amount to torture; the methods involved included extensive beating, asphyxiation using a plastic bag or gas mask, electric shocks, suspension by the limbs, hyperextension and, more rarely, the infliction of burns by cigarettes, lighters or other devices.

Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a0210, ECHR\u00a02005IV, and Popov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a026853/04, \u00a7 264, 13\u00a0July 2006).
