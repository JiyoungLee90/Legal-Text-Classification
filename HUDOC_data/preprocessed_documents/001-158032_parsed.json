Three were awaiting results of forensic tests and seven scenes were still being searched. A total of 3,887 exhibits had been recovered to date. Priority was being given to exhibits such as documents, computers, mobile phones, sim cards and data storage devices; a large number of computers were being searched as well as DVDs and CDs; 127 phone or sim cards had been recovered and were being forensically examined, some with large memories.

They further argued that the searches of their homes were unlawful because the search warrants had been granted in terms that were too wide, because the terms of the warrants had been breached in that, although the police had permission to undertake a search on one occasion, they had actually occupied the premises for many days, and because of the seizures themselves.",

City of Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court [2011] EWCA Civ 1188, a newspaper had unsuccessfully requested access to documents referred to by the Magistrates\u2019 Court in extradition proceedings. The Divisional Court upheld the ruling of the District Judge. The question arose in the Court of Appeal whether the proceedings were a \u201ccriminal cause or matter\u201d. The newspaper accepted that the extradition proceedings themselves were a \u201ccriminal cause or matter\u201d but submitted that the order refusing journalistic access to the underlying material was not. Lord Neuberger, delivering the judgment of the court, undertook a review of the authorities in the area and considered that the newspaper\u2019s application had been wholly collateral to the extradition proceedings and made by someone not a party to those proceedings. The order of the District Judge did not invoke the Magistrates\u2019 Court\u2019s criminal jurisdiction and had no bearing upon the criminal (i.e.\u00a0extradition) proceedings themselves. Lord Neuberger expressed the opinion that \u201cany sort of final coherence in relation to the scope and effect of section 18(1)(a) can only be provided by the Supreme Court\u201d and concluded that the best way of applying the \u201crather tangled\u201d jurisprudence developed over the past thirty-five years, and ensuring maximum coherence, was to hold that the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to hear the appeal in the case.",

The appellants were instead obliged to make their application to the Divisional Court for certification of a point of law of general importance and pursue their appeal to the Supreme Court.

The Government pointed out that the Divisional Court had held that the complaints should have been brought by way of a private-law action because they raised fact-sensitive issues inappropriate for judicial review proceedings. In light of the Divisional Court judgment, the applicants could undoubtedly have brought a civil damages claim in respect of their arrest and initial detention. The Government emphasised that the applicants did not argue that their detention was lawful under domestic law irrespective of compliance with Article 5 of the Convention, such that the only appropriate remedy would be a declaration of incompatibility under the Human Rights Act (see paragraph 121 above). In so far as the applicants contended that they were unable to pursue a private-law claim from Pakistan and would not have been able to obtain legal funding, the Government pointed out that the applicants had pursued the judicial review claim and the case before this Court without difficulty. It was also relevant, the Government argued, that the applicants were not excluded in principle from obtaining legal aid and, in any case, refusal to grant legal aid would not have rendered the bringing of a private-law claim impractical.",

The applicants referred to the case of Rawlinson (see paragraph 108 above) in support of their argument that judicial review, and not private-law proceedings, was the appropriate route to challenge arrest and detention decisions. However, it does not appear that the Divisional Court\u2019s judgment in that case provides support for the general rule contended for by the applicants and the applicants did not point to any specific passage of that judgment which they contended could carry such an interpretation. Moreover, while in their initial application they claimed that it would have been impossible to obtain legal aid for private-law proceedings, as the Government pointed out (see paragraph 126 above), they were not excluded in principle from the possibility of applying for legal aid. In these circumstances; and in the absence of any cited authority or examples of a restrictive approach to the award of legal aid in cases such as the applicants\u2019, the argument that legal aid would not have been available is wholly speculative.",

The judgments themselves recognise the ambiguity surrounding the meaning of \u201ccriminal cause or matter\u201d, with Lord Neuberger expressing the view that only the Supreme Court would be in a position to resolve the question (see paragraph 118 above). Subsequently, in Panesar, the Court of Appeal recognised the uncertainty and incoherence to which the existing, at times inconsistent, authorities had given rise (see paragraph 119 above). While the court in that case concluded that a \u201ccriminal cause of matter\u201d was at stake, its conclusion followed a careful examination of section 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, the legislative provision in respect of which the proceedings had been brought. That provision is not implicated in the present case. Given the finding of the Divisional Court as to the private-law nature of the applicants\u2019 claim, it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that the Court of Appeal would have found that the case concerned a \u201ccriminal cause or matter\u201d and that that court accordingly had no jurisdiction in the case.",

Because of the attendant risk of loss of life and human suffering, the police are obliged to act with the utmost urgency in following up all information, including information from secret sources. Further, the police may frequently have to arrest a suspected terrorist on the basis of information which is reliable but which cannot, without putting in jeopardy the source of the information, be revealed to the suspect or produced in court. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention should not be applied in such a manner as to put disproportionate difficulties in the way of the police authorities in taking effective measures to counter organised terrorism in discharge of their duty under the Convention to protect the right to life and the right to bodily security of members of the public. Contracting States cannot be asked to establish the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest of a suspected terrorist by disclosing the confidential sources of supporting information or even facts which would be susceptible of indicating such sources or their identity (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, Series A no. 182). It follows that Article 5 \u00a7 4 cannot require disclosure of such material or preclude the holding of a closed hearing to allow a court to consider confidential material. Pursuant to Article 5 \u00a7 4, the authorities must disclose adequate information to enable the applicant to know the nature of the allegations against him and have the opportunity to lead evidence to refute them. They must also ensure that the applicant or his legal advisers are able to participate effectively in court proceedings concerning continued detention.",

The present case, like that in A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, concerned allegations of a planned large-scale terrorist attack which, if carried out, was likely to result in significant loss of life and serious injury. The applicants did not argue that the context of their arrests was inadequate to justify the holding of a closed hearing and restrictions on their right to disclosure. The Court is satisfied that the threat of an imminent terrorist attack, identified in the course of Operation Pathway, provided ample justification for the imposition of some restrictions on the adversarial nature of the proceedings concerning the warrants for further detention, for reasons of national security.",

Fourthly, the width of the description of relevant material was justified by the fact that the police had genuine and reasonable concerns about an imminent terrorist attack and elaborate reasoning as to precisely what items might prove to be relevant was not consistent with the urgency of the situation. The width was also justified by the nature of the investigation, which concerned a sophisticated terrorist plot in which different media (in particular electronic media) were reasonably suspected of being used by the plotters to communicate.

While limiting the search and seizure of files to specific addresses, it authorised in a general and unlimited manner the search and seizure of correspondence, books, electronic equipment, financial documents and numerous other items. However, the specificity of the list of items susceptible to seizure in a search conducted by law-enforcement officers will vary from case to case depending on the nature of the allegations in question. Cases such as the present one, which involve allegations of a planned large-scale terrorist attack, pose particular challenges, since, while there may be sufficient evidence to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that an attack is under preparation, an absence of specific information about the intended nature of the attack or its targets make precise identification of items sought during a search impossible. Further, the complexity of such cases may justify a search based on terms that are wider than would otherwise be permissible. Multiple suspects and use of coded language, as in the present case, compound the difficulty faced by the police in seeking to identify in advance of the search the specific nature of the items and documents sought. Finally, the urgency of the situation cannot be ignored. To impose under Article 8 the requirement that a search warrant identify in detail the precise nature of the items sought and to be seized could seriously jeopardise the effectiveness of an investigation where numerous lives might be at stake. In cases of this nature, the police must be permitted some flexibility to assess, on the basis of what is encountered during the search, which items might be linked to terrorist activities and to seize them for further examination. While searches of electronic devices raise particularly sensitive issues, and arguably require specific safeguards to protect against excessive interference with personal data, such searches were not the subject of the applicants\u2019 complaints or the domestic proceedings in this case and, in consequence, no evidence has been led by the parties as to the presence or otherwise of such safeguards in English law.",

As explained in paragraph 41 of the present judgment \u201c[p]art of the hearing was closed to allow the District Judge to scrutinise and ask questions about the material ...\u201d. I share the view that it is of crucial importance that the judge dealing with the possible extension of detention should acquire knowledge of available evidence against the applicant, but I find it unjustified to exclude the applicant and his representative from the part of the hearing when this discussion took place, thus removing the possibility that the applicant might dispute the relevance of evidence which was decisive for that extension of detention. The decision in the present case to exclude the applicants and their representatives from even one part of the hearing implies that the police did not provide the applicants with adequate information about the reasons for their continued detention.",

It is clear that they could have used a private-law remedy but I consider that in a situation where there are different effective remedies available to the applicant, he is obliged to exhaust not all of them but the one he finds to be more appropriate than another for the situation at hand. I cannot accept the reasoning given by the judge in these proceedings to the effect that there was another \u2013 private law \u2013 remedy available, that these claims involved potentially complex disputes of fact or that there was no reason for these proceedings to take up the judicial resources of the Administrative Court, which were required for the numerous urgent and prospective judicial review proceedings issued in the High Court every week. At that time, the applicants were being held pursuant to deportation orders. In order to use the private-law action, as suggested by the judge, \u201c[t]he claimants would not have [had] to return to the UK to give evidence ..., which could instead [have been] provided by way of video-link\u201d!
