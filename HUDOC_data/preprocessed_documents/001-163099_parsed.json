It reiterates that, in assessing evidence, it has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is to rule not on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention  conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In proceedings before the Court there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. In accordance with its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 88, 23 February 2012, and the cases cited therein).",

The Court reiterates its case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention to the effect that \u2013 where the events at issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody \u2013 strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries, damage and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.

It appears that the authorities did not give any weight to the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s seizures and the accompanying risks, ranging from trauma to the detrimental effect of repeated seizures on the brain and even sudden, disease-related death.

The situation was further aggravated by the authorities\u2019 persistent refusals to authorise an in-depth medical examination of the applicant to assess the state of his illness and to formulate the appropriate anti-epilepsy therapy (see paragraphs 39-41 above).",

Where such grounds are found to have been \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings. \u00a0The presumption is in favour of release. As the Court has consistently held, the second limb of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention does not give judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until his conviction, the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continued detention ceases to be reasonable. A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify his or her continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.

The Court notes that, while accepting the investigators\u2019 allegations that the applicant was likely to avoid or pervert the course of justice, the courts gave no heed to important and relevant facts that supported the applicant\u2019s pleas for liberty and reduced the risks of absconding or collusion. Those the Court can identify include the applicant\u2019s fragile health, his strong community ties, and the lack of any evidence that he had ever attempted to contact the victims or witnesses in the course of the criminal proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to analyse the applicant\u2019s personal situation and to give detailed and specific reasons, supported by evidentiary findings, for holding him in custody.",
