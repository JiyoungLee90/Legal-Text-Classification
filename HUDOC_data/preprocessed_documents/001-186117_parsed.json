While the term \u201caggravated murder\u201d did not have to be understood in a merely legal sense but could also be understood as a moral judgment, the overall presentation of the website at the very least did not exclude a reading that Dr Q. had perpetrated the criminal offence of aggravated murder. Even though the applicant had pointed out that abortions were exempt from punishment, he had not referred to section 218a of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 14 below), which exempted abortions as performed by Dr Q., from criminal liability. In addition, the applicant had emphasised the term \u201caggravated murder\u201d in the relevant parts of the website and had compared abortions with the Holocaust. In sum, the statements of the website could be understood as a personalised accusation against Dr Q. of perpetrating aggravated murder.",

The Court of Appeal reasoned that the applicant had not made it sufficiently clear that doctors providing abortions in accordance with Article 218a of the Criminal Code had been exempted from criminal liability. Therefore, the present case has to be distinguished from the case of Annen (cited above), which concerned a leaflet of the applicant in which he had called abortions unlawful but had clearly provided an additional explanation that they had not been subject to criminal liability. In the present case, however, the applicant did not provide such additional information, but merely stated that abortions constituted aggravated murder and mentioned only once that they were \u201cunpunished\u201d (see paragraph 6 above). This singular reference in the context of counseling centres could easily go unnoticed and did not have to be understood as elaboration of the legal situation in Germany, according to which doctors providing abortions in accordance with Article 218a of the Criminal Code were exempted from criminal liability.",

The Court therefore concludes that there was no factual foundation whatsoever for the allegation that Dr Q. committed the criminal offence of aggravated murder. The Court would further add that even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must be a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2001II). Consequently, the Court finds that, even assuming that the applicant\u2019s statements were to be considered value judgments, there was not a sufficient factual basis for calling abortions as performed by Dr Q. \u201caggravated murder\u201d. In that context the Court also notes that the accusations were not only very serious, something reflected in the fact that a conviction for aggravated murder would carry a life sentence, but might also incite to hatred and aggression.",
