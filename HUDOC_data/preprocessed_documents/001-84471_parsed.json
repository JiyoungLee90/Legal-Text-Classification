Not only were there several periods of inactivity before the national courts or lack of diligence on their part (see paragraphs 7, 8, 10, 15 to 17 above), but the total duration of the proceedings in question, 16 years and three months, was also particularly long. The Court is mindful of the fact that the present case was adjourned pending the outcome of another case brought against different parties (see paragraphs 11 to 13 above). However, the duration of the latter proceedings became the subject of a previous application under the Convention in which the Court found that they had exceeded a reasonable time in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see in A. and E. Riis v.  (No. 1), cited above, \u00a7 55). While the Court accepts that the first applicant has contributed to the length of the proceedings (see notably paragraphs 11 to 14 above), this could not absolve the authorities of the respondent State from their obligation under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to ensure that the proceedings be concluded within a reasonable time (see Dattel and Others v. , no.\u00a013130/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053-54, 4 August 2005; and A. and E. Riis v.  (No. 1), cited above, \u00a7 55).
