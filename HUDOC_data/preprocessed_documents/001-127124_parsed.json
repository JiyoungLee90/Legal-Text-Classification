[GC], no. 54522/00, \u00a7 90, 3 April 2012). When the authorities are obliged to act in order to enforce a final court decision and they fail to do so, their inactivity may, in certain circumstances, engage the State\u2019s responsibility on the ground of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Scollo v. Italy, judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 315-C, \u00a7 44, and Fuklev v. Ukraine, no. 71186/01, \u00a7 84, 7 June 2005). The Court\u2019s task in such cases is to examine whether measures applied by the authorities were adequate and sufficient and whether they acted diligently in order to assist a creditor in execution of a judgment (see Anokhin v. Russia (dec.), no. 25867/02, Fociac v. Romania, no. 2577/02, \u00a7 70, 3 February 2005).",

Ka\u010dapor and Others v. Serbia, cited above, \u00a7 114). In other words, in such cases the State is directly liable for the debts of State-controlled companies irrespective of the fact whether the company at issue at one point operated as a private entity (see An\u0111eli\u0107 and Others v. Serbia [Committee], no. 57611/10 and\u00a0166\u00a0other applications, \u00a7\u00a032, 28\u00a0May 2013). Furthermore, \u201cthe fact that the State sold a large part of its share in the company it owned to a private person could not release the State from its obligation to honour a judgment debt which had arisen before the shares were sold.
