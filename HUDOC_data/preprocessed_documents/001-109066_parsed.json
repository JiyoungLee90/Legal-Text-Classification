The seriousness of the situation confronting the establishment led the Committee to state in the report on its visit in March 2006 that, unless the above-mentioned problems were resolved, prisoners should be relocated elsewhere. In their response to that report, the Moldovan authorities indicated that they considered the situation at Penitentiary establishment No. 8 in Bender to be under control and saw no reasons for the relocation of prisoners to other establishments.",

The delegation was informed that some 35 inmates had been released since March 2006, and approximately the same number of new prisoners had been admitted. The great majority of the prisoners currently held at the establishment originated from the Transdniestrian region or nearby locations. The delegation gained the impression that all prisoners who had been admitted in the last year had themselves asked for a transfer to Bender, in particular because of wishing to be closer to their families. An examination of the documentation confirmed that newly admitted prisoners had been expressly informed of the conditions prevailing at the establishment (i.e. absence of running water, electricity and sewage disposal) and had confirmed with their signature their wish to be transferred there.

In cases where there is a continuing situation, the six-month period runs from the cessation of the situation (see B.\u00a0and D. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9303/81, Commission decision of 13\u00a0October 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 49, p. 44). The concept of a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State so as to render the applicant a victim (see Montion v. France, no. 11192/84, Commission decision of 14 May 1987, DR 52, p. 227; and Hilton v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a012015/86, Commission decision of 6 July 1988, DR 57, p. 108). Normally, the six-month period runs from the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of (see D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 38719/97, 26 June 2001).",

It is true that the applicant was detained within the framework of the same criminal proceedings throughout his entire detention. Nonetheless, in view of the significant gap between the two periods of detention with which the complaints are concerned, the Court cannot treat them as a part of a continuing situation as described above, even if the other conditions are met (see Haritonov v. Moldova, no.\u00a015868/07, \u00a7 26, 5 July 2011). In such circumstances, the Court considers that only the complaint concerning the last period of detention, in Prison no.\u00a013, was lodged within six months. Consequently, the complaint in respect of the other periods of detention in Prison no. 13 must be declared inadmissible under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

The inmates who requested transfers to other establishments on account of that disruption received satisfaction (see paragraph 7 above). The applicant did not adduce any evidence to show that he or his lawyer had made any requests to be transferred to other establishments. Therefore, the Court is not persuaded that he was genuinely dissatisfied with his conditions of detention at the material time, that is, with the problems in the supply of electricity and water. Accordingly, the Court concludes that this part of the complaint under Article\u00a03 of the Convention is manifestly ill-founded and therefore inadmissible within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

Since the present case refers to the same detention facility and since no evidence has been adduced by the Government that the situation had changed between September 2006 and March 2007, the Court considers that there are no reasons to depart from the conclusions reached in \u0162urcan.
