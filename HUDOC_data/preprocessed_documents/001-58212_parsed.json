For the Court, it continues to be the case that transsexualism raises complex scientific, legal, moral and social issues, in respect of which there is no generally shared approach among the Contracting States (see the X, Y and Z v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22\u00a0April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p.\u00a0635, \u00a7 52).",

France judgment). It cannot be denied that the incidents alluded to by Miss\u00a0Sheffield were a source of embarrassment and distress to her and that Miss\u00a0Horsham, if she were to return to the United Kingdom, would equally run the risk of having on occasion to identify herself in her pre-operative gender. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that an individual may with justification be required on occasion to provide proof of gender as well as medical history. This is certainly the case of life assurance contracts \nwhich are uberrimae fidei. It may possibly be true of motor insurance where the insurer may need to have regard to the sex of the driver in order to make an actuarial assessment of the risk. Furthermore, it would appear appropriate for a court to run a check on whether a person has a criminal record, either under his or her present name or former name, before accepting that person as a surety for a defendant in criminal proceedings. However, quite apart from these considerations the situations in which the applicants may be required to disclose their pre-operative gender do not occur with a degree of frequency which could be said to impinge to a disproportionate extent on their right to respect for their private lives. The Court observes also that the respondent State has endeavoured to some extent to minimise intrusive enquiries as to their gender status by allowing transsexuals to be issued with driving licences, passports and other types of official documents in their new name and gender, and that the use of birth certificates as a means of identification is officially discouraged (see paragraphs 26 and 31 above).",

In both those cases, the second of which was decided as long ago as 1990, the Court had expressed its awareness of the seriousness of the problems facing transsexuals and the distress which they suffer. It had also made clear in both these cases the importance which it attached to the need for appropriate legal measures in this area to be kept under review. In the years since the Cossey decision that need has certainly not diminished.

As regards the range of practical problems for the applicants which the present cases disclosed, while concerned not to underestimate in any way their potential for causing embarrassment or hardship, I found them to be less injurious in likely frequency of occurrence and seriousness than those experienced by the applicant in the case of B. v.

If the State can make exceptions in the case of driving licences, passports and adoptive children (see paragraphs 16 and 44 of the judgment) solutions can be found which respect the dignity and sense of privacy of post-operative transsexuals.

It is of relevance in this context that the applicants are not claiming that their former identity should, for all purposes, be completely effaced.

The Government do not, however, address the obvious question concerning how other member States of the Council of Europe have dealt with that problem without, apparently, creating unacceptable legal uncertainty. It is my firm belief that British society, or the English legal system, cannot have such specific features in this respect that these require and justify an interference of such a scope in the private lives of post-operative transsexuals while other European democratic societies apparently feel no need for such an interference. To the extent that there are certain specific features of any relevance, these may be taken into consideration when adopting the required measures, since no uniform model has to be followed in that respect (see \nalso Judges Bindschedler-Robert and Russo in their joint partly dissenting opinion in the Cossey case and Judge Martens in his dissenting opinion in that case, Series A no. 184, pp. 20 and 29\u201330 respectively). In that respect, therefore, a margin of appreciation is indeed left to the domestic authorities, and the fact that there may be no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe on how to accommodate the specific needs of post-operative transsexuals concerning the registration of their sex does not stand in the way of finding a positive obligation under Article 8.",

Since, in my opinion, Article 8 requires legal recognition of gender reassignment following a surgical operation, this implies that the applicants have to be considered as persons of the new sex for legal purposes, including for the application of Article 12. Therefore, even if one starts from the presumption that Article 12 has to be considered to refer to marriages between persons of the opposite sex \u2013 a presumption which still seems to be justified in view of the clear wording of the provision, although it has the unsatisfactory consequence that it denies to, or at least makes illusive for, homosexuals a right laid down in the Convention \u2013 the applicants should be treated as women under Article 12, and should be allowed to marry men. Only in that way is their choice of a new sexual identity socially respected and legally recognised. The fact that, biologically, the medical treatment may not have changed their sex to that of women is, in my opinion, not relevant as that fact does not stand in the way of a marriage and the applicants are in any case not (or no longer) in any better disposition \u2013 psychologically or physically \u2013 to marry women. I cannot see any reason why legal recognition of reassignment of sex requires that biologically there has also been a (complete) reassignment; the law can give an autonomous meaning to the concept of \u201csex\u201d, as it does to concepts like \u201cperson\u201d, \u201cfamily\u201d, \u201chome\u201d, \u201cproperty\u201d, etc.",

At first sight, that fact would seem to justify a rather broad margin of appreciation on the part of the individual States. However, denying post-operative transsexuals in absolute terms the right to marry a person of their previous sex while marrying a person of their newly acquired sex is no longer an acceptable option would amount to excluding them from any marriage. Since no restriction of a right or freedom laid down in the Convention may affect that right or freedom in its essence (see Article 17 of the Convention), it must be concluded that such an absolute denial falls outside the margin of appreciation. That margin only allows for a certain discretion as to the modalities and requirements of the marriage of transsexuals to avoid or remedy certain legal and practical problems which such a marriage may pose. Here, again, it is not for the Court to go into different options and modalities in the abstract. I am, therefore, of the opinion that Article 12 has also been violated in the two cases.",

It does not explain why section 11(b) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (see paragraph 27 of the judgment) would not affect the applicant. Even if that were the situation under private international law, the main reason or one of the reasons why the applicant lives and intends to marry her male partner in the Netherlands would seem to lie precisely in the legal situation prevailing in the United Kingdom. Therefore, even if it cannot be said with certainty what the outcome would be were the validity of her marriage, contracted under Netherlands law, to be tested in the English courts, it cannot be denied that the applicant has suffered from the mere fact that English law does not allow her to marry her partner or any man.",
