In particular, they submitted that it was open to the applicant to challenge before the domestic courts the bailiffs\u2019 actions (or inaction) in enforcing the judgment of 24\u00a0January 2014, as well as A.D.\u2019s failure to comply with the above-mentioned judgment. The Government relied in this regard on the 1993 Law on Judicial Review of Measures and Decisions Infringing Individual Rights and Freedoms, and also on Chapter\u00a025 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation (\u201cChallenging decisions, actions or the inaction of State and municipal bodies and officials\u201d), which was replaced, from 15 September 2015, by the Code of Administrative Procedure of the Russian Federation. They furthermore referred to Article\u00a066\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Family Code of the Russian Federation, which provided that in the event of non-compliance with a court decision, the parent guilty of non-compliance was to be subjected to measures stipulated by the legislation on administrative offences and enforcement procedure, and that in the event of persistent non-compliance with a court decision, the court could, upon a claim being lodged by the parent residing apart from the child, take a decision to place the child in his or her care, having taken into account the child\u2019s interests and the child\u2019s opinion. However, the applicant had not availed himself of the above remedies and had thus not afforded the domestic authorities an opportunity to address the alleged violations of his rights.",

A.D. had sent the applicant a list of things which had been necessary for the child\u2019s birth. In that correspondence the applicant and A.D. had also discussed the child\u2019s baptism.

The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. While national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, since the interests (as well as the rights and freedoms) of all concerned must be taken into account, as must the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Where contact with the parent might appear to threaten those interests or interfere with those rights, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them. What is decisive is whether the national authorities have taken all necessary steps to facilitate access as can reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of each case (see Nuutinen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0128). In this context, the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between a child and a parent who do not cohabit (see Zolt\u00e1n N\u00e9meth, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045).",

Despite the fact that the general environment of the meeting was rather tense, no assistance was provided to the applicant for his subsequent visits on 12\u00a0February and 4\u00a0March 2017, which could not take place because of A.D.\u2019s resistance on the first occasion and her not being at home with the child at the scheduled time on the second occasion. Although it can be seen from the case file that in March and April 2016 the bailiff decided to involve a psychologist in the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 37 above), there is no evidence that any psychological counselling actually took place in order to prepare the child and the applicant for meeting each other; such counselling would appear to have been crucial for the renewal of the contact between the father and the daughter that was interrupted in January 2011. The enforcement proceedings are still pending, perpetuating a situation wherein the applicant is unable to have contact with his child.",
