The decision was based on a new expert report which established that E. and his family had been taking good care of the child. Partly on account of the lack of contact with the applicant, the child had not developed an emotional bond with her. Furthermore, at several meetings (see paragraph 18 above) it had been observed that the applicant was failing to show any affection towards the child, and further meetings had been discontinued at her request. A language barrier had also developed between the applicant and her child, in that the former spoke Macedonian and Turkish, but the latter only Albanian. Lastly, the Centre stated that, considering the child\u2019s age, a sudden change of environment could have negative consequences. For all of those reasons it was decided that it would be in the best interests of the child to remain with her father.
