Italy judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 337-A, p. 10, \u00a7 28). Secondly, it notes that the applicant groundlessly challenged the reporting judge on three occasions, once even after judgment had been given at first instance (see paragraph 23 above). Her failures to attend the hearings, only some of which were justified by her state of health, and her refusal to attend for the third psychiatric examination contributed decisively to slowing down the proceedings. Had she undergone the third psychiatric examination, the case could have been concluded within a short space of time. Furthermore, the applicant and her counsel seem to have coordinated their actions poorly. Although the lawyer had accepted the court\u2019s appointment of a fresh psychiatrist as an expert (see paragraph 10 above), Mrs Proszak did not attend on the day appointed for the examination (see paragraph 11 above). That was scarcely consistent with the diligence which must be shown by the plaintiff in civil proceedings. Nor can the authorities dealing with the case be blamed for the lapse of more than one month between the lodging of the appeal on points of law and its dismissal for want of any legal basis (see paragraph 25 above).",

It is also clear both that some delay was unavoidable because of the difficulties, beyond the control of the District Court, in finding a suitable expert and that failings of cooperation on the part of Mrs Proszak were a further source of delay. But, even if, as the Government pointed out and as the Court accepts in paragraph 33 of the judgment, the way a case proceeds under Polish civil procedure depends largely upon the parties, this does not dispense the courts from ensuring compliance with Article 6 as to the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",

And although, as we have indicated, we accept that Mrs Proszak proved to be a difficult person for the District Court to deal with (perhaps not altogether surprisingly, in the light of her personal history as a concentration camp victim) and made some contribution to the delay, we do not consider that this should have prevented it from so proceeding.",
