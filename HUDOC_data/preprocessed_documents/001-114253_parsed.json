All of those were erected on uneven terrain sloping steeply from the north-west to the south-east. The officers stopped their car in front of the gate, close to which they saw a big pile of used car tyres. They noticed that the gate was closed and started to whistle and shout. Several dogs in the yard started barking and Mr\u00a0Todorov\u2019s mother came out of one of the service buildings. One of the officers presented himself and told her that they were looking for her son. Then she opened the gate and held the dogs back. The officers moved towards the house, the one with the bulletproof vest walking in front, and went through another gate between several service buildings. At that point they spotted Mr Todorov on the steps outside the house, carrying an unidentified weapon. He also saw them, waved to them to go away and fired a shot, apparently in their direction. Two of the officers hid behind the service buildings and one behind some building materials scattered around the yard. He then ran back to the car and radioed the headquarters in Harmanli about the incident. At about 7.30 or 7.45 the head of the three officers ordered them to remain where they were and not to take further action.",

However, as the windows and the doors were covered with linoleum, cardboard and blankets, most of the smoke bombs failed to penetrate. Mr Todorov started firing at the first group, and this forced them to take cover in a ditch.

The explosive device which had killed him had been very close to his body at the moment of detonation, with the result that the body had suffered the impact of all components of the explosion: the detonation, the gases, parts of the explosive, soot, parts of the device\u2019s casing and fragments of it. Mr Todorov\u2019s body had been destroyed and had sustained deep burns, to the point of charring, and multiple wounds from the device\u2019s casing and filling. The metal fragments found inside the body showed that the device was a hand grenade, of the type used in the Bulgarian army, consisting of a metal casing and, underneath it, plastic shells containing 200\u00a0to 400 pellets. All of those had impacted on Mr Todorov\u2019s body. The mechanism of the grenade and the force needed to pull its lever were such as to prevent accidental detonation, including detonation resulting from the closeby detonation of another device, which meant that Mr Todorov had been fully conscious of his actions when activating the grenade. He had thus blown himself up, as could be seen from the safetypin loop found on the third finger of his right hand. However, it was probable that the charring of his body was due to a secondary fire in the room, and had occurred after his death.",

They argued that not enough evidence had been gathered on the time and the causes of Mr Todorov\u2019s death, and that only experts in pathology would be able to give an informed opinion on those points. It was also hard to believe that Mr Todorov had blown himself up with a hand grenade. He was a righthander and the grenade safetyloop was found on a finger of his right hand, whereas it was highly unusual for someone to draw the safetyloop of a hand grenade with his strong hand and hold the grenade itself with his weak hand. The investigation had not done enough to elucidate that paradox, which was central to its conclusions. It was also incomprehensible how the experts, none of whom was a psychologist, were able to give an opinion about Mr Todorov\u2019s state of mind before his death. No explanation was provided about the type of explosives used at 9 p.m. on 10 December 2003 to blow up the hole in the wall of the house. This seriously weakened the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that the metal pellets found in Mr Todorov\u2019s body were from a hand grenade. After 5 p.m. on 10\u00a0December 2003 the police were not acting in selfdefence because Mr\u00a0Todorov had not fired any shots at them after that time. They clearly overstepped the limits set by Article 12a of the Criminal Code and did not try to contact him or arrest him without using force after that time. The conclusion that a grenade launcher was needed to diffuse possible booby traps could not withstand scrutiny. No such traps were found, and it was absurd to believe that trained police officers could suppose that such traps had been laid around a house whose yard was used by Mr Todorov, his family and domestic animals. The police apparently only resorted to using a grenade launcher to speed up the operation. It was also telling that the names of the officers who ordered the use of a launcher were not mentioned in the prosecutor\u2019s decision. Lastly, the applicants pointed out that this Court\u2019s caselaw under Article 2 of the Convention required that there should be an effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force by the police.",

If the [applicants\u2019 lawyers] had bothered to acquaint themselves with [the] evidence ..., they would not have reached those conclusions. The prosecutor\u2019s findings about the causes and the time of [Mr] Todorov\u2019s death were based not only on the conclusions of the medical expert\u2019s report and the complex ballistics and medical experts\u2019 report, but also on the statements of all eyewitnesses. The lawyers should be aware that a fact, namely the time and the causes of death, can be established through all types of evidence allowed under the rules of criminal procedure, not solely expert reports. Since the experts\u2019 conclusion, whose accuracy the court does not doubt, is supported by an abundance of other evidence, including eyewitness statements, the court finds this fact to be unequivocally established ... For that reason, the court finds that the time and the cause of [Mr] Todorov\u2019s death have been unequivocally established, and that this has been accurately described in the prosecutor\u2019s decision. The court therefore finds the [applicants\u2019] arguments in that connection unfounded and not corresponding to the evidence in the case.

The court reiterates that if the [applicants\u2019 lawyers] had read the complex medical and ballistics report, they would have understood this alleged lack of clarity ...",

However, it cannot be overlooked that in previous cases where a criminal investigation into the use of firearms by the police had been discontinued by the prosecuting authorities, the Bulgarian civil courts were reluctant to uphold subsequent claims for damages in that respect. In one such case, Tzekov v. Bulgaria (no. 45500/99, \u00a7\u00a7 2327, 23 February 2006), those courts dismissed a claim concerning the use of firearms against an unarmed individual who \u2013 not being suspected of a violent offence or of being dangerous \u2013 had failed to stop his horse cart when ordered to do so. In a more recent case, Vasil Sashov Petrov v.\u00a0Bulgaria (no. 63106/00, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 6061, 10 June 2010), the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed a similar claim, holding that the actions of the police had been proportionate and lawful, even though the individual against whom they had used firearms had not been suspected of committing a violent offence or of being dangerous. This Court criticised that approach, saying that it had fallen short of the standards stemming from its caselaw, which require a careful review of whether lifethreatening force used during police operations is more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d, that is, strictly proportionate in the circumstances. The Government did not cite any domestic court decisions in which such review has been undertaken. In these circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that a claim for damages by the applicants would have stood a reasonable chance of succeeding, especially bearing in mind that Mr Todorov was resisting arrest, was armed, and was shooting at the police (see, mutatis mutandis, Andronicou and\u00a0Constantinou v. Cyprus, 9 October 1997, \u00a7 161, Reports 1997VI). It is incumbent on a Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy that they rely on is effective and available in theory and in practice (see, among many other authorities, Zl\u00ednsat, spol. s r.o. v. Bulgaria, no. 57785/00, \u00a7 56, 15 June 2006).",

However, Mr Todorov had fired at the police, putting their lives at serious risk. The rocket propelled grenades had been fired at the lower storey of the house to avoid hitting Mr Todorov; the aim had been solely to make an opening in the wall of the house for the assault party, not to harm Mr Todorov. Given that he had been armed and dangerous, the police could not allow him to escape and possibly harm others. It had therefore been imperative to attack the house. The next morning the police had entered the house without using firearms. The entire operation, and in particular the participation of the special antiterrorist squad, had been fully in line with the relevant rules on the use of force, and had been based on the written orders of the Minister of Internal Affairs.",

No attempts had been made to enter the house after 5 p.m. on 10 December 2003, and Mr Todorov\u2019s relatives had not been allowed to bring him a mobile phone or another communication device allowing him to be in contact with the police.

It does not consider it appropriate to make specific findings concerning the legal framework governing the planning and control of the actions of, in particular, the special antiterrorism squad (see paragraphs 5051 above). The parties did not address that question in their observations, and it is unclear whether the chain of events which led to Mr Todorov\u2019s death was the result of specific shortcomings in that framework (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 5971). Unlike previous cases against Bulgaria in which the Court found that the rules governing the use of force for the arrest of unarmed and nondangerous individuals were deficient in that they allowed the police to use firearms against them (see Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a7 99102, ECHR\u00a02005VII; Tzekov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 5356; Vasil Sashov Petrov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 63106/00, \u00a7\u00a7 4347, 10 June 2010; and Karandja v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 69180/01, \u00a7\u00a7 5660, 7 October 2010), the present case concerns an armed and dangerous individual who was using firearms against the police. The Court\u2019s findings in those four cases are therefore not readily transposable to the situation at hand. The Court must have regard to the context in which the incident occurred and to the way in which the situation developed over the course of the day (see, among other authorities, Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above, \u00a7 182).",

It is doubtful whether precipitate action was indeed necessary, and it appears that the police, who were quite numerous and wellequipped, had enough time to cordon off the house in which Mr Todorov was hiding, make arrangements to prevent his escape, and prepare carefully his arrest (compare with Golubeva, \u00a7 106, and An\u0131k and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 6365, both cited above). The decisions to use explosives and rocket propelled grenades were taken \u2013 a fact specifically mentioned by the Plovdiv Military Court in its first decision (see paragraph 35 above) \u2013 a considerable time after the last shot had been fired by Mr Todorov, and were thus not a direct result of an abrupt violent reaction of his, or of an immediate attempt to take the life of another (contrast Andronicou and Constantinou, \u00a7 191; Y\u00fcksel Erdo\u011fan and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 9798; and Huohvanainen, \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 106 in fine, all cited above). It is true that the police had attempted to negotiate with Mr Todorov earlier in the day, but they did not try to bring an end to the incident through persuasion and dialogue right up to the last possible moment (contrast Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above, \u00a7 183), and doubts remain as to the effectiveness of their communication with Mr Todorov. Secondly, it seems that the police did not sufficiently appreciate the possibility that some of their assessments \u2013 for instance, that the house and its yard had been boobytrapped \u2013 might be erroneous (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann and Others, cited above, \u00a7 213). Thirdly, they used weapons which appear far too powerful for the aim they were trying to achieve (see, mutatis mutandis, Isayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 195), apparently without sufficiently considering the dangers that such methods invariably entail (see, mutatis mutandis, Isayeva, cited above, \u00a7 189). It is questionable whether the use of explosives and the firing of no less than fifteen rocket propelled grenades, which inevitably placed in danger the lives of anyone in proximity to their impact points, was justified by a reasonable belief that officers\u2019 or civilian lives were at risk from Mr Todorov or by the need to secure access to the house. While it is not for the Court, with detached reflection, to substitute its own opinion of the situation for that of police officers who were required to react in a tense situation in which they were facing an armed and dangerous individual, and while errors of judgment or mistaken assessments, unfortunate in retrospect, will not in themselves entail responsibility under Article 2 (see, among other authorities, Andronicou and\u00a0Constantinou, \u00a7 192, and Brady, both cited above), the use of heavy weapons and explosives, with the attendant risk for human life, cannot be regarded as justified in the circumstances.",

The authorities interviewed a considerable number of witnesses and obtained expert opinions on various aspects of the case. However, the investigation may be regarded as deficient in at least two crucial respects. First, it does not appear that the standard applied by the authorities was comparable to the \u201cno more than absolutely necessary\u201d standard required by Article 2 \u00a7 2 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nachova and\u00a0Others, \u00a7\u00a7 11314; Tzekov, \u00a7 71; Vasil Sashov Petrov, \u00a7 52; Karandja, \u00a7 65; and Vlaevi, \u00a7 88, all cited above). A reading of the prosecutor\u2019s decision to discontinue the investigation and the court\u2019s decision that upheld it (see paragraphs 41 and 43 above) shows that both were of the view that any amount of force, including explosives and rocket propelled grenades, was warranted to overcome Mr Todorov\u2019s resistance (see, mutatis mutandis, An\u0131k and Others, \u00a7 60, and Wasilewska and Ka\u0142ucka, \u00a7 62, both cited above). Secondly, the prosecuting authorities said that members of the antiterrorist squad could not be investigated or prosecuted because by section 159(3) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 their identities were to be kept secret (see paragraphs 41 and 52 above). The Court first expressed concern about that approach in Rashid v. Bulgaria (no. 47905/99, \u00a7\u00a7 6365, 18 January 2007). Later, in Vachkovi (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 8183 and 8789), it specifically found that it fell foul of the requirements of Article 2, on the basis that any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the identity of the persons responsible is liable to render it ineffective (see also Hristovi v. Bulgaria, no. 42697/05, \u00a7\u00a7 8891, 11\u00a0October 2011). It sees no reason to hold otherwise in the present case.",

                        "content": "In order to find that there has been such a breach, in paragraph 84 of the judgment the majority relies on two points: (a) that, in assessing the results of the investigation into Mr Todorov\u2019s death, the authorities did not apply a standard that was comparable to the \u201cno more than absolutely necessary\u201d standard required by Article 2 \u00a7 2; and (b) that they did not interview the members of the antiterrorist squad, because they preferred to preserve their anonymity. In my view, in the specific circumstances of this case the failure to interview the officers of the antiterrorist squad did not have any effect on the thoroughness of the investigation carried out by the national authorities. It is beyond doubt that in spite of the rule applicable at the time of the investigation \u2013 section 159(3) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997, which required that the identities of those officers be kept secret \u2013 there was a procedural possibility under Bulgarian law to interview them, for instance by questioning them as anonymous witnesses. Interviewing such officers is clearly required in cases similar to Vachkovi v. Bulgaria (no. 2747/02, 8\u00a0July 2010), where the Court found that there had been a breach of Article\u00a02 of the Convention precisely because of the failure to interview the officers of the antiterrorist squad. However, I do not find that the facts of the present case match those of Vachkovi. In that case, the unquestioned witnesses were the only ones who had been in close proximity to the victim at the time his death. It was therefore natural that they would be the most useful witnesses and that, without interviewing them, the authorities could not maintain that they had done all they could to uncover the truth. In the instant case, the special antiterrorist squad took part in the last stages of the operation, and none of its members was any closer to the house where the victim was hiding than any of the other witnesses. In the course of the investigation the authorities interviewed enough persons who were close to Mr Todorov and almost all police officers who had taken part in the operation. After the case was referred back for additional investigation, the authorities obtained additional expert evidence, the purpose of which was to establish the time and the manner in which Mr Todorov had died. In as much as the majority finds that those two points were not elucidated, and that the authorities did not therefore carry out an effective investigation into the death of the applicants\u2019 relative, I am not convinced that it was possible to obtain any further clarification by interviewing the officers of the antiterrorist squad. I consider that the investigation obtained sufficient evidence \u2013 in the form of expert reports and witness statements \u2013 that allowed the competent authorities to determine whether any offences had been committed.",

                        "content": "In the final analysis, States cannot be blamed for enacting legislation which protects the identities of police officers who are, by law, required to discharge very important duties in challenging situations. The essential issue in the present case is whether by interviewing those officers the authorities would have arrived at a different conclusion. I do not believe that this would have been the case, for the abovementioned reasons. The effectiveness of an investigation is not determined by the quantity of the evidence but by the quality of the information conveyed by that evidence. For this reason, I find that the national authorities cannot be faulted for the way in which they conducted the investigation, which was comprehensive and full in terms of elucidating the manner in which the events of 10 and 11\u00a0December 2003 had unfolded. As regards the time and the manner of Mr\u00a0Todorov\u2019s death, interviewing those officers would not have helped clarify these points, which were obviously something that could be determined solely through expert evidence. In view of this, and of the Court\u2019s settled caselaw concerning the effectiveness of investigations into suspicious deaths, I am of the view that the national authorities gathered enough evidence to be able to determine speedily the cause of Mr Todorov\u2019s death and the person or persons who bore responsibility for it. In examining the procedural limb of Article 2 of the Convention, the Court should not seek to determine that, on the basis of the available evidence, the national authorities should have made fundamentally different findings of fact or law. This is a matter falling into the exclusive purview of the national authorities, which should not be supplanted by the Court.",

This finding is, in my view, an assessment of the ends, not of the means, and should not have featured in the Court\u2019s analysis under the procedural limb of Article 2. This point is relevant only for the finding of a substantive breach of Article 2, a finding with which I fully agree.",
