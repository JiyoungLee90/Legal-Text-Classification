The Court notes with regret that the applicant was not medically examined immediately after his arrest on 7 August 2001. There is also no evidence, and the Government did not argue to the contrary, that a prison doctor examined the applicant before his admission to the temporary detention facility on 8 August 2001.

Without prejudice to the examination of the question of the cause and severity of the injuries which will be carried out below in the context of compliance with Article 3 of the Convention, the Court thus finds it established that on the day after his arrest the applicant had a slash wound to his left forearm and a bruise to the left side of his body.

However, the Court is not convinced by that explanation. It firstly notes that that version of events was never raised before the Oktyabrskiy District prosecutor\u2019s office and was never examined during the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry into the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment. The Court observes, and the Government did not argue to the contrary, that domestic authorities did not take any action against the applicant\u2019s alleged attackers, that they were never subject to any form of investigation and were not even questioned about the alleged attack. Furthermore, the Court considers it extraordinary that, in the absence of any official records, in October 2005, that is more than four years after the applicant\u2019s arrest, the police officers were able to recollect the exact circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s transfer to the police station and the names of the victims who had allegedly attacked him.

The Court notes that this description corresponds to physical sequelae from beating with a stick or a rubber truncheon rather than to injuries sustained as a result of a collision with a concrete floor. This finding is also supported by the expert\u2019s reluctance to conclude that the injuries could have resulted from a fall.

In this connection the Court accepts the applicant\u2019s argument that that extract is of little evidential value as it had been copied by hand by a warder and did not bear the applicant\u2019s signature. The Court observes that it was open to the Government to submit a photocopy of the corresponding page from the registration log to support their allegation that the applicant had made an entry in the log noting that the injuries had been self-inflicted. However, no such document was presented. The Court finds it peculiar that the Government preferred to submit a handwritten copy made by a facility warder. Furthermore, the Court notes that the Government did not provide any explanation as to how and when the applicant could have injured himself while being interrogated in the Oktyabrskiy District police station. The Court also does not lose sight of the fact that neither the forensic experts nor the hospital doctors recorded any self-inflicted injuries on the applicant\u2019s body.",

In this connection, the Court firstly notes that the medical expert who examined the applicant on 9 August 2001 did not only fail to record certain of the applicant\u2019s injuries, such as an injury to the right kidney, which were later discovered in the hospital on 12 August 2001, but also omitted to mention in his report a slash wound to the applicant\u2019s forearm which, as was pointed out by the Government, was sustained on 8\u00a0August 2001. Therefore, the Court attaches no evidentiary weight to the fact that certain injuries on the applicant\u2019s body were recorded for the first time by the hospital doctors on 12 August 2001. Furthermore, although the effectiveness of the investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment will be examined below, the Court would already stress at this juncture that it is struck by the fact that the expert examination on 9 August 2001 was ordered by the same police investigator, Ms Z., who had questioned the applicant after his arrest and could have witnessed the alleged beatings (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). That police investigator also formulated questions to the medical expert. The Court entertains doubts whether this fact could have influenced the expert\u2019s findings.",

The Court has already noted in previous cases that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see Salman v.  [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0114, ECHR 2000VII). According to the Court\u2019s consistent approach, treatment is considered \u201cinhuman\u201d if it is premeditated, applied for hours at a stretch and causes either actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering. It is deemed to be \u201cdegrading\u201d if it is such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 92). The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a violation of Article 3 (see, for example, Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2001-III, and Kalashnikov v.

Firstly, a thorough evaluation was not carried out with respect to the quantity and nature of the applicant\u2019s injuries.\u00a0The Court has already found it striking that the initial examination of the applicant by a forensic expert was ordered by the same police investigator who could have witnessed the applicant\u2019s beatings (see paragraph 48 above). The Court further reiterates that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. , nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a055 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X). When the doctor writes a report after the medical examination of a person who alleges having been ill-treated, it is extremely important that the doctor states the degree of consistency with the allegations of ill-treatment. A conclusion indicating the degree of support to the allegations of ill-treatment should be based on a discussion of possible differential diagnoses (non-ill-treatment-related injuries \u2013 including self-inflicted injuries \u2013 and diseases). That was not done in the present case. In his report of 13 August 2001 the expert not only failed to document the applicant\u2019s injuries properly, but he also did not make any reference to the degree of support to the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment (see paragraph  above). Taking into account the serious defects of the initial expert report, the Court finds it regrettable that the additional expert examination only commenced on 30 November 2001, that is almost four months after the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment had taken place. The Court notes that a delay in requesting an additional expert opinion led, among other things, to serious discrepancies between the findings of doctors who had examined the applicant in the Lipetsk Regional hospital and the conclusions of the forensic medical expert.",

It was not until 7 December 2001 when the assistant prosecutor restated the expert and hospital reports which listed the injuries sustained by the applicant. However, she limited herself to a selective reiteration of the expert findings (see paragraph 21 above) and did not attempt to examine the medical evidence before her or to draw conclusions on that basis.

Although the excerpts of from the applicant\u2019s testimony were included in the decision not to institute criminal proceedings, the assistant prosecutor did not consider that testimony to be credible, apparently, because it reflected a personal opinion and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant. However, the investigator did accept as such the credibility of the police officers\u2019 testimonies as credible, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics and have been aimed at damaging the applicant\u2019s credibility. In the Court\u2019s view, the prosecution inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies, as that given by the applicant was deemed to be subjective, but not those given by the police officers. However, tThe credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation had soughtwas supposed to establish whether the officers were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v.

The Court further observes that it has found a particularly grievous violation in the present case. The Court accepts that the applicant suffered humiliation and distress on account of the ill-treatment inflicted on him. In addition, he did not benefit from an adequate and effective investigation of his complaints about the ill-treatment. In these circumstances, it considers that the applicant\u2019s suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation. Nevertheless, the particular amount claimed appears excessive. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant EUR 15,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
