The court held that the applicant and his co-accused had gone to the victim\u2019s apartment to help M.B. find his stolen motorcycle. It considered that the applicant\u2019s guilt had been established by the testimonies of the applicant\u2019s co-accused, the victim, M.B., U.I., A.\u0160., and the two minor girls who had written down the number of the licence plate of the car used to transport the victim\u2019s stolen property. The court considered that there was no reason not to believe the pre-trial statements of M.B. and that slight discrepancies in the testimony of U.I. could be explained by the fact that three years had passed since the events in question. The court did not believe the testimonies of the witnesses who confirmed that on the day of the robbery the applicant had been working in the yard of his house, because those witnesses had been questioned at the applicant\u2019s request and because too long a time had passed since the day of the robbery and they could not possibly remember what the applicant had been doing on that particular day.",

At the same time, the Court has also emphasised that if no death of a victim as a result of actions attributable to the State or its agents has occurred, then such actions will be analysed from the angle of Article\u00a02 only in exceptional circumstances (see Karchen and Others, cited above). The Court considers that no such exceptional circumstances are present in this case. The crux of the applicant\u2019s complaint appears to concern the single but inevitably shocking fact of being infected with two dangerous diseases. Therefore the Court will examine the applicant\u2019s complaints under the substantive and the procedural aspects of Article\u00a03.",

Furthermore, his blood sample had been sent for analysis to the laboratory of the Infectious Disease Centre, which only accepted blood samples in vacuum containers. The Government further referred to the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (hereinafter \u201cthe CPT\u201d) on its visit to Latvia from 24\u00a0January to 3\u00a0February 1999, that is, shortly before the disputed blood sample was taken from the applicant.

The \u201cwindow period\u201d can last anywhere between three and six months after the date of the infection. As for hepatitis\u00a0C, the Government pointed out that persons infected with it sometimes did not display any symptoms or displayed only mild symptoms for ten or even up to twenty years after having been infected. The Government argued that the applicant could have been infected with the two diseases prior to his arrest, while getting tattoos, or sharing needles when injecting drugs, or in some other way. He could also have been infected during long-term meetings with private individuals when already in prison.",

In various contexts that date has been reported to be the beginning of the 1990s (see paragraph\u00a027 above), 1992 (paragraph\u00a063), 1996 or 1997 (paragraph\u00a028) and 1998 (paragraph\u00a031). Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of the arguments submitted by the Government. Despite this uncertainty the Court considers that reasonable doubts equally persist that the applicant was infected with HIV and hepatitis C only after his arrest. The Court has previously found that the existence of a \u201cwindow period\u201d for detecting the presence of HIV antibodies means that there exists the possibility that the infection might have been contracted prior to the person\u2019s arrest (see, for example I.T. v.  (dec.), no.\u00a040155/02, 24\u00a0November 2005). As to the infection with hepatitis C, the Court notes that it does not have any information that the applicant had ever been tested for that disease prior to his arrest in 1999. An ordinary medical check-up does not suffice to reveal chronic hepatitis and, as noted by the Government, the disease can remain asymptomatic for extended periods of time. Therefore doubts persist that the applicant was infected only after his arrest (see also Mechenkov v. , no.\u00a035421/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81, 7\u00a0February 2008, and Ghavtadze v. , no.\u00a023204/07, \u00a7\u00a079, 3\u00a0March 2009).",

In the applicant\u2019s view that response attested to the fact that Central Prison had failed to carry out any investigation of his claims whatsoever.

They had not questioned the prisoners whose blood samples had been taken on the same day as his own. In any case, civil proceedings could not be considered an effective official investigation, since civil proceedings were carried out on an adversarial basis, thus all evidence of the applicant\u2019s allegations had to be collected and submitted by the applicant himself. The applicant\u2019s complaint to the Office of the Prosecutor General had been dismissed without any official investigation.",

France [GC], no.\u00a047287/99, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR\u00a02004-I). However, the Court has said on a number of occasions that the effective judicial system required by the Convention may, and under certain circumstances must, include recourse to the criminal law. However, if the infringement of the right to life or to personal integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed under the Convention to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence the obligation may, for instance, also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (see Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2002 I). However, the above-mentioned rule is not absolute. In certain situations it is only by recourse to criminal-law remedies that it can be ensured that situations are investigated and evidence is collected in conformity with the Convention requirements. In Latvian law, as in French law, \u201ccriminal proceedings prevail over civil proceedings ... in terms of the means available to establish the facts and gather evidence\u201d (see Perez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066). While in theory parties to a civil case could ask a court to secure evidence to which they had no access (section\u00a093\u00a0(2) of the Law of Civil Procedure, see paragraph\u00a049 above), in practice such a method of gathering evidence might in many cases be cumbersome. In the particular circumstances of the present case two considerations militate against civil proceedings as an effective means of investigation. First, because he was in prison the applicant\u2019s personal investigative capacity was inevitably severely curtailed. Second, the applicant was absent from the appeal court\u2019s hearing in the civil proceedings he had instituted concerning his infection. While the impact of his absence on his right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention will be dealt with below (see paragraphs\u00a0107-115), for the purposes of the present analysis the Court has some doubts whether the applicant was able to have \u201ca full adversarial hearing on [his] allegations of negligence\u201d (see Powell v. the  (dec.), no.\u00a045305/99, ECHR\u00a02000V, and Vo v. France [GC], no.\u00a053924/00, \u00a7\u00a091, ECHR\u00a02004VIII).",

Consequently, the applicant\u2019s decision to submit a criminal complaint to the Office of the Prosecutor General was justified and the domestic authorities had an obligation to make use of the criminal-law remedies available to them. That conclusion is wholly independent from the fact that according to the domestic law applicable at the time prosecutors had a strict obligation to initiate criminal proceedings every time there were sufficient reasons to suspect that a criminal offence had been committed (see paragraph\u00a051 above).",

What this means is that the domestic authorities are not obliged to come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant\u2019s account of events. However, any investigation carried out by such authorities should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and the potential identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation into serious allegations of treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 of the Convention must be thorough and the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened (see Mikheyev v. , no.\u00a077617/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0107-108, 26\u00a0January 2006).",

[GC], no.\u00a031333/06, \u00a7\u00a0114, 10\u00a0September 2010, and Alimu\u00e7aj v. , no.\u00a020134/05, \u00a7\u00a0152, 7\u00a0February 2012). Thus it is not open to the Court to speculate, in the absence of observations in that respect, whether a criminal investigation of the applicant\u2019s complaints might have been impossible for objective reasons, such as, for example, the expiry of the statute of limitations. What the Office of the Prosecutor General did was to forward the applicant\u2019s complaints to the Ministry of Justice. It appears that subsequently that Office acquiesced to the Ministry of Justice\u2019s reliance on the findings of the civil courts (see paragraph\u00a033 above).",

The question instead was whether the proceedings in their entirety, including the way in which evidence had been taken, had been fair (\u017d. v. , no.\u00a014755/03, \u00a7\u00a094, 24\u00a0January 2008, and Pacula v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a065014/01, \u00a7\u00a059, 15\u00a0September 2009). For that reason it was necessary to establish the reason why the applicant had requested that the victim testify in court, which, according to the Government, was only to demonstrate that the victim would be unable to identify him as one of the assailants. The Government argued that during the pre-trial investigation the victim had consistently stated that he had never seen his assailants before the robbery and thus would not be able to recognise them. The Government submitted that the victim\u2019s testimony, which had been read out during trial at the first-instance court and on appeal because the victim was disabled and thus unable to appear at the hearings in person, had not been the sole or decisive piece of evidence for establishing the applicant\u2019s guilt. In addition, the applicant and his counsel had been given an opportunity to comment on the victim\u2019s statements which had been read out at the hearing. Lastly the Government emphasised that neither the applicant nor his counsel had objected to the victim\u2019s absence from the appeal court hearing or requested that the hearing be adjourned because of the victim\u2019s absence.",

When questioned, on 13\u00a0October 1999, the victim had stated that he did not remember the features of the assailants. In addition, the statements given by the victim during the pre-trial investigation had been inconsistent and had contradicted statements given by other witnesses during the trial. Those discrepancies led the applicant to submit that having an opportunity to put questions to the victim in person would have been particularly important. The applicant had had no other possibility to challenge the victim\u2019s version of the events, his request to organise an identity parade and a confrontation between him and the victim having been denied. The applicant further disputed the argument that the victim had been unable to attend the court hearing because of his disability. According to the applicant the victim had been disabled since his childhood but was nevertheless physically capable of attending court hearings. Lastly the applicant submitted that under the laws governing criminal procedure the courts had the possibility to question witnesses in their place of residence, yet the first-instance court and the appeal court had not used that possibility.",

Two requirements follow from that principle. First is the so-called \u201csole or decisive\u201d rule, according to which Article 6 may be violated when a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the  [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7\u00a0119, 15\u00a0December 2011). In this context the word \u201cdecisive\u201d should be interpreted narrowly (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0131). Secondly, even where the evidence of an absent witness has not been sole or decisive, Article 6 may be violated when no good reason has been shown for the failure to have the witness examined (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0120, with further references).",

The Government and the applicant appear to be in agreement that as from 13\u00a0October 1999 the victim could no longer remember the specific features of his assailants and therefore could not have reliably eliminated the applicant from among the persons who had attacked him. Second, even though the domestic court accepted, without delving further into the issue, the victim\u2019s claim that he could not participate in the trial because of his disability, the applicant himself might have contributed to that omission by failing to consistently maintain his complaint in that regard before the appeal court. Overall the Court considers that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the fact that the victim\u2019s absence from the proceedings impaired his defence rights to such an extent as to render the whole proceedings unfair. The applicant was convicted on the basis of solid evidence (testimonies of witnesses and his co-defendants, expert reports, and so on).

While it is true that it appears to have been the earlier theft of M.B.\u2019s motorcycle that launched the sequence of events that eventually led to the robbery in the victim\u2019s apartment, in so far as the applicant\u2019s role in the events was concerned, M.B.\u2019s statements were corroborated by the testimony of the applicant\u2019s co-accused and of U.I. In any case M.B. had not witnessed the actual robbery, as he had been waiting in the car outside. The Court is of the opinion that the national authorities cannot be blamed for lack of effort to ensure M.B.\u2019s presence at the trial. The first-instance court sent summonses to his address on file as well as ordering the police to look for him. Those attempts remained unsuccessful. In addition, the Court does not overlook the fact that on 7\u00a0July 2000 the applicant, who was assisted by counsel, was confronted with M.B. and did not use the opportunity to ask him questions (see paragraph\u00a09 above). Overall the Court considers that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the fact that M.B.\u2019s absence from the proceedings impaired his defence rights to such an extent as to render the whole proceedings unfair.

What this means is that the Court will need to determine whether the respondent State failed to protect the applicant\u2019s Article\u00a08 rights from interference by other individuals (see, mutatis mutandis, Appleby and Others v. the , no.\u00a044306/98, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2003VI).",

Instead, the question of the positive obligations of the respondent State arises at the level of the decisions of the domestic courts, which, according to the applicant, did not grant him sufficient protection against the incursion into his private life by the publication of the disputed article in R\u012bgas Balss (see Gurgenidze v. Georgia, no.\u00a071678/01, \u00a7\u00a039, 17\u00a0October 2006, and Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056).

Accordingly, this is an area in which the Contracting Parties enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention, account being taken of the needs and resources of the community and of individuals. The Court nonetheless notes that Article 8, like any other provision of the Convention or its protocols, must be interpreted in such a way as to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Armonien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Biriuk, cited above, \u00a7 37).",

The virus does not spread through the air like cold and flu viruses. HIV lives in the blood and in some body fluids. For a healthy person to get infected with HIV, one of these fluids from someone already infected with HIV has to find its way into that person\u2019s blood. The body fluids that contain enough HIV to infect someone are: semen, vaginal fluids (including, but not limited to, menstrual blood), breast milk, blood and the lining inside the anus. Other body fluids, like saliva, sweat or urine, do not contain enough of the virus to infect another person. The main pathways through which the virus enters the bloodstream are: cuts and sores in the skin, the thin lining on or inside the anus and genitals, the thin lining of the mouth and eyes. One cannot catch HIV from an infected person through kissing, or through contact with unbroken, healthy skin, through being sneezed on, through sharing baths, towels or cutlery, through using the same toilets and swimming pools, or through contact with animals or insects such as mosquitoes.",

I am also prepared to accept that in a case like this the burden of proof shifts. It is not sufficient for the Government to point out other possible causes of the infection; they must produce evidence that they cannot be blamed and that the account given by the applicant is untrue. And that is precisely what the Government did. In the civil case instituted by the applicant, the nurse who had taken the applicant\u2019s blood sample in 1999 testified before the court that single-use syringes had been used exclusively for blood tests in Central Prison since 1996 or 1997 (paragraph 28). The applicant merely stated, without any corroboration, that he knew for certain that in 1999 a multiple-use syringe had been used to take a sample of his blood (paragraph 29). Under these circumstances the burden shifts again and it was up to him to proffer further evidence which could cast doubt on the veracity of the nurse\u2019s testimony. This he was quite unable to do. So in the end the testimony of the nurse was sufficient for the national court to accept that the Government could not be blamed, and it is sufficient for me as well.",

The unfortunate corollary of such reasoning is this: never mind if you lose your civil case, just file a criminal complaint and the prosecutor has the obligation to carry out an in-depth investigation, hopefully leading to the conclusion that the final civil judgment was wrong. I find that absurd. And what should have been further investigated anyway?

Besides, what could be proven by questioning the other prisoners? Would they remember the type of syringes? And would their testimony be more relevant than the testimony of a professional nurse who knows the material he or she works with? Or should their medical records be examined and included in the file of the criminal investigation? What about their privacy?

Here I can be brief. In paragraph 29 it is mentioned that in the amendment to his appeal he requested that his presence at the hearing be ensured. Likewise, in paragraph 43 it is mentioned that the applicant asked the appeal court when his appeal would be heard, and that he also requested that his presence at the hearing be ensured. Of course the applicant should be notified in proper time of the date of the hearing(s), so as to be able to ask the authorities to make arrangements to have him escorted to the hearing as domestic law allows. But it cannot be the task of the court of appeal to ensure a suspect\u2019s presence at the hearing, not even in the present case where the applicant expressly so requested. I could not find in the file any indication that the applicant asked the relevant (prison) authorities to organise transport and/or that his request was rejected on unreasonable or arbitrary grounds. Nor could I find any indication that under Latvian law people deprived of their liberty are prevented from attending any civil court hearing in which they themselves are a party.

The defendant prison authorities objected to opening the trial to the public, considering that the case concerned sensitive material. The court nonetheless allowed the applicant\u2019s request. I cannot but conclude that the applicant wanted the case he had instituted against the prison authorities to be given a great deal of media attention. He was served according to his wishes. Paragraph 37 describes how a newspaper did indeed publish an article with the lurid title \u2018Prison Doctors Accused of Injecting AIDS\u2019. The newspaper also reported that it was the applicant who had instituted the proceedings, but only referred to him as Andris M., describing him as a recidivist who was currently serving his prison sentence. They even added a photograph of the applicant, albeit one that had not been taken at the hearing in question. As the Government pointed out in their observations, the newspaper had obtained the photo from the internet portal of the photography agency AFI, with whom the publisher had an agreement about the use of the photos found there. It emerged that the applicant had previously consented to the inclusion of his personal photo on the site and had been aware of the risk that it might be published at some point in the future, although not in what context.",

This applicant cannot be compared with someone who has not consciously and intentionally submitted himself to public scrutiny. He himself asked for publicity. Did he really believe that the newspapers would only report what he wanted them to report? That the newspapers, in their oft-mentioned role of public watchdog, would only bark the way he wanted them to bark? A newspaper has its own professional duties and responsibilities, although admittedly limited in its reporting by the relevant legal provisions. The fact that Latvian data protection laws were not binding on privately published newspapers is, as far as I am concerned, not relevant in the present case. The Court has to deal with European minimum standards. Must I take it that from now on, in any other of the 47 High Contracting Parties, in a comparable civil case where the press is expressly invited by a \u2018vulnerable\u2019 party (and against the advice of the Government party) to be present, the press will not be permitted to publish the name or sensitive personal details of that same \u2018vulnerable\u2019 party \u2013 even if those details, as such, are relevant to the hearing?
