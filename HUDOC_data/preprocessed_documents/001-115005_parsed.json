As to the complaint that the first-instance court had refused to obtain an opinion from an expert in photographic analysis, the Court of Appeal found that the judge had rightly held that she could interpret the photographs for herself. Furthermore, the finding that the applicant and the seminarian K. had had a homosexual relationship was based not only on the photographs but first and foremost on a witness statement.

The average reader of the magazine would understand the term \u201ckinky\u201d to mean a deviation from what was considered normal, which would include photographs of priests and seminarians in a sexual pose wearing clerical clothing, especially as the persons concerned belonged to a group who publicly spoke out against homosexuality and denounced homosexual contacts as sinful.

The Catholic Church, to which the majority of the Austrian population belongs and which, according to Article II of the Concordat (BGBl. II No. 2/1934), has public-law status, has a level of importance in Austria going beyond that of a small association, as is clear from the overall content of the Concordat and the circumstances in which it was ratified. Accordingly, conduct on the part of Church dignitaries which is in flagrant contradiction with Catholic teachings may very well be of public interest, particularly where \u2013 as in the present case \u2013 homosexual contacts take place and are maintained, albeit on a consensual basis, between staff and students in an educational establishment and between students themselves. The Catholic Church strives for acceptance and credibility among the public at large, and the activities of a principal and a deputy principal, as the persons in charge of a training college for future priests, have a public dimension. The Catholic Church is engaged in public relations work in many spheres and regularly makes its views on (sexual) morality known to the population as a whole, with the result that the general public is also entitled to be informed if individual officials are failing to practise what they preach, condemning homosexuality as a sin in public while practising it in private, even between staff and students. It should also be taken into consideration that the teachings of the Catholic Church on the subject of homosexuality are contrary to the fundamental right to sexual self-determination under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and to the prohibition on discrimination; hence, on this basis also, there is a public interest in the publication of specific allegations that Church dignitaries are failing to observe their Church\u2019s teachings on sexual morals. This is even more so where the reports concern homosexual contacts between a teacher and his students. Such relationships of dependency call for particular vigilance in order to avoid potential breaches of a fundamental code of conduct designed to protect the physical and psychological integrity of the students. The media have a vital role in publicly exposing misconduct in a democratic society governed by the rule of law.",

The weighing of interests in the present case should undoubtedly lead to the conclusion that the public right to information prevails. The professional activity of an ordained priest who is active in public life, as a clergyman, as deputy head of a seminary and as a close adviser and secretary to the bishop, does not take place merely within the Church; the Catholic Church has an important and, in some respects even a State role, and the credibility of its officials, who demand moral standards from the population and compliance with the Church\u2019s rules of community life, occupies an important position in that regard. In particular, the fact that the events involved students who, as future officials of the Catholic Church are supposed to be taught these moral precepts by example, lends those events a public-interest dimension extending beyond the Church itself and affects all sections of the population.",

In its judgment of 28 June 2006 the Court of Appeal, examining the issue in more detail, also noted the important position held by the Roman Catholic Church in Austrian society. It observed that the Church regularly made its moral values known to the general public. In view of the Church\u2019s position condemning homosexuality, the public had a right to be informed about the conduct of a dignitary of the Church which was in open contradiction with that position, all the more so if such conduct occurred at a training institution for future priests and involved contacts, albeit voluntary ones, between future priests and their superiors.",

The Court observes that, in addition to proceedings under the Media Act, Austrian law provides protection against the publication of a person\u2019s picture under section 78 of the Copyright Act. That provision aims specifically at protecting individuals against publication of their image and allows them to obtain an injunction, preceded if need be by a preliminary injunction. The request for an injunction may also be combined with a claim for damages. By contrast, sections 6 and 7 of the Media Act are more generally concerned with protection against defamation or exposure of an individual\u2019s strictly personal sphere through any form of publication in the media. Persons whose rights have been infringed are entitled to compensation. The Court notes that the applicant chose not to bring proceedings under section 78 of the Copyright Act.
