They are an expression of what has been called social solidarity or fraternit\u00e9; the duty of any community to help those of its members who are in need. But that duty is generally recognised to be national in character. It does not extend to the inhabitants of foreign countries. That is recognised in treaties such as the ILO [International Labour Organization] Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention 1952 (Article 69) and the European Code of Social Security 1961.",

The situation of the beneficiaries of UK social security is, to quote the European Court in Van der Mussele v.

But that in my opinion is an obvious fallacy. National Insurance contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions, comparable with contributions to a private pension scheme. In fact the link is a rather tenuous one. National Insurance contributions form a source of part of the revenue which pays for all social security benefits and the National Health Service (the rest comes from ordinary taxation). If payment of contributions is a sufficient condition for being entitled to a contributory benefit, Ms Carson should be entitled to all contributory benefits, like maternity benefit and jobseeker\u2019s allowance.

The main reason for the provision of State pensions is the recognition that the majority of people of pensionable age will need the money. They are not means-tested, but that is only because means-testing is expensive and discourages take-up of the benefit even by people who need it. So State pensions are paid to everyone whether they have adequate income from other sources or not. On the other hand, they are subject to tax. So the State will recover part of the pension from people who have enough income to pay tax and thereby reduce the net cost of the pension. On the other hand, those people who are entirely destitute would be entitled to income support, a non-contributory benefit. So the net cost of paying a retirement pension to such people takes into account the fact that the pension will be set off against their claim to income support.",

But, from the point of view of the citizens who contribute, National Insurance contributions are little different from general taxation which disappears into the communal pot of the consolidated fund. The difference is only a matter of public accounting. And although retirement pensions are presently linked to contributions, there is no particular reason why they should be. In fact (mainly because the present system severely disadvantages women who have spent time in the unremunerated work of caring for a family rather than earning a salary) there are proposals for change. Contributory pensions may be replaced with a non-contributory \u2018citizen\u2019s pension\u2019 payable to all inhabitants of this country of pensionable age. But there is no reason why this should mean any change in the collection of National Insurance contributions to fund the citizen\u2019s pension like all the other non-contributory benefits. On Ms Carson\u2019s argument, however, a change to a non-contributory pension would make all the difference. Once the retirement pension was non-contributory, the foundation of her argument that she had \u2018earned\u2019 the right to equal treatment would disappear. But she would have paid exactly the same National Insurance contributions while she was working here and her contributions would have had as much (or as little) causal relationship to her pension entitlement as they have today.",

Furthermore, I think that this is very much a case in which Parliament is entitled to decide whether the differences justify a difference in treatment. It cannot be the law that the  is prohibited from treating expatriate pensioners generously unless it treats them in precisely the same way as pensioners at home. Once it is accepted that the position of Ms Carson is relevantly different from that of a  resident and that she therefore cannot claim equality of treatment, the amount (if any) which she receives must be a matter for Parliament. It must be possible to recognise that her past contributions gave her a claim in equity to some pension without having to abandon the reasons why she cannot claim to be treated equally. And in deciding what expatriate pensioners should be paid, Parliament must be entitled to take into account competing claims on public funds. To say that the reason why expatriate pensioners are not paid the annual increases is to save money is true but only in a trivial sense: every decision not to spend more on something is to save money to reduce taxes or spend it on something else.",

But that seems to me an entirely rational basis for differences in treatment. The situation of a  expatriate pensioner who lives in a country which has been willing to enter into suitable reciprocal social security arrangements is relevantly different from that of a pensioner who lives in a country which has not. The treaty enables the government to improve the social security benefits of  nationals in the foreign country on terms which it considers to be favourable, or at least not unduly burdensome. It would be very strange if the government was prohibited from entering into such reciprocal arrangements with any country (for example, as it has with the EEA [European Economic Area] countries) unless it paid the same benefits to all expatriates in every part of the world.\u201d",

Denmark, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 56, Series A no.\u00a023). Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no.\u00a057325/00, \u00a7 175, ECHR 2007-IV, and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2008). Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see Burden, cited above, \u00a7 60). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature\u2019s policy choice unless it is \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2006-VI).",

Much is made in the applicants\u2019 submissions and in those of the third-party intervener of the extreme financial hardship which may result from the policy not to uprate pensions and of the effect that this might have on the ability of certain persons to join their families abroad. However, the Court is not in a position to make an assessment of the effects, if any, on the many thousands in the same position as the applicants and nor should it try to do so. Any welfare system, to be workable, may have to use broad categorisations to distinguish between different groups in need (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, \u00a7 39, 10 May 2007).

However, the list set out in Article 14 is illustrative and not exhaustive, as is shown by the words \u201cany ground such as\u201d (in French notamment) (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8\u00a0June 1976, \u00a7 72, Series A no. 22). It further notes that the words \u201cother status\u201d (and a fortiori the French equivalent toute autre situation) have been given a wide meaning so as to include, in certain circumstances, a distinction drawn on the basis of a place of residence. Thus, in previous cases the Court has examined under Article 14 the legitimacy of alleged discrimination based, inter alia, on domicile abroad (see Johnston and Others v. Ireland, 18\u00a0December 1986, \u00a7\u00a7 59-61, Series A no. 112) and registration as a resident (see Darby v. Sweden, 23 October 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 31-34, Series A no.\u00a0187). In addition, the Commission examined complaints about discrepancies in the law applying in different areas of a single Contracting State (see Lindsay and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 8364/78, Commission decision of 8 March 1979, Decisions and Reports 15, p. 247, and Gudmundsson v. Iceland, no. 23285/94, Commission decision of 17\u00a0January 1996, unreported). It is true that regional differences of treatment, resulting from the application of different legislation depending on the geographical location of an applicant, have been held not to be explained in terms of personal characteristics (see, for example, Magee v. the United Kingdom, no. 28135/95, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2000-VI). However, as also pointed out by Stanley Burnton J (see paragraphs 26-28 above), these cases are not comparable to the present case, which involves the different application of the same pensions legislation to persons depending on their residence and presence abroad.",

However, in common with the national courts and the Chamber, the Grand Chamber considers that the applicants\u2019 argument misconceives the relationship between NICs and the State pension. Unlike private pension schemes, where premiums are paid into a specific fund and where those premiums are directly linked to the expected benefit returns, NICs have no exclusive link to retirement pensions. Instead, they form a source of part of the revenue which pays for a whole range of social security benefits, including incapacity benefits, maternity allowances, widow\u2019s benefits, bereavement benefits and the National Health Service. Where necessary, the National Insurance Fund can be topped-up with money derived from the ordinary taxation of those resident in the United Kingdom, including pensioners (see paragraph 38 above). The variety of funding methods of welfare benefits and the interlocking nature of the benefits and taxation systems have already been recognised by the Court (see the decision in Stec and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050). This complex and interlocking system makes it impossible to isolate the payment of NICs as a sufficient ground for equating the position of pensioners who receive uprating and those, like the applicants, who do not.

The scheme of the primary legislation is, as the Court of Appeal said, \u201centirely geared to the impact on the pension of price inflation in the United Kingdom\u201d (see paragraph 30 above).

All of them are members of, and have contributed to, the National Insurance system, according to the rates fixed by law, which are general and binding in nature. All of them have been awarded pensions according to the same general rules, including common rules determining the number of years of contributions required to accrue pension rights, the length of the period to be taken into account in each case, and the amount of the initial pension to which they are entitled according to these general rules. All of them (whether they reside in the United Kingdom or not) have therefore been included, under the same conditions, in a system whose goal is to guarantee that when reaching retirement age they will have an income based on the number of years they have contributed to the pension system, and on the amount of those contributions.",

The majority are correct in stating that the funds for the payment of pensions derive from many sources, and not only from the (previous) contributions of current pensioners. But the sources of the funds to pay National Insurance pensions are not relevant in this case. Whatever these sources may be at any given time, the undisputed fact is that all members included in the system who have made contributions to it were equally subject to identical general rules concerning the amount of those contributions, the way in which they were paid, and the conditions required to establish the initial pension. In other words, the right to a pension and the right to be treated equally when receiving a pension derive, for all pensioners, from having complied with the general conditions and rules of the system established on an equal basis for all its members, and do not derive from the material sources from which pensions are paid at any given time.",

The rate of depreciation may vary from year to year, but it is (and this was not denied by the parties to the case) a common and accepted fact.",

No such formula is applied to non-resident pensioners, so that the progressive depreciation of their pensions is not compensated in any way. The nominal monetary value of the initial pension remains the same, no matter the rate of inflation and the corresponding depreciation of sterling. The consequences of this depreciation are very considerable. In the case of the first applicant, Ms\u00a0Carson, residing in South Africa, over the first five years (2000-05) the lack of uprating resulted in a loss of 28% of her weekly pension, in comparison with someone in the same circumstances residing in the United Kingdom.

But that is no justification for subjecting pensioners who choose not to live in the United Kingdom to extremely unfavourable and unequal treatment in comparison with those who do. There will of course always be differences in depreciation rates for pensioners residing in other countries, depending on exchange rates, the comparative cost of living and other factors. But these factors do not preclude the accepted fact that, at least based on the experience of a century, the depreciation of United Kingdom currency is undeniable and unavoidable, and in the space of a few years such depreciation results in an irreparable deterioration in the real value of pensions paid to persons not residing in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the complete denial (as is the case) of any formula for uprating pensions of pensioners not resident in the United Kingdom (whether or not the abovementioned factors are taken into account) represents a disproportionate difference in treatment for which there is no convincing justification.",

Finally, while it is true that non-residents do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, it is equally true that they do not receive the services paid for with those taxes, and, in any case, this could be remedied within the terms of an appropriate uprating formula.",
