As far as the applicants\u2019 conduct is concerned, the Court notes that more than nine months of the total length of the proceedings before the national courts are attributable to them as they did not pay in time the fees required (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03ad\u03bd\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf) in order to comply with the procedural rules.

However, the Court does not find that it was the applicants\u2019 conduct alone which contributed to the prolonged length of the proceedings. On the contrary, the Court is of the opinion that the actual length of the proceedings - which was more than eight years - without taking into account the applicants\u2019 delay, remains excessive. In particular, it is noted that the duration of the proceedings when the case was pending before the First Instance Administrative Court of Chalkida - which lasted for almost seven years - was at least in part attributable to the national courts. Their handling of the case did not facilitate its timely completion. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the length of the proceedings can only be explained by the failure of the domestic courts to deal with the case diligently (see G\u00fcm\u00fc\u00fften v.\u00a0\u00a0, no. 47116/99, \u00a7\u00a7 24-26, 30\u00a0November 2004).",
