While the Minister attempted subsequently to amend these decisions, awarding the claimants compensation bonds instead of shares, or denying altogether their right to compensation, the Supreme Administrative Court found these subsequent decisions null and void, as they contradicted the initial ones, which had become final (see paragraphs 8, 10 and 16 above). After 2004 neither the Minister of Education nor any other body questioned the applicants\u2019 entitlement to receive compensation. Measures were taken to ensure the provision of that compensation, such as the Privatisation Agency\u2019s authorisation for the transfer of shares in \u2018Obrazovanie i nauka\u2019 EAD, given in 2008 (see paragraph 18 above). Accordingly, the 1998 and 1999 decisions, which determined with finality the applicants\u2019 entitlement to compensation and were not subject to modification, gave rise to legitimate expectations for the applicants to receive such compensation, and thus to \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Mutishev and Others, \u00a7 123, and Hadzhigeorgievi, \u00a7 63, both cited above).",

This would mean that the compensation procedure has in fact been completed and the authorities no longer have any obligation in that regard. However, the Government also stated \u2013 at the domestic level and in the proceedings before the Court \u2013 that the Minister of Education was looking for a lawful means to complete the compensation procedures (see paragraphs 11 and 34 above), which contradicts their argument that the applicants were shareholders. Moreover, in its judgment of 27 January 2015 the Supreme Administrative Court stated expressly that the applicants were not shareholders in \u2018Obrazovanie i nauka\u2019 EAD, dismissing on that ground their application for the judicial review of a governmental decision concerning the company (see paragraph 21 above). The Court thus concludes that the grant of compensation in two decisions of 1998 and 1999 which subsequently became final was not followed by the actual transfer of shares to the applicants \u2013 and that this continued failure of the Minister of Education to comply with the decisions acknowledging the applicants\u2019 entitlement to compensation has constituted an interference with the applicant\u2019s possessions.",
