Having regard to the material in the case file and the parties\u2019 submissions, the Court notes that the issues raised by the present complaint are similar to those examined in the Huseynli and Others judgment (cited above). Based on the analysis of international and domestic reports, the Court concluded in that case that at the material time, opposition activists had been routinely deterred or prevented from participating in demonstrations; punished for having done so; and punished for advocating or showing support for those demonstrations (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 85-91). Furthermore, having examined the circumstances in which the applicants had been arrested and convicted, the Court concluded that the administrative proceedings against them had equally sought to deter them from protesting and to punish them for doing so (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 92-97). Consequently, the Court concluded that the applicants\u2019 arrests and administrative detention had amounted to arbitrary and unlawful interference with their right to freedom of assembly (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 98-101).",

Firstly, in the present case it appears that the applicant\u2019s affiliation with the opposition was likewise generally known, as he was a member of the PFPA, he had participated in various protests held by the opposition, and he had promoted public participation in the demonstration of 11 March 2011 on online social networks (see paragraphs 6-7 and 9-10 above). Secondly, the applicant was arrested on dubious grounds shortly before the demonstration of 11 March 2011 (see paragraphs 16-17 above). Thirdly, the domestic courts failed to establish facts that were disputed between the parties \u2013 the police and the applicant \u2013 by carrying out an objective and thorough examination. They ignored the applicant\u2019s submissions that the arrest had been politically motivated, and merely recapitulated the circumstances and the charges as presented by the police (see paragraphs 24, 26, 29-30 and 32-33 above).",

The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment also apply to the present cases. In that judgment, the Court noted in particular that (i) there were serious concerns about the foreseeability and precision of the legislation governing public assemblies, and about the possibility of public assemblies being arbitrarily banned or dispersed (ibid., \u00a7 55); (ii) there were doubts about the credibility of the formal grounds, namely Article 310.1 of the CAO, relied on by the authorities to arrest and convict the participant in an unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 62); (iii) the authorities had failed to take into consideration the fact that notification had been given about the demonstration (ibid., \u00a7\u00a060); (iv) there had been a lack of relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration, which the organisers had intended to be peaceful and which had been conducted in a peaceful manner (ibid., \u00a7 61); and (v) there had been no acknowledgment that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration had itself been protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 63). Having regard to the above, in the Gafgaz Mammadov case the Court found that the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of assembly had been violated on account of the dispersal of the demonstration and his arrest and conviction.",

As in those cases, the applicants in the present cases were arrested and convicted following an accelerated procedure under the CAO. They were held in police custody without any contact with the outside world, presented with charges without receiving a copy of the administrative-offence reports, and shortly afterwards (in a matter of hours) taken to a court and convicted. The applicants were not given an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of their own choosing at the pre-trial stage or for the proceedings before the respective first-instance courts. In the cases where the applicants had not refused Statefunded legal assistance, representation by the appointed lawyers was purely formalistic: they did not put forward any arguments, either making no submissions on the applicants\u2019 behalf or just simply orally asking the court \u201cto consider the young age of the applicant\u201d. Neither the first-instance courts nor the Court of Appeal took note of the applicants\u2019 arguments, in particular the argument that there had been a political motive behind the arrest (an argument pertinent to the first applicant\u2019s first application), or the argument that the demonstrations had been peaceful in nature (an argument pertinent to the second applicant\u2019s application and the first applicant\u2019s first application). The courts failed to clarify the facts that were disputed between the parties: they merely accepted the police\u2019s versions of events and the charges as presented in the relevant police reports. In view of the similarities between the present cases and Huseynli and Others and Gafgaz Mammadov, the Court sees no particular circumstances that could compel it to deviate from its findings in those judgments, and finds that the administrative proceedings in the present cases, considered as a whole, were not in conformity with the guarantees of a fair hearing (compare Huseynli and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 110-35, and Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74-96; compare also Ibrahimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 93-115).",

The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in those judgments also apply to the applicants\u2019 present cases. In those judgments the Court noted that the measures applied by the authorities, namely arrest and custody followed by several days of imprisonment, had pursued aims unrelated to the formal grounds relied on to justify the deprivation of liberty, and implied an element of bad faith and arbitrariness (see Huseynli and Others, cited above, \u00a7 147, and Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 108). Having regard to the above, the Court found that the deprivation of liberty of the applicants in Huseynli and Others and the applicant in Gafgaz Mammadov had been arbitrary. In view of the similarities between the present cases and Huseynli and Others and Gafgaz Mammadov, the Court sees no particular circumstances that could compel it to deviate from its findings in those judgments, and finds that in the present cases both applicants\u2019 right to liberty was breached for the same reasons as those outlined above.",
