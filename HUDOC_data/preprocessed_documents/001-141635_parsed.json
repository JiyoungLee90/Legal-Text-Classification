In the text of its judgment, the court referred to an extensive array of evidence, including the applicant\u2019s statements given on 23 and 24 December 2002. The court noted that those statements were consistent with other evidence, and that there was no indication that they had been extracted by ill-treatment or otherwise in defiance of the applicant\u2019s will or in breach of his procedural rights. They therefore had to be preferred over the applicant\u2019s submissions at the trial.

In addition, the windows, which had non-transparent panes of glass, barely let in daylight. With only two small electric bulbs, artificial light was also very poor. As a result, it was very difficult to read or write in the cell. The food was also inadequate. To support the applicant\u2019s nutritional needs his mother had to send in regular food parcels, containing such basic products as tea, pasta, cereals and canned meat and vegetables.

Before that time he had only been questioned as a witness, and had not given any self-incriminating statements. Upon his arrest, the applicant had been duly notified of his right to access to a lawyer, and had waived that right in writing in respect of his questioning of 24 December 2002. There was therefore no breach of the guarantees against self-incrimination on account of the use by the judicial authorities of his confessions of 23 and 24 December 2002 as a basis for his conviction. Moreover, these confessions were corroborated by other evidence. Once the applicant had requested to be legally represented, a lawyer of his choosing had been admitted to the proceedings. Throughout the investigation stage the applicant had been represented by lawyers of his choosing, whose omissions, if any, could not be imputed to the Government. In addition, each time the applicant had found himself without a legal representative before questioning or another investigative activity, he had been notified that he was not obliged to take part in it, unless he voluntarily consented.",

France, no.\u00a029731/96, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR 2001II). As a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided from the first time a suspect is questioned by the police, unless it can be demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were compelling reasons to restrict this right (see\u00a0Salduz\u00a0v. Turkey\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7\u00a055, 27\u00a0November 2008). The right to mount a defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (ibid.). While a defendant in criminal proceedings may, under various circumstances, waive his right to legal representation, such a waiver may not run counter to any important public interest, must be unequivocally established, and must be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with the waiver\u2019s importance (see, for instance, Sejdovic v. Italy\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2006II).",

However, as follows from his submissions, by that time he had already been in police custody for nearly three weeks (since 5 December 2002) during which time he had been de facto treated and questioned as a suspect. The Court observes that these submissions are consistent with the documents on file. In particular, it is noteworthy that the Regional Court calculated the applicant\u2019s prison sentence from 5 December 2002, thus indirectly acknowledging that he was already in custody on that date. There are also records of the applicant\u2019s questionings of 14 and 15\u00a0December 2002 concerning his involvement in the revolutionary movement, and of his participation in a confrontation with another person associated with this movement on 17 December 2002 (see paragraphs 10-11 above). It is noteworthy that there is no evidence that the applicant was ill-treated by the police and that de jure at the material time he was questioned as a witness only. At the same time, according to the explanations given by the Kakhovka police officers interviewed in connection with the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment allegations, on 14 and 15 December 2002 he was in fact in their custody as \u201can arrestee under investigation\u201d (see paragraph 27 above).",

It follows that he should have been apprised of his right to legal assistance and given access to a lawyer no later than the time of his first questioning after his arrest. On the facts of the case, the authorities did not provide the applicant with an opportunity to have access to a lawyer between 5 and 23 December 2002, for no compelling reason. It follows that the information given by the applicant during the period at issue was obtained in breach of his right to mount a defence.",

Nevertheless, on 24 December 2002 the applicant was again questioned without a lawyer. It is true that the applicant gave written consent to be questioned without a lawyer. However, it is noteworthy that he did so just minutes after expressing the wish to have a lawyer and before having access to one (see paragraph 14 above). He also did not explain why he changed his mind so quickly. In these circumstances the Court cannot accept that the applicant, who was in police custody at the material time and had not consulted a lawyer, unequivocally waived his right to legal assistance in respect of the questioning of 24 December 2002, as required by Article 6 of the Convention. It follows that the information divulged by him during the questioning at issue was likewise obtained in breach of his right to mount a defence.",

The Supreme Court of Ukraine likewise rejected the applicant\u2019s relevant complaints raised in his appeal.
