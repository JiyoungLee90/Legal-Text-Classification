The case originated in an application (no. 12312/05) against the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro lodged with the Court, under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”), by Kin-Stib, a limited liability company based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (hereinafter “the first applicant”), and, at that time, a national of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, Mr Milorad Majkić (hereinafter “the second applicant”), on 6 April 2005.
Both applicants were represented by Mr C. Leon, a lawyer practising in . The Government of the State Union of Serbia and  and, subsequently, the Government of Serbia (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
The applicants alleged that they had suffered violations of Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention, as well as a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, stemming from the partial non-enforcement of an arbitration award rendered in their favour.
On 4 May 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
As of 3 June 2006, following the Montenegrin declaration of independence,  remained the sole respondent in the proceedings before the Court.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 12 October 1989 the first applicant concluded a joint venture agreement with the “Hotel Intercontinental Belgrade”, concerning the setting-up and joint operation of a casino on its premises.
At that time, the said hotel was owned by “Generalexport” (hereinafter “Genex”), a major “socially-owned company” (see paragraph 70 below) with an annual turnover in excess of seven billion US Dollars (“USD”).
Article 12 of the joint venture agreement provided that the first applicant was entitled to collect 80% of any earnings made as part of the joint operation of the casino in question, whilst Genex had the right to collect the remaining 20% thereof. Article 19 of the agreement, however, stated that Genex would, in any event, be entitled as guaranteed minimum earnings to a payment of no less than USD 500.000 annually by the first applicant.
The casino opened in October 1990. By 1993, however, it closed due to various financial difficulties, and a number of disputes between the parties followed.
In 1995 the first applicant brought proceedings against Genex before the Foreign Trade Arbitration Court of the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce (hereinafter the “”), seeking repossession of the casino as well as compensation for breach of contract.
On 10 April 1996 the , having resolved issues regarding the first applicant's status, ruled partly in its favour. Specifically, Genex was ordered to: (a) pay compensation in the amount of USD 1,999, 992, plus 6 % interest, on account of the first applicant's inability to operate the casino in question between 1 April 1995 and 31 March 1996; (b) allow the first applicant to retake possession thereof; and (c) effectively manage its operation for five years after reopening it. The sum of USD 1,999,992, i.e. USD 166,666 monthly, was arrived at by multiplying Genex's minimum annual earnings on the basis of the agreed ratio (see paragraph 9 above).
On 7 June 1996 the  in  ordered the enforcement of the arbitration award of 10 April 1996, in its entirety.
Following several suspensions and adjournments, on 15 October 1997 the National Bank of  informed the  that USD 1,672,437.06 had been transferred to the first applicant's bank account.
On 4 May 1998 the  ordered the payment of the remaining USD 618,542.23, together with the interest accrued.
By 6 May 1998 the debtors, Generalexport and International CG as two successor companies of the original Genex company, appear to have fully complied with this order.
On 22 March 2004 the first applicant requested repossession of the casino and sought to be allowed to effectively manage it for a period of five years after reopening it.
Following three oral hearings, on 28 May 2004 the  accepted this request and ordered the debtors to comply therewith.
On 30 November 2004 the Constitutional Court of the  dismissed the applicants' motion to order the full and effective enforcement of the arbitration award, stating that it did not have the competence, ratione materiae, to consider complaints alleging individual human rights violations.
On 3 December 2004 the  fined the debtors for their failure to comply with the repossession order and mandated repossession within an additional period of thirty days. Initially, the fine imposed was 45,000 Dinars (“RSD”) per debtor (approximately USD 770), but on 7 December 2004 this amount was reduced to RSD 20,000 each (approximately USD 340).
In 2005 the applicants filed a complaint with the Court of Serbia and .
Between 25 May 2005 and 24 October 2006 the  fined the debtors for their failure to comply with the repossession order on eight separate occasions. The fines imposed totalled RSD 320,000 (approximately USD 4,770).
On 24 October 2006 the  terminated the enforcement by means of imposing fines, noting that the maximum statutory amount had been reached in accordance with the Enforcement Procedure Act.
On 4 December 2006 this decision was confirmed.
On 30 July 2007 the  rejected the first applicant's subsequent request for it to impose additional fines on the debtors.
On 29 November 2007 this decision was confirmed.
On 10 March 2008 the  noted that on 9 August 2007 the Privatisation Agency had ordered the restructuring of the debtors and stayed the enforcement proceedings until the conclusion of this process.
In 1996 Genex instituted civil proceedings before the  in , seeking annulment of the arbitration award. Once again, it raised issues regarding the first applicant's status.
On 23 June 1997 the  rejected this claim, as did the  on 25 May 1997 and, ultimately, the Supreme Court of Serbia on 24 December 1997, at third and final instance.
On 5 February 2002 Generalexport and International CG filed a request for the reopening of the annulment proceedings.
Following two remittals, on 4 October 2006 the  rejected this request. In so doing, inter alia, it noted that the issues raised by the plaintiffs had already been considered, in one form or another, within the impugned annulment suit.
On 21 November 2007 the  confirmed this decision on appeal.
Following prior remittals, on 27 June 2001 the  ruled partly in favour of the first applicant. Generalexport and International CG were thus ordered to pay a total of USD 4,333,333.16, plus interest, on account of the first applicant's inability to operate the casino between 1 April 1996 and 31 May 1998.
On 6 September 2001 the  upheld this judgment, and it thereby became enforceable.
On 30 January 2002 the Supreme Court reduced the amount awarded to USD 1,083,332, plus interest. It estimated the lost earnings only on the basis of the respondent's minimum annual profit, as stipulated in the joint venture agreement (see paragraph 9 above).
In the meantime, on 24 September 2001, the first applicant sought enforcement of the judgment rendered on 27 June 2001, by means of a bank account transfer.
On the same day the  issued an enforcement order.
On 14 February 2002 the  terminated the enforcement proceedings. In so doing, it noted that, notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court had subsequently reduced the compensation awarded to USD 1,083,332, plus interest, approximately USD 700,000 in excess of this amount had already been transferred to the first applicant's bank account.
Following prior remittals, on 3 March 2005, and as rectified on 8 September 2005, the  ruled partly in favour of the first applicant. It thus ordered Generalexport and International CG to pay a total of USD 1,426,666.60, plus interest, on account of the first applicant's inability to operate the casino between 1 June 1998 and 1 April 2001. This time, the  also estimated the lost earnings on the basis of Genex's minimum annual profit only, as stipulated in the joint venture agreement.
On 21 February 2006 the  upheld this judgment, and it thereby became enforceable.
On 27 June 2007 the Supreme Court rejected the appeals on points of law (revizije) filed by the parties.
In the meantime, on 24 March 2006, the first applicant sought enforcement of the judgment rendered on 3 March 2005 by means of a bank account transfer.
On 27 March 2006 the  issued an enforcement order.
The enforcement proceedings would appear to be still pending.
In January 2002 the Second Public Prosecutor's Office in  charged the second applicant with forgery. In particular, it was alleged that he had made fraudulent statements regarding the first applicant's status under Congolese law, and had forged several powers of attorney in order to get involved in the above proceedings.
On 17 January 2002 the second applicant was placed in pre-trial detention but by 22 February 2002 he was released.
On 9 July 2004 the Second Municipal Court in  terminated the criminal proceedings against the second applicant. It stated that the first applicant was indeed a registered entity under Congolese law, that the impugned powers of attorney were authentic, and that there was no evidence whatsoever indicating that the second applicant had committed a crime.
Additional criminal proceedings, concerning related “fraud and forgery issues”, were terminated on similar grounds by the District Court in  on 7 November 2003.
On an unspecified date the Hotel Intercontinental was renamed the Hotel Continental.
On 8 November 1994 the second applicant bought from G.J., at that time the first applicant's sole owner, “a part of the first applicant” consisting of all of its rights and pecuniary interests derived from the joint venture agreement of 12 October 1989. The second applicant thus became “the owner of this part of the company”, as well as the first applicant's “Director and President” in all matters related to Generalexport.
On 6 April 2002 the High Court in  confirmed that, as of 19 May 1996, the second applicant held 25% of the first applicant's shares and was its Deputy General Manager.
The first applicant's Articles of Association, as certified in December 2002, reaffirmed the above and noted that the second applicant was indeed the first applicant's sole representative in respect of all matters concerning the joint venture in question.
On 21 December 2005 the Ministry of Finance issued a statement informing the public that an exclusive gambling licence had been granted to a company called Grand Casino. The licence had been issued for a period of ten years in respect of a casino to be located in .
On 27 August 2007 the first applicant informed the Privatisation Agency about its outstanding claim in respect of Generalexport and International CG.
On 24 March 2008 the first applicant sent another warning letter to the Privatisation Agency.
On 29 April 2008, however, International CG, following a public competition organised by the Privatisation Agency, sold some of its real estate to NBGP Properties. One of the buildings sold was the Hotel Continental. Article 8.1.2 of the sales contract provided, inter alia, that the buyer shall not, within a period of seven years, be entitled to mortgage or otherwise burden the hotel, unless it obtains prior written authorisation to this effect from the Privatisation Agency.
Despite the restructuring and sale of some of their assets, Generalexport and International CG are themselves still socially-owned companies.
Article 4 § 1 provides that enforcement proceedings are urgent.
Articles 16 and 17 § 1 explicitly recognise arbitration awards as valid legal bases for the formal institution of enforcement proceedings.
Article 23 states that enforcement proceedings shall also be carried out at the request of a claimant not specifically named as the creditor in the final court decision, providing the former can prove, by means of an “official or another legally certified document”, that the entitlement in question has subsequently been transferred to it from the original creditor. This provision shall, mutatis mutandis, also be applied in respect of a debtor who has not been specifically named as such in the final court decision at issue.
Articles 202-207 regulate enforcement in situations where a debtor's compliance is required: in particular, where a debtor has been ordered to perform a certain action, desist therefrom or accede thereto. The system provides for the successive imposition of fines up to a certain maximum which, if the debtor happens to be a natural person and the fines cannot be enforced, may ultimately be converted into a number of prison days.
The substance of Article 37 of this Act corresponds, in the relevant part, to that of Article 23 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act 2000 referred to above.
The Enforcement Procedure Act 2004 entered into force on 23 February 2005, thereby repealing the Enforcement Procedure Act 2000. In accordance with Article 304, however, all enforcement proceedings instituted prior to 23 February 2005 are to be concluded pursuant to the 2000 legislation.
Pursuant to Article 483 § 1, an arbitration award has the force of a final judgment in respect of the parties to the proceedings, unless the arbitration agreement itself provides for an appeal to a higher instance.
Articles 484, 485 and 486 set out the deadlines and the specific grounds for the annulment of an arbitration award, which can only be sought through the institution of a separate civil suit before a “regular” court of law.
Article 64 § 1 provides that a domestic arbitration award shall have the force of a final domestic judgment and shall be enforceable.
This Act entered into force in June 2006 and thereby repealed the above-cited provisions of the Civil Procedure Act.
Articles 19-20e set out the details as regards the restructuring of companies about to be privatised. This restructuring, however, is optional and a company may be sold without having been restructured if the Privatisation Agency so decides.
Article 20ž provides, inter alia, that all enforcement proceedings instituted in respect of companies undergoing restructuring shall be stayed until the conclusion of this process.
The relevant provisions of this legislation are set out in the R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia judgment (nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, §§ 68-76, 15 January 2008).
