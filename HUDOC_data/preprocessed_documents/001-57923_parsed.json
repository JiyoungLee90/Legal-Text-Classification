The one capacity she does have, I accept, is the desire to be a parent, to have the child, but the accomplishment of that ambition is, I fear, demonstrated to be beyond her.

The Court accepts that in this sensitive domain of family law there may be good reasons for opting for an adjudicatory body that does not have the composition or procedures of a court of law of the classic kind (see, mutatis mutandis, the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, p. 23, para. 53).

However, the first applicant had claimed paternity on 27 January 1988; and even at the time of this initial children\u2019s hearing he was living with the second applicant and was, especially in his capacity as her representative, closely associated in the attempt to obtain access to A. (see paragraphs 7, 13, 14 and 15 above). Thereafter the two applicants acted very much in concert in their endeavour to recover the custody of and have access to A., not only in the framework of the legal proceedings before the children\u2019s hearing and the Sheriff Court but also in their dealings with the social work department of the local authority (see paragraphs 18 and 20 to 25 above).

She could not, so they argued, be said to have suffered a loss of real opportunities; nor was the present case comparable to other cases concerned with children in which damages had been awarded for feelings of frustration and helplessness (such as O. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 9 June 1988, Series A no. 136-A, or Keegan v.

Whilst the present applicants may not have suffered a loss of real opportunities to the same extent as previous applicants who had been denied access to a proper remedy, it cannot be affirmed with certainty that no practical benefit could have accrued to them if the procedural deficiency in question had not existed. More importantly, the Court accepts that some, although not the major part, of the evident trauma, anxiety and feeling of injustice experienced by both applicants in connection with the care proceedings is to be attributed to their inability to see the confidential documents and reports in question. An award of financial compensation is therefore warranted. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, as it is required to do under the terms of Article 50 (art. 50), the Court awards the applicants jointly the sum of \u00a38,000.",

In our view, however, these differences in legal circumstances cannot be overlooked. They are crucial for the purposes of Article 8 (art. 8), in that it is precisely because of the significant difference in legal status of the two applicants that the incidence of the admitted procedural deficiency in the care proceedings is not the same for each of them.",

It is undeniable that even before their marriage in April 1990 (see paragraph 32 of the judgment) the two applicants were leading a joint \"family life\" and that, at least as from Mrs McMichael\u2019s acceptance of Mr McMichael\u2019s paternity (18 February 1988 - see paragraph 18 of the judgment), that joint family life included their shared parental relationship with A. To this extent, therefore, Article 8 (art. 8) was applicable to Mr McMichael as well as Mrs McMichael. Where we part company with our colleagues is in relation to the finding that there was an unjustified interference with Mr McMichael\u2019s family life as a result of his not being granted access to certain documents submitted in legal proceedings to which he was not a party and had not even asked to be a party.",

These were the Court\u2019s conclusions when unanimously rejecting Mr McMichael\u2019s claim of discrimination under Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention (see paragraph 98 of the judgment). Indeed in his case this requirement would not appear to have been onerous. As the judgment points out in the context of his claim under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), at least as from 18 February 1988 an application by him for an order for parental rights would have been dealt with speedily - and presumably without difficulty - given the mother\u2019s consent (see paragraph 77 of the judgment).",

We find it inconsistent and contrary to the logic of the Convention system that the constraints of a legal status which are judged, in terms of possible discrimination under Article 14 (art. 14), to have an objective and reasonable justification should not be similarly justified in relation to enjoyment of the right to respect for family life under Article 8 (art. 8) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 31, para. 68). Furthermore, as far as access to documents in the care proceedings to which Mrs McMichael was a party are concerned, we do not perceive why, if Mr McMichael chose not to seek recognition of his rights under Scots law as a natural father, as he could have done, he should be more deserving of protection under Article 8 (art. 8) than under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). Even if the domestic law and practice concerning the procedural position of parents taking part in care proceedings had been in conformity with the standards of the Convention, in the absence of a parental order in his favour Mr McMichael would still have had no entitlement to access to the documents. Article 8 (art. 8) should not be so construed as to prevent the imposition of reasonable conditions, in the interests of the mother and child, on participation by natural fathers, even when recognised as such, in care proceedings with consequent entitlement for them to have access to sensitive material such as social and medical reports.",
