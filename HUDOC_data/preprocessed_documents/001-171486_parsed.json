The Court notes that the issues raised by the applicant are essentially the same as those examined in the Gafgaz Mammadov case (cited above). The facts of that case closely resemble those of the present case. The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment also apply to the applicant\u2019s first case. In that judgment, the Court noted in particular the existence of serious concerns about the foreseeability and precision of the legislation governing public assemblies, and about the possibility of public assemblies being abusively banned or dispersed (ibid., \u00a7\u00a055); doubts about the credibility of the formal ground, namely, Article\u00a0310.1 of the CAO, invoked by the authorities for arresting and convicting the participant in an unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 56 and\u00a062); the failure by the authorities to take into consideration the fact that the demonstration had been notified (ibid., \u00a7 60); the lack of relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration, which had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner (ibid., \u00a7 61); and the lack of any acknowledgment that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64). Having regard to the above, in the Gafgaz Mammadov case the Court found that the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of assembly had been violated on account of the dispersal of the demonstration and his arrest and conviction.",

The Court observes that the organisers did not give the BCEA prior notice of the demonstration of 26 January 2013. Examining the applicant\u2019s argument that no such notice was required by law, the Court notes that, indeed, under Article 5 \u00a7 IV of the Law on Freedom of Assembly, no prior written notification was required for \u201cspontaneous assemblies\u201d. Nevertheless, the applicant has failed to sufficiently substantiate her allegation that the demonstration in which she participated was a spontaneous one. In such circumstances the Court is ready to accept that the dispersal of the demonstration of 26 January 2013 was lawful (compare Ibrahimov and\u00a0Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11, 69252/11 and 69335/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 11 February 2016).",

Therefore, for the same reasons as those outlined in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment, the Court concludes that the authorities in the present case have not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration (see Gafgaz\u00a0Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 61). The authorities also failed to acknowledge that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64).",

She was ordered to pay AZN 2,000, whereas at the material time the minimum wage in the country was AZN 93.5. The measures applied in the present cases and the fear of sanctions that could potentially be applied against participants and organisers of unauthorised peaceful assemblies undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of assembly. This deters other opposition supporters and the public at large from attending demonstrations, and, more generally, from participating in open political debate.",

The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in that judgment also apply to the present cases. In that judgment, the Court noted in particular that the administrative proceedings had lacked the necessary safeguards and guarantees, as there had been a lack of adequate time and facilities to prepare the defence (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 78-81); the strong reliance by the domestic courts on the administrative offence report prepared by the police and the statement given by a police officer (ibid., \u00a7 85); the utter disregard by the domestic courts of the important factual circumstances and legal issues of the case, inter alia, the peaceful nature of the unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7 86); an absence of legal assistance at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a090-91); the failure to provide the applicant with an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of his own choosing (ibid., \u00a7 92); and the formalistic representation by a State-funded lawyer (ibid., \u00a7 93). Having regard to the above, the Court found that the administrative-offence proceedings against the applicant in the Gafgaz Mammadov case, considered as a whole, had not been in conformity with the guarantees of a fair hearing.",

The applicant did not give any details as to the effects or duration of the alleged ill-treatment, including the time she had allegedly been kept handcuffed. In addition, her submissions are not supported by relevant medical evidence objectively confirming any injuries. It is true that she asked the Court of Appeal to order a forensic examination. However, even though that request was disregarded, the applicant could have attempted to secure medical evidence of her own accord in order to substantiate her allegations before the Court. In particular, she could have attempted to be examined by a doctor after her release from the five day\u2019s administrative detention. She also failed to secure any witness statements or any other evidence. The only piece of evidence submitted by the applicant is a photograph allegedly taken at the time of her arrest in the course of the dispersal operation. The applicant is shown with both arms twisted behind her back by two police officers and with her body bent as a result of that restraint. The photograph does not suggest that the measure used against the applicant was excessive or constituted treatment contrary to Article 3.",
