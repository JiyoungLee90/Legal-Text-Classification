The case originated in an application (no. 25763/10) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Igor Vieru (“the applicant”), on 21 April 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr R. Zadoinov, a lawyer practising in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent ad interim at the time, Ms Ruxanda Revencu.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his rights guaranteed under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention had been breached as a result of the abusive quashing of a final judicial decision issued in his favour.
On 30 May 2016 notice of the complaint concerning Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was given to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Chişinău.
In 2007 criminal proceedings were initiated in respect of the applicant on charges of unlawful appropriation of property. On 25 April 2008 the prosecutor discontinued the proceedings in respect of the applicant for lack of evidence. A civil party, G., appealed against that decision.
On 26 June 2009 the Centru District investigating judge dismissed G.’s appeal and upheld the prosecutor’s decision of 25 April 2008. That decision was final.
G. lodged an extraordinary appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice. On 26 January 2010 the Supreme Court of Justice allowed G.’s extraordinary appeal, quashed the decision of the investigating judge and remitted the case for a fresh examination to the investigating judge. The court argued that the investigation had not thoroughly examined G.’s complaints.
The relevant domestic law was summarised in Beșliu v. the Republic of Moldova (no. 28178/10, §§ 9-10, 9 July 2013).
