Bulgaria, no. 9808/02, \u00a7\u00a056, 24 March 2005). However, the personal attendance of the defendant does not take on the same crucial significance for an appeal hearing as it does for the trial hearing (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7\u00a060, ECHR 2006-...). Regard must be had in assessing this question to, inter alia, the special features of the proceedings involved and the manner in which the defence's interests are presented and protected before the appeal court, particularly in the light of the issues to be decided by it (see, among many other authorities, Metelitsa v. , no.\u00a033132/02, \u00a7\u00a027, 22 June 2006; Belziuk v.\u00a0Poland, judgment of 25 March 1998, Reports 1998II, \u00a7 37, and Botten v.\u00a0Norway, judgment of 19 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I, \u00a7\u00a039). Where an appellate court has to examine a case as to the facts and the law and make a full assessment of the issue of guilt or innocence, it cannot determine the issue without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused for the purpose of proving that he did not commit the act allegedly constituting a criminal offence (see Dondarini v. San Marino, no. 50545/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 6 July 2004, and Hermi, cited above, \u00a7 64).",
