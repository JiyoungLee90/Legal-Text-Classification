In particular it was suspected that Mr EMP organised, financed and managed, directly or indirectly a network of companies situated in various states (San\u00a0Marino, Italy, Malta, Portugal (Madeira) and Vanuatu) which were all traceable to one source namely, San Marino Investimenti S.A. (hereinafter \u201cS.M.I.\u201d). According to the applicants, Mr EMP owned S.M.I.\u2019s entire capital stock which was instrumental to the accomplishment of a series of investment and fiduciary operations (operazioni fiduciarie) the aim of which was to allow a number of Italian clients to launder money coming from illicit sources (by impeding the identification of the real source of the money entrusted to it by means of a double system of fiduciary mandates (mandati fiduciari)). The group of co-accused were suspected of having, through such network, abusively supplied investment services contrary to the legal requirements as provided in the relevant Italian law (Testo Unico Della Finanza) and of having abusively carried out financial activities without being in possession of the necessary economic and financial requisites and the relevant registration as required by Italian law (Testo Unico Bancario).",

In particular the Commissario considered that those crimes were also punishable under San Marino law. It therefore ordered, inter alia, an investigation in respect of all banks, fiduciary institutes and trust companies in San Marino. The purpose was to acquire information and banking documents (inter alia, copies of statements showing transactions and movements, cheques, fiduciary dispositions (disposizioni fiduciarie) and emails) related to a number of named current accounts in specified institutes as well as any other current account which could be traced back (riferibile) to S.M.I, held by all banks and fiduciary institutes in San Marino, which were directly or indirectly involved with the company or physical persons mentioned in this decision. In reaching that decision the Commissario bore in mind the relevant articles of the Bilateral Convention on Friendship and Good Neighbourhood between Italy and San Marino of 1939, law no. 104/2009, the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, and San Marino\u2019s commitment to international organs such as the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL) as well as Article 36 of law no. 165/05 which provides that banking secrecy cannot be held against the criminal justice authorities and Article 13 of law no. 104/2009 according to which the act of acquiring copies of documentation amounts to seizure.",

They alleged a violation of the principles contained in the San Marino Declaration on Citizens\u2019 Rights and Fundamental Principles (hereinafter \u201cthe declaration\u201d). In particular they contended that the principle that crimes had to be punishable under the law of the requested state had not been respected, that there had been a violation of both Italian and San Marino law, and they noted the absence of the fumus delicti and of any link between the crimes at issue and the position of the applicants. Moreover, given that many such complaints by persons in similar situations had already been declared inadmissible by the domestic courts for lack of standing - them not being the persons charged and therefore not the direct victims of the seizure - the applicants further complained that Article 30 (3) of law no. 104/2009 was not compatible with the principles laid down in the Declaration, in so far as it had been interpreted as not protecting or recognising the right to lodge a complaint by anyone who was subject to coercive measures of seizure of documents (related to their interests) as a result of an exequatur decision.",

The court noted that the applicants had been served with a notice of the exequatur order and had exhausted pleas available in law in that respect (hanno esperito le impugnazioni previste dalla legge). It further noted that an exequatur decision may only be challenged by a person who is involved in the investigation being carried out by the requested authority, or by a third party who is not investigated but who has been subjected to the measure. A person, who, in consequence of the investigation, is involved in any way with the activity undertaken, may not be considered as an interested person since any breach of the rights or interests of such persons, resulting from the execution of the exequatur decision, must be raised in the ambit of the Italian jurisdictions. The court considered that as established by domestic case-law it was only after the finding of admissibility of the application that a judge had to set a time-limit for submissions. For the purposes of admissibility one had to verify, amongst other things, the juridical interest of the appellant. Moreover, any constitutional complaints could give rise to an assessment of such question by the competent court (Collegio Garante), following a referral, only if the original proceedings were properly instituted, and not where, because of a lack of juridical interest of the appellant, the application was inadmissible. In the present case the appellants were not interested parties in relation to the exequatur decision, but may only have an eventual interest in the effects of such execution, and thus they did not have juridical interest to challenge the said decision.",

Moreover, the seized documents were irrelevant for the purposes of ascertaining the existence of the crimes attributed to the accused, thus, the only purpose behind the seizure was to name the Italians who had had dealings with S.M.I. irrespective of any involvement they had had with the facts object of the letter rogatory. They further challenged the appeal decisions in so far as they were issued in breach of the rights of the defence, in particular as they were not allowed to present submissions as provided for in law, neither in respect of the challenge nor in respect of the constitutional complaint. Furthermore, the decisions had lacked reasons and made no reference to the actual position of the applicants and a lack of reasoning in respect of the rejection of the constitutional complaint was particularly detrimental as it did not allow a proper examination of the matter by the third-instance judge.",

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this criterion hinges on the idea that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court (see Korolev v. Russia\u00a0(dec.), no.\u00a025551/05, 1 July 2010). The assessment of this minimum level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Korolev, cited above, and Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no. 23563/07, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02012 (extracts)). The severity of a violation should be assessed taking account of both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above). Thus, the absence of any such disadvantage can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant (see Adrian Mihai Ionescu v. Romania (dec.) no. 36659/04, \u00a7 34, 1 June 2010, Rinck v.\u00a0France (dec.) no. 18774/09, 19 October 2010; and Kiousi v.\u00a0Greece\u00a0(dec.) no. 52036/09, 20 September 2011). However, a violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage without affecting pecuniary interests (see Korolev, cited above).",

Pointing to Article\u00a030\u00a0(3) of law no. 104/2009 on international letters rogatory - which provided that any complaint envisaged by domestic law against exequatur orders establishing coercive measures were to be admitted - the Government noted that the term \u201cinterested persons\u201d had necessarily to be interpreted as \u201cparties involved under the legislation on complaints envisaged by domestic law\u201d and they stressed that the special legislation on letters rogatory did not introduce any particular and special remedies regulated by specific rules. On the contrary, that legislation established that existing remedies should be used for that purpose and it described the specific rules of procedure to be applied for such remedies. The Government submitted two domestic judgments in the same context and concerning the same letters rogatory delivered in 2011 (judgments of the third-instance criminal judge of 2 March 2011 and 5\u00a0July 2011) which confirmed that law no. 104/09 was not intended to introduce a system of ad hoc remedies in relation to coercive measures in the ambit of letters rogatory, but simply referred to the system of remedies already envisaged in the Code of Criminal Procedure, which were available only to the parties involved.",

However, the Court would recall that it is not its task to substitute itself for the domestic jurisdictions. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see Anghel v. Italy, no. 5968/09, \u00a7 82, 25 June 2013). The Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, in the context of Article 6, inter alia, Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, \u00a7\u00a054, ECHR 1999I and S\u00e2mbata Bihor Greco-Catholic Parish v. Romania, no. 48107/99, \u00a7 64, 12 January 2010). The Court notes that the Government supported the interpretation of the domestic courts. It follows that it is not disputed that the procedure attempted by the applicant was not in fact available to him. It is also noted that the applicant\u2019s claims as to the constitutional legitimacy of such a finding were also rejected for lack of standing. The Court reiterates that the institution of proceedings does not, in itself, satisfy all the access to court requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, for example, Sukhorubchenko v. Russia, no. 69315/01, \u00a7 43, 10 February 2005), it follows from this that, contrary to what was submitted by the Government, the mere fact that the applicant instituted those proceedings, which were then rejected for lack of standing, does not in itself satisfy the requirement of effective control under Article 8.",

Similarly, while the Convention is incorporated in San Marino law and is directly applicable in San Marino, the Government have not furnished any example of a litigant having successfully relied on the Convention to apply to a domestic authority in order to obtain redress in similar circumstances. Moreover, it is unclear \u2013 and the Government have not explained \u2013 what procedure would have been followed and what would have been the legal effect of such a complaint (see also, Rachevi v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 47877/99, \u00a7 64, 23 September 2004). The Court considers that the Government should normally be able to illustrate the practical effectiveness of a remedy with examples of domestic case-law, but it is ready to accept that this may be more difficult in smaller jurisdictions, such as in the present case, where the number of cases of a specific kind may be fewer than in the larger jurisdictions (see Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no.\u00a055352/12, \u00a7 63, 23 July 2013). However, in the present case the exequatur decision affected more than a thousand persons (see paragraph 10 above) and the Government have not demonstrated at least one example of such a remedy being undertaken by any of the affected persons in the applicant\u2019s position. In any event, the Court has already held that a claim for damages against the State in an action before the ordinary courts is clearly distinct from \u2013 and should not be confused with \u2013 an application for judicial review. Accordingly, it would not have been a remedy capable of achieving the aim sought by the applicant of having the impugned search and seizure, or its consequences, annulled and could therefore not be regarded as an \u201ceffective review\u201d for the purposes of Article 8 (see, mutatis mutandis, Xavier Da Silveira, cited above, \u00a7 48; and Pruteanu v.

Thus, the Court finds that, despite the wide extent of the measure which had been applied extensively and across to all banking and fiduciary institutes in San Marino, the applicant did not have available to him the \u201ceffective control\u201d to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law and which would have been capable of restricting the interference in question to what was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

This in their view resulted in yet another denial of access to court in relation to this matter. They also considered that no sufficient reasons had been given for this denial, thus they were arbitrary and not fully motivated, unlike the situation in the case of N\u0103stase-Silivestru v. Romania (no. 74785/01, 4 October 2007). They further argued that the appeal judge had not even authorised the twenty day time-limit for the applicants to make submissions on the matter as provided for by law (Article 13 (4) of law no. 55/2003) having found that no such referral was possible in the absence of on-going proceedings - a finding which the applicants considered inappropriate given that the complaint was precisely the lack of access to court as a result of the interpretation of laws the constitutional legitimacy of which was being questioned. A decision on the constitutional legitimacy was even more relevant given that it did not appear that the matter had ever been examined by the constitutional jurisdiction (namely, il Collegio Garante della Costituzionalita` delle Norme) or the third-instance criminal judge.",

According to the Government\u2019s interpretation of the Court\u2019s case-law, the assessment during proceedings concerning constitutional legitimacy is not absolutely necessary, save in exceptional circumstances, for instance where an arbitrary refusal would make the main proceedings unfair. However, in this case, the refusal to start the procedure for the assessment of the constitutional legitimacy cannot be considered as arbitrary, as it was justified on the basis of the applicant\u2019s lack of entitlement to bring an action in the proceedings a quo. They considered that the denial by the San Marino criminal judges, based on such overriding considerations, was also in line with the relevant case-law, as well as with the judgments mentioned by the applicants since the latter referred to national proceedings in which there were no doubts as to the entitlement of the applicant with respect to the main proceedings.",

They considered that Article 6 in its criminal head should also apply to the present case as the Court\u2019s case law had established that Article 6 started to apply from the moment an individual\u2019s position was affected. That criterion had been fulfilled in their case given that they were affected by the measure despite not yet being under investigation. They contended that the act itself was aimed at naming persons involved with S.M.I, irrespective of their involvement with the facts object of the letters rogatory. Indeed the Commissario\u2019s decision had clearly stated that SMI\u2019s dealings suggested that the persons involved (the applicants took this to refer also to them) sought to escape anti-laundering verifications, a signal of the doubtful origins of legal titles (titoli). Similarly, the Commissario\u2019s subsequent decision had stated that the investigation could affect third parties who were not charged. The applicants therefore contended that the Commissario had aimed at obtaining coercively the information related to them, thus by-passing banking secrecy, with the aim of eventually charging other individuals. They claimed that the possibility under San Marino law for the judge to authorise the use of such documentation for purposes not related to the object of the letters rogatory, meant that proceedings against the applicants could be initiated on the basis of those documents, contrary to their right to the presumption of innocence and the right not to incriminate oneself, them being denied any procedural guarantees.
