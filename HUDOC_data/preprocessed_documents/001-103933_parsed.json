These men were not officers of the Malgobek ROVD, as they had claimed. A number of steps were taken to establish their identities, but they were all unsuccessful. The Court further notes that the applicant's allegation that the men could have been officers of the Kabardino-Balkaria RUBOP is not corroborated by any evidence. Moreover, despite being questioned on many occasions by the domestic investigators, the applicant advanced this version for the first time in his submissions to the Court dated 26 November 2008.",

However, the investigation obtained sufficient proof to conclude that at the time of the murder Mr Ye. had been in . No other incriminating evidence has been collected. In any event, Mr Ye. had quit the prosecutor's office in March 1999, that is, more than six months prior to the murder. Thus, the Court does not find that the question of Mr Ye.'s possible involvement in the applicant's brother's murder is in itself decisive as to whether the crime can be attributed to agents of the State.",

According to the established case-law of the Court, the first sentence of Article 2 \u00a7 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction (see L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-III, \u00a7 36). The State's obligation in this respect extends beyond its primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions. Article 2 of the Convention may also imply a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28\u00a0October 1998, Reports 1998VIII, \u00a7 115).",

Thus, the Court notes that as can be seen from the transcript of the questioning of the Malgobek district prosecutor, the latter had indeed authorised Mr Tsechoyev's transfer to the Malgobek ROVD several weeks prior to the abduction (see paragraph 63 above).

The information supplied by the parties in respect of this aspect of the investigation leads the Court to conclude that the investigation has been ultimately ineffective in that it failed to follow an obvious line of inquiry to an extent which undermined its ability to establish the circumstances of the case and the person or persons responsible, and that the authorities have thus failed to carry out a thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements (see Kolevi v.
