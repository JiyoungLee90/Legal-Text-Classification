Both parties had repeatedly submitted numerous pleadings and applications which the court had been obliged to examine. No delays on the part of the court in examining these applications had been established. The parties had appealed against various interlocutory decisions on six occasions. Furthermore, as a result of the attitude of both parties, the issue of access to the child had become the main problem in the case. This had further protracted the proceedings.",

Another important factor in proceedings concerning children is that time takes on a particular significance, because there is always a danger that any procedural delay will result in the de facto determination of the issue before the court (see P.F. v.\u00a0Poland, no. 2210/12, \u00a7 56, 16 September 2014). Moreover, the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent who do not cohabit (see, for example, Kuppinger v.\u00a0Germany, no. 62198/11, \u00a7\u00a0102, 15 January 2015).",

Nevertheless, the applicant\u2019s wife failed to fully comply with this order. On 20 February 2009 the applicant lodged an enforcement request, asking the domestic court to impose a fine of PLN\u00a01,000 on her.

Having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s enforcement request led to a decision setting a time-limit for the mother to comply with the contact order on pain of a fine. In accordance with the provisions of domestic law as applicable at the material time, if the child\u2019s mother had failed to comply with this decision, upon another request from the applicant, the domestic court would have imposed the fine on her and would have set another time-limit (see paragraph 62 above).

It is all the more pressing in cases such as the present one, where the passage of time may also have an impact on the outcome of a pending custody dispute. Even though, as argued by the Government, the applicant in the present case was not entirely deprived of contact with his son, he experienced considerable difficulties in having regular and uninterrupted contact with M. in the course of the pending divorce and custody proceedings. The Court further notes in this connection that at the material time, the parents\u2019 relations with M. were being assessed by the experts for the purposes of compiling a report on the family\u2019s situation (see paragraphs 31-32 above).",

A substantial part of this period \u2013 approximately eighteen months - elapsed awaiting the preparation of the expert reports (see paragraphs 28-32 and 3637 above). The second report could not be completed in the end, as the applicant\u2019s wife failed to attend the scheduled appointments, but the domestic court failed to take any measures to discipline her or the experts.
