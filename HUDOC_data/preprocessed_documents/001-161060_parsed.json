When questioned, X stated that he had met Mr Ofitserov and Mr Navalnyy at the Governor\u2019s office and had complained to them that Kirovles was making losses because of falling timber prices and a lack of customers, among other reasons. Mr Navalnyy had later returned to him with the idea of setting up a trading intermediary, VLK, to bring customers to Kirovles, and they had concluded the contract. He indicated that although VLK had paid average market prices for the timber, he had later realised that their commission and the terms of supply had cost Kirovles extra, making it unprofitable. He had therefore terminated the contract. X further stated that when concluding the contract he had been under the impression that Mr Navalnyy had been acting in his official capacity at the Governor\u2019s office, and that as a State enterprise director he had to comply with the decisions of regional government. Two other former Kirovles employees were questioned, Ms\u00a0B. and its deputy director Z. They confirmed that although VLK had paid average market prices, Kirovles could have increased its margins by selling the timber directly and it had therefore made a limited profit on these sales.

Kirovles and VLK\u2019s accounts were examined, and three reports were ordered from experts in accounting, finance and economics. It follows from the parties\u2019 submissions that the following witnesses were also questioned. Witness Mr A., Chief of the Kirov Regional Forestry Department, made a statement about how the contract between VLK and Kirovles had been concluded and how the first applicant and X had been at odds. Witness Mr K., Deputy Chief of the Kirov Regional Forestry Department, stated that the first applicant had insisted on an independent audit of Kirovles and proposed restructuring it to prevent financial manipulation by X. Seven other witnesses, all managers of VLK, gave details about VLK\u2019s work to find customers for Kirovles in accordance with the contract. Based on this evidence, the investigators found that there was no case against the applicants.",

Criminal courts are obliged to establish the facts of the case relevant for the assessment of the legal responsibility of the accused as accurately and precisely as possible, and they cannot present established facts as mere allegations or suspicions. This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third parties, though if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those accused in the trial before it. Even if the law expressly states that no inferences about the guilt of a person can be drawn from criminal proceedings in which he or she has not participated, judicial decisions must be worded so as to avoid any potential prejudgment about the third party\u2019s guilt in order not to jeopardise the fair examination of the charges in the separate proceedings (see Karaman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06465).",

Where the effect of pleabargaining is that a criminal charge against the accused is determined in an accelerated form of judicial examination, this amounts, in substance, to a waiver of a number of procedural rights.

If the nature of the charges makes it unavoidable for the involvement of third parties to be established in one set of proceedings and those findings would be consequential on the assessment of the legal responsibility of the third parties tried separately, this should be considered as a serious obstacle for disjoining the cases. Any decision to examine cases with such strong factual ties in separate criminal proceedings must be based on a careful assessment of all countervailing interests, and the co-accused must be given an opportunity to object to the cases being separated.",

It notes, however, that Article 90 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as worded at the material time, expressly afforded the force of res judicata to judgments even if issued in accelerated proceedings (see paragraph 79 above). Moreover, by stating that \u201cCircumstances established in a judgment ... shall be accepted by a court ... without additional verification\u201d, it set forth the rule whereby not only a finding of guilt of an accused but also findings of fact would formally have potential prejudicial effect. Even though in accordance with Article 90, a judgment cannot predetermine the guilt of those who have not participated in the criminal case under consideration, the fact that the circumstances established in the judgment against X had the force of res\u00a0judicata in effect contravened that prohibition.",

As noted above, his conviction was based on the version of events formulated by the prosecution and the accused in the plea-bargaining process, and it was not required that that account be verified or corroborated by other evidence. Standing later as a witness, X was compelled to repeat his statements made as an accused during plea-bargaining. Indeed, if during the applicants\u2019 trial X\u2019s earlier statement had been exposed as false, the judgment issued on the basis of his plea-bargaining agreement could have been reversed, thus depriving him of the negotiated reduction of his sentence. Moreover, by allowing X\u2019s earlier statements to be read out at the trial before the defence could cross-examine him as a witness, the court could give an independent observer the impression that it had encouraged the witness to maintain a particular version of events. Everything above confirms the applicants\u2019 argument that the procedure in which evidence had been obtained from X and used in their trial had been suggestive of manipulation incompatible with the notion of a fair hearing.",

Over the next two years the inquiry stopped and restarted several times, but in 2012 it was resolutely reopened under the direct orders of Mr\u00a0Bastrykin, the Chief of the Investigative Committee.

We also voted with the majority as regards Article 7 of the Convention. However, we are unable to agree with our colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 18 of the Convention is inadmissible. Our colleagues considered that, given the findings made under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, it was not necessary to examine the applicants\u2019 other complaints under Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention. They were not, however, content to follow the same approach on Article 18 of the Convention, choosing instead to dismiss that complaint as inadmissible. We respectfully disagree.",

That provision states simply that \u201c[t]he restrictions permitted under [the] Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed\u201d. However, the preparatory work on the provision shows that it was drafted as a defence against abusive limitations of Convention rights and freedoms and thus to prevent the resurgence of undemocratic regimes in Europe. Article\u00a018 of the Convention was intended to provide Europe with the new approach needed in the \u201cbattle against totalitarianism\u201d, premised on the understanding that States could always and would always find excuses or reasons to limit, restrict, and ultimately hollow out individual rights and freedoms: the public interest in \u201cmorality, order, public security and above all democratic rights\u201d can all be abused for this purpose. Thus, an early version of the provision, proposed by the Legal Committee to the Consultative Assembly, proscribed \u201cany restriction on a guaranteed freedom for motives based, not on the common good or general interest, but on reasons of state\u201d. This version of Article\u00a018 of the Convention was part of the universal limitations clause that was, at an early stage of the Convention\u2019s drafting, introduced to apply to all Convention rights and freedoms.",

This application of the provision is also reflected in the Court\u2019s practice, though findings of a violation of Article 18 are rather rare, given the exacting standard of proof applied as a result of the presumption that States comply with their Convention obligations in good faith. The Court has nonetheless found a number of violations of Article 18 of the Convention. One example is the Court\u2019s 2012 Lutsenko\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine judgment, where it found that the criminal prosecution of the applicant had not only been initiated in order to bring him to justice for a suspected criminal offence, but also \u201cfor other reasons\u201d, inter alia to punish him for asserting his innocence and going to the media in order to contest the allegations made against him. Another example is the 2014 Ilgar Mammadov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan case. There, the applicant was called in for police questioning on the day after posting a blog entry providing information about riots which the authorities had wanted to keep from the public. Criminal proceedings were then begun against him. Given the absence of \u201cobjective information giving rise to a bona fide suspicion against the applicant\u201d, the Court considered it sufficiently proven that \u201cthe actual purpose of the impugned measures was to silence or punish the applicant for criticising the Government and attempting to disseminate what he believed was the true information that the Government were trying to hide\u201d. There are also several other examples of judgments in which the Court applied Article\u00a018 of the Convention to politically motivated proceedings. While rare, the application of the provision to such proceedings is nonetheless confirmed by the Court\u2019s case-law.",

Of course, we note that Article 18 cannot be invoked to combat abuse of power in every possible form. The Court \u2013 and indeed the text of Article\u00a018 itself \u2013 makes it clear that the provision enshrines an accessory right which must be invoked together with another Article of the Convention. However, it is important to note that this other Article need not have been violated. The question at issue in the present case is whether Article\u00a018 can be invoked together with any Convention right, or only with those that explicitly provide for justified restrictions. In its past case-law, the Court has explicitly permitted the invocation of Article\u00a018 together with Article 5 of the Convention, Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention. However, the Court also seems to have allowed Article 18 to be invoked together with one of these three provisions and other Convention rights, for example Article 6 of the Convention. Furthermore, the drafting history of Article 18 would indicate that its application was not intended to be limited to those provisions of the Convention containing an explicit restriction clause. Instead, as per its ratio conventionis, it applies to limitations on all Convention rights, with the exception of those absolute rights that do not permit limitation and to which it therefore cannot logically apply, for example those under Article 3.",

The criminal proceedings brought against him were not simply unfair and thus in violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1; there is also an arguable claim to the effect that the proceedings contained an abusive element. The domestic criminal proceedings at issue subjected a government-critical, prominent and politically active person to criminal prosecution in a manner that the majority in this case found to have \u201carbitrarily and unforeseeably construed [the domestic law] to the detriment of the applicants, leading to a manifestly unreasonable outcome of the trial\u201d (see paragraph 115 of the judgment). The effect of such a distortion of the law \u2013 the singling out of dissidents in order to silence them by means of criminal proceedings \u2013 is precisely the sort of abuse from which Article 18 is intended to provide protection. This is a separate issue from the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1, and it is an issue regarding which the applicants raised an arguable claim in Strasbourg. The Court was therefore under a duty to examine the allegation made. Rejecting the complaint as incompatible ratione materiae, as the majority do, flies in the face of the ratio conventionis and the previous case-law concerning Article\u00a018. For this reason, though we do not consider it our place to make a determination about the merits of the applicants\u2019 complaint in this context, we consider that the Court should have declared the complaint under Article\u00a018 of the Convention admissible.",
