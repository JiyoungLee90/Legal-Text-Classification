Russia (dec.), nos.\u00a038951/13 and 59611/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-96, 12\u00a0May 2015).

In the latter respect, the Government submitted that the legal nature of the plot of land in question had been clearly defined in the lease agreement, which explicitly prohibited the construction of permanent structures on the land in question (clause 2.2.5) and stated that on termination of the lease all temporary structures were to be removed (clause 2.2.10). Therefore, taking into account the fact that the applicant\u2019s garage was located within a railway right of way and the explicit prohibition on constructing permanent structures on such land, there were no grounds to doubt that the applicant knew that the land belonged to the State. He must also have known that he had no right to acquire title to immovable property built on that land in disregard of the explicit prohibition on doing so.

Moreover, since 31 July 2007 the GSK had been breaching its obligation under the lease agreement to pay maintenance costs for the land occupied by the garages. The applicant should therefore have foreseen all the legal consequences and could not be considered as having suffered an excessive individual burden.",

The District Court further authorised the RZD to proceed with the removal of the garage if the applicant failed to comply with the judgment voluntarily. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s garage was demolished. This constituted an interference with his \u201cpossession\u201d.",

The Court considers that, being meant to ensure compliance with the general rules concerning the prohibition on any construction not related to the railway system on railway rights of way, the interference amounted to \u201ccontrol [of] the use of property\u201d (see Saliba v.\u00a0Malta, no. 4251/02, \u00a7\u00a035, 8\u00a0November 2005; Hamer, cited above, \u00a7 77; and Ivanova and Cherkezov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069).

Sweden (no. 1), 25 October 1989, \u00a7 57, Series A no.\u00a0163), sees no reason to doubt that the interference complained of was in accordance with Russian law since it had a clear basis in Article 222 of the Civil Code. Under that provision, anyone who has erected an unauthorised construction may not acquire ownership rights in respect of it and is obliged to demolish it (see paragraph 32 above). Nothing shows that this provision has been interpreted or applied by the domestic courts in an arbitrary manner. The Court therefore concludes that the measure complained of satisfied the requirement of lawfulness within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention.",

The Court notes in this connection that, according to the Government, in August 2013 the construction of the fourth main track of the Oktyabrskaya railway between Moscow and Khimki was completed on the land previously occupied by the garages of the GSK and was opened for circulation of the suburban electric train; and that in December 2014 noisereduction barriers were installed along the Oktyabrskaya railway line in the area of the Marfino residential district (see paragraph 28 above). In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Court finds that the measure complained of pursued a legitimate aim which corresponded to the general interests of the community, as envisaged in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",

The Court also observes that the sum that the applicant invested in the GSK allowed him to enjoy the use of the garage for the period of fifteen years. The Court considers therefore that in the particular circumstances of the present case the benefit for proper town and country planning and development and ensuring that no structures that were not related to the railway system were located within railway rights of way can be considered proportionate to the inconvenience caused to the applicant by the removal of his garage.",
