He submitted that he had been working at the Unit since 2000. Since 2001 he had been responsible for the provision of arms, receipt of information and organisation of field missions. Usually he remained on duty for twenty-four hours, after which he stayed at home for forty-eight hours. On 20 July 2004 officer M. had taken up duty at 8.30 a.m. On that date officer G., officer T. and officer Tut. had also been on duty. At 9 a.m. officers of the federal units of the Ministry of the Interior deployed in Ingushetia brought two detainees with black bags on their heads to the Organised Crime Unit. The officers were wearing masks and gave no information about the detainees, promising to provide it later. Officer M. made no entries in the register at that time. After waiting until 10 a.m., he asked the officers to provide him with the information concerning the detainees. They replied that they would obtain explanations from the latter and forward them to officer M. later. He did not know who the officers were, they were wearing camouflaged uniform. Officer M. also submitted that after the events of 21-22 June 2004 officers of the federal units were regularly stationed at the Organised Crime Unit. They would bring people there and question them. At approximately 1.40 p.m. on 20 July 2004 officer M. heard a loud noise on the staircase. After leaving his post, he saw two officers of the federal units lifting a man in dark clothes with a bag on his head. He asked them what was going on. They replied that the man had slipped on the stairs and fallen down. Having lifted him, they took the man upstairs. At approximately 2.50 p.m. the officers of the federal units left for a field mission, having informed officer M. that they had to fetch one more person who was an accomplice of those already brought to the Organised Crime Unit. At around 3 p.m. the officers returned. At 3.20 p.m. B., the Deputy Head of the Organised Crime Unit, called officer M. and told him to call an ambulance, which he did immediately. At 3.40\u00a0p.m. the ambulance arrived and, together with the doctors, officer M. went to the second floor and entered office no. 17. In the office medical assistant Kh. and Deputy Head B. were providing first aid to a man lying on the floor. The man, Mr\u00a0Bashir Velkhiyev as officer M. learned later, died before the arrival of the doctors, who pronounced him dead of heart failure. Then the doctors left and an investigative unit from the Nazran Prosecutor\u2019s Office arrived. In the evening the officers of the federal units arrived back at the Organised Crime Unit and took away the other detainee. As officer M. learned later, the detainee was the first applicant. Officer M. stated that he did not know who the officers were or to which particular unit they belonged. According to him, the officers of the federal units deployed in the Organised Crime Unit changed constantly and he was not personally acquainted with any of them. He did not know which officers had taken part in the detention of the first applicant and Mr\u00a0Bashir Velkhiyev either. He had not witnessed any beating or other forms of ill-treatment. He did not know where exactly the first applicant had been held, but assumed that it was somewhere on the first floor.",

They cordoned off the yard while officers of the federal units entered the house.

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see, among other cases, Aksoy v. Turkey, 18\u00a0December 1996, \u00a7\u00a064, Reports 1996-VI, and Mikheyev v.

Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries. The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities\u2019 reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities\u2019 conduct (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0358).",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee, as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

The wife was also an eyewitness to the search of the house and the abduction of her husband, and a day later buried him in the family cemetery. I do not agree that the situation of \u201cdisappeared persons\u201d can be automatically applied in this case. The scope of the present case differs substantially from cases where the \u201cdisappeared person\u201d test was applied (see Kurt v. Turkey, 25\u00a0May 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 130-134, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III; Gongadze v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, \u00a7 184-196, ECHR 2005-XI; and Luluyev and Others v. , no. 69480/01, \u00a7\u00a7 116-118, ECHR\u00a02006XIII). The finding of a substantive violation of Article 2 of the Convention does not cover, to my mind, the mental suffering of the abovementioned applicants, close relatives of Bekhan Velkhiyev. It is difficult to imagine that the loss of a close relative in the tragic circumstances of this case cannot form the basis for finding a separate violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
