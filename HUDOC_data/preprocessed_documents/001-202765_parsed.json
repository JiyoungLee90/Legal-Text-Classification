In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins, cited above, \u00a7 108).\u00a0Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to an assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants. The Court has already held that the taking of property without the payment of an amount reasonably related to its value would normally constitute a disproportionate interference (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0110).",

The Property Acts also provide, either indirectly or directly, for the payment of just compensation when owners are deprived of their property. Notably, the 1980 Property Act referred back to the Constitution in this regard, whereas the 2009 Property Act itself explicitly provides for just compensation when the owners are deprived of their property (see paragraphs 19-20 above). The 2000 Expropriation Act also provides for compensation (see paragraph 26 above). Lastly, the Coastal Zone Act also provided that lawful private owners of land in the coastal zone should be afforded compensation in the event of dispossession pursuant to the provisions on expropriation (see paragraph 23 above).\u00a0Therefore, while the relevant legislation allows for the State to become the owner of the land at issue, it also provides for the applicant\u2019s right to compensation in return.

It is unclear, however, what expropriation actually means in this context: the courts suggested that the applicant lost title ex lege, but it is also clear that further procedure was necessary to formalise the State\u2019s title, as well as to determine the compensation, and even after the court decisions it is suggested that dispossession through formal expropriation has not yet taken place. The Government\u2019s submission in this regard and the Coastal Zone Act provision also seem to imply that it could also be the case that no formal expropriation at all occurs, in which case the applicant would not receive any compensation, which runs contrary to all the other pieces of legislation providing for compensation in cases of deprivation of property. The Coastal Zone Act itself provides no details as to when, and if at all, the formal expropriation of land in the coastal zone is obligatory. Therefore, it is unclear if and when formal expropriation will take place. Furthermore, it is unclear in the instant case in respect of whom such expropriation would be undertaken, given that the applicant is no longer the owner of the land at issue.",
