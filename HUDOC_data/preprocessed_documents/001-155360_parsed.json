It is further observed that the Convention provides for a just satisfaction award only if the internal legislation does not allow for full reparation. It is noted in this regard that the internal law of the respondent State in the present case allows for full reparation of the amount the applicant paid to the plaintiff, that is of the pecuniary damage, by means of a counter-claim in the enforcement proceedings. The Court, however, reiterates that if the victim, after exhausting in vain the domestic remedies before complaining at Strasbourg of a violation of his rights, were obliged to do so a second time before being able to obtain from the Court just satisfaction, the total length of the procedure instituted by the Convention would scarcely be in keeping with the ideas of the effective protection of human rights. Such a requirement would lead to a situation incompatible with the aim and object of the Convention (see, for example, De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium (Article 50), 10 March 1972, \u00a7 16 in fine, Series A no. 14). The Court therefore awards the applicant EUR 1,133.31 for pecuniary damage.",
