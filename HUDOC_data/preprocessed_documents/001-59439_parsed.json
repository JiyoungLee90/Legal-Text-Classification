It observes that the hearings of 24 June 1993 and 27 April 1995 were postponed by reason of the lawyers\u2019 strikes. In this respect, it is to be recalled that a delay in the criminal proceedings caused by a lawyers\u2019 strike cannot be attributed to the State, whereas the period of time elapsed between the end of the strike and the new hearing is to be imputed to the conduct of the authorities (see the Portington v. Greece judgment of 23\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2633, \u00a7\u00a033). In the present case the following hearings were fixed respectively at 2 June 1994 and 21\u00a0March\u00a01996. The Court is not unaware of the complications which strikes may cause by overloading the list of cases to be heard by courts (see the Papageorgiou v. Greece judgment of 22 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2291, \u00a7 48), and has taken note that the first strike had been announced to be of indefinite duration. However, it considers that a delay of almost eleven months in scheduling the subsequent hearings is excessive and must be imputed, at least in part, to the State authorities. ",
