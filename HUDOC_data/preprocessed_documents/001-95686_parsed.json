In this connection, the Court notes that the use of an advocate in civil proceedings is not obligatory under the Finnish law, and it is therefore possible for any legally competent person to bring a civil action and pursue his or her own case before the court. Further, the Court notes that there appear to have been certain periods of inactivity while the cases were pending before the District Court. In this respect the Court observes the period of some eleven months which elapsed before the District Court between the applicant's submissions of 2 April 2002 and the court's requests of 7 March 2003 for clarification of his claims, as well as the time taken by that court, one year and three months, to deliver its judgment after the appellate court's decision to remit the case had gained legal force.",
