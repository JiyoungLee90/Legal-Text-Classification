It is also true that in certain exceptional cases the persistent use of insulting or provocative language by an applicant against the respondent Government may be considered an abuse of the right of petition (see, most recently, Duringer and Grunge v.\u00a0France (dec.), nos.\u00a061164/00 and 18589/02, ECHR 2003-II, as well as Stamoulakatos v. the United Kingdom, no. 27567/95, Commission decision of 9 April 1997; L.R. v.

Germany, no. 2625/65, Commission decision of 30\u00a0September\u00a01968, Reports 28, pp. 26-42). In the present case, however, the Court considers that although the statements made by the applicant\u2019s lawyer are inappropriate, excessively emotional and clearly regrettable, they do not amount to the circumstances of the kind that would justify a decision to declare the application inadmissible as an abuse of the right of petition (see, mutatis mutandis, Chernitsyn v.

In this context, the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent who do not cohabit (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102).",

For these reasons the Social Care Centre proposed that the enforcement proceedings be terminated. In my opinion, this clearly shows that the applicant himself was not sufficiently active in seeking contact with his children. Nevertheless, I believe that these arguments are not decisive in the circumstances of the case, particularly because  ratified the Convention only on 3 March 2004. This means that, according to the Court\u2019s competence ratione temporis, only the period from 3 March 2004, when Serbia ratified the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Jasi\u016bnien\u0117 v.

It should now be analyzed whether the respondent State, taking into account its margin of appreciation, took all necessary steps to implement within a reasonable time the final court\u2019s decision and did everything in their power that could reasonably have been expected of them. I fully agree with the Court\u2019s clear-cut case-law that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings, including the enforcement proceedings, is to be considered in the light of the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities, and also the importance of what is at stake for the applicant (see, among other authorities, Comingersoll S.A. v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, \u00a7\u00a019, ECHR 2000-IV). I also agree that Article 6 protects the implementation of final, binding judicial decisions, which, in States that accept the rule of law, cannot remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. Accordingly, the execution of a judicial decision cannot be prevented, invalidated or unduly delayed (see, among other authorities, Hornsby v. , 19\u00a0March 1997, \u00a7\u00a040, Reports 1997-II; Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2002-III, and Jasi\u016bnien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 41510/98, \u00a7\u00a027, 6 March 2003, etc). In custody cases, the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the litigation must be given extra weight. This means that it is essential that child custody cases be dealt with speedily (see Nuutinen v. Finland, no.\u00a032842/96, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2000-VIII), as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between children and parents who do not live with them (see, mutatis mutandis, Maire v. Portugal, no.\u00a048206/99, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2003-VII, and Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no.\u00a031679/96, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2000-I), although a delay at some stage may be tolerated if the overall duration of the proceedings cannot be deemed excessive (see, for example, Pretto and Others v. Italy, 8\u00a0December 1983, \u00a7\u00a037, Series A no. 71).",

The Social Care Centre also noted that the applicant himself could not be considered a positive influence on his daughter Z.F., which, in my opinion, is a very serious factor in balancing the interests of the parents and children involved. It is also established that on 22 February 2007 one of the daughters, Z.F., again went to stay with the applicant, but was returned to the mother\u2019s home.",

The factual circumstances of this case clearly show that the applicant had contact with his children since 2005 and even more, the children were actually living with him, in violation of the court order placing them in the mother\u2019s house. In these circumstances, another aspect could have had very detrimental effects \u2013 the mother could also have complained that the municipal court\u2019s order of 6 June 2000, placing the children with her, had remained unenforced, as the children had been actually or occasionally living with the applicant (see paragraphs 39-41 and 44).",

On 29 June 2001 the Municipal Court decided to impose the said fine and again ordered M.F. to respect the applicant\u2019s access rights; this decision was confirmed by the Municipal Court in February 2005.\u00a0On 3\u00a0March 2005 the Municipal Court ordered M.F. to pay 6,750 dinars in costs.",

On 20 April 2005 the Municipal Court found the applicant guilty of failing to pay child maintenance between 8 October 2001 and 8 March 2005 and sentenced him to four months in prison, suspended for one year. I note the applicant\u2019s argument that he was unemployed and was unable to pay child maintenance, but I consider that in such a situation the applicant ought to have applied to the court to have the maintenance order changed. The applicant\u2019s passivity cannot be seen as an appropriate contribution to the best interest of his children. As I understand it, the applicant had not only a right to contact with his children, but also a financial obligation to contribute to optimal living and educational arrangements for them.",

Therefore, there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this case. Taking into consideration the fact that the finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention was based on the same arguments, analyzed under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, and given in particular the applicant\u2019s genuine opportunities to see his children and even to live with them, relying on the fact that no irremediable consequences for the relationship between the children and their father can be discerned in this case, and also taking into account the active attitude of the Social Care Centre and the courts, I come to the conclusion that no separate examination is necessary under Article 8 of the Convention.",
