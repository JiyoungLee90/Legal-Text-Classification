However, having failed that, in July 2002, the Tax Authority (Skattemyndigheten) in Stockholm ordered him to submit his tax return within two weeks from receiving the order. As he did not comply with the order, the Tax Authority informed him that it would make a discretionary assessment of his income and, in October 2002, sent him a proposal for a discretionary assessment. The applicant was given two weeks to comment on it, but did not do so. In November 2002, the Tax Authority decided to maintain the proposal and, as it found no grounds for exemption, imposed tax surcharges on him. The applicant was informed that the taxes, tax surcharges and a delay charge amounted to, in total, SEK 232,572 (approximately EUR 27,000). This amount was to be paid by 26 February 2003. The Tax Authority\u2019s decision included information about how to request reconsideration or appeal against it.

He then stated that he would submit his tax return for the tax assessment year 2002 to the Tax Authority immediately and that he had also requested respite from payment of his taxes although the Tax Authority had not dealt with this request yet. Moreover, he claimed that it was utterly disproportionate to sell his home, which would entail serious economic, social and medical consequences for him and his wife. He had suffered from serious depression for some years, for which he had sought medical help in October 2002, and in February 2003 he had begun treatment.

Moreover, the Enforcement Authority was officially notified of the respite on Monday 8 September, five days after the decision had been taken, on Wednesday 3 September.

Moreover, the Court observes that the Enforcement Authority\u2019s procedure and all of the above decisions had their basis in Swedish legislation regulating the collection and enforcement of tax debts to the State, namely in the Tax Payment Act (Chapter 20, section 1, and Chapter\u00a023, sections 7 and 8) and the Enforcement Code (Chapter\u00a03, section\u00a023, Chapter\u00a04, section 10, Chapter 8, section 19, and Chapter\u00a012, sections\u00a01 and 11).

However, the Court observes that the documents submitted by the applicant in support of his claim are not sufficiently specific to substantiate that the evaluation of the market value of his property by an independent company in July 2003 was incorrect or inaccurate. Moreover, it notes that the Enforcement Authority rejected a first round of bidding, as the final bid was considered too low, and that in the second round of bidding, the final bid which was accepted amounted to 80% of the estimated market value. To the Court, taking into account also the higher risk for the buyer of the property under these circumstances compared to a sale on the open market, this must be considered to be within an acceptable margin, not raising an issue under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",

Moreover, he did not respond in any way to the repeated actions by the Tax Authority between July 2002, when it first ordered him to submit his tax return, and April 2003, when it reminded him of his duty to pay the tax debt established by the Tax Authority\u2019s discretionary assessment. The Court further observes that the applicant continued to remain passive after the tax debt had been transferred to the Enforcement Authority, of which the applicant was aware at least as from the end of April 2003 when an enforcement officer had come to his home for a pre-planned visit and he was absent. On this occasion, the officer had left a note for the applicant requesting him to contact the Enforcement Authority, which he failed to do.",

Thus, for more than one year, he neither sent a letter to the Tax Authority informing it of his illness, nor did he ask his wife to help him do so. He also did not contact a lawyer or accountant to deal with the matter on his behalf. It should be recalled that the applicant was the owner of a close company and thus it must be expected that he was aware of his statutory obligations and the likely consequences if he failed to fulfil them. The Court therefore agrees with the Government that the applicant had time and the opportunity to avoid enforcement measures being taken against him to ensure the payment of his tax debts.",

Likewise, enforcement measures are not automatically suspended when a debtor appeals against such measures (Chapter 2, section 19, of the Enforcement Code). While such mechanisms must be considered acceptable and falling within the State\u2019s wide margin of appreciation under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court considers that it is necessary that they are accompanied by procedural safeguards to ensure that individuals are not put in a position where their appeals are effectively circumscribed and they are unable to protect correctly their interests. The Court observes that such safeguards exist under Swedish law, inter alia, through the possibility to request the Tax Authority to grant respite from the payment of taxes (Chapter 17, sections 2, 2(a) and 3, of the Tax Payment Act). If such a request has been granted, no enforcement measures may be taken for the amount covered by the respite (Chapter 17, section 10, of the Tax Payment Act). Moreover, a debtor may request the Enforcement Authority to grant deferment of payment (sections 7 and 8 of the Debt Collection Act) or a stay on the enforcement measure (Chapter 8, section 3, of the Enforcement Code).",

On the same day, he also requested the Tax Authority to grant him respite from the payment of his tax debt as he intended to submit his income tax return for 2002. The applicant further asked the Enforcement Authority to provide him with a copy of the writ of execution so that he could appeal against it to the District Court, which indeed he did on 10 August 2003, after having received the decision.

The Court finds this rather remarkable, considering the obligation laid down in section 9 of the Enforcement Ordinance and the importance of the decision and the effects on the applicant\u2019s possibilities to appeal against it. This is particularly so as Chapter 12, section 11, of the Enforcement Code stipulates that property should be sold within four months of the decision to attach it. In any event, as noted above, the applicant was made aware of the writ of execution in July 2003 and received a copy of the decision at the beginning of August 2003, at which point he appealed against it. The Court observes that the District Court rejected the appeal on 28 August 2003. It thereby ensured that the writ of execution benefitted from judicial review before the public auction took place. The Court has regard though to the fact that the writ of execution had not gained legal force when the property was actually sold and that, on 15\u00a0September 2003, within the statutory time-limit, the applicant made a further appeal to the Court of Appeal.",

Upon appeal to the District Court, where the applicant submitted a medical certificate and stated that he had requested respite from the payment of his tax debt and would submit his tax return, the court, on 28 August 2003, upheld the Enforcement Authority\u2019s decision in full. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s request was dealt with expeditiously by the Enforcement Authority and the District Court, guaranteeing him access to court before the decision to sell the property was enforced by the public auction. Again, however, even though the law provides for further appeal to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, the applicant was effectively deprived of this right since the enforcement took place before the Court of Appeal could consider the appeal and it therefore struck the case out of its list of cases.",

The Government have acknowledged that, if the request had been dealt with, it might, directly or indirectly through further actions by the applicant, have influenced the Enforcement Authority\u2019s decision to sell the property. The Court does not consider that it is in a position to speculate about whether such a request would have been granted or not, or what a positive or negative decision would have led the applicant to do or how it might have influenced the Enforcement Authority in its decision to proceed with the public auction. It suffices for the Court to note that this error may have had an impact on how the case developed and showed a lack of due diligence on the part of the authorities.",

He also informed the Tax Authority of the urgency of the matter, albeit without stating that the date for the public auction had been set for 3 September 2003. A few days later, on 1\u00a0September, he sent another fax to the Tax Authority stressing that it was of the highest importance to him that the request be considered promptly. The Court finds that these repeated requests within a few days of each other and stating the urgency must be considered enough for the Tax Authority to have realised the importance of treating the request without delay. This is particularly so since the Tax Authority knew about the enforcement proceedings and since, according to Chapter 12, section 11, of the Enforcement Code, the sale of real property and site-leasehold rights should take place within four months of the attachment. Moreover, the Court observes that the Tax Authority and the Enforcement Authority have access to each other\u2019s databases (see above \u00a7 74) and the Tax Authority could therefore easily have verified the status of the enforcement proceedings concerning the applicant in the Enforcement Authority\u2019s database. It would then have seen that the public auction to sell the applicant\u2019s property was scheduled for 3 September 2003. The Tax Authority does not appear to have done so. As it was, the Tax Authority took two days to grant respite which, in the Court\u2019s opinion, under normal circumstances may be acceptable but in the particular circumstances of the present case, as set out above, was not sufficiently prompt, noting that the request was only granted on the same day that the public auction took place.",

It considers that, since the Tax Authority was not aware that the public auction was taking place on 3\u00a0September 2003, there was no special reason for it to inform the Enforcement Authority of its decision the same day by fax or a telephone call. As it was, the Enforcement Authority was officially informed of the decision on 8 September 2003. However, the Court stresses that, on the day of the decision, the Tax Authority registered the respite in the applicant\u2019s tax account in its database to which the Enforcement Authority had access. Consequently, the Enforcement Authority could have seen that respite had been granted if it had verified that account late on 3 September or the next day. In any event, it would have been after the sale had taken place. Here, the Court points out that the petitioner in the present case was the State, represented by the Enforcement Authority, following an enforceable tax debt submitted by the Tax Authority to the Enforcement Authority. In such a situation, the Court considers that it is not unreasonable to expect the authorities involved to keep each other informed about developments of direct relevance to the enforcement proceedings, such as a request for, and the grant of, respite. In the present case, there appears to the Court to have been a lack of effective communication between the two authorities. Moreover, the Court observes that the applicant, in his appeal to the District Court dated 3 August 2003 against the Enforcement Authority\u2019s decision not to stay the sale of his property, stated that he had requested respite from the payment of his tax debt. Thus, the Enforcement Authority was aware of this circumstance well before the public auction took place and could therefore reasonably have been expected to verify its state of proceedings and/or outcome directly with the Tax Authority before selling the applicant\u2019s property.",

Still, in its reply of 17 September 2003 to the District Court, in the proceedings relating to the applicant\u2019s appeal against the actual sale of his property at public auction, the Enforcement Authority included these previously discharged debts to justify the sale of the property despite the respite from payment of the tax debt.

To the Court, both the decision to uphold the sale and the ensuing eviction of the applicant appear excessive and disproportionate, especially since the applicant had other assets, such as a car, which could have been seized and sold to cover what little remained of his enforceable debts. This is particularly so because the authorities knew that the proceedings concerning the writ of execution were still ongoing and thus had not yet gained legal force.",

While this may have been in the interest of efficient enforcement proceedings, the Court is not convinced that the applicant\u2019s interests were adequately protected in view of this most extreme form of interference with his right to respect for his home. It notes that, on 6 October 2003, when the Enforcement Authority decided that the applicant should be evicted, it knew that the applicant had been granted respite from payment of his enforceable tax debt and that only a very minor debt remained enforceable. Furthermore, it knew that the applicant\u2019s appeal against the writ of execution was still pending before the Court of Appeal and that his appeal against the actual sale of the property was pending before District Court. Although the District Court rejected the appeal on 15 October 2003, a week before the actual eviction took place, the Court notes that this decision did not become final since the applicant appealed against it to the Court of Appeal within the statutory time-limit. Thus, the Court considers that, in order to ensure that the remedies and procedural safeguards existing in domestic law were in fact available and sufficient, not only in theory but also in practice (see, Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002VIII), the eviction should have been postponed until the underlying contentious issues had been resolved.",

They first noted that the applicant\u2019s tax debt had not been cancelled but that he only had been granted respite from the payment on 3 September 2003. This respite had lapsed in November 2003, after the Tax Authority had reconsidered its decision on the basis of the income tax return submitted by the applicant and calculated the applicant\u2019s taxes to SEK 78,000. Thus, the sale might still have taken place after this. Moreover, the Government considered that the property\u2019s value should be calculated on the basis of the evaluation made by an independent company at the time of the sale.",

Thus, the bill from the law firm for legal fees did not specify what legal costs were covered nor that the applicant had paid the bill. As concerned the hotel bills, the Government observed that they were addressed by the hotel to the local social authorities (Sp\u00e5nga-Tensta Stadsdelsf\u00f6rvaltning), not to the applicant. Turning to the eviction costs, the Government did not consider that there was a causal link, since the applicant had been informed of the date of the eviction in good time and could have avoided it by moving out of his own accord. As concerned the interest claimed, they noted that it had not been explained by the applicant and, in any event, they found that 8% was excessive. Moreover, the Government disputed in its entirety the applicant\u2019s claim for extra costs for the new property that he was renting since he had proved neither the monthly charges for his old property nor those of his new home.

The applicant is therefore entitled to compensation for pecuniary damage in so far as there is a causal link between the violations and the damaged suffered. The applicant must also substantiate the value of the damage suffered and costs incurred. For its part, the respondent State is under a legal obligation to put an end to the breach and make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach (see Iatridis v.

The Government has disputed this. The Court observes that, in cases where the interference in question has satisfied the condition of lawfulness and was not arbitrary, it has considered that compensation at the level of the market value of the property at the time of the interference was appropriate (see, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 148 and 257-258, ECHR 2006V). It sees no reason to make another assessment in the present case. Since the applicant\u2019s property was inspected by an independent company before the sale and at that point valued at between SEK 1,850,000 and SEK 2,150,000, the Court finds that the market value can reasonably be estimated at SEK 2 million. The reference made by the applicant to sales of equivalent properties between January and July 2002 is, in the Court\u2019s view, not reliable since none of those properties were the same as the applicant\u2019s property in size, age, condition or situation. It follows that the applicant should be compensated for the difference between the market value, SEK\u00a02\u00a0million, and the price at which the property was sold, SEK\u00a01,6 million, that is SEK 400,000.",
