They told him that they had adjustable explosive devices which could be fixed to the skin of selected victims so that the latter would be obliged to pay the money asked for in order to avoid the risk of an explosion entailed by removing a device without the instructions and equipment in the possession of those who had put it in place. At the end of April, two of these group leaders told him that they were thinking of a businessman, Mr Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Bult\u00f3 Marqu\u00e9s, on whom to use this device for the first time\u2019; (c) the statement made to the judge by Mr Francisco Javier Barber\u00e0 Chamarro, assisted by his lawyer (doc. no. 903): he admitted being a member of the Catalan National Liberation Army, working together with Mr Mart\u00ednez Vendrell, being in possession of arms and knowing of the existence of stocks of arms; (d) the statement made to the judge by Mr Antonino Messegu\u00e9 Mas, assisted by his lawyer (doc. no. 906): he belonged to the armed organisation, had been trained in urban guerrilla tactics by Mr Mart\u00ednez Vendrell and knew of the existence of a stock of explosives; (e) the official report on a search of the flat at no. 1 Pinos Street, Hospitalet de Llobregat (doc. no. 890), and from the file on the investigation a statement by Mrs Dolores Tubau Molas (doc. no. 904) to the effect that the defendant Barber\u00e0 Chamarro lived in the flat with other activists and that there were found there (inter alia) a transmitter, electronic equipment, lathes, tools and files containing press cuttings and information about a number of prominent people, and books on topography, the chemistry of explosives, and electronics; (f) the official report on a search of the flat at no. 27 Parlamento Street, Barcelona (doc. no. 892), occupied by Mr Antonino Messegu\u00e9 Mas and Mrs Concepci\u00f3n Dur\u00e1n Freixa (statement in doc. no. 908) and where a transmitter and receiver, medicines, wigs and stiff paper of the type used for national identity cards and for driving licences were seized; (g) the official report on the discovery of an arms dump and two radio transmitters at three places indicated by the defendant Barber\u00e0 (doc. no. 882); (h) the official report on the discovery of an explosives dump indicated by Mr Messegu\u00e9 and the destruction of the explosives on the spot (docs. nos. 833 and 899). The mere existence of this evidence, irrespective of its implications and the way in which it is assessed, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence relied on by the defendants Barber\u00e0 Chamarro and Messegu\u00e9 Mas, and we therefore reject grounds five and four respectively of their appeals; the facts established in paragraph 1 of the recital finding that they were directly and immediately involved in the homicidal operation must consequently be confirmed in toto. The description of the facts as murder under Article 406 para. 3 of the Criminal Code with an aggravating circumstance under Article 10 para. 6, which was allegedly incorrectly applied according to Barber\u00e0\u2019s sixth ground of appeal and Messegu\u00e9\u2019s fifth ground of appeal, was therefore correct and their appeals under section 849(1) of the Procedure Act must therefore be dismissed.\"",

The Court observes that the central investigating judge did not even attempt to hear Mr Mart\u00ednez Vendrell\u2019s evidence after the arrest of the applicants on 14 October 1980, not only to confirm his identification of them but also to compare his successive statements with theirs and arrange a confrontation with the applicants. Admittedly, the latter could also have requested an opportunity to examine him; but this does not exonerate the judge, having regard in particular to the specific circumstances referred to in paragraph 84 above. In the end, the applicants never had an opportunity to examine a person whose evidence - which was vital, as is clear from the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 27 December 1982 (see paragraph 31 above) - had been taken in their absence and was deemed to have been read out at the trial (see, mutatis mutandis, the Unterpertinger judgment previously cited, Series A no. 110, p. 15, para. 31): by the time the file was forwarded to the defence on 27 May 1981 for it to propose its evidence, Mr Mart\u00ednez Vendrell had absconded (see paragraphs 18 and 22 above).",
