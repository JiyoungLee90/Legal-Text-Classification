He also complained that his right to a fair trial had not been respected, in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1, since he was not informed promptly and in adequate time about the reasons for the prosecution against him. Moreover, relying on Article 8, he complained of a restriction on maintaining contact with his family members. Furthermore, relying on Article 13, he submitted that there had been a violation of his right to an effective remedy since his appeal against the decision of 23 July 2010 had been rejected before he had introduced his detailed written appeal.
