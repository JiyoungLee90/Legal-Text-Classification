Moreover, the contents of the police report give the impression that the relevant police department limited its search for the witnesses merely to the finding that they were, for a short period of time, outside of that particular department\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. In such circumstances, it is unclear why the trial court failed to follow up the matter. It is true that at the hearing of 27 August 2004 the defence did not object to those witnesses\u2019 statements being read out. However, at the hearing of 29 September 2004, in the light of the documentary evidence examined, the defence pointed out that the reason for their absence had not been established and asked that they be called again. In rejecting that request, the domestic court limited itself to stating that their statements had already been read out (see paragraph 15 above and compare Kostecki v. Poland, no. 14932/09, \u00a7 65, 4 June 2013). It does not appear, therefore, that the trial court subjected the reasons given for the non-appearance of the witnesses to careful scrutiny (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0122).",
