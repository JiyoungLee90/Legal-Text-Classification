In this respect the Court notes that the duty imposed by Article 8 does not create a general obligation on the part of a Contracting State to respect the choice by married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to accept non-national spouses for settlement in that country (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 33-34, \u00a7\u00a068). However, the removal of a person from a country where close members of his or her family are living may amount to an infringement of the right to respect for family life as guaranteed in Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Moustaquim v. Belgium, 18 February 1991, \u00a7\u00a036, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0193; see also \u00dcner v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 57, and Boultif v.

This report was the basis for the Migration Department\u2019s refusal of the applicant\u2019s request for a temporary residence permit. The Court draws attention to the national administrative law and practice of the domestic courts \n(see paragraphs 25-26 above) which provide that, as a rule, factual data which constitutes a State secret may not be used as evidence in an administrative case until it has been declassified. However in the present case the \u201csecret\u201d report was not only used as evidence, but, according to the information in the case file, it was also the sole ground for not granting the applicant a temporary residence permit. As a result, he was deported from . Moreover, the Government acknowledged that, when reaching their decisions, the administrative courts relied on that report but chose not to disclose the content thereof to the applicant, thus restricting his defence rights.",

First, there was no evidence that the applicant\u2019s stay in Lithuania had posed such a threat beforehand \u2013 in 2001 the authorities, after having examined his background, saw no reason to refuse him a temporary residence permit (see paragraph 8 above). It is not contested that the applicant had a previous conviction; however, as the Government noted in their observations, it was for theft and not for a crime related to national security. Moreover, that conviction had not been an obstacle for the applicant to obtain a temporary residence permit in 2001. Secondly, no objective materials verified by the domestic courts have been presented to the  to demonstrate that the domestic authorities had good reasons to suspect the applicant of being a threat to national security. From the foregoing, the Court finds that, in the case file before it, there are no documents allowing the Court to conclude that the applicant posed such a threat. Nonetheless, the applicant was deported and until 2099 is prohibited from re-entering , where his two children and wife, all of whom were Lithuanian citizens, live, which is also an important element for the Court to take into account when assessing the necessity of the interference and its proportionality.",
