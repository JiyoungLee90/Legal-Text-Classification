Thus it confirmed the fundamental role of these proceedings in the  legal system and practice. The importance of such a remedy in the specific field which is the subject of the present case is moreover illustrated by the three judgments of the Court of Cassation referred to in paragraph 15 above. They were all delivered in interlocutory proceedings, two of which resulted in the President of the District Court ordering the immediate release of the person concerned. In addition, in the proceedings concluded by the judgment of 9 January 1970, the State had argued that the President lacked jurisdiction; its objection was dismissed in accordance with a consistent line of cases decided in interlocutory proceedings and it did not appeal. The Koendjbiharie case also shows the extent to which the \"kort geding\" constitutes an obvious remedy in the field in question (see the Koendjbiharie judgment given this day, Series A no. 185-B, pp. 35-37, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 14).",

It did so, having regard to the importance of the principle in question, in spite of the statutory rule restricting the right of appeal to persons heard at first instance. Similarly, by a judgment of 29 March 1985 (NJ 1986, no. 242), it declared admissible, notwithstanding the express provisions of the law, the appeal against a decision ordering the provisional hearing of witnesses, on the ground that the appellant had not been heard first.",
