Moreover, the applicant submitted that the \u012ale Centre had limited space and was surrounded by a stone wall, which was topped with barbed wire. He provided some photographs, taken in 2012, that corroborated this submission. It could be seen from these photographs that the premises, although no longer in use, indeed were surrounded by a stone wall. The \u012ale Centre had been located on a hill in the middle of a forest, and was completely inaccessible by car in winter, autumn and spring.

The Court emphasises nevertheless that this question is not determinative of the issue. In this regard, the Court notes its case-law to the effect that a person could be considered to have been \u201cdetained\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 even during a period when he or she was in an open ward with regular unescorted access to unsecured hospital grounds and the possibility of unescorted leave outside the hospital (see H.L. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 92). The key factor in determining whether Article 5 \u00a7 1 applies to the applicant\u2019s situation in the \u012ale Centre is whether its management exercised complete and effective control over his treatment, care, residence and movement from 30 January 2002, when he was admitted to that institution, to 1 April 2010, when he was transferred to Lielb\u0113rze (ibid., \u00a7 91; D.D. v. , no. 13469/06, \u00a7\u00a0146, 14\u00a0February 2012; and K\u0119dzior v. , no. 45026/07, \u00a7 57, 16\u00a0October 2012 (not final)).",

Permission appeared to be conditional on the applicant\u2019s state of health and was provided only if he was accompanied by staff of the institution or by another patient. There is no information at the Court\u2019s disposal that the applicant had ever received permission to leave the centre with a staff member or another patient, or whether he had actually left it at any time between 30\u00a0January 2002 and 1\u00a0April 2010. The Government\u2019s reference to permission that had been granted to the applicant to leave the centre appears to be related to the period of his stay in the \u012ale Centre in Lielb\u0113rze and not while he was in the \u012ale Centre in \u012ale parish. Moreover, the Court notes that the custodial court established that the applicant\u2019s guardians at the material time, his wife and subsequently his son, had never taken him outside the \u012ale Centre. It sees no reason to question this finding. Moreover, it appears that his wife also limited the applicant\u2019s social contacts by at one point prohibiting the applicant from receiving other visitors without her; this is contrary to the Government\u2019s submission that he could freely meet other people. The Court further takes note of the applicant\u2019s submission, which remained uncontested by the Government, that whenever patients left the institution without permission they were taken back there by the police. This situation resembles that of Mr Stanev (see Stanev, cited-above, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 127, who had overstayed a leave of absence and the staff returned him to the home without regard to his wishes) and Ms\u00a0D.D. (see D.D. v. Lithuania, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 146, who had left the institution on her own and then was brought back by the police).

Whilst accepting that there are situations where the wishes of a person with impaired mental faculties may validly be replaced by those of another person acting in the context of a protective measure, and that it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the true wishes or preferences of the person concerned (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0130), the Court finds that this was not the applicant\u2019s case. The documents presented to the Court indicate that the applicant subjectively perceived his compulsory admission to the \u012ale Centre as a deprivation of liberty. Contrary to what the Government suggested, he has never regarded his admission to the institution as consensual, and has objected to it during his stay there. On a number of occasions the applicant applied to the custodial courts with a view to having his legal capacity reinstated (see paragraphs 32 and 38 above), submitting that this would allow him to leave the centre. In his further applications to the State authorities he explicitly stated that he had been placed in the \u012ale Centre against his will (see paragraph 34 above) and that he wished to have another guardian who would carry out his wish to be allowed to leave (see paragraph 38 above). The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s argument relating to the applicant\u2019s alleged refusal to move to another social care institution located in Iecava municipality in November or December 2010 (see paragraphs 26 and 117 above). However the Court considers that this refusal did not relate to his possible release from the \u012ale Centre in \u012ale parish, but rather his possible release from the \u012ale Centre in Lielb\u0113rze, where he was placed on 1\u00a0April 2010. By the same token the Court considers that the Government\u2019s reference to the telephone conversation of 26 March 2012 (see paragraphs\u00a058 and 121 above) is misconceived, since it did not attest to his wishes to reside in the \u012ale Centre in \u012ale parish but rather in Lielb\u0113rze.",

In that connection the Government have not shown that in the present case, on arrival at the \u012ale Centre in \u012ale parish or at any later date, the applicant agreed to stay there.

Having due regard to the parties\u2019 submissions and to the facts of the case, the Court has doubts whether the applicant could be considered as having been deprived of his liberty in the \u012ale Centre in Lielb\u0113rze. In this connection, the Court refers to the fact that the applicant acknowledged that the \u012ale Centre in Lielb\u0113rze had been an open institution. It further notes that he himself had refused to move to another care centre, namely to the Iecava branch, by pointing out that he was satisfied with his stay in the \u012ale Centre in Lielb\u0113rze (see paragraph 26 above). The applicant did not contest this before the Court. It is also important in this connection to note that the applicant did, in fact, leave the \u012ale Centre in Lielb\u0113rze on several occasions to spend some time outside after Mr Petrovs had been appointed his guardian (see paragraph 58 above). Finally, the Court notes that the applicant did not approach any domestic authority with a view to his release from the \u012ale Centre in Lielb\u0113rze, contrary to his express opposition to his confinement in the \u012ale Centre in \u012ale parish (see paragraph 134 above). In this connection, the Court notes that under the applicable law (see paragraph 75 above) the applicant could complain about any breaches of his rights. The Court observes that there is no indication in the case material that the applicant approached any domestic authority to allege a breach of his rights in the \u012ale Centre in Lielb\u0113rze, for example, as concerns arbitrary or indeed any deprivation of his liberty. The Court cannot but note that he did exercise this right while residing in the \u012ale Centre in \u012ale parish.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that in deciding whether an individual should be detained as a \u201cperson of unsound mind\u201d, the national authorities are to be recognised as having a certain discretion, since it is in the first place for them to evaluate the evidence adduced before them in a particular case; the Court\u2019s task is to review under the Convention the decisions of those authorities (ibid., \u00a7 40; and, more recently, Stanev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0155). It is not the Court\u2019s task to reassess various medical opinions, which would fall primarily within the competence of national courts; however, it must ascertain for itself whether the domestic courts, when taking the contested decision, had at their disposal sufficient evidence to justify the detention (see Herz v.

However, the objective need for accommodation and social assistance must not automatically lead to the imposition of measures involving deprivation of liberty. The Court considers that any protective measure should reflect as far as possible the wishes of individuals capable of expressing their will. Failure to seek their opinion could give rise to situations of abuse and hamper the exercise of the rights of vulnerable persons. Therefore, any measure taken without prior consultation of the interested person will as a rule require careful scrutiny (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 153).",

In any event, the Court reiterates that the mental condition of a person must be established at the time he is deprived of liberty (see O.H. v. Germany, no.\u00a04646/08, \u00a7\u00a078, 24 November 2011) and, in the present case, the experts examined the applicant on 19\u00a0April 2000 in the course of the incapacitation proceedings, while the decision to place him in the \u012ale Centre was taken almost two years later, on\u00a021 January 2002. Similarly, the scarcely-reasoned decision by the Social Assistance Authority to include the applicant in the list of people waiting for a referral to a social care institution was adopted on 28\u00a0November 2000, therefore any examination of the applicant\u2019s state of health carried out for the purposes of that decision cannot be considered as an \u201cobjective medical opinion\u201d for deprivation of liberty taking place more than one year later, let alone an examination that did not establish the existence of \u201ca mental illness\u201d.",

It is true that it contained a conclusion that in view of the applicant\u2019s state of mental health he could be placed in an institution for people with mental disorders. However, the Court considers that such a conclusion is not sufficient. For the purposes of the Winterwerp test it has to be reliably shown that the applicant was suffering from a \u201ctrue\u201d mental disorder at the time he was placed in the institution. In the medical certificate of 17 January 2002 there was no mention that the applicant was suffering from any illness, let alone that he suffered from any mental disorder at all.",

Indeed, there is no information as concerns his behaviour before he was placed in the \u012ale Centre; the mere fact that prior to his placement in the social care home he had been admitted to the psychiatric hospital is insufficient in this regard. The Court considers that the Government\u2019s reference to the information which related to later events, namely from 2007 to 2011 (see paragraph 119 above), is also not sufficient to prove that the severity of the applicant\u2019s disorder warranted his confinement in 2002.

Nor was any consideration given to a possibility of treating the applicant as an outpatient (ibid., \u00a7 60) or to other less restrictive means of social assistance and care.

However, in the present case the courts were not involved in deciding on the applicant\u2019s placement at any time or in any way. It appears that in situations such as the applicant\u2019s Latvian law does not provide for automatic judicial review of the lawfulness of admitting a person to and keeping him in an institution like the \u012ale Centre. In addition, a review cannot be initiated by the person concerned if that person has been deprived of his legal capacity. In sum, the applicant was prevented from independently pursuing any legal remedy of a judicial character to challenge his continued involuntary institutionalisation. This again confirms a lack of an effective regulatory framework in this area (see paragraph 151 above).",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the Constitutional Court in Latvia is empowered to repeal legal provisions which it finds unconstitutional, but not to adopt new legal procedures or to close an alleged legislative gap (see Liep\u0101jnieks v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a037586/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a073 and 75, 2 November 2010). This conclusion is further supported by the  ruling of 27 December 2010, whereby some legal provisions of the Latvian Civil Law relating to the legal capacity of individuals were declared null and void with effect from 1 January 2012. Parliament therefore had to come up with a legislative solution to comply with the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling and to establish a system of partial legal capacity for individuals in . This was done two years after the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling and the new regulation is applicable from 1\u00a0January 2013.
