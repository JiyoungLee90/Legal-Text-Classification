Following an application by the applicant to have his contact time increased, the Family Court held on 16 January 2001 an oral hearing, joined the proceedings on contact to the proceedings on custody rights previously initiated by Ms K. in 1999, and commissioned an expert opinion with regard to the custody of D. On 1 October 2001 the applicant requested that the Family Court impose a fine on Ms K., because she was not cooperating. On 16 November 2001, after the appointed psychology expert had informed the Family Court that he considered that contact with the father was in the child\u2019s best interest, the parties concluded an in-court settlement according to which contact between the applicant and his son should be re-established.

Accordingly, there was no basis for joint custody. A transfer of custody to the father would not solve the problem, only shift it. On 22 October 2002 the Family Court granted Ms\u00a0K. custody while rejecting her prior application for a suspension of contact; it granted the applicant contact with his son for six hours each week.

It found that, according to Ms K.\u2019s submissions and a report by the treating paediatrician and psychotherapist Dr D., the child showed mental abnormalities after contact with the applicant.

According to a medical certificate issued by a psychologist dated 7 January 2008, Ms K. suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder manifesting itself in uncontrollable agitation patterns, palpitations, feelings of panic, trembling, nausea and feelings of helplessness and despair. This clinical picture raised serious doubts as to her ability to properly prepare the child for contact meetings between himself and the applicant.

It was not reasonable to act counter the child\u2019s wishes; it was preferable to initiate therapeutic measures.

It considered that because of the massive and continuing conflict between the parents, the child would experience a serious conflict of loyalty if contact was enforced. This would seriously jeopardise his welfare. The court further considered that Ms K., because of her own stress disorder, which had been established by medical certificates, was not able to prepare the child for contact meetings with the applicant properly. As had already been pointed out by the court-appointed expert in 2002 (see paragraph 9 above), contact without a minimum of cooperation between the parents would put serious strain on the child. This should be avoided considering his ongoing therapeutic treatment. In view of the lack of co-operation from Ms K., it had to be expected that forced contact would again traumatise the child. Consequently the child\u2019s well-being required the suspension of the applicant\u2019s contact rights for three years in order to allow the child to undergo trauma therapy (Traumatherapie).",

It observed that the child, when heard by the Family Court on 8 January 2008 during the custody proceedings, had clearly stated that he currently did not wish to see his father. By a letter to the guardian ad litem dating from 2008, the child had stated that he did not wish to discuss this issue further, having already expressed his opinion five times. The Youth Office had confirmed on 22\u00a0June 2007 that D. wanted to be left in peace and that he had not wanted to see his father, as the latter always \u201cobliged him to go to the Youth Office\u201d. This was in line with D.\u2019s statement to his paediatrician in 2007. These statements demonstrated that D. had established an association between his father and the court hearings, which he disliked. Only a period of respite could give D. the feeling that he could decide on his own whether he wished to see his father. Furthermore, this period of time would also allow Ms K. to reflect on her behaviour. She should be aware of the fact that D., when reaching adolescence, would be in urgent need of his father as a counterbalancing authority figure. The applicant\u2019s own submissions did not lead to different conclusions. The conflict of loyalty to which D. was exposed was certainly not exclusively imputable to Ms K. Furthermore, it would undoubtedly not be compatible with the child\u2019s welfare to separate him from both parents and to place him in a boarding school, as had been suggested by the applicant. Referring to its decision on custody rights given on that same day, the Court of Appeal lastly observed that D. was developing in a positive way.",

In this regard, the Court notes that in his applications and submissions the applicant made factual statements not only with regard to the contact proceedings, but also with regard to the custody proceedings.

In the present case, having regard to the age of the expert opinion on which the Family Court relied \u2013 some seven years \u2013, the submissions of the director of the kindergarten, according to which further contact with the applicant would have been beneficial to the child (see paragraph 20 above), and the fact that already in 2007 the Youth Office had recommended to obtain an expert opinion because of the contradictory accounts regarding the child\u2019s situation (see paragraph 24 above), the Court is not convinced that there was a sufficient evidential basis to assess whether the suspension of contact had been in the child\u2019s best interest without obtaining such an expert opinion.",

Taking into account Ms\u00a0K.\u2019s overall conduct in the proceedings and having regard to the importance of the subject matter, the Family Court should not have been satisfied, in the circumstances, with relying on that private medical attestation without having at its disposal an expert opinion or, at least, without having had the benefit of direct contact with Ms K., when finding that it was the fact that Ms K. suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder which prevented her from preparing the child for contact with the applicant.

It relied, in particular, on a letter by the child to his guardian ad litem dating from 2008, the Youth Office\u2019s statement of 22\u00a0June 2007 and the child\u2019s paediatrician\u2019s statement of 2007 and thus relied on statements which dated between eighteen and twenty-four months back at the time of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision. It further relied on the child\u2019s statement in its hearing before the Family Court in January 2008. As regards the issue of hearing the child in court, the Court observes that as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them, including the means used to ascertain the relevant facts (see Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32-33, \u00a7 33; and Sahin v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a030943/96, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2003VIII). In this connection, the child had last been heard sixteen months earlier by the Family Court with regard to the question of custody. In the meantime, on 30 January 2009 the expert had stated that contact with the applicant would not jeopardise the child\u2019s welfare. The Court, taking into account the child\u2019s declaration 16 months earlier that it did not want to go to court anymore (compare paragraph 26 above), is not convinced that hearing testimony of the child or obtaining new statements by the guardian ad litem, the Youth Office or the child\u2019s paediatrician would not have produced relevant information of the child\u2019s present attitude. It is thus of the opinion that the Court of Appeal overstepped its margin of appreciation when reaching its decision without obtaining fresh statements by the parties involved.",

Even though the first set of contact proceedings had been instigated in 1999 (see paragraph 7 above), they were terminated on 22 October 2002, when the Cologne Family Court issued a decision concerning contact (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). The proceedings at issue were started with the child\u2019s mother\u2019s request to suspend the applicant\u2019s contact rights dated 20\u00a0June 2005 (see paragraph 12 above). Within the limits of these proceedings, on 18 January 2006 the applicant applied for a new contact regulation.

With regard to the length complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, the Court notes that the applicant had access to the claim for just satisfaction, which became available to him under the transitory provision of the Remedy Act upon its entry into force on 3\u00a0December 2011. The Court has previously found that the Remedy Act was in principle capable of providing adequate redress for the violation of the right to a trial within a reasonable time and that an applicant could be expected to make use of this remedy, even though it became available to him only after he had lodged his complaint with the Court (see Taron v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), 53126/07, \u00a7\u00a7 40-43, 19 May 2012). The Court considers that the applicant has not submitted any reason which would allow the conclusion that the just satisfaction claim in respect of the alleged unreasonable length of the court proceedings would not have had a reasonable prospect of success if pursued by the applicant (see Kuppinger, cited above, \u00a7 126). The mere fact that the Government contested that the length of proceedings had been excessive is not sufficient to call into question the effectiveness of that legal remedy.",
