It had a predecessor and was continuing its activities. The court described the founding of UMO Ilinden in 1990 and its unsuccessful attempt to register in 199091 (see paragraph 10 above). It further found that UMO Ilinden had split in 1994, the radicals remaining on one side and the more moderate members forming two separate organisations: UMO Ilinden\u00a0\u2013 Democratic Action and UMO Ilinden \u2013 Blagoevgrad. Most of the applicant party\u2019s current leaders, including Mr Ivan Singartiyski (the second applicant) and Mr Kiril Ivanov, had been members of these two organisations, which had merged and, after an unsuccessful attempt to register as an association at the , had managed to register as a political party at the Sofia City Court. It could thus be concluded that the applicant party was not a novel organisation, but was closely connected with the former unregistered association UMO Ilinden. The two had almost the same name and the same persons were their leaders and members. Moreover, the second applicant and another leader of the applicant party had intimated in newspaper interviews that they considered the applicant party and UMO Ilinden as one and the same organisation. The court therefore concluded that the activities of the applicant party\u2019s predecessor organisations should be taken into account for purpose of assessing its constitutionality.",

Therefore, the \u2019s finding that the applicant party was not a novel organisation and had a predecessor, UMO Ilinden, was logical. UMO Ilinden\u2019s splitup in 1994 had produced two organisations: UMO Ilinden \u2013 Democratic Action, headed by Mr Ivan Singartiyski (the second applicant), and UMO Ilinden, headed by Mr Kiril Ivanov, both leaders of the applicant party.

However, it reiterates that a political party may campaign for a change in the legal and constitutional structures of the State on two conditions: firstly, the means used to that end must in every respect be legal and democratic, and secondly, the change proposed must itself be compatible with fundamental democratic principles (see Yazar and Others, \u00a7 49, and Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others, \u00a7 98, both cited above).

In this connection, the Court observes that the incidents referred to by the Constitutional Court were rallies, speeches, press conferences, letters or maps, in which members of the applicant party or of its predecessor organisations had stated that there existed a Macedonian minority in Bulgaria and that the Pirin region was not part of Bulgaria, and had made certain peaceful demands in that respect (see paragraph 26 above).",

In a previous case which concerned bans of meetings organised by UMO Ilinden, which organisation is apparently closely connected with the applicant party, the Court examined the question whether the probable expression of separatist ideas at public meetings constituted sufficient grounds for the banning of such meetings, and held that \u201cthat the fact that a group of persons calls for autonomy or even requests secession of part of the country\u2019s territory \u2013 thus demanding fundamental constitutional and territorial changes \u2013 cannot automatically justify a prohibition of its assemblies\u201d (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, \u00a7 97). It also held that \u201cthe probability that separatist declarations would be made at meetings organised by [UMO] Ilinden could not justify a ban on [its] meetings\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 98). In that case the Court had regard, inter alia, to the Constitutional Court\u2019s findings which are at issue in the present case (ibid., \u00a7 96). The Court considers that the reasoning adopted in Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden applies in the case at hand as well. The mere fact that a political party calls for autonomy or even requests secession of part of the country\u2019s territory is not a sufficient basis to justify its dissolution on national security grounds. In a democratic society based on the rule of law, political ideas which challenge the existing order without putting into question the tenets of democracy, and whose realisation is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through, inter alia, participation in the political process. However shocking and unacceptable the statements of the applicant party\u2019s leaders and members may appear to the authorities or the majority of the population and however illegitimate their demands may be, they do not appear to warrant the impugned interference. The fact that the applicant party\u2019s political programme was considered incompatible with the current principles and structures of the  does not make it incompatible with the rules and principles of democracy. It is of the essence of democracy to allow diverse political programmes to be proposed and debated, even those that call into question the way a State is currently organised, provided that they do not harm democracy itself (see Socialist Party and Others, p. 1257, \u00a7 47, and Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP), \u00a7 41, both cited above). Moreover, there is no indication that the applicant party had any real chance of bringing about political changes which would not meet with the approval of everyone on the political stage (see Yazar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 58 in fine). Indeed, it was recognised in the request for its dissolution that its public influence was negligible (see paragraph 15 above). In this connection, it should also be noted that some of UMO Ilinden\u2019s and the applicant party\u2019s declarations apparently included an element of exaggeration and provocativeness as they sought to attract attention (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, \u00a7 102 in fine). It thus appears that the \u2019s holding that the applicant party\u2019s activity truly \u201cimperil[ed] [\u2019s] national security\u201d was not based an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.",

Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a041340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, \u00a7\u00a7 86105, ECHR 2003II). The answer to this question should be based on two main considerations.",

As the Court has many times stressed, such a drastic measure requires very serious reasons by way of justification before it could be considered proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued; it would be warranted only in the most serious cases (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, \u00a7 100, with further references). It should be noted in this connection that, prior to its dissolution, the applicant party had been registered, had existed for some time, and had participated in local elections, thus being a participant in the political life. Admittedly, during its existence the applicant party could have shown through its actions and public statements that it merited to be declared unconstitutional and dissolved. However, it was for the national authorities to convincingly establish the need for such a measure. The  should thus have placed a heavier emphasis on UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN\u2019s behaviour on the political stage and the manner in which it participated in the democratic process. Had they done so, the outcome of the case could have been different.",

Its analysis, which contained cogent arguments, did not however conclusively establish, on the basis of the available evidence, that there existed sufficient reasons to find that there was a genuine and serious risk that the means which the applicant party intended to use for achieving its aims would not be legal and democratic in every respect, as required by this Court\u2019s caselaw (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, \u00a7 98).",
