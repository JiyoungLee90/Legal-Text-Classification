An applicant does not need to exhaust remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach (see B\u00fclb\u00fcl v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 47297/99, \u00a7 17, 22 May 2007). In the present case, it was clear from the judgment of the Beyo\u011flu Magistrates\u2019 Court, dated 15\u00a0July 2008, that it was a final ruling due to the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant. The subsequent decision, which was delivered on 12\u00a0September 2008, was not an examination of the merits of the case, but it was a review on procedural grounds. The Court observes that according to the domestic legislation at the material time, it was clear that no appeal was possible against the judgment of 15 July 2008 because the fine that had been imposed on the applicant had not reached the minimum value required for lodging an appeal. Consequently, in the Court\u2019s view, filing an objection against the decision 12 September 2008 would have been futile.",
