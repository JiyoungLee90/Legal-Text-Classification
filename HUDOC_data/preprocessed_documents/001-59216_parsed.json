That being said, it cannot but note that the proceedings lasted almost fifteen years and eight months of which seven years and six months are within the scope of the Court\u2019s consideration (see paragraph 25 above). This is an excessively long period which cannot be justified with reference to considerations of complexity. Furthermore, the respondent Government have not sought to attribute any of the delay to the applicant\u2019s conduct of the case. In the Court\u2019s opinion the length of the proceedings can only be explained by the failure of the domestic courts to deal with the case diligently. It observes in this connection that it took the Ankara Martial Law Court almost five years to reach a verdict following the Military Court of Cassation\u2019s decision of 22 September 1988 to remit the case back to it (see paragraph 20 above). No convincing justification for this inordinate delay has been offered by the respondent Government.",
