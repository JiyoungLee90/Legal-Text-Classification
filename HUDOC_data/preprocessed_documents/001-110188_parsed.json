The first is the public interest in the prosecution of serious crime. The second is the public interest in the protection of family life from State interference. Both interests are important, having regard to the common good. In balancing those competing interests the respondent Government have considered that the public interest in the protection of family life weighed heavier in the scales than the public interest in criminal prosecution, but they have set limits on the scope of the \u201cfamily life\u201d that attracts statutory protection. They have done so by requiring formal recognition of the \u201cprotected\u201d family relationship before permitting the \u201ctestimonial privilege\u201d exception to arise. This formal recognition can be obtained either through marriage or by way of registration of the relationship. The public interest in the prosecution of crime involves, of necessity, putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions (see, among other authorities, Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports 1998VIII; more recently, Branko Toma\u0161i\u0107 and Others v.

(extracts)). It should be added that the duty of High Contracting Parties to deter or punish crime extends to other Convention provisions involving the active protection of individuals\u2019 rights against harm caused by others: in fact, the Court first formulated such a duty in finding a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 91).",

Austria, cited above, \u00a7 45), has been identified by the Court as lying at the heart of the rights which the defence enjoys under Article 6 (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7 45, Reports 1996I; and Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a068, Reports 1996VI; more recently, Jalloh v.

In this regard, the Court notes that the  is among the many Council of Europe member States that have elected to create a statutory testimonial privilege for certain categories of witnesses. This has been done in a \u201cclear and workable manner\u201d, as the Supreme Court indicated (see paragraph 21 above), by delimiting specific categories of persons including, among others, the spouse and any former spouse of the suspect and any person who is, or has been, in a registered partnership with the suspect. Such witnesses are relieved of the moral dilemma of having to choose between giving truthful evidence and thereby, possibly, jeopardising their relationship with the suspect or giving unreliable evidence, or even perjuring themselves, in order to protect that relationship.",

States are entitled to set boundaries to the scope of testimonial privilege and to draw the line at marriage or registered partnerships. The legislature is entitled to confer a special status on marriage or registration and not to confer it on other de facto types of cohabitation. Marriage confers a special status on those who enter into it; the right to marry is protected by Article 12 of the Convention and gives rise to social, personal and legal consequences (see, mutatis mutandis, Burden v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2008...; and \u015eerife\u00a0Yi\u011fit v.

Rather than the length or the supportive nature of the relationship, what is determinative is the existence of a public undertaking, carrying with it a body of rights and obligations of a contractual nature. The absence of such a legally binding agreement between the applicant and Mr\u00a0A. renders their relationship, however defined, fundamentally different from that of a married couple or a couple in a registered partnership (see Burden, cited above, \u00a7 65). The Court would add that, were it to hold otherwise, it would create a need either to assess the nature of unregistered non-marital relationships in a multitude of individual cases or to define the conditions for assimilating to a formalised union a relationship characterised precisely by the absence of formality.",

The Court accepts that any measure which involves the detention of a person is a serious one. However, in the circumstances of this case, it is satisfied that the domestic legal provisions governing the making of a detention order contain sufficient safeguards, which include (i)\u00a0a relatively short duration of validity (24 hours) during which time the investigating judge is obliged to notify the Regional Court of the making of the detention order; and (ii) a further short period of time (48 hours) within which the Regional Court must decide to release the witness or extend the detention order (see paragraph 26 above). While a witness cannot appeal against that decision, he or she may apply to the  to order his or her release and may also appeal against any refusal to grant such an application. The Court is of the view that the deprivation of liberty to which the applicant was subjected did not constitute, in the circumstances of the present case, a disproportionate interference with her rights under Article 8 of the Convention.",

For example, tax evasion or fraud is often harshly punished, because public finance will be undermined if taxpayers stop paying their taxes. Similarly, many criminal codes impose harsh punishments for failure to assist someone in danger.

This presentation is quite simply contrary to the spirit and letter of Article 8 of the Convention. Respect for family life is not only an interest but a right guaranteed by Article 8 \u00a7 1. The prevention of crime is, for its part, an interest included among the exceptions to the enjoyment of the right in Article 8 \u00a7 2.

Taking Article 8 alone, whilst it is understandable that the exemption should be accorded to ex-spouses and ex-partners, in particular because of the need to protect any children they may have had together, it does not appear logical for those who have maintained a stable family life with the person against whom they are asked to testify to be denied such an exemption merely on the grounds that their relationship is of a de facto nature. The Government acknowledge that the general assumption underlying the exemption of spouses and registered persons from the duty to testify is that their relationship with the suspect or accused is so close that it is unfair to hold them to that duty. Whether married, registered or having a similar long-lasting relationship, de facto, all partners of suspects who are called to give evidence are faced with the same moral dilemma by having to make a choice between testifying, and thereby possibly jeopardising their relationship with the suspect, or giving false evidence in order to protect that relationship.",

This argument appears irrelevant to us. We submit that it is not that the duty to give evidence in itself always constitutes a disproportionate interference with family life. Rather, we contend that compelling the applicant to testify against her partner, by depriving her of her liberty, constitutes an interference with her family life. The emphasis does not lie on the duty to give evidence in criminal proceedings in general, but on the pressure that is used to extract evidence from a party to a relationship within \u201cfamily life\u201d in the sense of Article 8 of the Convention, which extends to de facto relationships.

It is further to be noted that information concerning, for example, cohabitation and the presence of children can be found in the public registries and in the municipal personal records database.

The measure was imposed on her because of her refusal to comply with a court order, namely, an order to give testimony against her partner in a criminal case concerning murder. In other words it was a measure of deprivation of liberty to compel the applicant to testify (called Beugehaft in German), because if she had agreed to do so she would have been released (Article 223 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), thus entailing a risk of abuse that is commonly associated with inquisitorial systems. As to the procedural safeguards mentioned in the judgment (paragraph 77 of the judgment), we find them quite simply irrelevant when it comes to such a serious measure involving a restriction of the right to liberty guaranteed by the Convention.

Moreover, after separation, being ex-partners and even without sharing family life, they could have continued to benefit from the privilege. The majority take the view that: \u201c[i]t has not been suggested that the applicant was unaware of the fact that Article 217 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reserved testimonial privilege to witnesses bound to the suspect by marriage or registered partnership ...\u201d (paragraph\u00a070), but our own conclusion is that, \u201c... given the length and nature of her relationship with Mr A.\u201d (same paragraph in fine), the contrary is more likely to be true.",

However, it is noteworthy that there are at least thirty-eight member States that recognise a right of testimonial privilege in criminal proceedings, twenty-two of which afford such right to persons in the same situation as the applicant (paragraph 36). It is not a question of proposing a uniform solution or of imposing a general obligation on all States, as the margin of appreciation comes into play here, but each situation must be carefully addressed, on a case-by-case basis, in each State. The applicant\u2019s situation, in any event, called for an assessment by the judicial authorities that was more respectful of her right to family life, especially as it transpires from the Explanatory Memorandum in respect of Article 217 of the Netherlands Code of Criminal Procedure, and from an Advocate General\u2019s advisory opinion, that:",

However, after thirteen days of detention, it ordered the applicant\u2019s release, finding that \u201c... the applicant\u2019s detention entailed an interference with her rights under Article 8 of the Convention\u201d (paragraph 18).
