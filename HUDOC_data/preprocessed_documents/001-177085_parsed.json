On 27 April 2010 he was sent to Istanbul Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre. Thus, from 27 April 2010 onwards he was detained in the context of immigration controls.

The Court notes that it paid special attention in the aforementioned cases to the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d), members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and of the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants regarding the problem of overcrowding and the lack of outdoor exercise at the centre following visits there in June 2009, May 2012 and June 2012 respectively (see Yarashonen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 28 and 30). The Court observes that the Government have not presented any evidence or arguments capable of justifying a departure from those conclusions. In particular, there is no evidence in the case file to show that the lack of adequate personal space in the dormitory rooms was alleviated by a possibility for a sufficient amount of freedom of movement within the removal centre or that the applicant had access to regular outdoor exercise. The Court is therefore led to conclude that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention at Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre caused the applicant distress which exceeded the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and attained the threshold of degrading treatment proscribed by Article 3 (see Yarashonen, cited above, \u00a7 80).",
