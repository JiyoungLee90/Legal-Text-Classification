The examination was carried out on the basis of the applicant\u2019s and the twins\u2019 medical records, which were obtained from the maternity hospital and the children\u2019s hospital. The results of the examination were set out in a report (\u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u044f), which mainly concerned the development and treatment of the twin who had died. In particular, the report stated that the infant had been born prematurely in the thirty-first week of gestation of an eighth pregnancy and by a first delivery. Her blood test had indicated the possibility of a prenatal viral infection, and she had been clinically diagnosed as premature (at thirtyone weeks), with respiratory distress syndrome and atelectasis. A postmortem examination had revealed moderate interstitial emphysema of the lungs, which had explained the immediate cause of death. It was concluded that she had been born with severe respiratory distress syndrome complicated by an air leak syndrome, and that she had been provided with treatment which had been entirely appropriate, given the seriousness of the condition and the nature of the disease. Such cases carried a risk of death of not less than 80%, in addition to the risk of serious disabilities, and an early transfer to a children\u2019s hospital did not guarantee survival or a favourable outcome. The report also noted that the second twin had suffered from respiratory distress syndrome as well, but to a much lesser extent. The experts did not make any significant observations about the treatment he had received at the maternity hospital or the children\u2019s hospital.",

The exceptions to that general rule included, in particular, the transfer of confidential medical information in connection with an ongoing investigation or court proceedings at the request of various official investigating bodies, a prosecutor or a court (paragraph 4 (3) of Article\u00a061 of the Basic Principles). It concluded that, in connection with an ongoing investigation or court proceedings, confidential medical information could be provided to a justice of the peace without the consent of an individual or his legal representative, but could not be provided to a lawyer or a member of parliament.",

France, no. 7508/02, \u00a7 32, ECHR 2006XI).\u00a0The protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person\u2019s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, \u00a7 95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I; P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, \u00a7 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, \u00a7 56, 29 April 2014). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above).",

The Government had failed to show any relevant and sufficient reasons or any pressing social need for obtaining and examining the applicant\u2019s medical records without her consent.

The applicant considered that the authorities had aimed to find an explanation for her child\u2019s death other than the lack of capacity at children\u2019s hospitals specialising in emergency medical treatment, as confirmed by the Committee\u2019s letter to the Ministry of 12 September 2003, which contained false and discrediting information about her urogenital mycoplasmosis infection.

In the light of its further assessment of the proportionality of the interference, the Court did not find it necessary to decide whether the wording of Article 61 met the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirements of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.

However, the Russian authorities had a duty to limit the scope of the requested information to the children\u2019s state of health. Instead, the commission of the maternity hospital also disclosed to the Committee (and later to the Ministry) very intimate and sensitive information regarding the medical history of the applicant herself (see paragraph 13 of the judgment). That information was not relevant to the death of the twin and therefore it was not necessary in a democratic society to disclose that information without the applicant\u2019s consent.",

The Committee concluded that an early transfer to hospital did not guarantee survival or a favourable outcome. This conclusion turns the whole report into a very valuable document for a museum of totalitarianism: even where there is a 20% possibility of survival, a totalitarian system would not make efforts to save a life, because a life is not important; likewise, it would not encourage the improvement of the health-care system or innovation.",

It is precisely this legal ground, which appears relevant in the present case (suspicious death of a premature new-born baby in hospital), which the Chamber dismissed automatically and without giving reasons. It should be pointed out that the administrative investigation ordered by the Ministry of Health was opened because of the telegrams sent to the Russian authorities by the applicant\u2019s own mother, who complained, among other things, of medical negligence on a large scale (see paragraphs 7 and 8).",

It strikes me as too rigid an approach to find, as the Court did in paragraph 54 of the judgment, that the Government were estopped from raising that argument, especially since a number of precedents appear to argue in favour of the opposite conclusion (see St\u00f6gm\u00fcller v.

Having received a notitia criminis\u00a0concerning the death of a particularly vulnerable person (a new-born baby), the authorities had a duty to investigate (see Avilkina and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a01585/09, \u00a7\u00a045, 6 June 2013). They appointed experts whose independence and technical competence were not disputed at any stage. It seems clear to me that a thorough investigation necessitated access to the applicant\u2019s medical records and that, in the interests of transparency and proper administration, the final report had to be notified to the authority which had ordered the investigation and the person who had instigated the proceedings, namely the applicant\u2019s mother (whose daughter, curiously, did not appear to blame her for her actions). The report was not made generally available. Moreover, it is not disputed that the doctors making up the Committee and the Ministry team had a duty of professional confidentiality in accordance with paragraph 7.2 of Recommendation No. R (97) 5 to the member States on the protection of medical data. These elements afforded, at least prima facie, effective and sufficient safeguards against abuse.",
