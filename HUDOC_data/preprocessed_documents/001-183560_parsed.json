The Court has already found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in respect of the first application (no. 59337/13) lodged by Mr Shilov on 13\u00a0September 2013 on account of his on-going unreasonably long detention on remand (see Aristov and 10 others v. Russia [Committee], nos. 36101/11 et al., 21 July 2016). Following that judgment, Mr Shilov remained in detention pending the trial proceedings against him and until his release on 21\u00a0November 2016. In the meantime, on 29 July 2016 he lodged the present application with the Court. The Court further observes that the Presidium of the Supreme Court, responding to the Court\u2019s findings in the Aristov and 10\u00a0 others case (cited above), quashed all the detention orders issued by the Russian courts during the investigation stage in respect of the applicant, up to the detention order of 2 February 2016, and explicitly refused to assess the subsequent detention orders, delivered by the Russian courts after the applicant\u2019s criminal case had been transferred to the trial court for examination on the merits.",

Having examined the Government\u2019s objections, the Court dismisses them for the following reasoning.

Furthermore, the Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the Presidium of the Supreme Court has explicitly refused to examine the detention orders issued in respect of the applicant after 2\u00a0February 2016.
