The court held that the incriminating evidence presented by the prosecution and examined by the trial court was consistent and sufficiently proved the applicant\u2019s guilt. The court held that the crime scene examination records and the report on the subsequent ballistic examination of the recovered items confirmed that the cartridge cases and bullet found at D.M.\u2019s flat and the bullets taken out of G.M.\u2019s body had been discharged from the same firearm (see paragraph 22 above). As multiple witnesses had confirmed that it was the applicant who had discharged a firearm in D.M.\u2019s flat (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above), the court reached the assumption that the murder and the attempted murder had been also committed by the applicant. In reaching this conclusion it also relied on the pre-trial statements of D.M. The court also inferred from the above-mentioned intervention by the applicant in E.K.\u2019s examination by the trial court that the applicant had admitted killing G.M. accidentally (see paragraph 21 above).",

According to the appeal court, the expert had in fact submitted that \u201che did not rule out\u201d the possibility that the cartridge cases had been discharged from the same firearm; however, he had not made a definitive finding in that respect. The appeal court furthermore noted that the cartridge cases had not been taken from the deceased\u2019s body (as had been stated in the first-instance judgment) but from the murder scene. The court further held that the statements given by D.M. were credible and consistent with other evidence. The appeal court made no observation regarding any possible effects on the course of the trial of the applicant\u2019s inability to cross-examine D.M.

Germany, no. 59549/12, \u00a7 58, 26 July 2018; F\u0105frowicz v. Poland, no. 43609/07, \u00a7\u00a7 58-60, 17 April 2012; and Tuskia and Others, cited above, \u00a7 107). Moreover, the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence of violation of public order. For those reasons, the Court is satisfied to conclude that the evidence of the absent witness, D.M. constituted neither the sole basis nor the decisive factor in securing the applicant\u2019s conviction on the charges in question, and nor could it have carried significant weight in that regard.",

All of the items in question collectively constituted circumstantial evidence. The applicant\u2019s conviction for G.M.\u2019s murder was further corroborated, according to the domestic courts, by the testimony of the applicant\u2019s father, E.K.",

However, the Court notes that E.K.\u2019s statement lacked detail and does not seem to have been consistent with the account that had been submitted by the absent witness. In particular, while E.K. seems to have alleged that G.M. had been killed as a result of the applicant having accidentally fired a shot, D.M. stated that the applicant had fired at him and his father deliberately (see paragraphs 11 and 21 above).",
