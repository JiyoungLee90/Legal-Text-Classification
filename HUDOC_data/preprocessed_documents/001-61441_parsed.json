The term \u201ccloset Nazi\u201d was used to describe a person who supported National Socialist ideas, not in public, but in private through clandestine activities. Belonging to such a circle of persons meant having a contemptible character and behaving in a manner contrary to honour or morality. According to the court, it could not be established that Mrs Rosenkranz was a co-author of her husband's magazine. Even assuming that she had contributed to certain passages of some of the articles published in it, as contended by the applicants, these were unproblematic in terms of the National Socialism Prohibition Act (Verfassungsgesetz vom 8. Mai 1945 \u00fcber das Verbot der NSDAP, Verbotsgesetz 1947 \u2013 \u201cthe Prohibition Act\u201d). As regards a statement by Mrs Rosenkranz in which she had said that she did not find her husband's activities immoral, the court found that Mr Rosenkranz had so far not been convicted of contravening the Prohibition Act. On the other hand, Mrs Rosenkranz had not said that she supported her husband's activities or identified herself with them. Moreover, a wife could not be expected to criticise her husband in public. Although she had criticised the National Socialism Prohibition Act in public statements, the court found that the applicants had failed to provide evidence of any clandestine National Socialist activities undertaken by Mrs Rosenkranz that would justify calling her a \u201ccloset Nazi\u201d.",

It was meant to describe those of his party colleagues who, officially, demonstrated support for democracy, but who, unofficially or secretly, did not dissociate themselves from neo-Nazi ideas or from contacts with the neo-Nazi scene. Therefore, their relation to the extreme right appeared to be unclear. The applicants complained that the court had in fact failed to conclude that Mrs\u00a0Rosenkranz had contributed to the editing of her husband's xenophobic magazine. They argued that Mrs Rosenkranz, as a politician, exposed herself to public scrutiny and advocated views of a political nature. As a politician, it was part of her functions to participate in political debate. Therefore, in the light of the right to freedom of expression and information of citizens and the electorate, it was legitimate to expect her to take a stand also in regard to her husband's political activities. Taking sides with her husband might do her credit as a wife, but, as a politician, she had to bear criticism under such circumstances, as her failure to dissociate herself from the extreme right could be perceived as an approval of her husband's political activities. Had the court correctly assessed the meaning of the incriminated passage, it would have concluded that the applicants had furnished proof of its factual basis.",

Therefore, the article had insinuated clandestine neo-Nazi activities on the part of Mrs Rosenkranz that were not proved. Consequently, it was irrelevant to take evidence relating to possible extreme right-wing activities of her husband, as proposed by the applicants. Moreover, the first-instance court had correctly found that neither Mrs Rosenkranz's public speeches when compared to certain passages of articles in her husband's magazine, nor her statement that she did not find her husband's activities immoral warranted the conclusion that she supported National Socialist ideas. Therefore, the evidence the applicants' proposed to adduce to the effect that Mrs\u00a0Rosenkranz knew the contents of her husband's magazine and that she in fact contributed from time to time to its editing was not sufficient to furnish proof of her clandestine support for National Socialist ideas.",

The Court notes in this respect that the assessment of whether a certain statement constitutes a value judgment or a statement of fact might in many cases be difficult. However, since under the Court's case-law a value judgment must be based on sufficient facts in order to constitute a fair comment under Article 10 (see De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, p. 249, \u00a7 47, and Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2001-II), their difference finally lies in the degree of factual proof which has to be established (see Krone Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, contrary to the domestic courts' position, the Court considers that the impugned statement, taken in its context, is not a statement of fact but has to be understood as a permissible value judgment. Mrs Rosenkranz is the wife of a well-known right-wing politician, who is the editor of a magazine considered to be extreme right-wing. This element in itself does not constitute a sufficient factual basis. However, Mrs Rosenkranz is also a politician, who has never publicly dissociated herself from her husband's political views but has criticised the Prohibition Act, which bans National Socialist activities, in public statements. In this context, it is to be noted that the essence of the impugned article was exactly the reproach that FP\u00d6 politicians failed to dissociate themselves clearly from the extreme right. Therefore, the body of facts available constituted a sufficient factual basis for the contested statement, understood in the above sense, namely that Mrs\u00a0Rosenkranz's stand towards extreme right political positions was at the least unclear. The Court considers that the applicants published what may be considered to have been their fair comment, namely the first applicant's personal political analysis of the Austrian political scene.

Therefore, the Court is not convinced by the Regional Court's reasoning, in response to Mrs Rosenkranz's statement that she saw nothing immoral in her husband's political activities, to the effect that Mr\u00a0Rosenkranz had so far not been convicted of contravening the Prohibition Act. The standards applied when assessing someone's political activities in terms of morality are different from those required for establishing an offence under criminal law.",

Therefore, having regard to the fact that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest, the Court finds that the domestic courts overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation afforded to member States, and that the interference was disproportionate to the aim pursued and was thus not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
