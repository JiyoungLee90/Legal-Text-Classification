In addition to that, the complaint was submitted to the Court more than six months from the date on which a final decision was taken. As regards the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article\u00a07 of the Convention, the Court observes that the applicant did not allege of the severity of the life sentence as such; his complaint was limited to an allegation that his death sentence should have been commutted to that of a fixed-term imprisonment. The Court notes in this connection that a similar complaint has been examined and found to be manifestly ill-founded in the case of Naydyon v. Ukraine (no. 16474/03, \u00a7 49, 14 October 2010). As to the applicant\u2019s complaints under Articles 17, 34 and 53 of the Convention, the Court finds that the material in its possession does not disclose any appearance of a violation of those provisions. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",
