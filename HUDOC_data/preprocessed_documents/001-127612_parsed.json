The Court finds that the injuries noted in the medical reports issued in respect of the applicant are not consistent with the applicant\u2019s submissions that he was hit with sticks and firearms and kicked. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the treatment that was described by the applicant would have left more serious marks on his body. Moreover, the injury on his head, a two-centimetre-long laceration, is consistent with the allegation that the applicant had hit his head on the door while resisting arrest. The Court accordingly finds that the applicant was not beaten during the arrest but was injured while struggling with the police officers - as they alleged - as a result of the force used by them. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that there is no evidence to support the applicant\u2019s allegation that he was beaten by the police during his arrest. Furthermore, in view, in particular, of the fact that two police officers also sustained injuries to various parts of their bodies during the arrest, the Court finds that there is nothing in the case file to show that the force used by the police was unnecessary or disproportionate.",
