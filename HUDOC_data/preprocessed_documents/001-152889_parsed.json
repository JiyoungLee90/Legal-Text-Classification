For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many other authorities, Mikheyev v. , no. 77617/01, \u00a7\u00a0107 et seq., 26 January 2006, and Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq.). For an investigation to be effective, those responsible for and carrying out the investigation must be independent and impartial, in law and in practice. This means not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection with those implicated in the events but also a practical independence (see Kolevi v. Bulgaria, no. 1108/02, \u00a7\u00a0193, 5 November 2009).",

In this regard the Court has previously found that such pre-investigation enquiries do not comply with the principles of an effective remedy, for the following reasons: the enquiring officer can take only a limited number of procedural steps within that procedure; the victims have no formal status, with the result that they are precluded from effective participation in the procedure (see Davydov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0310-312 and Savitskyy v.

In this regard it has not been shown that the decisions to suspend the investigation in 2004 and 2005 were justified. Similarly, it cannot be concluded that the decision of 13\u00a0March 2006 by which the investigator refused to open criminal proceedings against specific police officers was based on a thorough examination of the applicant\u2019s allegations. It is notable that in 2004 and 2009 the supervising prosecutor\u2019s offices admitted that the investigation was not comprehensive or adequate (see paragraphs 26 and 37 above).",

As to the Government\u2019s objection concerning the failure of the applicant to appeal against the decision of 13 March 2006, the Court takes note of the applicant\u2019s contention that the domestic authorities informed him of that decision only belatedly. It also appears that the applicant was not provided with a copy of that decision by the domestic authorities and could examine it only with the Government\u2019s observations in 2012. This means that before that date he did not know the precise reasons for it, and thus was not in a position to appeal effectively against it (see Akulinin and Babich v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a05742/02, \u00a7\u00a029, 2 October 2008, and Savitskyy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0120).

The medical evidence also shows that following that day he experienced psychological problems (see paragraphs 18, 21 and 27 above). At the same time, when documenting the applicant\u2019s detention on 4 May 2003 the authorities noted that the applicant was not injured. This statement therefore suggests that the applicant had not sustained injuries before being placed under the control of the authorities. As to the time of release, there is nothing in support of the Government\u2019s contention that the applicant was released on 4 May 2003 and not on 5 May 2003 following the court hearing in the administrative case, as argued by the applicant. Accordingly, the Court finds that it was for the State to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of the circumstances in which the applicant sustained injuries. The State\u2019s failure to discharge this burden of proof may prompt the Court to accept the applicant\u2019s account of the events.",

The Government maintained that according to the last medical expert report the possibility could not be excluded that the injuries had been sustained as a result of the applicant\u2019s falling down. However, similarly to the applicant\u2019s version, this version was not properly examined by the domestic authorities either. It is furthermore notable that by that same report the expert also considered that the injuries could have been sustained in the circumstances as described by the applicant. The Court therefore does not accept the Government\u2019s suggestion as a plausible explanation. Meanwhile, no other explanation for the applicant\u2019s injuries has been provided. In these circumstances the Court holds that the State must be held responsible for the ill-treatment, which should be classified as inhuman and degrading.",
