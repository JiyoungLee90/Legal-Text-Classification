The second-instance court delivered its judgment on 9\u00a0May\u00a02007. An appeal on points of law was lodged on 13\u00a0June 2007 and since then the proceedings have been pending before the Supreme Court. As regards the possible outcome of the latter proceedings, the Court notes that the Supreme Court could theoretically reject the applicant\u2019s claim as a whole and that would lead to a final resolution of the case; it could also remit the case for-re-examination (see paragraph 26 above). These scenarios, however, have not been mentioned by the Government, who have submitted instead that after the Supreme Court renders a decision the remaining part of the claim concerning the amount of damages to be awarded to the applicant would have to be examined by the regular court.",

In this connection, the Court notes that since 1\u00a0January\u00a02007 individuals have had the opportunity to avail themselves of a compensatory remedy under the two conditions set out in the 2006 Act (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above).
