According to the applicants, this background information showed that, instead of arresting their relatives at a much earlier stage, members of the security forces had chosen to wait until their relatives went to the countryside where the conditions were suitable for an operation to kill them.

In examining whether the Government have discharged their burden, the Court will not only examine whether the resort to the use of lethal force by the soldiers was no more than absolutely necessary and was strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in the subparagraphs of Article\u00a02 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, but also whether the operation was regulated and organised in such a way as to minimise to the greatest extent possible any risk to life (see Makaratzis v.

Without casting any doubt on the accuracy of the findings of that report according to which 16 of the 17 relatives had gunpowder residue on their hands which, according to the report, could indicate that they had either handled firearms or had pulled the triggers, it is to be noted that the same report also goes on to highlight the volatile nature of gunpowder residue and states how a number of other events \u2013\u00a0such as contamination\u00a0\u2013 could explain the presence of the gunpowder residue on their hands. In this connection the Court notes, as have the applicants (see paragraph\u00a068 above), that the bodies of the seventeen were carried by the soldiers, who had killed them by opening fire on them. Furthermore, after they were taken to the Ovac\u0131k Gendarmerie Command by the soldiers, swabs were not taken from their hands immediately. They were first examined at that military base outdoors, then handed over to a non-commissioned officer and taken to the Forensic Medicine Institute\u2019s Malatya branch, where swabs were finally taken some 12-36 hours after the killings. As a result of the failure to take swabs immediately after the applicants\u2019 relatives were killed, and by experts independent of those who were implicated in the events, the Court cannot exclude that some, if not all, of the gunpowder residue found on their hands had been left by contamination. Without calling into question whether there was an exchange of fire, the Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s interpretation of the forensic report as unequivocally showing that the sixteen \u201chad actively fired on the security forces\u201d.",

The Court notes that the Government\u2019s assertion is refuted by the Ovac\u0131k prosecutor\u2019s written request to have the investigation file classified as confidential and the Ovac\u0131k Magistrates\u2019 decision accepting the prosecutor\u2019s request (see paragraphs 44-45 above) in which no mention was made of any sensitive documents or of any statements having been made by any arrested persons. The real reason for the prosecutor\u2019s request was, according to those two documents, because the three applicants who requested those documents from the file were related to \u201cthe deceased members of the terrorist organisation\u201d. The Court is also unable to accept the Government\u2019s submissions that the decision to classify the investigation as confidential had not prevented the relatives from accessing the file because in the Government\u2019s opinion that decision only placed restrictions on the removal of some of the documents in the file and that the file had always been accessible to the relatives. Unlike the Government, the Court notes that that decision effectively prevented the applicants from seeing any of the documents in the file, with the exception of the autopsy reports. In fact the applicants did not have access to the documents in the file until some three years after the investigation was closed; those documents were made available to the Court and the Court forwarded them to the applicants (see paragraph 89 above).",

Thus, the crucial evidence, such as the weapons, ammunition, spent bullet cases and the bodies of the applicants\u2019 relatives, were secured by those soldiers. The Court considers that allowing those soldiers to take such an active part in the investigation into the killing is not only so serious as to taint the independence of the entirety of the criminal proceedings (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0339-341, ECHR 2007\u2011II), but also entailed the risk that crucial evidence implicating the soldiers in the killing would be contaminated, destroyed or ignored (see G\u00fclbahar \u00d6zer and Others, cited above, \u00a7 62; see also \u00d6zcan and Others, cited above, \u00a7 66). In its examination below of the evidence collected from the scene and in assessing its corroborative value, the Court will take into account that risk. In this connection the Court must also stress that it cannot accept the Government\u2019s submissions that the prosecutor \u201chad personally carried out the procedure throughout the investigation and had never relied heavily on the information provided by the gendarmes\u201d (see paragraph\u00a0103 above).

Even in the most difficult of circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism or organised crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of its Protocols, Article 3 of the Convention makes no provision for exceptions, and no derogation from it is permissible under Article\u00a015 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see, among other authorities, Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a062, Reports 1996-VI).",

For example, in its judgment in the case of Benzer and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 209-213), the Court found that seeing the bodies of their close relatives who had been bombed by military aircraft and having to collect what was left of their bodies and burying them in mass graves, coupled with the lack of the slightest concern for human life on the part of the pilots who bombed the villages and their superiors who ordered the bombings and the national authorities\u2019 failure to offer even the minimum humanitarian assistance to the applicants in the aftermath of the bombing, amounted to inhuman treatment.",
