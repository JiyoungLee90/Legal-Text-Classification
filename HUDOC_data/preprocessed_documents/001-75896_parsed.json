In this respect, the Court reiterates that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending (G\u00f3rski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7 57, 4 October 2005). The Court also acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider in an initial stage that such a risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.

Poland, no. 28904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4\u00a0October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see, Celejewski v Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7 37, 4 May 2006; Dudek v Poland, no. 633/03, \u00a7 36, 4 May 2006). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-defendants, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention during the period necessary to terminate the investigation, to draw up the bill of indictment and to hear evidence from the accused. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal groups, the risk that a detainee if released might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high.",
