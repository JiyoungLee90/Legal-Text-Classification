Accordingly, as submitted by the Government and as also evidenced by the list of claimants who had applied for financial compensation between 2005 and 2008 (see the attached Annex), if a claimant obtained partial restitution of the property or other forms of compensation, he would not be eligible to obtain financial compensation. This is the position in two applications (nos.\u00a043628/07 (Dani) and 34770/09 (Muka)). The applicants in those cases would not be entitled to obtain financial compensation because they had been previously allocated a plot of land.",

However, financial compensation is the sole form of compensation currently awarded. Had the applicants therefore applied for and been awarded financial compensation in respect of 200 sq. m, their right to have the remainder of their decisions enforced would have been uncertain. In fact, even though the applicants in application no. 46684/07 (Ahmatas and Others) received financial compensation, to date, the remainder of the decision in their favour remains unenforced. Moreover, the Court is not convinced that the award of financial compensation equal to the value of 200 sq. m, irrespective of the plot of land recognised for the purpose of compensation, would ensure effective equality of treatment of claimants as contended by the Government. Persons, whose situations are significantly different, should be treated differently (see Thlimmenos v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000IV).",

ALUIZNI has collected \u20ac30 million in fees so far, of which half has been paid to restitution claimants. This has fallen far short of the required amount to compensate expropriated owners, which means the largest share of the compensation due must therefore be paid out of budget resources. This shortfall notwithstanding, amendments to the Legalisation [Act] were adopted in October 2009 that allow applicants to pay up to half of the cost of legalization using otherwise worthless vouchers issued under a 1990s privatization scheme. The acceptance of vouchers is likely to deprive the state of significant revenue that could have been used to compensate expropriated owners.\u201d",
