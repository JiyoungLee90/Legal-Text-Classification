In the application which he lodged with the Commission on 16th August 1966 (No. 2899/66) and supplemented on 6th September 1966, the applicant invoked Articles 4, 5 and 6 (3) (c) (art. 4, art. 5, art. 6-3-c) of the Convention. He complained in the first place of his detention: he emphasised that he had a fixed abode at Brussels-Schaarbeek and had never begged and so he was surprised at having been placed in a vagrancy centre. He further alleged that he had had no opportunity of defending himself before the  police court on 4th November 1965 as the hearing had lasted \"scarcely two minutes\" and he had not been granted free legal aid. He also complained of various features of the regime to which he was subjected. In order to prevent him accumulating the 2,000 BF required to constitute release savings, he had been left, he alleged, for several months without sufficient work. In a general way, he added, the directors of the various institutions acted in concert in order to prolong the detention of vagrants as much as possible; the Government, for its part, \"encouraged\" vagrancy which gave it a labour force almost without cost (1.75 BF per hour at manual work) and huge profits. Finally, Versyp maintained that his numerous letters addressed to the competent authorities, such as, for example, the inspector of prisons, the public prosecutor\u2019s office (July 1966) and the Minister of Justice (June and August 1966), invariably returned \"to the director\" who filed them without further action; these letters were not the object of any decision or, like his request for a transfer to Brussels, met with a refusal. One of them, that addressed on 7th February 1966 to the Minister of Justice by registered post, had even been opened by the director of the Wortel settlement who had not sent it.",

The Agent of the Government replied that that superior administrative court considered it had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against a magistrate\u2019s order (Vleminckx judgment of 21st December 1951, cf. paragraph 37 above); he underlined, however, that there was \"at least one case\" - Du Bois - \"pending before the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat in which the problem of the right to appeal against a magistrate\u2019s decision had again been raised\"; he further expressed his personal opinion that \"a decision of the Minister refusing\" to release a detained vagrant could doubtless be set aside if need be by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat \"on a pure point of law\". He did not, however, use this as an argument to request the Commission either to reject the applications for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies or to adjourn its decision on their admissibility.",

Starting from that premise, the Government stressed that the applicants had reported voluntarily to the police and that their admission to Wortel and Merksplas had been the result \"of an express or implicit request\" on their part, express for Versyp and Ooms, implicit for De Wilde. According to the Government, such a \"voluntary reporting\" can scarcely amount to being \"deprived of liberty\" within the meaning of Article 5 (art. 5).

At first sight, the wording of Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) might make one think that it guarantees the right of the detainee always to have supervised by a court the lawfulness of a previous decision which has deprived him of his liberty. The two official texts do not however use the same terms, since the English text speaks of \"proceedings\" and not of \"appeal\", \"recourse\" or \"remedy\" (compare Articles 13 and 26 (art. 13, art. 26)). Besides, it is clear that the purpose of Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) is to assure to persons who are arrested and detained the right to a judicial supervision of the lawfulness of the measure to which they are thereby subjected; the word \"court\" (\"tribunal\") is there found in the singular and not in the plural. Where the decision depriving a person of his liberty is one taken by an administrative body, there is no doubt that Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) obliges the Contracting States to make available to the person detained a right of recourse to a court; but there is nothing to indicate that the same applies when the decision is made by a court at the close of judicial proceedings. In the latter case the supervision required by Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) is incorporated in the decision; this is so, for example, where a sentence of imprisonment is pronounced after \"conviction by a competent court\" (Article 5 (1) (a) of the Convention) (art. 5-1-a). It may therefore be concluded that Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) is observed if the arrest or detention of a vagrant, provided for in paragraph (1) (e) (art. 5-1-e), is ordered by a \"court\" within the meaning of paragraph (4) (art. 5-4).",

In all these different cases it denotes bodies which exhibit not only common fundamental features, of which the most important is independence of the executive and of the parties to the case (see Neumeister judgment of 27th June 1968, Series A, p. 44, paragraph 24), but also the guarantees of judicial procedure. The forms of the procedure required by the Convention need not, however, necessarily be identical in each of the cases where the intervention of a court is required. In order to determine whether a proceeding provides adequate guarantees, regard must be had to the particular nature of the circumstances in which such proceeding takes place. Thus, in the Neumeister case, the Court considered that the competent courts remained \"courts\" in spite of the lack of \"equality of arms\" between the prosecution and an individual who requested provisional release (ibidem); nevertheless, the same might not be true in a different context and, for example, in another situation which is also governed by Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4).",

Regarding the interrogation of this individual, the 1891 Act limits itself to specifying in Section 12 that the magistrate ascertains the identity, age, physical and mental state and manner of life of the person brought before him.

It does not ensure guarantees comparable to those which exist as regards detention in criminal cases, notwithstanding the fact that the detention of vagrants is very similar in many respects. It is hard to understand why persons arrested for simple vagrancy have to be content with such a summary procedure: individuals liable to sentences shorter than the terms provided for by Section 13, and even Section 16, of the 1891 Act - including those prosecuted for an offence under Articles 342 to 344 of the Criminal Code (aggravated vagrancy) - have the benefit of the extensive guarantees provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure. This procedure undoubtedly presents certain judicial features, such as the hearing taking place and the decision being given in public, but they are not sufficient to give the magistrate the character of a \"court\" within the meaning of Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) when due account is taken of the seriousness of what is at stake, namely a long deprivation of liberty attended by various shameful consequences. Therefore it does not by itself satisfy the requirements of Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) and the Commission was quite correct in considering that a remedy should have been open to the applicants.

One of the three elements of the basis of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction provided for in this article (art. 48) is the word \"affaires\" (\"cases\"). Relying on the English version of paragraph (1) of Article 46 (art. 46-1), the Court interprets this word as \"all matters\". But in interpreting a text which is authentic in two languages, one cannot, in my opinion, give preference to one language: one must find the meaning which best reconciles the two texts, taking into account the aim and purpose of the Convention. In the different articles of the Convention, the French text constantly uses the word \"affaire\" while the English text expresses the same concept by the words \"question\", \"cases\" and \"matters\". The English version is not, from this point of view, a text which has a uniform terminology on which one can rely. The text of Article 45 (art. 45) does not provide sure indications to clarify the meaning of the word \"affaires\". One must therefore go to the source of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to harmonise the words quoted and find a common meaning. According to Articles 31 and 32 (art. 31, art. 32) what is referred as an \"affaire\" (\"case\") by the Commission to the Committee of Ministers or to the Court is the question whether there has or has not been a violation of the Convention. The word \"affaire\" must therefore be interpreted in this sense.",

Competence to accept an application and to check its admissibility belongs to the Commission. Jurisdiction to decide whether there has been a violation of the Convention belongs to the Court.

Through a broad interpretation of Article 45 (art. 45), the judgment has set up a system of supervision by the Court of the Commission\u2019s decisions on admissibility. An enormous waste of time and effort would result in cases where the Court should find, generally four or five years after the admissibility of the applications, that Article 26 (art. 26) has not been observed. If there is jurisdiction to supervise decisions of admissibility, it must be exercised at the first stage of the proceedings.

However, I do not agree with the judgment in deducing therefrom a supervisory jurisdiction of the Court. In effect, the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is not concerned with the internal organisation of a given international jurisdictional body. As stated above, the Convention set up two organs to ensure the observance of Human Rights. The aim of the rule in question is achieved if the rule is observed by one of these organs and, above all, by the organ entrusted with the task of checking the observance of the conditions of admissibility. This is all the more true since, according to paragraph (3) of Article 27 (art. 27-3), the condition of exhaustion of domestic remedies is a preliminary question which concerns essentially the admissibility of the application. It is for the Commission to decide whether this condition is fulfilled. If the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies is raised before the Commission and the latter has decided the issue, the requirements of the rule in question are completely satisfied from the point of view of international law.",

Its decisions to reject applications which it considers to be inadmissible are without appeal as are, moreover, also those by which applications are accepted; they are taken in complete independence\". The judgment adds, however, that the decision of the Commission to accept a case \"is not binding on the Court any more than the Court is bound by the opinion expressed by the Commission\". I cannot accept this reasoning. First of all, the decision of admissibility taken by the Commission and the opinion expressed by it on the merits are of a different nature.

The preparatory works show that all conditions for admissibility - exhaustion of remedies, compatibility with the provisions of the Convention and not manifestly ill-founded \u2013 were considered from the same angle, namely to prevent a flood of cases. The whole responsibility with regard to admissibility - also including exhaustion of local remedies - was laid upon the Commission.

Its decisions to reject applications which it considers to be inadmissible are without appeal as are, moreover, also those by which applications are accepted; they are taken in complete independence ...\". But if this is so, how can then the Court through \"interpretation or application\" of Article 26 (art. 26) set aside the Commission\u2019s final decision laying down that all internal remedies are exhausted? The majority contend that as the Court\u2019s jurisdiction according to Article 45 (art. 45) shall extend to \"all cases concerning the interpretation and application ... which the High Contracting Parties or the Commission shall refer to it\", it is \"impossible to see how questions concerning the interpretation and application of Article 26 (art. 26) ... should fall outside its jurisdiction\".

The question of exhaustion of internal remedies is not part of the case as this question is already finally decided by the Commission, exercising a judicial function against which no appeal lies.

If the Court nevertheless exercises its own jurisdiction in regard to admissibility and decides against the Commission\u2019s decision, the inequality between the applicant and the State in proceedings before the Court will be more aggravated, which can only harm the cause of Human Rights. The provisions in Articles 28 to 31 (art. 28, art. 29, art. 30, art. 31) clearly show that the meaning of the Convention is that the Contracting States shall also abide by a decision of admissibility. The Commission acts immediately upon its finding that the application, in whole or in part, is admissible. There is no means by which the decision laying down that all internal remedies have been exhausted can be controlled or tried by any other organ. The Commission\u2019s further dealing with the application is consequently in full compliance with the Convention when the Commission accepts the petition (Article 28) (art. 28), and undertakes to ascertain the facts, to examine the petition and carry out - if need be - an investigation. It shall try to secure a friendly settlement and if a friendly settlement is not reached, the Commission shall draw up its report on the facts and state its opinion \"as to whether the facts found disclose a breach by the State concerned of its obligations under the Convention\".

Furthermore, a State will have every opportunity to remedy a decision during the time the application has been under consideration by the Commission, and the question of exhaustion discussed at length. This is usually the situation in every application which is dealt with by the Commission. It seems unreasonable that, under these circumstances, a State shall have the right to pursue this question of local remedies further and take it up before the Court. In this connection to speak about the rule of exhaustion as marking out the limits \"within which the Contracting States have agreed to answer for wrongs alleged against them before the organs of the Convention\", and that \"the Court has to ensure (its) observance ... just as of the individual rights and freedoms ...\", carries really no weight. As to the interests of a State in regard to exhaustion of remedies, the State itself has every opportunity to look after them before the Commission, which also protects these interests.",

The case is the \"report on the facts\" and the Commission\u2019s opinion \"whether the facts found disclose a breach by the State concerned of its obligations under the Convention\" (Article 31) (art. 31).

But there is in actual fact no difference between the competence of the Committee of Ministers and the competence of the Court. It is generally understood that the Ministers shall not deal with the question of admissibility, they shall only decide whether there has been a violation. But is it not just the same competence the Court exercises? The Ministers shall of course also \"interpret and apply\" the Convention in the same way as the Court.

It can only find that this or that criterion has been established in internal law in accordance with a lawful procedure conforming to the requirements of the Convention in a way which renders legitimate certain measures taken by the State. Apart from this, since in the Court\u2019s opinion the applicants were not in a position to have supervised within the meaning of Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) of the Convention the lawfulness of their alleged character of a vagrant, it had to be concluded that there were perhaps very strong reasons to hold that they were vagrants and that it was permitted to undertake and pursue the appropriate procedure, but that the state of vagrancy could not yet be considered to exist according to the Convention. The same principle as that in Article 6 (2) (art. 6-2) of the Convention is applicable here (\"Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law\"). According to the Court, the state of vagrancy was not lawfully established because of the violation of Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) of the Convention; it was therefore still to be presumed that they were not vagrants.",

First of all, the Court states, quite rightly in our opinion, that the Convention requires only the supervision by a judicial organ of the measures taken by the police, irrespective of whether this control is exercised ex officio or at the request of the interested party. We also agree with the Court in accepting that the Belgian magistrate, invested with jurisdiction to decide in vagrancy matters, is a court independent of the executive and enjoying the guarantees afforded to the judges by Articles 99 and 100 of the Belgian Constitution. Similarly, we can also accept that the magistrate necessarily decides on the lawfulness of the detention which the prosecuting authority requests him to sanction. Lastly, the same is true of the finding that the procedure before the said magistrate allows certain rights of the defence and presents certain judicial features, such as the hearing taking place and the decision being given in public. Nevertheless, the Court finishes by deciding that all this is not sufficient.",

Once again, we agree with the Court: one cannot, for example, consider the procedure for the detention of a person of unsound mind to be satisfactory if it did not include medical examinations fully guaranteeing objectivity and competence. But, in the present cases, the Court says that the deprivation of liberty complained of by the applicants resembles very closely that imposed in criminal cases and that therefore the procedure to be followed should not provide guarantees markedly inferior to those existing in criminal matters in the member States of the Council of Europe. This comparison seems scarcely exact to us. Shelter in an assistance home or in a vagrancy centre is not quite the same as being locked in prison; the consequences are not shameful to the same degree; release can be requested and obtained at any time, which is not the case where a prison sentence is being served. On the other hand, it must be emphasised that the decision of the magistrate in vagrancy matters deals simply with the existence of certain factual conditions which are quite easily established and which do not require either a lengthy investigation or long hearings. A rather simplified procedure therefore normally suffices.",

It is perhaps otherwise in the only case where the placing at the disposal of the Government is not of a temporary and transitory nature but is decided for a whole determinate period which, according to Belgian law, can go up to seven years. In that case it can reasonably be asked whether this is not a sort of conviction and sentence, and even quite a serious one, to which the ordinary guarantees of criminal procedure should apply. The Court however has not made an abstraction of this case, which concerned only some of the applicants; moreover, De Wilde and Versyp, who were both placed at the disposal of the Government for two years, were released before, and one of them well before, the expiry of the term which thus does not seem to be as rigorous as a criminal sentence. With all reservations as to the compatibility in general of the Belgian law with the Convention, we do not believe that in the present cases there are sufficient elements to support the conclusion that there has been a violation on this point by the Belgian Government of the applicants\u2019 right protected by Article 5 (4) (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",

It is true that, although the applicants failed to appeal to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, the Court has unanimously declared the submission of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies to be ill-founded for the reason that the applicants can not be blamed for not having attempted an appeal which, according to established case-law, was inadmissible. This, however, does not mean that such an appeal could not have been possible. The Du Bois case, which was already pending at the time of the detention of the applicants, reversed the former case-law and the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat decided that the orders of the magistrates in vagrancy matters were subject to appeal to it. An appeal by the applicants which would very likely have been the subject of a decision by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat subsequent to the Du Bois judgment would have been dealt with in the same way and would have been declared admissible and then judged. From the uncertainty of the situation existing at the time, while in spite of the previous case-law to the contrary a new attempt to appeal to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat had already been made and had finally been crowned with success, no argument can be drawn either to deny that, according to the communis opinio, there had then been exhaustion of domestic remedies or to deny that, this notwithstanding, the real possibility of an appeal existed. The applicants can ask to be excused for not having entered an appeal which at that time seemed ill-founded but they cannot seriously complain that an appeal did not exist which in fact existed.",

At the hearing of 18th November 1970, Mr. S\u00f8rensen, the Principal Delegate of the Commission, explained that the majority of the Commission had not shared his opinion because Belgian legislation did not provide a further supervision of the lawfulness of the detention. However, the 1891 Act provides at Sections 15 and 18 that the Minister of Justice shall release detained persons, whose detention he considers to be no longer necessary. The Commission did not take into account that, during their detention, the applicants had had the right to request their release, on the ground that their detention was no longer justified, and to complain of the nature, which in their opinion had become unlawful, of their detention, as well as, moreover, of any violation of their rights by the administrative authorities by addressing themselves to the Minister of Justice and by way of an appeal against a negative decision of this authority to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat.

An act is arbitrary when it violates in a serious and obvious way a legal rule or again when it is devoid of all serious justification. The least one can say is that it has not been proved that the magistrates at Brussels and Charleroi clearly violated Section 13 of the 1891 Act when, in placing Versyp and De Wilde in a vagrancy centre, they took into consideration the moral and social disorder which characterised the behaviour of these two vagrants.",

Moreover, the Commission did not go into this complaint in its memorial to the Court, nor did the applicants\u2019 counsel do so in his observations appended to the Commission\u2019s memorial.",

The order of detention was made by a court and with the formalities of a public hearing in the presence of the parties during and after which the persons appearing had the opportunity to avail themselves of all means of defence. They did not make use of this right. The clearly established facts show that the measures taken in their regard were not arbitrary and that it is doubtful whether other magistrates or even a court of appeal could have come to decisions appreciably different from those which were taken.",
