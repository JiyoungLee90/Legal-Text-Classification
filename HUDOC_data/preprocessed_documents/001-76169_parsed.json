I believe that, as things stand, this procedure must be described as being contrary to the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT).

It may be extended beyond that period only after a report to the Sentence Enforcement Board and following a decision by the regional director of prisons. In exceptional cases, solitary confinement may be extended beyond one year following an initial decision by the Minister for Justice. In such cases, the prison director compiles a file including, among other things, the opinion of the prison doctor and of the Sentence Enforcement Board.

During the visit, I had the opportunity to talk with persons placed in solitary confinement. Some complained about the harshness of their living conditions. According to them, being unable to communicate with anyone for long periods, sometimes well in excess of a year, is hard to bear. Prisoners placed in solitary confinement have no effective administrative remedy at their disposal, and most of those I spoke to regard solitary confinement as a disguised disciplinary punishment.

In view of the fact that one of the requirements of the solitary confinement regime is that the prisoners concerned should have no contact with other prisoners, it is very difficult to allow them to exercise the rights vested in all prisoners not subject to a disciplinary punishment, which should clearly be the case for those in solitary confinement. For example, to allow them to use the library or a sports hall, care must be taken to ensure that no one else enters these premises at the same time. As we know, owing to prison overcrowding, it is already quite difficult to ensure access for ordinary prisoners to these services. Most of those I spoke to therefore complained that it was impossible for them to exercise the rights to which they should normally be entitled. The same applies to the possibility of engaging in a gainful occupation. In theory, prisoners in solitary confinement are entitled to that, but in practice they may only do so inside their own cell, which is highly problematical in view of the scarcity of work opportunities in general.",

I therefore call on the French authorities to take rapid action to bring solitary confinement into line with European standards, in particular those upheld by the CPT. I think there is a need for legislative provisions or regulations to govern the solitary-confinement procedure. The adversarial system already introduced for disciplinary punishments should apply to the solitary-confinement procedure. Lastly, I think it would be in keeping with the spirit of the principle of legal certainty if a judicial body were henceforth able to participate in the procedure, for example the judge responsible for sentence enforcement.",

Excluding prisoners from these activities amounts to a disguised punishment. Such changes are bound to lighten the already quite heavy atmosphere which I found in the places of detention visited.",

The applicant could take showers only very rarely, often having to wait several months between one and the next. On this subject the Court refers to the conclusions in the report produced by the CPT following its visit to Transdniestria in 2000 ..., in which it described isolation for so many years as indefensible.",

Despite this, we are able to agree with the CPT and the majority that the conditions were \u201cglobally acceptable\u201d. Nonetheless, it is undeniable that physical conditions are closely related to the length of detention and that conditions which it may be humanly possible to bear for several months will inevitably become increasingly harsh and unbearable as the years go by and the level of suffering grows.",

We agree with that assessment. However, it is important to compare like with like. As the judgment rightly states (see paragraph 134), in the Rohde case the applicant was held in solitary confinement for eleven and a half months (less than the one-year period for which ministerial review is required under French law), whereas Mr\u00a0Ramirez Sanchez was held under the same regime for eight years and two months, in other words for a period eight times as long.",

In the present case, the Court described the applicant\u2019s isolation as \u201cpartial and relative\u201d, as if a scale of the seriousness of such a prison regime had been established. However, no such scale exists. The French legislation does not contain any qualifiers, but simply refers to \u201csolitary confinement\u201d (mise \u00e0 l\u2019isolement), \u201csolitary-confinement measure\u201d (mesure d\u2019isolement) and \u201cplacement in solitary confinement\u201d (placement \u00e0 l\u2019isolement).

Indeed, despite the legislature\u2019s oversight in not setting a maximum period (and it is this that is perhaps the source of the arbitrariness), it is implicit in the detailed statutory regulations on solitary confinement that extending the measure beyond a year is inherently dangerous and should only be done in exceptional circumstances.",

In the present case, the orders successively prolonging the applicant\u2019s solitary confinement did not set out any real reasons. They are statements in general terms that are often reproduced from one document to the next and which are devoid of the genuine reasons and objective evidence required by the legislation.

However, as far back as 23 May 2001, the doctor in charge of the Outpatient Consultation and Treatment Unit wrote to the governor of La Sant\u00e9 Prison to say that even though the applicant was in reasonable physical and mental condition \u201cstrict solitary confinement for more than six years and nine months is ultimately bound to cause psychological harm\u201d and that it was his duty as a doctor to alert the governor \u201cto these potential consequences\u201d (see paragraph 58 of the judgment). On 13 June 2002 an assistant doctor from the Outpatient Consultation and Treatment Unit at La Sant\u00e9 Prison stated that, from the medical standpoint, \u201cthe problem posed by prolonged solitary confinement over a number of years is that it may affect the prisoner\u2019s physical and mental health\u201d (see paragraph 65).
