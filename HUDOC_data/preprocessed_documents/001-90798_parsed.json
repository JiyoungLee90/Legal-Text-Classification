The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. It is incumbent on the respondent Government claiming non-exhaustion to indicate to the Court with sufficient clarity the remedies to which the applicants have not had recourse and to satisfy the Court that the remedies were effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that they were accessible, were capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Aksoy v.

The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of an individual within their control is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (see, among other authorities, Orhan v.

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention.

The Court notes that the applicants produced a copy of Ms\u00a0M.M.\u2019s statement, whereas the Government failed to furnish the Court with a copy of the transcript of the witness interview on which they relied. It further observes that the applicants stated that the perpetrators had acted in a manner similar to that of a security operation. In particular, they had arrived in a large group in military vehicles during the night, had checked the identity papers of a man living in the flat and had searched the flat. Also, the intruders had spoken Russian without an accent and had had a Slavic appearance.

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur v.  [GC], no.\u00a021594/93, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 1999III). In particular, there is an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa v. , 2\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102-104, Reports 1998-VI, and Mahmut Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022535/93, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-107, ECHR 2000-III). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan\u00a0v. the , no.\u00a037715/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-92, 4 May 2001).",

In that context, it has repeatedly stressed that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. To minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104).",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. Failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

The Court observes that the provisions of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the Government referred, do not preclude disclosure of the documents from the file of an ongoing investigation, but rather set out the procedure for and limits to such disclosure.

She stated that Isa Zaurbekov had worked as a car mechanic and that she could have counted on 30% of his monthly wages. The first applicant submitted that she was unable to provide any document concerning Isa Zaurbekov\u2019s exact earnings at the material time, but stated that in any event his income had been no less than the allowance of an unemployed person having the same qualifications. The first applicant based her calculations on the actuarial tables for use in personal injury and fatal accident cases published by the United Kingdom Government Actuary\u2019s Department in 2004 (\u201cthe Ogden tables\u201d), with reference to the absence of any equivalent methods of calculation in Russia.",

It finds that there is indeed a direct causal link between the violation of Article\u00a02 and the loss by the first applicant of the financial support which her son could have provided for her. The Court further finds that the loss of earnings applies to dependants and considers it reasonable to assume that Isa Zaurbekov would have had some earnings and that the first applicant would have benefited from them. Having regard to the applicants\u2019 submissions, the Court does not consider the amounts sought by the first applicant excessive.
