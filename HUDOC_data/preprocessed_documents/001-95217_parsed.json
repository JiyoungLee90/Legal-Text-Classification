This is significant because, if the Court of Cassation were to hold a hearing, the appellant would be notified of its date and would therefore be aware that the decision would be given either at the end of that hearing or within a period of one week thereafter. In the latter instance, the Court expects the applicant to show a certain degree of diligence and obtain a copy of the decision from the registry of the first-instance court (see, for example, Okul v. Turkey (dec.), no. 45358/99, 4\u00a0September 2003).",

In these circumstances, and having regard to the similar cases referred to above, the Court considers that the applicant would only have become aware that his conviction had been upheld by the Court of Cassation and that the decision of the Court of Cassation had been deposited with the registry of the first-instance court, when he was arrested on 7 October 2002 and sent to prison to serve his sentence.
