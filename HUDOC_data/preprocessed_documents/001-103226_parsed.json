In particular, it did not find any plausible explanation as to the reason for his injuries, or provide a substantiated response to his arguments concerning the unlawfulness of his arrest and detention or his allegations that he had been questioned about P.'s robbery in violation of procedural guarantees enshrined in the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Notwithstanding that finding, the subsequent refusals to initiate criminal proceedings reiterated the same conclusion, without further reasoning.",
