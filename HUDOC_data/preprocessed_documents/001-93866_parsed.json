In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

The applicant\u2019s failure to ask the supervisory-review court to ensure his presence at the time when he lodged his application could not have been regarded by the domestic authorities as an unequivocal waiver of his right. Pursuant to the Russian Code of the Criminal Procedure, it was first incumbent on the supervisory-review court to inform the applicant that his request for supervisory review had been granted and communicate to him the time, date and place of the scheduled hearing (see paragraph 25 above). The Court notes that the Presidium of the  did send such notice to the applicant. However, the applicant received it only after the supervisory-review hearing had already taken place.",
