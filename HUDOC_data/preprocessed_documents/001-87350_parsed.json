He was himself an eyewitness to the events and relied on statements by other eyewitnesses, collected by the applicant himself and by the investigation, including his daughter, wife and neighbours, which referred to the involvement of the military or security forces in the abduction. The applicant and the other witnesses stated that the perpetrators had acted in a manner similar to that of a security operation \u2013 they had checked the residents\u2019 identification papers and had spoken Russian without any accent. Furthermore, the applicant and his wife had identified one of the men involved in the abduction at the Staropromyslovskiy VOVD. The applicant referred also to the fact that several other residents had been apprehended on that date. Some of them were released later and stated that they had been held together with Magomed Umarov in a pit in Khankala, and when the latter had been taken out of the pit together with two other persons, they had heard somebody saying \u201cTake them to the Khankala post!\u201d. In his applications to the authorities the applicant consistently maintained that his son had been detained by unknown servicemen and requested the investigation to look into that possibility.",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee.

A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their possession without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention. In a case where the application raises issues as to the effectiveness of the investigation, the documents of the criminal investigation are fundamental to the establishment of the facts and their absence may prejudice the Court\u2019s proper examination of the complaint both at the admissibility and at the merits stage (see Tanr\u0131kulu v.

In particular, the Assanidze judgment ordered the respondent State to secure the applicant\u2019s release so as to put an end to the violations of Article 5 \u00a7 1 and Article 6 \u00a7 1, whereas in the Tahsin Acar\u00a0judgment the effective investigation was mentioned in the context of the Court\u2019s examination of the respondent Government\u2019s request for the application to be struck out on the basis of their unilateral declaration. The Court further notes its above finding that in the present case the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined at its early stages by the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to take meaningful investigative measures (see paragraphs 103-106 above). It is therefore very doubtful that the situation existing before the breach could be restored. In such circumstances, having regard to the established principles cited above and the Government\u2019s argument that the investigation is currently under way, the Court finds it most appropriate to leave it to the respondent Government to choose the means to be used in the domestic legal order in order to discharge their legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention.",
