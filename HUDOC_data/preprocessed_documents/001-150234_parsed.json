These persons were of the view that the system of presumed consent meant that \u201ceverything which is not forbidden is allowed\u201d. The investigators, on the other hand, were of the opinion that section 2 of the Law gave a clear indication that the Latvian legal system relied more on the concept of \u201cinformed consent\u201d and, accordingly, removal was permissible only when it was (expressly) allowed, that is to say when consent had been given either by the donor during his or her lifetime or by the relatives.",

In exchange for the supply of tissue to the company, the Forensic Centre had organised the purchase of different medical equipment, instruments, technology and computers for medical institutions in Latvia and the company had paid for these purchases. Within the framework of the agreement, the total monetary value of the equipment for which the company had paid exceeded the value of the removed tissue that was sent to the company. In the decision of 14 April 2008 (see paragraph 27 below) it was noted that the tissue was not removed for transplantation purposes in accordance with section 10 of the Law but was actually removed for transformation into other products to be used for patients not only in Latvia, but also in other countries.",

According to the testimonies of all the relatives, they would not have consented to the removal of organs or tissue had they been informed and their wishes established. According to the experts\u2019 testimonies, they had merely checked passports for stamps and had not sought relatives\u2019 consent as they had not been in contact with them. It was also noted that with effect from 1 January 2002 information was to be sought from the population register, which the experts had failed to do. It was concluded that the experts, including N.S., had contravened section 4 of the Law and had breached the relatives\u2019 rights.

Programmes are more able to rely on the deceased\u2019s explicit or presumed consent, without seeking further permission from family members, when the public\u2019s understanding and acceptance of the process of donating cells, tissues and organs is deep-seated and unambiguous.

The Government provided some examples of domestic case-law pertaining to the application of section 1635 in practice. They referred to the proceedings in case PAC-714 (instituted on 7 February 2005), where a claimant had sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage from a hospital where she had given birth and where tubal ligation (surgical contraception) had been performed without her consent (referring to L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, \u00a7 8, 29April 2014).

This judgment had taken effect on 10 February 2007.

Latvia, no. 45744/08, \u00a7 50, 21 December 2010). The Court observes that the applicant was originally unaware of the fact that tissue from her husband\u2019s body had been removed; she learned about it only when the security police opened a criminal inquiry into these facts. Subsequently, she availed herself of the criminal avenue of redress \u2013 she was declared an injured party in these proceedings and she pursued them by lodging various complaints with the investigating and prosecuting authorities. The criminal-law remedy could have given rise to a finding that the removal of tissue from her husband\u2019s body had been carried out contrary to the domestic procedure and that her rights as the closest relative had been breached. It could eventually have led to a compensation award, given that the Latvian legal system recognises victims\u2019 rights to lodge civil claims in criminal proceedings and to request compensation for damage suffered as a result of a crime (see paragraphs 54-55 above). In such circumstances, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant could have legitimately expected that the criminal-law remedy would not be an effective one in her case.",

It has also held that the refusal of the investigating authorities to return the bodies of deceased persons to their relatives constituted an interference with the applicants\u2019 private and family life (see Sabanchiyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 38450/05, \u00a7 123, ECHR 2013, and Maskhadova and Others v. Russia, no. 18071/05, \u00a7 212, 6 June 2013).

The Court notes that there is no dispute between the parties that the applicant\u2019s right \u2013 established under domestic law \u2013 to express consent or refusal in relation to the removal of tissue from her husband\u2019s body comes within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention in so far as private life is concerned.

The applicant referred to sections 4 and 11 of the Law and argued that in 2001 the system of \u201cexplicit consent\u201d had operated in Latvia. The applicant was of the opinion that the experts should have enquired whether the closest relatives had agreed or objected to tissue removal and that they had been under an obligation to do so under the aforementioned provisions. She argued that the aim of the Law was to protect the body of a deceased person and that it was necessary for this aim to be taken into account when interpreting its provisions. In this connection she also referred to international material (see paragraph 37 above). Lastly, the 2004 amendments to the Law demonstrated that previously the system of \u201cexplicit consent\u201d had prevailed. The discussion regarding \u201cexplicit\u201d and \u201cpresumed\u201d consent systems in Latvia had only started at about the time that the criminal inquiry was opened in the present case. As a result, substantive legislative amendments had been passed by Parliament in 2004 (see paragraph 50 above). The applicant submitted that even after these amendments the relevant legal provisions were still not clear enough, but their wording had been changed to establish the system of \u201cpresumed consent\u201d.",

It has to be borne in mind, however, that the issue before the Court in the present case is not the general question of whether the respondent State should provide for a particular consent system. The issue is rather the applicant\u2019s right to express wishes in connection with the removal of tissue from her husband\u2019s body after his death and the domestic authorities\u2019 alleged failure to ensure the legal and practical conditions for the exercise of that right.",

On the other hand, various supervising prosecutors concluded that by removing the tissue without prior express consent the experts had breached the law and were to be held criminally liable (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 25 above). Eventually, the security police accepted the prosecutors\u2019 interpretation of the domestic law and found that the rights of the closest relatives, including the applicant, had been breached. However, any criminal prosecution had in the meantime become time-barred (see paragraph 27 above). Lastly, a domestic court, while accepting that the closest relatives had the right to express consent or refusal in relation to the removal of tissue, overruled the view adopted by the prosecution and found that the domestic law did not impose an obligation on the experts to inform the closest relatives and explain their rights to them. The experts could not be convicted of breaching an obligation which was not clearly established by law (see paragraph 28 above).",

In this regard, the Court refers to the domestic court\u2019s finding that, although section 4 of the Law provided for the right of the closest relatives to refuse the removal of the deceased person\u2019s organs and/or tissue, it did not impose an obligation on the expert to explain this right to the relatives (see paragraph 28 above). The Government also relied on this statement to argue that the tissue removal had not been unlawful (see paragraphs 97 and 99 above). The Court therefore concludes that, although Latvian law set out the legal framework allowing the closest relatives to express consent or refusal in relation to tissue removal, it did not clearly define the scope of the corresponding obligation or the margin of discretion conferred on experts or other authorities in this respect. The Court notes, in this connection, that the relevant European and international documents on this matter accord particular importance to the principle that the relatives\u2019 views must be established by means of reasonable enquiries (see paragraphs 34 et seq. above). More specifically, as noted in the Explanatory Report to the Additional Protocol, whichever system a State chooses to put in place \u2013 be it that of \u201cexplicit consent\u201d or that of \u201cpresumed consent\u201d \u2013 appropriate procedures and registers should also be established.

Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7\u00a7 147 and\u00a0184, ECHR 2004V). Following the death of the applicant\u2019s husband on 19\u00a0May 2001, an expert from the Forensic Centre was authorised to remove tissue from his body within twenty-four hours of verifying that his passport did not contain a special stamp denoting objection (see paragraph 16 above). However, it appears that at the material time there was no common register of stamps that had been entered in passports in order to denote refusal of or consent to the use of the passport-holder\u2019s body after death (contrast with the situation following legislative amendments effective as of 1\u00a0January 2002 and the inclusion of this information in the population register, as described in Petrova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035). Moreover, it appears that there was no procedure for the State institutions and experts to follow in order to request and obtain this information. The Government argued that the expert had physically checked Mr Elberts\u2019 passport prior to removing the tissue, but the applicant claimed that her husband\u2019s passport was at home. Therefore, the procedure followed by the expert to verify the information contained in his passport remains unclear. Irrespective of whether or not the expert checked Mr\u00a0Elberts\u2019 passport, it remains unclear how the system of consent, as established under Latvian law at the material time, operated in practice in the circumstances in which the applicant found herself, where she had certain rights as the closest relative but was not informed how and when these rights might be exercised, still less provided with any explanation.",

In such circumstances it is all the more important that adequate mechanisms are put in place to counterbalance the wide margin of discretion conferred on the experts to carry out tissue removal on their own initiative (see paragraph 15), but this was not done (see also the international material cited in paragraphs 34 et seq. above). In response to the Government\u2019s argument that nothing had prevented the applicant from expressing her wishes in relation to tissue removal, the Court notes the lack of any administrative or legal regulation in this regard.

The Court therefore regards the final decision in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint as having been issued on 23 October 2008, when the criminal inquiry was discontinued by means of a final decision. It dismisses the preliminary objection in this respect.",

Relevant elements include the closeness of the family bond and the way the authorities responded to the relative\u2019s enquiries (see, for example, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 98, where this principle was applied in the context of enforced disappearance; Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v. Belgium, no. 13178/03, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2006-XI, where the Court further relied on this principle in consideration of a mother\u2019s complaint regarding her suffering on account of her five-year old daughter\u2019s detention in another country; and M.P. and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 22457/08, \u00a7\u00a7 122-24, 15\u00a0November 2011, where the relevant complaint concerned the suffering of the relatives of an abused child). In the cases cited the Court attached weight to the parent-child bond. It has held that the essence of a violation lay in the authorities\u2019 reactions and attitudes to the situation when it was brought to their attention (see Salakhov and Islyamova, cited above, \u00a7 200). Similar considerations may be said to be applicable in the present case involving the applicant and her deceased husband.",

In this context, the Government\u2019s argument that only dura mater was removed is of no relevance here. In any event, the applicant discovered this only during the proceedings before the Court. At the time of the events, the applicant had no reason to question the activities carried out in the Forensic Centre, as her husband\u2019s body had been delivered there to establish the cause of death. Subsequently, a criminal inquiry was opened to determine the legality of the tissue removal carried out in the Forensic Centre and it was revealed that tissue had been removed not only from her husband\u2019s body but also from hundreds of other persons (nearly 500 people in only three years, by way of example) over a period of some nine years (see paragraphs 13-33 above). It was also established that removals had been carried out under a State-approved agreement with a pharmaceutical company abroad. This scheme had been implemented by State officials \u2013 forensic experts \u2013 who, in addition to their ordinary duties of carrying out forensic examinations, had carried out removals on their own initiative (see paragraph 15 above). These are special factors which caused additional suffering for the applicant.",

The Court has already found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention because, as the closest relative, the applicant had a right to express consent or refusal in relation to tissue removal, but the corresponding obligation or margin of discretion on the part of the domestic authorities was not clearly established by Latvian law and there were no administrative or legal regulations in this respect (see paragraphs 109-16 above). While there are considerable differences between the present case and the above-cited Petrova case as concerns the scale and magnitude of the organ or tissue removal, the Court has nonetheless noted in both cases certain structural deficiencies which have prevailed in the field of organ and tissue transplantation in Latvia. These factors are also to be taken into account in the Latvian context as far as Article 3 of the Convention is concerned. In addition, not only were the applicant\u2019s rights as the closest relative not respected, but she was also faced with conflicting views on the part of the domestic authorities as to the scope of the obligations enshrined in national law. Furthermore, while the security police and various prosecutors disagreed as to whether or not domestic law was sufficiently clear to allow a person to be prosecuted on the basis thereof, they all considered that removal without consent was unlawful (see paragraphs 18, 20, 22, 24 and 25 above). However, criminal prosecution had become time-barred by the time their disagreement had been resolved (see paragraph 27 above) and, in any event, the domestic court would not have allowed such a prosecution because the law was not sufficiently clear (see paragraph 28 above). These facts demonstrate the manner in which the domestic authorities dealt with the complaints brought to their attention and their disregard vis-\u00e0-vis the victims of these acts and their close relatives, including the applicant. These circumstances contributed to feelings of helplessness on the part of the applicant in the face of a breach of her personal rights relating to a very sensitive aspect of her private life, namely giving consent or refusal in relation to tissue removal, and were coupled with the impossibility of obtaining any redress.",

She was not informed of the tissue removal and, having discovered that her deceased husband\u2019s legs were tied together on the day of the funeral, assumed this to be a consequence of the car accident. Two years later she was informed of the pending criminal inquiry and the potentially unlawful acts carried out in respect of her deceased husband\u2019s body. It is clear that at this point the applicant experienced particular anguish and realised that her husband might possibly have been buried with his legs tied together as a consequence of the acts that had been carried out in the Forensic Centre on his body. The Government\u2019s argument that this was not proved \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d is misplaced, since the applicant\u2019s complaint relates to the anguish resulting from precisely that uncertainty regarding the acts carried out at the Forensic Centre in respect of her deceased husband\u2019s body.",

The object of these treaties is to protect the dignity, identity and integrity of \u201ceveryone\u201d who has been born, whether now living or dead (see paragraph 37 above). As cited in paragraph\u00a0133 above, respect for human dignity forms part of the very essence of the Convention; treatment is considered \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention when, inter alia, it humiliates an individual, showing a lack of respect for human dignity. The applicant\u2019s suffering was caused not only by the breach of her rights as the closest relative and the ensuing uncertainty regarding what had been done in the Forensic Centre, but was also due to the intrusive nature of the acts carried out on her deceased husband\u2019s body and the anguish she suffered in that regard as his closest relative.",

This right is derived from the right of the deceased man to decide freely on the transplantation of his organs. The surviving relative acts as the depositary of the rights of the deceased. Therefore, the applicant may agree or object to the transplantation of her deceased husband\u2019s organs only in so far as she expresses the wishes of the deceased. Holding otherwise would transform the body of a deceased person into an object of arbitrary decisions by relatives.",

However close the connection between the two rights in question, the protection afforded to them under the Convention may be different. As I explained in my concurring opinion in Petrova, cited above, an individual\u2019s right to express the wishes of a deceased relative in respect of transplantation comes within the scope of family life, within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. The right under consideration ensures a multidimensional protection, since it protects not only the wishes of the deceased person but also those of the deceased person\u2019s relatives themselves, and relationships within the family. Whether the right to decide freely on the transplantation of one\u2019s own organs comes within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention is a separate issue.",

The meaning of \u201cprivate life\u201d is thus gradually being transformed into a general freedom of action, a notion which is known as allgemeine Handlungsfreiheit in German legal science. In my view, such an extensive interpretation of Article 8 in the Court\u2019s case-law does not have a sufficient legal basis in the Convention. The provision in question is sometimes misused to fill lacunae in the Convention protection.",

I do not see sufficiently strong arguments to consider that decisions concerning the transplantation of one\u2019s own organs are covered by the notions of private life or family life as understood under the rules of treaty interpretation established in international law.
