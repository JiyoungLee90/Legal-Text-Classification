However, it has not been disputed by the Government that throughout the events in question the applicants were under the exclusive control of the authorities and were not free in their movement. Specifically, both applicants were stopped at the airport at about 10.30 p.m. on 28 April 2014. The second applicant was under the control of the authorities until the moment of his hospitalisation during the night of 28\u00a0to 29 April 2014 while the first applicant was allowed to leave following the searches carried out in her apartment and the Association\u2019s office at about midnight on 29 April 2014 (see paragraph 19-24 above). In this connection, the Court reiterates that in order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5, the context in which action was taken is an important factor to be taken into account. Where a passenger has been stopped by border officials at border control in an airport in order to clarify his or her situation and where this detention has not exceeded the time strictly necessary to comply with the relevant formalities, no issue arises under Article 5 of the Convention (see Gahramanov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), no. 26291/06, \u00a7 40, 15 October 2013). By contrast, in the present case the applicants were not stopped in the context of security checks to be carried out prior to admission to an aircraft, but were obliged to accompany the police for the purpose of questioning as witnesses in the context of the criminal proceedings against a third party. Thus, having regard to the fact that the restriction of the applicants\u2019 freedom of movement lasted for many hours, excluded any possibility for them to leave and served the purpose of bringing them for questioning, the Court concludes that the applicants were deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, \u00a7\u00a0134, 31\u00a0May 2011).",

However, the Court notes that this accusation was not supported by any material. Notably, it remains unclear why the withdrawal of these sums from the NGO bank account was considered by the prosecution as a fraudulent activity, and not, for example, as payments of fees and remuneration in relation to the administration and management of the relevant projects by the first applicant. In this context, the Court notes that it does not appear from the case file that the donors of the relevant projects ever complained that the money paid under the grant agreements had not been properly spent for the purposes for which it had been allocated and that it had been misused by the first or second applicant by way of \u201cabuse of trust or deceit\u201d, which was one of the constituent elements of the criminal offence of \u201cfraud\u201d under Article 178 (see paragraph 75 above). Nor was there any other evidence which would have demonstrated the presence of such an element in order to form a reasonable suspicion that the applicants might have committed the above criminal act by abusing the trust of the donors (compare Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0132, as regards the charge of embezzlement).",

A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Farhad Aliyev v.

However, this duty to inform the public cannot justify all possible choices of words, but has to be carried out with a view to respecting the right of the suspects to be presumed innocent (see Pe\u0161a v. Croatia, no. 40523/08, \u00a7 142, 8 April 2010). The Court considers that the statement, assessed as a whole, was not made with the necessary discretion and circumspection. Notably, as regards the fact, invoked by the Government, that the statement ended by referring to the existence of a reasonable suspicion, the Court notes that this reference was made twice in the statement. The first reference to the existence of a reasonable suspicion was indicated only with respect to one of the episodes imputed to the first applicant as regards \u201ctaking possession by abuse of trust\u201d as opposed to other episodes incriminated to both applicants which were presented in the statement as established facts. As to the general reference to the existence of a reasonable to charge the applicants with the crimes, the Court notes this wording was negated by the preceding remarks in the statement which presented the applicants\u2019 involvement in the commission of those crimes as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, (see, mutatis mutandis, Ilgar Mammadov, \u00a7 127). Moreover, the reference to the existence of a suspicion against the applicants was not indicated at the beginning of the statement so that an external reader might understand that the applicants were merely suspected of having committed those crimes, but rather put in the end of the statement when a reader had already formed a view that the applicants had committed those crimes. Thus, the overall manner in which the statement was formulated gave the impression that the applicants were regarded as guilty before being so proved according to law.",

At the same time, according to the same Article of CCrP, in cases of urgency where there is a risk that the offender might destroy the property or otherwise obstruct the administration of justice, property could be frozen on the basis of a reasoned decision of an investigating authority. However, it does not appear that such a reasoned decision was taken in the present case, either by a court or an investigator, which would have demonstrated an existence of reasonable grounds to freeze the applicants\u2019 bank accounts. They had been frozen on the basis of a simple request addressed by the prosecuting authorities to the bank by mere reference to the \u201cemerging necessity\u201d within a criminal case. Such a request does not appear to be in compliance with the above-mentioned requirements of domestic law.",
