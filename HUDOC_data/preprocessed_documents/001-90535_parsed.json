Bulgaria, no.\u00a056796/00, \u00a7\u00a056, 26 October 2006).

Where no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the time-limit expires six months after the date of the acts or measures complained of, or after the date of knowledge of that act or its effect or prejudice on the applicant (see Younger v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a057420/00, ECHR 2003-I).

This decision, however, was final and there were no further sufficiently accessible and effective remedies to exhaust, including the extraordinary remedies which could be initiated under Article 294 of the CAO with a prosecutor or the president of a higher court (see Galstyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42). The applicant nevertheless tried this avenue for review by submitting both an appeal to the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal and a request for appeal to the General Prosecutor (see paragraph 11 above). On 2 March 2003 the President of the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal decided to review the final decision of the District Court of 26 February 2003, on the basis of the applicant\u2019s extraordinary appeal. The applicant lodged his application with the Court on 28\u00a0August\u00a02003, which is more than six months from the date of the District Court\u2019s decision but less than six months from the date of the decision of the Court of Appeal. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the decision of the Court of Appeal taken on the basis of the applicant\u2019s extraordinary appeal restarted the running of the six-month period as far as the final decision of the District Court is concerned.",

However, the Court has also accepted that situations in which a request to reopen the proceedings is successful and actually results in a reopening may be an exception to this rule (see Pufler v. France, no.\u00a023949/94, Commission decision of 18 May 1994, Decisions and Reports 77-B, p. 140; Korkmaz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 42576/98, 17 January 2006; and Atk\u0131n v.

The Court, however, does not consider that the mere fact of reopening proceedings will restart the running of the six month period. It cannot be excluded that a case may be reopened on grounds unrelated to the Convention complaints which an applicant may later lodge with the Court and the Court doubts that such a reopening will affect the calculation of the six month period. Since Article 35 \u00a7 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court before his position in connection with his complaint has been finally settled at the domestic level (see Petrie and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 29703/05, 6 February 2007), it means that an applicant is required under that Article to seize the Court once his position in connection with his complaint has been finally settled and the reopening of a case on unrelated grounds will not affect the finality of the settlement in respect of that particular issue. The Court therefore considers that, in cases where proceedings are reopened or a final decision is reviewed, the running of the six month period in respect of the initial set of proceedings or the final decision will be interrupted only in relation to those Convention issues which served as a ground for such a review or reopening and were the object of examination before the extraordinary appeal body. A different approach would also be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, on which the Convention machinery is founded and which requires that the complaints intended to be made at the international level should first be aired in substance before the domestic courts (see Azinas v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a056679/00, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2004III).",

The only issue raised in that appeal concerned the alleged unlawfulness of the interference with his right to freedom of assembly. The Court further notes that the Court of Appeal did not address of its own motion any of those issues either, apart from upholding the applicant\u2019s conviction under Article 180.1 of the CAO and modifying the penalty imposed by the District Court. Thus, the complaints raised by the applicant before the Court in connection with the decision of the District Court, apart from the one concerning the alleged unlawfulness of the interference with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly, were not the object of examination before the Court of Appeal and the grounds on which the Court of Appeal decided to review the final decision of the District Court cannot be seen as being in any way related to those complaints. The Court therefore concludes that the review of the final decision of the District Court by the Court of Appeal upon the applicant\u2019s extraordinary appeal did not re-start the running of the six-month period in respect of those complaints.",

Spain (dec.), no.\u00a064359/01, ECHR 2002IX (extracts)). The Court notes that, even if the applicant pursued his complaint under Article 11 through an extraordinary remedy which has been already found by the Court to be ineffective (see Galstyan, cited above), this actually led to the re-examination of his case on that particular ground and a new decision on the merits. In such circumstances, and bearing in mind that Article 35 must be interpreted with some flexibility (see Ahtinen v. Finland (dec.), no.\u00a048907/99, 31\u00a0May\u00a02005), the Court does not consider that this complaint was introduced out of time.",

It further reiterates that Article 6 does not apply to proceedings concerning a failed request to reopen a case. Only the new proceedings, after the reopening has been granted, can be regarded as concerning the determination of a criminal charge (see Vanyan v. Russia, no.\u00a053203/99, \u00a7\u00a056, 15 December 2005). The Court does not, however, consider it necessary to determine this issue in the present case, since the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 about the proceedings before the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal is, in any event, inadmissible for the following reasons.",

It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the court and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question of whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see, among other authorities, Hiro Balani v.
