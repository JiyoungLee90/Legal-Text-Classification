Thirdly, it is apparent from the details of the scheme considered in Tsfayo that whereas in the case of prospective benefit, central government reimbursed the local authority 95% of what it was required to pay, it only reimbursed 50% of backdated awards (see paragraph 19 of the decision); this fact had been heavily relied upon in argument (see paragraph 37 of the decision) for the powerful contention that the hearing had taken place before a tribunal consisting of members of an authority which would be required to pay 50% of the benefit if it made an award in the applicant\u2019s favour; the HBRB was not independent of the parties. Finally when the housing benefits scheme was looked upon as a whole, it was readily apparent that a conclusion could be reached, in contradistinction to the scheme under Part VII of the Housing Act, that the particular scheme was not compliant with Article 6.1.\u201d",

Italy, cited above, \u00a7 19, and Tsfayo v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 40). However, the present case differs from previous cases concerning welfare assistance, as the assistance to be provided under section 193 of the 1996 Act not only was conditional but could not be precisely defined (compare, for example, Tsfayo, in which the dispute concerned a fixed financial amount of housing benefit). It concerns, as the Government noted, a \u201cbenefit in kind\u201d and the Court must therefore consider whether a statutory entitlement to such a benefit may be a \u201ccivil right\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1. In this regard, the Court agrees with the Government that the Russian authorities relied upon by the applicant are of little assistance as they concerned the enforceability of pre-existing domestic judgments on the right to housing and, as such, no consideration was given to the question before the Court in the present case.",

Nonetheless, the Court is not persuaded that all or any of these factors necessarily militate against recognition of such an entitlement as a \u201ccivil right\u201d. For example, in Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, in which the applicant\u2019s entitlement to an invalidity pension depended upon a finding that she was at least 66.66% incapacitated, the Court accepted that Article 6 \u00a7 1 applied. In any case, the \u201cdiscretion\u201d in the present case had clearly defined limits: once the initial qualifying conditions under section 193(1) had been met, pursuant to section 206(1) the Council was required to secure that accommodation was provided by one of three means, namely by providing accommodation itself; by ensuring that the applicant was provided with accommodation by a third party; or by giving the applicant such advice and assistance to ensure that suitable accommodation was available from a third party. In this regard, the Court agrees with Hale LJ in Adan v. Newham London Borough Council, in which she opined that the right to accommodation under section 193 \u201cis more akin to a claim for social security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services, where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and resource considerations may also be relevant\u201d.",
