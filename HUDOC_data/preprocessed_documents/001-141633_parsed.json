In particular, during his stay in the SIZO, he was frequently moved from cell to cell and often arbitrarily placed in the quarantine block with new arrivals who were subjected to monitoring for contagious diseases. The applicant and his codetainees were not allowed to leave the cells except for a one-hour walk per day. The cells sometimes housed twenty or more inmates per ten-bed cell, so the detainees had to take turns to sleep. As a result, the applicant\u2019s mental alertness during trial was impeded by sleep deprivation. Furthermore, on court days the applicant was often taken out of his cell at about 6 a.m. and placed in a special transit box, which measured some 1520 square meters, had no windows and no heating, with twenty to thirty other inmates. He had to wait several hours in those conditions for a prison van to come. Following his return from the court, he again had to wait for several hours in the same box before being escorted to his regular cell. As a result, he missed meal times and was often left hungry. The so-called \u201cpacked lunches\u201d provided to the applicant on court days, consisted only of bread. Sometimes hot meals were made available in the court building, but their supply was irregular. In addition, the applicant received no medical assistance in SIZO for his vegetative-vascular dystonia and mitral valve prolapse (a chronic heart dysfunction).",

As regards the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant should also have ventilated them before the SIZO administration, the Court reiterates that in principle hierarchical complaints do not constitute an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see as a recent authority Znaykin v. Ukraine, no.\u00a037538/05, \u00a7\u00a068, 7 October 2010). Furthermore, given the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaints in the present case, the Court considers that they stemmed from administrative practices, and that the SIZO administration was well aware of the applicant\u2019s situation. Regard being had to the structural nature of the problems giving rise to the applicant\u2019s complaints, the Court finds no reason to depart from its earlier approach and dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.",

In view of these findings, it does not find it necessary to address the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the sanitary and other arrangements in the Odessa SIZO.",

It also appears that the applicant, who was represented at the material time by M., his chosen lawyer, had ample opportunities to request further time \u2013 either before the commencement of the court proceedings or at the preparatory hearing. Similar requests by his co-defendants were granted during that time. It is further notable that neither in his application to the Regional Court, nor in his cassation appeal lodged with the Supreme Court, did the applicant indicate what materials in the case file, which concerned various episodes of criminal activity by eleven defendants, he had needed to review further and in which way his ability to defend himself was prejudiced by his inability to obtain additional time to review these materials in the original form. Likewise, in his submissions before the Court, the applicant did not expound on this issue and referred exclusively to the fact that the case file was comprised of many volumes. He also did not argue that the only way for him to obtain access to the necessary documents was by studying the original file. In these circumstances it is not for the Court to decide in abstracto how much time is necessary to study a case file of a given volume.",

Having been arrested off the record on 19 December 2002, the applicant had been ill-treated and pressured to collaborate with the investigation. As a result, after the arrest report had been drawn up on 20\u00a0December 2002, he had agreed to sign a waiver of his right to a lawyer, which had not been genuine. Secondly, at the material time the applicant had had no funds to hire a private lawyer, and the legal-aid lawyer, Sh., appointed to him on 28 December 2002, who had been present during only one questioning session, had not provided him with the requisite assistance. Thirdly, the investigative authorities had failed to inform the applicant that the appointment of a lay defender had not extinguished his right to legal counsel. As a result, for a certain period of time during the pre-trial investigation (in March and April 2003) the applicant had been represented only by a lay defender (his father). Finally, the trial court had arbitrarily removed the applicant\u2019s father from the position of his lay defender.",

They noted that on 20\u00a0December\u00a02002 the applicant had signed several documents apprising him of his defence rights and had provided extensive handwritten explanations as to why he had chosen to waive his right to legal representation. As soon as the applicant had requested a lawyer, he had been appointed one. This lawyer had subsequently been replaced with lawyers of the applicant\u2019s choice, when he had so wished. While the applicant\u2019s father had been appointed as his lay defender on 14 March 2003, the applicant had not requested Sh. to step down until 17 April 2003, on which date he had asked for her to be replaced by two other lawyers. This request had been allowed on 21 April 2003. So, de jure, the applicant had been represented by a lawyer and his father most of the time. In so far as the applicant had not insisted that both his father and his lawyer be present during some of the investigative actions, it had been his procedural choice, for which the State authorities could not be held responsible. Eventually, three lawyers had been admitted in the proceedings at the applicant\u2019s request and they had provided him with the requisite legal assistance during the investigation. During his trial and in the cassation proceedings the applicant had again been represented by lawyers of his choice, who had actively defended his interests. Lastly, concerning the removal of the applicant\u2019s father from the proceedings, he was not a lawyer. His participation in the proceedings did not therefore fall within the ambit of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c) of the Convention.

France, no.\u00a029731/96, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR 2001II). As a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided from the first questioning of a suspect by the investigative authority, unless it can be demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were compelling reasons to restrict this right (see\u00a0Salduz\u00a0v. Turkey\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7\u00a055, 27 November 2008). The very fact of unjustified restriction of access of a detained suspect to a lawyer may prejudice the rights of the defence even where no incriminating statements were obtained as a result (see Dayanan v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a07377/03, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, 13 October 2009). At the same time, neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial, as long as a waiver of the right is given in an unequivocal manner and was attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Salduz v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 59 and Paskal v. Ukraine, no. 24652/04, \u00a7\u00a076, 15 September 2011).",

The Court can therefore not examine the relevant allegations. It appears from the available materials that after his arrest on 20 December 2002 and before the appointment of Sh. as his legal-aid lawyer, the applicant was questioned twice. Before each of these questionings, the applicant signed documents containing very detailed descriptions of his procedural rights and provided reasoned handwritten explanations as to why he chose to waive his right to a lawyer (see paragraphs 7-9 above). There is no medical or other evidence that the applicant had signed those waivers under pressure or as a result of illtreatment. Moreover, based on the case-file documents, on 28 December 2002 the applicant explicitly denied any ill-treatment allegations during his questioning in the presence of his legal-aid lawyer, Sh. He also did not pursue any ill-treatment complaints before the prosecutorial authorities at a later date and did not raise any relevant complaint in his cassation appeal. Furthermore, the applicant did not give any self-incriminating statements in the course of the questionings at issue. On the contrary, he consistently denied all the charges against him, as he also did during the subsequent proceedings. In light of all the above, the Court has no basis on which to conclude that in waiving his right to legal representation between 20 and 28\u00a0December 2002 the applicant was misled, coerced or that he did not understand the consequences of his actions. The Court therefore finds that there was no undue restriction of the applicant\u2019s right to legal representation in respect of the period in question.",

The competent national authorities may be required under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (c) to intervene if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see Kamasinski v\u00a0 Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 168; Daud v. Portugal, 21\u00a0April 1998, \u00a7 38, Reports 1998-II; and Iglin, ibid.). In other situations, in view of the independence of the legal profession from the State, the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his counsel, whether that counsel be appointed under a legal-aid scheme or be privately financed (see Cuscani v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a032771/96, \u00a7\u00a039, 24\u00a0September 2002, and Iglin, ibid.).",

Although de facto the applicant took part in several investigative actions in March and April 2003 represented only by his father, there is no evidence that he was coerced or misled into accepting this situation or that he had no opportunity to refuse to take part in those activities in absence of a lawyer.

Ukraine, no. 16404/03, \u00a7\u00a039, 19 February 2009). Viewing the present complaint in the context of the more general right to mount one\u2019s defence, the Court reiterates that when appointing defence counsel, the national courts must have regard to the defendant\u2019s wishes. However, they can override those wishes when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (see Croissant v.\u00a0Germany, judgment of 25 September 1992, Series A no. 237-B, \u00a7 29, and Mayzit, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066). The applicant\u2019s father was removed from the proceedings on the grounds that he had abused his procedural rights notwithstanding a prior warning (see paragraph 29 above). His participation in the proceedings was complementary to that of the applicant\u2019s legal counsel, M. The Court therefore considers that the removal of the applicant\u2019s father from the proceedings did not constitute a disproportionate restriction of the applicant\u2019s right to defence or undermine the essence of his right to a fair trial.",

In the meantime, as follows from the materials on file, in 2006 the applicant, who received seven short visits and had one telephone conversation with his father, did not use up the short-visit and telephone conversation quotas established by the applicable law (see paragraph 46 above). It further appears that in December 2006, despite the absence of hostel facilities, the prison administration made a certain concession and allowed the applicant to have an unsupervised visit which lasted more than four hours. Neither the applicant, nor his parents lodged any complaints concerning having been restricted in their visiting rights. When the prosecutor\u2019s office started investigating the applicant\u2019s situation following a complaint lodged by the Committee for the Protection of Political Prisoners on his behalf, the applicant refused to pursue any claims against the prison administration (see paragraph 42 above). There is no evidence on file that pursuing such a complaint would have put the applicant at imminent risk of sanctions.",
