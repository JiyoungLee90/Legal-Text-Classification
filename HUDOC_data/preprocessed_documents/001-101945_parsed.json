It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, \u00a7\u00a035, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a040). This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69).",

Moreover, the Court lays emphasis on the fact that the District Court held, when convicting A. on 7\u00a0January 2002, that he should be sent to a hospital in order to undergo psychiatric treatment. As the applicant stresses, A. was shortly released from that hospital due to the District Court's failure to discharge its statutory obligation (under Article 351 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure set out at paragraph 20 above) to order the hospital to detain him and provide him with the treatment in question. As a result of the District Court's omission, the applicant and her lawyer were subjected to renewed threats from A., which led to the filing of fresh criminal complaints against him.",

It is clear that A.'s repeated threats following his release from hospital, which constitute the basis of the applicant's complaint under Article 8 of the Convention, did not actually materialise into concrete acts of physical violence (compare and contrast the case of Bevacqua, cited above, in which the Court found that the State had breached its positive obligations under Article 8). Notwithstanding, the Court considers that given A.'s history of physical abuse and menacing behaviour towards the applicant, any threats made by him would arouse in the applicant a well-founded fear that they might be carried out. This, in the Court's estimation, would be enough to affect her psychological integrity and well-being so as to give rise to an assessment as to compliance by the State with its positive obligations under Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",

Moreover, it was only after the applicant and her lawyer had filed fresh criminal complaints against A. that the police had taken it upon themselves to intervene. In this connection, it recalls that the domestic authorities were under a duty to take reasonable preventive measures where they \u201cknew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, the Court's judgment in the case of Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 116, Reports 1998VIII). The Court finds that A.'s conviction for violence against the applicant on 7\u00a0January 2002, A.'s criminal antecedents, and the District Court's own assessment that A. was in need of psychiatric treatment were sufficient, in the circumstances of the case, to render the domestic authorities aware of the danger of future violence and threats against the applicant. Furthermore, owing to the particular vulnerability of victims of domestic violence which the Court has highlighted on a number of occasions (see the Court's judgment in Opuz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0132, among other authorities), the domestic authorities should have exercised an even greater degree of vigilance in the present case.",
