The Government argued, firstly, that at the time when the  consolidated police units had moved onto the applicant's estate it had been left abandoned, and, secondly, that they had been unable to obtain prior approval from the local council as the latter had not been functioning at the time. The Government also submitted that the actions of the federal forces during the counter-terrorist operation on the territory of the Chechen Republic had been aimed at preventing disorder, crime and terrorist attacks, that is to say, above all, at protecting the interests of the residents of Chechnya, including the applicant and his family members, and that given that the Tambov police units had been entrusted with the task of protecting public order and preventing crime, their presence on the applicant's estate had ensured protection of the applicant's property against marauders.

Moreover, the applicant's brother entrusted the applicant with representation of his interests in the domestic proceedings, in which the applicant always participated both in his own name and on behalf of his brother. The Court notes in this latter respect that the domestic courts always accepted the applicant as the rightful co-owner of the estate and a due claimant and the representative of his brother. Furthermore, although the applicant's brother refused to participate in the proceedings before the Court, he clearly supports the application, given that he issued the applicant with a general power of attorney confirming the applicant's right to represent him should it be necessary (see paragraph 8). In such circumstances the applicant and his brother do not appear to have competing interests which could create difficulties, as reflected in the Court's case-law on the subject, and therefore the Court considers that the applicant can claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the impugned measures taken in respect of the plot of land and industrial premises transferred to the Nedra company.",

The Court has no doubt that the applicant retained sufficient links with the place, given that at the relevant period it was his only housing, he had not established his home elsewhere and always demonstrated his intention to return to the estate and reside there permanently, this intention being supported by the fact that, as indicated by him, the gas and heating were in service when the police moved in, which has never been disputed by the Government.

In particular, it has found, building on its dynamic interpretation of the Convention, that a company's right to respect for its registered office, branches or other business premises could fall within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention (see Niemietz v.\u00a0Germany, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251B, p.\u00a034,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a030; Chappell v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 March 1989, Series A no. 152A, pp. 12-13, \u00a7\u00a026, and p. 26, \u00a7\u00a063; and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Colas Est and Others v. France, no. 37971/97, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2002III). On the other hand, the Court has also held that some limits must be set to this broad interpretation of the \u201chome\u201d and dynamic interpretation of Article 8, to avoid flying in the face of common sense and completely subverting the intentions of the authors of the Convention, and has found, for example, that a farm specialising in pig production and housing several hundred pigs can scarcely be described as a \u201chome\u201d, or even as business premises (see Leveau and Fillon v. France (dec.), nos. 63512/00 and 63513/00, 6\u00a0September 2005). Similarly, in the present case the Court does not consider that the mill, bakery and storage facility, which appear to have been used entirely for industrial purposes, would constitute the applicant's home. In so far as the land is concerned, the Court observes that in its Loizidou judgment it held that the notion of \u201chome\u201d did not extend to land on which the applicant planned to build a house for residential purposes. In the instant case, it observes that, on the one hand, the applicant's dwelling was situated on the land in question, but, on the other, from the documents in the Court's possession it transpires that the plot of land had been assigned for business activity rather than for merely residential purposes, and that a number of industrial buildings had been erected thereon. Bearing in mind the above conclusion concerning industrial constructions, the Court considers that the land cannot be regarded as the applicant's \u201chome\u201d either.",

The Government, for their part, submitted written statements made in November\u00a02004 by police officers who had occupied the applicant's estate at various times during the relevant period and had claimed that they had left it intact, and a statement of the head of the local council of Bratskoye made in January 2007 to the effect that there had been some minor defects in the applicant's house after the police had finally vacated it. The Court is sceptical about these statements, as the Government did not corroborate them with any official documents pertaining to the period under consideration, such as certificates or reports attesting to the state of the applicant's property at the moment when the police units moved in, or replaced each other, or when they left the estate, which could confirm that the property had remained undamaged, as alleged by the officers. The Court notes in this respect that in a situation, where the State takes an individual's property for a certain period of time, such as in the present case, it is for the State to take appropriate steps to certify the state and condition of that property prior to, and to account for it after, the occupation.",

While vesting wide powers in State agents within the zone of the counter-terrorist operation, the legal provisions in question, however, did not define with sufficient clarity the scope of those powers and the manner of their exercise so as to afford an individual adequate protection against arbitrariness. The Court considers that the said legal provisions, formulated in vague and general terms, cannot serve as a sufficient legal basis for such a drastic interference as occupation for a prolonged period of time of an individual's housing and property. It also takes into account the fact that the Nadterechny District Court in its judgment of 14 February 2001 clearly held that the continuing occupation of the applicant's estate had been in breach of the national law.",

There is nothing in the said court decisions to indicate that the courts separately addressed the applicant's claim for compensation for the adverse occupation of his estate or his claim for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. In particular, the first-instance judgment remained totally silent as regards non-pecuniary damage, whilst the only sentence which may be understood as relating to the occupation is the conclusion that \u201cthe plaintiffs' arguments that the Ministry of the Interior had adversely occupied their property had proved groundless\u201d (see paragraph 50 above). The judgment, however, gives no explanation as to how the first-instance court reached that conclusion and never mentions elsewhere the applicant's claim relating to the occupation. The appellate instance, in its turn, endorsed the first-instance court's findings in summary fashion. It is therefore clear that the applicant's claims regarding compensation for the occupation and non-pecuniary damage remained without examination.

This latter finding, in the Court's view, cannot but imply that the consolidated police units had inflicted damage on the estate. It does not appear that the domestic courts, in the proceedings at issue, as such called into question the findings made in the judgment of 14 February 2001, or any other evidence on this matter, or ever disputed the fact that the applicant's estate had indeed been wrecked. Nevertheless, the domestic courts surprisingly considered it unproven that the applicant's estate had been occupied by the Ministry of the Interior and that it was the defendant Ministry which had damaged the applicant's property. The Court is perplexed by this conclusion and cannot see how it could be reconciled with the abundant evidence to the contrary, and, first of all, with the findings made in the judgment of 14 February 2001, or the replies from public officials. In the Court's view, the unreasonableness of this conclusion is so striking and palpable on the face of it that the decisions of the domestic courts in the 2002 proceedings can be regarded as grossly arbitrary, and by reaching that conclusion in the circumstances of the case the domestic courts in fact set an extreme and unattainable standard of proof for the applicant so that his claim could not, in any event, have had even the slightest prospect of success.",

Having regard to the documents submitted by the applicant and the fact that the Government did not dispute their authenticity, or the amounts indicated therein, which, in the Court's view, do not appear unreasonable, the Court accepts that the said amounts can serve as the basis for calculating the award in respect of the damage caused to the estate.

It is true that this coefficient was mentioned in the document of the Federal Agency for Construction, Housing Maintenance and Utilities dated 12 October 2006 (see paragraph 183 above) as the one applicable to the estimated costs of repair work in  in 2006 as compared to those in 2001.

The Court is of the opinion that, in so far as the applicant's claim relates to the period between 31 March 2000 and 14\u00a0June\u00a02002, when his estate was occupied by the police, it is covered by the award of compensation for the occupation of his estate in the amount of the rent he could have received if the premises had been rented. Indeed, on the assumption that the applicant had let the estate to the authorities under a lease agreement and had received the awarded amount in rent, this would not have absolved him of an obligation to rent some other housing to live, for which he could have paid using the rent for his estate. In such circumstances the Court rejects the applicant's claim for this period, as holding otherwise would amount to awarding the applicant double damages for the same violation of his rights. On the other hand, the Court considers that the present claim has a direct causal link with the violation of the applicant's right as a result of the damage inflicted on his estate. Having regard to the extent of the damage caused to the estate, it accepts the applicant's argument that it was uninhabitable after the police units had left and considers it appropriate to make an award for the period following the police withdrawal during which the applicant was unable to live in his property due to its poor state and had to pay for alternative accommodation. The Court also notes that the monthly rent paid by the applicant, namely RUB 3,000 (approximately EUR\u00a086), does not appear unreasonable. It therefore awards the applicant the rent he paid from 14\u00a0June\u00a02002 until 31\u00a0March\u00a02006 in the amount of EUR 4,000.",

The Court notes, however, that even assuming that the rates and data on which the calculations were based in this document could apply in Chechnya, the said document only gives an estimation of future profit from operation of a mill rather than providing concrete financial information regarding the applicant's actual income. The Court notes that the applicant did not adduce any other documents, such as, for example, his tax returns, capable of confirming that his business was at all profitable, and the amount of that profit. The Court notes in this connection that in their observations the Government referred to a statement of a certain official from the  to the effect that the Nedra company had been operating for a month and had not paid taxes to a local budget. It does not overlook the fact that the Government did not indicate the name of the official or submit his written statement, and recognises the practical difficulties for the applicant to obtain documents relevant to the activities of the Nedra company. However, in the absence of any reliable documents confirming that the applicant's business had brought him profit, the Court considers that any award regarding his lost earnings would be speculative. It therefore rejects this part of the applicant's claim.",
