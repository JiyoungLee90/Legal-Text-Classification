The Regional Court noted that Ms B. was notified of the request for legal aid only in mid-2007, hence more than two and a half years after the expiry of the limitation period. It considered that the exception foreseen by domestic law allowing for the retroactive effect of arranging for notice to be given was not applicable in the instant case. According to that exception, the running of time for the purposes of limitation was suspended with effect from the day a request for legal aid was lodged, if the notification of that request was arranged \u201cshortly after\u201d (demn\u00e4chst). The Regional Court noted that, according to the constant case-law of the domestic courts, the term \u201cshortly after\u201d was interpreted in a way that required the litigant to act with the necessary diligence to effect the immediate notice or service. It found that the applicant \u2013 who, as a lawyer, must have known that arranging for notice to be given to the defendant of his request for legal aid \u201cshortly after\u201d its submission was required to prevent his claim from becoming timebarred\u00a0\u2013 had in a reproachable manner contributed to the delay and thus not acted with the necessary diligence required. The Regional Court observed that the applicant had not asked the Regional Court to notify immediately the defendant of his request for legal aid, irrespective of its prospects of success, which he could have done without additional costs and without suffering any procedural disadvantages. Also, rather than enquiring whether the notification of the request had been arranged, the applicant limited himself to enquiring whether his request for legal aid had been successful. In relation to the alleged telephone calls in June 2005 and November 2005, it found that, given that the Regional Court had not responded to his written request of 24\u00a0March 2005, the applicant should not have relied on the registry\u2019s alleged statement. The court found it incomprehensible that the applicant had waited until 29\u00a0August 2005, and 11 May 2007, to enquire again in writing about the success of his request for legal aid.",

Furthermore, there must not be legitimate interests of the defendant that conflicted with such retroactive effect (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 26 below). It confirmed the Regional Court\u2019s finding that the applicant had not acted with the necessary diligence. It underlined that the applicant would have had to alert the Regional Court about the imminent expiry of the limitation period and to ask to arrange for the immediate notification of the defendant in order to suspend the running of time for the purposes of limitation. In fact the applicant had to take into account that the Regional Court also had the possibility to refuse his request for legal aid without hearing, and hence without notifying, the defendant if it considered the claim to be illfounded or the applicant to have the necessary means (decision a limine). The Court of Appeal likewise considered that the subsequent steps taken by the applicant were not sufficient, because he had not asked for the notification to be effected immediately.

The Court recalls that, whilst Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention guarantees to litigants an effective right of access to the courts for the determination of their \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d, it leaves to the State a free choice of means to be used towards this end (see Airey v. Ireland, 9\u00a0October 1979, \u00a7 26, Series A no. 32). There is no obligation under the Convention to make legal aid available for all disputes in civil proceedings, as there is a clear distinction between the wording of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c), which guarantees the right to free legal assistance on certain conditions in criminal proceedings, and of Article 6 \u00a7 1, which makes no reference to legal assistance (see Del Sol v. France, no. 46800/99, \u00a7 20, ECHR 2002II). Thus, the right of access to court is not absolute and may be subject to restrictions, provided that these pursue a legitimate aim and are proportionate. It may notably be acceptable to impose conditions on the grant of legal aid based, inter alia, on the financial situation of the litigant or his, her or its prospects of success in the proceedings (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2005II), provided that the legal aid system offers individuals substantial guarantees to protect them from arbitrariness (see Gnahor\u00e9 v.

The Court of Appeal, as confirmed by the Federal Constitutional Court, had rightly taken into account that the applicant had not alerted the Regional Court about the imminent expiry of the limitation period, nor had he asked to arrange for the immediate notification of the defendant, which he could have done without any costs or procedural disadvantages, nor had he specifically enquired about the notification of the defendant when he subsequently contacted the Regional Court in relation to his request for legal aid.

A litigant with sufficient financial means should not limit himself to submitting a lawsuit, but rather had to remind the court to ask him to pay the necessary court fees or even pay the fees on his own initiative, if the court had failed to ask him, in order to effect the service of the legal action (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 28 above). An impecunious litigant had to ask for the immediate notification of the defendant of the request for legal aid, and to remind the court to arrange for notice to be given (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 27 above). The Court considers that the respective obligations of both groups of litigants were nearly identical and any difference in treatment would not exceed the margin of appreciation afforded to Contracting States in regulating the right of access to a court.",
