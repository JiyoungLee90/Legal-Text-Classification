The Court has already found that refusing a detainee leave to attend a relative\u2019s funeral constitutes an interference with the right to respect for family life (see P\u0142oski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a026761/95, \u00a7 32, 12 November 2002; see also, mutatis mutandis, Schemkamper v.

The domestic decisions indicated by the Government might suggest that there was a practice in Romania recognising the existence of such a right and setting the conditions for granting leave to mentally ill persons to attend the funerals of their close family members.

The State can refuse an individual the right to attend his or her parents\u2019 funerals only if there are compelling reasons and if no alternative solution can be found (see P\u0142oski, cited above, \u00a7 37). In addition, the Court reiterates that perpetrators of criminal acts who suffer from mental disorders and are placed in psychiatric facilities are in a fundamentally different situation than other detainees, in terms of nature and purpose of their detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Ilnseher v.
