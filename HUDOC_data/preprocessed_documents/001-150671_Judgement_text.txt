The case originated in an application (no. 26127/11) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Péter Sikuta (“the applicant”), on 19 April 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Kádár, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 – read alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention – that the imposition of 98% tax on the upper bracket of his severance payment constituted an unjustified deprivation of property, or else taxation at a disproportionate rate, with no remedy available.
Moreover, he submitted under Article 8 that the legal presumption of the impugned revenues contravening good morals represented an interference with his right to a good reputation. Lastly, he argued that the tax in question – in reality, of a punitive character – had not been imposed in judicial proceedings conducted before the civil or the criminal courts – which, in his view, amounted to a breach of Article 6 of the Convention.
On 19 February 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Budapest.
On 1 July 2002 the applicant concluded an employment contract with a State-owned financial institution.
On 6 May 2010 the applicant’s employment was terminated by mutual agreement with effect from 30 July 2010. Under this agreement, on 17 May 2010 the employer paid the applicant, after payroll burdens, a net amount of 4,997,020 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 16,100 euros (EUR)), including his salary due until the termination of his employment, payment for unused annual leave and an additional five months’ salary.
Under new legislation (see paragraph 10 below) the gross amount corresponding to the above payment was subsequently taxed at a 98% rate in its part exceeding HUF 3.5 million; the income tax and social security contributions already paid (see paragraph 8 above) were deducted from the tax payable. Thus, the applicant had to pay an additional HUF 2,144,160 (approximately EUR 6,900) as special tax, until 20 May 2011.
