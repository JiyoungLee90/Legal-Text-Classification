The Convention institutions have always and unconditionally considered in their case-law that the parent, sibling or nephew of a person whose death is alleged to engage the responsibility of the respondent Government can claim to be the victim of an alleged violation of Article 2 of the Convention even where closer relatives, such as the deceased person's children, have not submitted applications (see Velikova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 41488/98, 18 May 1999, with further references). Furthermore, in a number of cases where complaints about the death of a person had been lodged by his or her partner and their relationship existed outside marriage, the Court recognised that the latter could claim to be personally affected by, and therefore a victim of, the alleged violations of the Convention in respect of his or her partner's death and the subsequent investigation (see Ceyhan Demir and Others v.

In her statement of 16 August 2005, produced before the Court, the first applicant explicitly referred to the third applicant as her \u201cson's wife Khadizhat Ismailovna Dudayeva\u201d and her \u201cdaughter-in-law Khadizhat\u201d. The applicants specified that the third applicant was Musa Ilyasov's common-law wife. They submitted statements by residents of their village to that effect, certified by the head of the village administration and the village imam, and the Court finds no reasons to question the authenticity or credibility of those documents. As regards the transcript of Ms S.'s interview submitted by the Government, the Court notes that it does not contain any reference to the particulars in her identity papers, whereas other interview transcripts furnished by the Government do contain such particulars. Furthermore, it reproduces almost verbatim the text of the first applicant's interview record and on one occasion refers to Musa Ilyasov as Ms S.'s \u201cson\u201d (see paragraph 59 above). In any event, the Court's task in the present case is not to establish the identity of Ms S. or her possible connection with the applicants, particularly given the fact that the Government provided no further information in that respect, but to decide whether the third applicant may claim to be a victim of the alleged violations of the Convention in connection with the disappearance of Musa Ilyasov.",

Secondly, in all the statements examined by the Court the applicants consistently referred to several APCs and UAZ vehicles. Furthermore, Ms\u00a0A. in her statement, the accuracy of which was not contested by the Government, confirmed that on the night of 11 August 2002 she had seen two APCs and two UAZ vehicles parked at the applicants' home. As regards the alleged presence of an ARV and a Niva vehicle at the scene, the Court observes that whenever the first applicant mentioned it, she explicitly stated that she herself had not seen it but had obtained that information from other persons. Lastly, in so far as the Government argued that the applicants had not seen their relative being put into any of the abductors' vehicles, the Court notes that the third applicant saw the armed men lead Musa Isayev outside his house with a pillow case on his head. The applicants also saw the abductors' vehicles leave shortly thereafter. The Court further observes that the applicants had been ordered to stay in their houses and considers that they could not be blamed for having complied with that order, given by a group of men armed with submachine guns. In those circumstances the Court cannot but assume that the intruders took Musa\u00a0Isayev with them, even though the applicants did not see the exact moment of his being put into any of the vehicles parked at their houses.",

However, beyond simply referring to those measures, the Government did not even specify the dates when they had allegedly been taken, let alone provide any supporting documents.

There is also no indication that the investigation made any attempts to find the vehicles described by the applicants or to identify their owners. Furthermore, although the Government vaguely referred to a \u201cdoor-to-door check\u201d in , it does not emerge from the available information that the investigation attempted to identify and question possible witnesses to Musa Ilyasov's abduction among the applicants' neighbours such as Ms A.",

In any event, it transpires from the documents submitted by the applicants that they were not properly informed even about the most basic decisions to suspend or resume the investigation. Accordingly, the investigators failed to ensure that the investigation was subjected to the required level of public scrutiny, and to safeguard the interests of the next of kin in the proceedings (see O\u011fur v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7 92, ECHR 1999III).",

In this connection the Court observes that the applicants, since they had no access to the case file and were not properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of the investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this regard that while the adjourning or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, it does not appear in the present case that the decisions to adjourn were made after the necessary investigative steps had been taken; this led to substantial periods of inactivity and hence unnecessary prolongation. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of occurred, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier, such as identifying the servicemen at the roadblock, could no longer usefully be conducted. Hence, it is extremely doubtful whether the remedy relied on would have had any prospect of success. Therefore, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
