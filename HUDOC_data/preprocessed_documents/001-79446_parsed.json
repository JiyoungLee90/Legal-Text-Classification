The Government admitted that the judgment had not been enforced in a timely manner, as the enforcement had taken place six years and one month after it had become final and enforceable. However, they submitted that the applicant had contributed to the length of the enforcement proceedings. In particular, he had not submitted the warrant of execution to the bailiffs' service until 28 April 2002, that is two years and four\u00a0months after the judgment of 17\u00a0December 1999 came into effect. The Government further admitted that the delay from 14\u00a0May 2002, when the enforcement proceedings were commenced, until 8\u00a0January 2003, when they were discontinued, was attributable to the domestic authorities. However, the subsequent delay, which started on 25\u00a0March 2003, when the domestic court of last instance reversed the decision of 8\u00a0January 2003 to discontinue the enforcement proceedings, and continued until the enforcement of the judgment in January 2006, was again attributable to the applicant since he had failed to re-apply for the warrant of execution necessary to proceed with the enforcement. As a result, after 25 March 2003 the enforcement of the judgment of 17\u00a0December 1999 was only made possible by the bailiffs' voluntary referral to the court for a warrant of execution enabling them to enforce the judgment. Therefore, the Government concluded that there had been interference with the applicant's rights under Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 thereto with regard to the period from 14 May 2002 to 8\u00a0January 2003. However, the period of 7\u00a0months and 25 days was not so long as to amount to a violation of the aforementioned provisions (see Presnyakov v. Russia (dec.), no. 41145/02, 10\u00a0November 2005; and Kolotkov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a041146/02, 9 March 2006).",

It is true that the enforcement proceedings were initiated by the applicant after a delay (see paragraph 11 above). However, the applicant cannot be considered responsible, since the court would not have issued him with a warrant of execution until 28\u00a0April\u00a02002 in any event. As soon as the applicant had obtained the warrant, he lodged it with the bailiffs' service. As to the Government's allegation regarding the applicant's failure to re-apply for a warrant of execution after the decision of 8\u00a0January\u00a02003 to discontinue the enforcement proceedings was quashed on appeal, the national legislation did not, in fact, require the applicant to take any action since the resumption of the enforcement proceedings was within the bailiff service's responsibility. In any event, as has emerged from the materials before the Court, the only reason for the non-compliance was the authorities' reluctance to act in accordance with the order of the court (see paragraph 10 above). Therefore, whether the bailiffs were involved in the enforcement proceedings or not did not change the situation. Moreover, a person who has obtained an enforceable judgment against the State as a result of successful litigation cannot be required to resort to enforcement proceedings in order to have it executed (see Metaxas v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a019, 27\u00a0May 2004; Gorokhov and Rusyayev v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7 33; Koltsov v.

The Court therefore concludes that the whole period between 27 December 1999, when the judgment of 17\u00a0December\u00a01999 became final and enforceable, and 19 January 2006, when the water supply company finally removed the obstacles which had prevented the applicant from operating his saw-mill, should be considered as a delay in execution for which the State authorities are responsible.",
