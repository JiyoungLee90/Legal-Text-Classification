Furthermore, upon another constitutional complaint concerning the length of civil proceedings the resolution of which is indispensable for the inheritance proceedings in question to continue (see \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 11 above), and which complaint was lodged by the other party to those civil proceedings, the Constitutional Court also ordered that those civil proceedings be speeded up, which had a beneficial effect on the applicant as well.

This factor combined with the fact that the proceedings are still pending leads to a result that the redress obtained by the applicants at the domestic level was unreasonable having regard to the Court's case-law and thus insufficient (see Cocchiarella, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 106-107; and, mutatis mutandis, Toma\u0161i\u0107\u00a0v. , no.\u00a021753/02, \u00a7\u00a035, 19\u00a0October 2006).
