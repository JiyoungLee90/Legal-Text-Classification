It was proved that two of the defendants had exerted improper pressure on witnesses and thus caused them to alter significantly their versions of the events. The court noted that the case involved thirteen defendants and sixty-six witnesses. Owing to the considerable amount of evidence to be taken, it was inevitable that the proceedings had been prolonged, given the need to ensure that the right to a fair trial was fully respected. At this point the court emphasised that the defendants had been making extensive use of their rights to question witnesses. Several witnesses had changed their testimonies and the reading out of their earlier statements had been justified. Almost thirty witnesses remained to be heard at that stage of the proceedings and there was a need to summon further witnesses and to cross-examine them.",

The court noted that, since June 2000, the first-instance court had held seven hearings and examined ten witnesses. The absence of other witnesses was the major reason for the prolongation of the proceedings; however, the trial court had taken proper measures to speed up the trial. The appellate court also pointed to the fact that the examination of the witnesses had been very time-consuming owing to the complexity of the case and the mental state of the victims.

The case was of considerable complexity, regard being had to the number of defendants, the need to separate them during the extensive evidentiary proceedings and to implement special measures required by the victims' vulnerability. Nevertheless, the hearings in the applicant's case were held regularly and at short intervals. The courts also took proper measures to ensure the speedy progress of the proceedings (see paragraphs 17, 20, 24 and 27 above). The Court further notes that the trial court took all necessary steps to resolve difficulties in hearing witnesses in the course of the proceedings and applied adequate measures to discipline them. It decided to examine the charges against one of the accused in separate proceedings, having considered that it would contribute to a prompt examination of the case (see paragraph 17 above). The Court therefore concludes that the national authorities displayed special diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. The length of the investigation and of the trial was justified by the exceptional complexity of the case. It should not be overlooked that, while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the efforts of the judges to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide both the defence and the prosecution with all necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed.",

In particular, the applicant and other defendants had lodged various applications and appeals, which had to be dismissed on several occasions owing to their irrelevance or lack of justification. The Government argued, relying on Malicka-W\u0105sowska v. Poland ((dec.), no. 41413/98, 5 April 2001), that in exercising his procedural rights, the applicant must have been aware that such applications and appeals might contribute to delays in the proceedings.",
