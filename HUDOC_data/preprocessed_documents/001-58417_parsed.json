Under section 19 of that Law, compensation, which was initially assessed provisionally before being assessed finally, was to be paid in government securities maturing over a period of several years and bearing interest at the rates prescribed in the schedule to the Law. For amounts exceeding PTE 6,050,000, payment was scheduled over twenty-three years (after a standstill period of five years) with an annual rate of interest of 2.5%. Section 24 specified that interest started to run from the date of the expropriation or nationalisation since it was due from the date scheduled for the issue of the government securities (which, in the applicants' case, by virtue of Legislative Decree no. 213/79 of 14 July 1979, was 1 September 1980). Lastly, section 13(3) provided that provisional compensation had to be regarded as a payment on account of final compensation such that the person concerned could be required to pay back provisional compensation to the State if either no final compensation was payable or the final compensation came to less than the provisional compensation.",

In such cases, the criteria applied by the national authorities, who have a wide margin of appreciation in that sphere, had to be respected, unless there was clearly no reasonable basis for them. The Government maintained that that was not the position in the instant case. The special circumstances of the Portuguese intervention in landed interests in 1975, which concerned a substantial part of the national territory and required complex action by the authorities, had to be borne in mind. In those circumstances, and regard being had also to the State's financial and budgetary resources, the arrangements decided on for payment did not infringe the proportionality principle as the landowners had already received provisional compensation in the form of interest-bearing government securities.",
