In this way, that provision embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only; however, it is an aspect that makes it in fact possible to benefit from the further guarantees laid down in paragraph 1 of Article 6 (see Kreuz v.\u00a0Poland, no. 28249/95, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2001VI).",

Whilst the final decision as to observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court, it is not part of the Court\u2019s function to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other assessment of what might be the best policy in this field. Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a036760/06, \u00a7 230, ECHR 2012).",

The rules governing the formal steps to be taken and the time-limits to be complied with in lodging an appeal or an application for judicial review are aimed at ensuring proper administration of justice and compliance, in particular, with the principle of legal certainty. That being so, the rules in question, or their application, should not prevent litigants from using an available remedy (see Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2002IX). In applying the rules of procedure, the national courts must avoid both excessive formalism, which would affect the fairness of the procedure, and excessive flexibility, which would result in removing procedural requirements established by law (see Frida, LLC v.
