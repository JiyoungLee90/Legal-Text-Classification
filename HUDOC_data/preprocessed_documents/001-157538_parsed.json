VIII Ips 3/2006 the Supreme Court held that the opinions of the Institute\u2019s disability commissions could only be considered expert opinions in pre-judicial proceedings within the Institute itself. Such opinions could not be considered expert opinions for judicial proceedings since they would be the opinions of the representatives of one of the parties to the judicial proceedings. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the procedural rights of the appellant had been violated since the first-instance court had treated the opinions of the disability commissions as decisive pieces of evidence in dismissing her request to appoint an independent expert to assess her degree of disability.",

Therefore the method of their appointment justifiably gave rise to the applicant\u2019s suspicion that they would not be able to act impartially (see, mutatis mutandis, Mihailov, cited above, \u00a7 37). While such suspicions may have a certain importance, they are not decisive; what is decisive is whether the doubts raised by appearances can be objectively validated (see Brandstetter v.

They were not required to give general advice on a particular subject, but rather to make findings on specific facts and to assess the applicant\u2019s state of health. The aim was to assist the Institute in deciding whether the applicant was entitled to a higher allowance with regard to his exact state of health at that time (see, similarly, Sara Lind Eggertsd\u00f3ttir, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051; Shulepova v.

The appellate court confirmed this decision of the first-instance court, also stating that it was based on the opinions of the commission. This left the opinions of the commission as the decisive evidence relied on by the courts to determine the issue in a case which certainly required expert knowledge, arguably not at hand in the court itself. Such reasoning by the domestic courts further highlights the dominant role of the Institute\u2019s disability commissions (see, similarly, Plac\u00ec, cited above, \u00a7\u00a078). In this light, the fact that the domestic court also heard testimony from the applicant and had regard to other material in the file before dismissing the claim, is not sufficient for the Court to decide that the proceedings complied with the Convention requirements.",
