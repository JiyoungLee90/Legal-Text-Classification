Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the decision of the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court of 31 January 2012 to declare the applicant\u2019s claim inadmissible may be regarded as imposing a restriction on his right of access to a court. The Court must therefore examine whether the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court was unduly restricted by that decision.",

In the Court\u2019s view a legitimate aim of such a requirement is to enable those suffering actual harm caused by false information to provide a publisher with an opportunity to correct distorted perceptions that could have been created about them based on incorrect media announcements. Accordingly, this requirement cannot in itself be seen as contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Therefore, the Court must further examine whether the manner in which the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court applied section 22 of the Media Act infringed the proportionality principle (see, mutatis mutandis, Bulfracht\u00a0Ltd v. Croatia, no. 53261/08, \u00a7 36, 21 June 2011).",
