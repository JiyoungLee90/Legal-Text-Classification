In the light of these circumstances, the Committee feels bound to query the motivation behind the employer's acts, in particular its persistent refusal to reinstate dockers, all of whom happen to be members of the [DUR], despite repeated judicial orders in this respect. Further noting the Duma resolution expressing extreme concern about this situation and adding that the question of anti-union discrimination has been reasonably posed, the Committee therefore requests the Government to establish an independent investigation into the allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination and if it is proven that acts of anti-union discrimination were taken against [DUR] members, in particular as concerns the non-transferral to the subordinated production sectors at TPK in accordance with the court's decision to take all necessary steps to remedy this situation, to ensure reinstatement at the TPK, as requested by the courts, as well as payment of lost wages. Furthermore, noting that the dockers were once again dismissed and a new case was filed, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this case.",

An employee or worker should be free to join or not join a trade union without being sanctioned or subject to disincentives (see Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a011002/05, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 2007...). The wording of Article 11 explicitly refers to the right of \u201ceverybody\u201d, and this provision obviously includes a right not to be discriminated against for choosing to avail oneself of the right to be protected by a trade union, given also that Article 14 forms an integral part of each of the Articles laying down rights and freedoms whatever their nature (see National Union of Belgian Police, cited above, \u00a7 44). Thus, the totality of the measures implemented to safeguard the guarantees of Article\u00a011 should include protection against discrimination on the ground of trade union membership which, according to the Freedom of Association Committee, constitutes one of the most serious violations of freedom of association, capable of jeopardising the very existence of a trade union (see paragraph 107 above).",

More stringent guarantees were provided for elected leaders of trade unions: without the prior consent of their trade union they could not be transferred to another position, dismissed or subjected to disciplinary sanctions.

The Court cannot speculate as to whether the applicants would indeed have been able to keep their earnings if these complaints had been effectively examined. It therefore rejects the applicants' claims in respect of pecuniary damage. However, the unsuccessful attempts to protect their right not to be discriminated against on the ground of their trade union membership must have caused the applicants justifiable anger, frustration and emotional distress (see Wilson, cited above, \u00a7 61). The Court considers that, on an equitable basis, each applicant should be awarded EUR 2,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
