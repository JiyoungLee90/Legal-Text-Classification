The court dismissed the applicant company\u2019s assertion that the criticism in question had not been aimed at S.P. as a person but at his mimicking of homosexuals, concluding that the average reader would understand the remark as an assessment of S.P.\u2019s intelligence and personal characteristics.",

As regards the applicant company\u2019s argument that the offensive statement had been a response to S.P.\u2019s own offensive remarks, the Constitutional Court acknowledged that in such cases sharper criticism might be permissible, but only if there was a sufficient factual basis for it. As the court found no substantive connection between S.P.\u2019s speech and the assessment of his intellectual abilities, it concluded that the criticism was not justified.

The first-instance court had examined the video footage of S.P.\u2019s parliamentary speech and had qualified it as an imitation of the gestures and speech of a same-sex-oriented male. According to that court, his words were not to be understood as promoting prejudice and inciting people against same-sex-oriented individuals, but rather as simply expressing his own, albeit negative, views on those individuals.

Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999-IV), and was directed against a politician. The Court has emphasised on many occasions that a politician must in this regard display a greater degree of tolerance than a private individual, especially when he himself makes public statements that are susceptible of criticism (see, among many other authorities, Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 103; Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 2), 1 July 1997, \u00a7 29, Reports 1997IV; and Lopes Gomes da Silva v. Portugal, no. 37698/97, \u00a7 30, ECHR 2000-X). In this connection, the Court reiterates that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation, or in other words, somewhat immoderate statements (see Lopes Gomes da Silva, cited above, \u00a7 34, and Mam\u00e8re v.

KG v. Austria, no. 31457/96, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2000-I). The Court agrees that describing S.P.\u2019s conduct as that of a \u201ccerebral bankrupt\u201d who, in a country with less limited human resources, would not even be able to find work as a primary school janitor, was indeed extreme and could legitimately be considered offensive. However, it is noted that the impugned remark was a value judgment, as acknowledged by the Government. It is true that in the absence of any factual basis even value judgments can be considered excessive. Nevertheless, in the present case the facts on which the impugned statement was based were outlined in considerable detail; with the exception of his concluding remark, S.P.\u2019s parliamentary speech was quoted almost in its entirety, along with a mention of his accompanying imitation of a homosexual man. This description was followed by the author\u2019s commentary which, in the Court\u2019s opinion, was not only a value judgment, but also had the character of a metaphor. In the context of what appears to be an intense debate in which opinions were expressed with little restraint (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above), the Court would interpret the impugned statement as an expression of strong disagreement, even contempt for S.P.\u2019s position, rather than a factual assessment of his intellectual abilities. Viewed in this light, the description of the parliamentarian\u2019s speech and conduct can be regarded as a sufficient foundation for the author\u2019s statement.",

In his speech, S.P. followed the line of other members of his party and portrayed homosexuals as a generally undesirable sector of the population, whether as children, same-sex couples or parents. In order to reinforce his point, he imitated a homosexual man through the use of specific gestures which, according to the domestic courts, were reminiscent of gestures used by actors to portray homosexuals. The Court, however, considers that S.P.\u2019s imitation may be regarded as ridicule promoting negative stereotypes.",

The author\u2019s critical opinions were coloured by a number of evocative, exaggerated expressions. Having already held that Article 10 protects both the content and the form of expression (see Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), 23 May 1991, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 204), the Court considers that even offensive language, which may fall outside the protection of freedom of expression if its sole intent is to insult, may be protected by Article 10 when serving merely stylistic purposes (see Tu\u015falp v. Turkey, nos. 32131/08 and 41617/08, \u00a7 48, 21 February 2012).",

Moreover, in this regard the Court also points out that political invective often spills over into the personal sphere; such are the hazards of politics and the free debate of ideas, which are the guarantees of a democratic society (see Lopes Gomes da Silva, cited above, \u00a7 34).",

The Court thus concludes that the reasons given by the domestic courts cannot be regarded as a sufficient justification for the interference with the applicant company\u2019s right to freedom of expression. The domestic courts therefore failed to strike a fair balance between the competing interests. Moreover, this conclusion cannot be affected by the fact that the proceedings complained of were civil rather than criminal in nature.",
