He pointed out that the administrative court had ignored the presence of another pupil in the classroom at the time of the incident, as well as his explanation that the door had been shut as a result of the draught from the open window. The administrative court had similarly overlooked his service record (sicil dosyas\u0131) and the fact that it made no mention of any allegations of misconduct in his previous post, which would be unimaginable if he had really been dismissed from that post for indecent behaviour. He also referred in this connection to the statements of \u0130.K., the deputy principal at the previous school, denying any such allegations of indecent behaviour.",

The Court has acknowledged in its case-law the existence of two aspects as regards the protection afforded by the presumption of innocence: a procedural aspect relating to the conduct of the criminal trial, and a second aspect which aims to ensure respect for the applicant\u2019s established innocence in the context of subsequent proceedings where there is a link with the criminal proceedings which have ended with a result other than a conviction (see, generally, Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 25424/09, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94, ECHR 2013). Under its first aspect, the principle of the presumption of innocence prohibits public officials from making premature statements about a defendant\u2019s guilt and acts as a procedural guarantee to ensure the fairness of the criminal trial itself. However, it is not limited to a procedural safeguard in criminal matters: its scope is broader and requires that no representative of the State should say that a person is guilty of an offence before his guilt has been established by a court (Konstas v. Greece, no. 53466/07, \u00a7 32, 24 May 2011). In that respect the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only in the context of the criminal trial, but also in separate civil, disciplinary or other proceedings that are conducted simultaneously with the criminal proceedings (see Kemal Co\u015fkun v. Turkey, no. 45028/07, \u00a7 41, 28\u00a0March 2017). While the scope of the first aspect under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention covers the period from the date on which a person is charged with a criminal offence until the criminal proceedings are final, the second aspect of the protection of the presumption of innocence comes into play when the criminal proceedings end with a result other than a conviction, and requires that the person\u2019s innocence vis-\u00e0-vis the criminal offence is not called into doubt in subsequent proceedings (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 94).",

The Court will therefore first consider the point in time when the impugned statement was made in order to determine the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 under its respective aspects. The Court observes in that connection that the disciplinary and criminal proceedings were lodged simultaneously following the allegations that the applicant had been seen in an inappropriate position with a minor. The disciplinary decision to dismiss the applicant from the civil service on the grounds that his behaviour amounted to disgraceful conduct was given on 5 July 2006, at a time when the criminal proceedings, based on the same facts and concerning the charges of sexual abuse, sexual assault and unlawful detention of a minor, were pending. The reasoning of the disciplinary decision was endorsed by the Ordu Administrative Court in its judgment of 3 July 2007, which held that the applicant\u2019s behaviour in harassing the minor amounted to shameful conduct incompatible with the civil service. Taking into account the fact that the impugned statements preceded the applicant\u2019s acquittal and the applicant\u2019s complaint that he had been presumed guilty before the criminal proceedings were final, the Court will confine its examination to the first aspect of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and assess thereunder whether the reasoning adopted in the disciplinary proceedings, before the final decision in the criminal proceedings, violated the applicant\u2019s right to be presumed innocent (see, in particular, Kemal Co\u015fkun, cited above, \u00a7 44). As a result, Article 6 \u00a7 2 is applicable in the context of the disciplinary proceedings at issue and the application is therefore not incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention.",

The presumption of innocence is infringed if a judicial decision or a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence conveys the opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration\u00a0\u2212\u00a0in the absence of a final conviction \u2212 that an individual has committed the crime in question (see, among others, Matija\u0161evi\u0107 v.

Poland, no. 5422/04, \u00a7 54, 9\u00a0December 2008). The latter infringes the presumption of innocence, whereas the former has been regarded as unobjectionable in various situations examined by the Court (see, among others, El Kaada v. Germany, no. 2130/10, \u00a7 54, 12\u00a0November 2015). In this connection the Court has emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence. While the use of language is of critical importance in this respect, the Court has also pointed out that the question of whether a statement by a public official has breached the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, ECHR 2000-X; Konstas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a033; Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0125 and 126; and El Kaada, cited above, \u00a7 55).",

In that respect, the Court reiterates that the Convention does not preclude that an act may give rise to both criminal and disciplinary proceedings, or that two sets of proceedings may be pursued in parallel. The Court reiterates in that respect that even exoneration from criminal responsibility does not, as such, preclude the establishment of civil or other forms of liability arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof (see, for example, Ringvold v. Norway, no. 34964/97, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2003\u2011II; Jakumas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 6924/02, \u00a7 57, 18 July 2006; \u00c7elik (Bozkurt) v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a034388/05, \u00a7 30, 12 April 2011; and Vella v. Malta, no. 69122/10, \u00a7\u00a056, 11\u00a0February 2014). However, in the absence of a final criminal conviction, if the disciplinary decision were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the applicant for the misconduct alleged against him in the disciplinary proceedings, it would raise an issue under Article 6 \u00a7 2 (see\u00a0Kemal Co\u015fkun, cited above, \u00a7 53 and the cases cited therein).",

The Court also notes, however, that the disciplinary authorities described the factual basis that gave rise to this offence as the \u201charassment of a minor\u201d. The subsequent disciplinary investigation was set up to determine whether the allegations of harassment were sufficiently well-founded to describe the applicant\u2019s conduct as \u201cshameful\u201d. The investigation was carried out by two inspectors who established the facts independently by taking statements from various parties concerned and took into account the guidance counsellors\u2019 report concerning the minor\u2019s psychological and social stage of development. There is nothing in the disciplinary report that suggests that the inspectors drew premature inferences from the criminal proceedings that were pending against the applicant. In that respect, the Court concludes that the disciplinary authorities conducted a separate inquiry into the facts of the case. At the end of their investigation, and on the basis of a less strict burden of proof, the inspectors concluded that they had the strong impression that the applicant had committed harassment against the minor. The Court notes in this respect that the disciplinary decision did not describe the harassment as sexual per se \u2212 as opposed to the classification of the offence in the criminal proceedings \u2212 and as such they did not pronounce the applicant guilty of a criminal offence. In their reasoning, they referred to the act by the term \u201charassment\u2019\u201d (\u201ctaciz\u201d) and not by \u201csexual abuse\u201d (\u201ccinsel istismar\u201d) or \u201csexual assault\u201d (\u201c\u0131rza tasaddi\u201d). In the opinion of the Court, the use of the term \u201charassment\u201d does not in itself present a problem, as the term is not used solely in connection with criminal law actions, but also in contexts where a person\u2019s private sphere, including his or her bodily integrity, is violated by non-consensual physical or verbal contact. Read in the context of the present disciplinary proceedings, the choice of words implies that the disciplinary authorities formed the opinion that the applicant\u2019s physical contact with the minor amounted to harassment but they did not comment on whether it could also be classified as sexual harassment within the meaning of criminal law. Furthermore they noted that the event, which had caused shock and anxiety in the community, had created a state of suspicion against the applicant, which in the Court\u2019s view meant that the disciplinary authorities had taken account of the need to maintain public confidence in the education system and to dispel any appearance of tolerance of suspicious acts against minors. Against this background, the Court does not consider that the disciplinary investigation overstepped the bounds of its civil jurisdiction in such a way as to violate the applicant\u2019s right to be presumed innocent in the context of the parallel criminal proceedings.",

It then rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that a statement by the sole eyewitness to the event could not prove conclusively the veracity of the allegation. In its assessment of the facts it took into account certain factors, such as the lights being turned off and the door being shut when the applicant was found in the alleged position with X. However, unlike the disciplinary investigation report, it commented on the criminal proceedings by referring to a statement allegedly made by the principal of the neighbouring school that the latter had heard rumours regarding the applicant\u2019s indecent behaviour in other schools where he had previously worked. Although the reference to this particular statement \u2212 which was allegedly given in the context of the criminal proceedings \u2013 may have been unwarranted in the context of the disciplinary proceedings, the Court has held that even the use of some unfortunate language can be tolerated, taking into account the circumstances of the case and the nature of the task that was before the domestic courts (see Allen, cited above \u00a7 126, and Vella, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57 and 61). Furthermore, the Court considers that a civil court\u2019s reliance on a statement made or evidence produced in the criminal proceedings is not itself incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention so long as such reliance does not result in the civil court commenting on the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility or drawing inappropriate conclusions therefrom. Turning to the administrative court\u2019s reference to the statement made by the neighbouring school\u2019s principal in the present case, the Court observes that, if read on its own, that reference can be interpreted as the court considering the applicant guilty of child molestation because of his alleged past behaviour. However, taking into account the administrative court\u2019s previous reference to the evidence available in the disciplinary case file and its following conclusion that it did not regard the applicant\u2019s explanations credible in so far as he had not discharged the burden of proof, the Court considers that that statement alone did not amount to an imputation of criminal guilt to the applicant. Nor did the administrative court comment on whether the applicant should be found guilty on the charges in the criminal proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Vella, cited above, \u00a7 61).",
