Bearing in mind the prominent place which the right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal holds in a democratic society (see, inter alia, De Cubber v. Belgium, judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a030), the Court considers that the State should bear the responsibility for a delay incurred through a successful challenge of the trial bench by a party to the proceedings. If a court accepts a party's motion for a change in the composition of the bench, it inevitably means that the fears of that party as to the impartiality and independence of the tribunal were justified. The Court further reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide the cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. Austria, no. 30546/96, \u00a7\u00a057, 3 October 2000). Therefore, the responsibility for an aggregated delay of approximately twelve months caused by the changes in the composition of the  rests ultimately with the State (cf. Marchenko v. , no. 29510/04, \u00a7\u00a039, 5 October 2006).",

The Court has already noted that at least eight hearings were adjourned because the  had failed to duly summons the applicant (see paragraph 31 above). The Court also observes that on 19 April 2002 the  remitted the case for an additional inquiry to enable the prosecution to correct serious violations of the procedural law. The inquiry was closed and re-opened on several occasions because the investigating authorities had consistently failed to correct the defects. Therefore, the period after 19 April 2002 is attributable to the State. The Court also does not overlook the fact that the Government did not provide any explanation as to the authorities' inactivity after 7 July 2003 when the criminal proceedings against the applicant were again re-opened. The Court finds it particularly striking that no actions were taken since that date and that the applicant for more than three years is kept in the dark as to the developments in the criminal case against him.",
