In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation. In cases such as the present one, the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in enabling the press to exercise its rightful role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d in imparting information of serious public concern (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas cited above, \u00a7 59).

The manner in which the applicant expressed his opinion of the senator\u2019s practices and the way in which the latter was carrying out his duties as an elected representative was held by the national courts not to reflect reality and, therefore, to be defamatory.

However, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, it considers that the applicant did suffer, and his widow has suffered, such damage and that this cannot be sufficiently redressed by the mere finding that there has been a violation. In this case, Mr Dalban\u2019s death, coming as it did before the Procurator-General made the extraordinary application to the Supreme Court of Justice, is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the damage to be made good. Having regard to the high rate of inflation in Romania, the Court will express the sum to be awarded in French francs (FRF), to be converted into Romanian lei at the rate applicable at the date of settlement. It awards Mrs Dalban FRF 20,000. Lastly, with regard to the Government\u2019s third argument, the Court confines itself to observing that Mrs Dalban did not claim reimbursement of the damages in question since they were never paid (see paragraph 22 above).",
