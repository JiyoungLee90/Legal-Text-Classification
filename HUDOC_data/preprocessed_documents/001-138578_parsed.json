In a number of countries visited by the CPT, particularly in central and eastern Europe, inmate accommodation often consists of large capacity dormitories which contain all or most of the facilities used by prisoners on a daily basis, such as sleeping and living areas as well as sanitary facilities. The CPT has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when, as is frequently the case, the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions ... Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insuf\ufb01cient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.\u201d",

In support of their argument, they relied on the relevant domestic laws\u2019 provisions (see paragraphs 23-29 above). In their opinion, it was open to the applicant, in order to obtain an adequate relief, to address his grievances to a court, a public supervision commission, or an ombudsman. They further cited the following examples from domestic practice. On 19\u00a0July 2007 the Novgorod Town Court of the Novgorod Region had awarded 45,000 Russian roubles (RUB) to D. in respect of nonpecuniary damage resulting from the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to ensure proper conditions during his pre-trial detention. On 17\u00a0December 2008 the Sovetskiy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod had upheld G.\u2019s claims concerning his detention in an overcrowded cell in a remand prison and awarded him RUB\u00a02,000. On 14\u00a0October 2009 the Sovetskiy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod had upheld B.\u2019s claims concerning the conditions of his pre-trial detention in view of the lack of sufficient personal space, lighting, ventilation, fresh air and adequate medical assistance and awarded him RUB\u00a0100,000. On 26\u00a0March 2007 the Tsentralniy District Court of Kaliningrad had found that the correctional colonies where R. had been serving a prison sentence had failed to provide him with adequate medical assistance and awarded him RUB\u00a0300,000. On 26\u00a0September 2008 the Berezniki Town Court of the Perm Region had awarded RUB\u00a065,000 to Ye. for the non-pecuniary damage resulting from his detention in a temporary detention centre. Lastly, referring to the Court\u2019s case-law (see Whiteside v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, decision of 7 March 1994, application no.\u00a020357/92, DR 76, p. 80), they pointed out that a mere doubt on the applicant\u2019s part as to the prospect of success was not sufficient to exempt him from submitting his complaint to any of the above mentioned competent national authorities.",

If an applicant has been held in conditions that are in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, is of the greatest value. Once, however, the applicant has left the facility in which he or she endured the inadequate conditions, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred (see, mutatis mutandis, Ananyev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a042525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a097, 10 January 2012).",

In this connection, the Court notes it has already examined the Government\u2019s argument about a possibility of judicial complaint or a complaint to an ombudsman in the context of conditions of detention in a remand prison in Russia and rejected it having found that those remedies had fallen short of the requirements set out in Article\u00a013 of the Convention. In respect of the judicial complaint, the Court concluded that, even though it provided a solid theoretical legal framework for adjudicating the detainees\u2019 complaints about inadequate conditions of detention, its capacity to produce a preventive effect in practice had not been convincingly demonstrated (see Ananyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0112). Nor could the Court recognise the effectiveness of a complaint to an ombudsman noting that the latter lacked the power to issue a legally binding decision that would be capable of bringing about an improvement in the detainee\u2019s situation or serving as a basis for obtaining compensation (see Ananyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). In the present case there is nothing in the materials before the Court that would allow it to reach a different conclusion.

Three of them dealt with overcrowding of pre-trial detention facilities (a temporary detention centre and remand prisons) and the fourth one concerned the lack of proper medical assistance in a correctional colony.

The Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances or the victim\u2019s behaviour (see, among other authorities, Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000IV). The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must go beyond the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-94).",

Accordingly, the Court\u2019s task in the present case is to determine whether the applicant\u2019s placement during the night time in a large capacity dormitory ensured adequate conditions of detention.",

However, the Court reiterates that it cannot decide, once and for all, how much personal space should be allocated to a detainee in terms of the Convention. That depends on many relevant factors, such as the duration of detention in particular conditions, the possibilities for outdoor exercise, the physical and mental condition of the detainee, and so on. This is why, whereas the Court may take into account general standards in this area developed by other international institutions, such as the CPT, these cannot constitute a decisive argument (see Trepashkin v. , no. 36898/03, \u00a7\u00a092, 19 July 2007).",

However, in the Court\u2019s opinion that factor alone, if established, cannot be considered so decisive that it would suffice, in itself, to tip the scales in favour of a finding of no violation of Article 3. The Court must also examine the conditions and duration of the freedom of movement in relation to the overall duration of the detention and the general conditions prevailing in the prison. It considers that factors that helped alleviate the harshness of the conditions of detention could be taken into account in determining the amount of any just satisfaction to be awarded to the applicants in the event of a finding of a violation.\u201d",
