Croatia, no. 5129/03, \u00a7 37, 2 November 2006). Furthermore, the Court notes that under Croatian law if the bankruptcy proceedings are opened against a certain company its creditors are entitled to realise their claims against it only in the bankruptcy proceedings. Therefore, all civil proceedings against that company have to be stayed until the bankruptcy administrator, at the examination hearing in the bankruptcy proceedings, either accepts or opposes the claims reported by the creditors. If the bankruptcy administrator accepts a claim which was under examination in civil proceedings, the claim is considered finally determined and the civil proceedings consequently become obsolete. If he or she opposes such a claim, he or she has to take over the pending civil proceedings, which shall accordingly be resumed, and the claim determined therein. Therefore, the civil and the bankruptcy proceedings shall be taken as a whole for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention (see Sukobljevi\u0107 v. Croatia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037).",

Where the individual's access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the Court will examine whether the limitation imposed impaired the essence of the right and in particular whether it pursued a legitimate aim and there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see, among other authorities, Levages Prestations Services v.
