The applicants, who are ethnic Hungarians, complained under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 12 to the Convention that they had had to sit two additional exams (oral and written in their mother tongue) during the same, rather short, period set for the final exams throughout the country. Moreover, the exams they had had to sit in Romanian language and literature had been very difficult for them. For this reason, ethnic Hungarian pupils had less time than Romanian pupils to prepare for their exams or to simply rest between them, and less chance of success in the baccalaureate.",

It cannot assess in the abstract how the domestic courts would deal with an action brought by the applicants against the ministerial order (see paragraphs\u00a015 and 42 above). For instance, the Court cannot speculate about the applicants\u2019 victim status under domestic law at the moment it was published, that is, before they graduated and qualified to take the baccalaureate (see Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the NEA, cited in paragraph 12 above).",

In this connection, it notes that the remedy suggested by the Government is provided for by the Administrative Proceedings Act, which constitutes the lex generalis for any action against an administrative act when such an action is permitted by law (see paragraph\u00a015 above). Even assuming that the ministerial orders setting the baccalaureate exam timetable have never been challenged in the past, the Government should have provided the Court with relevant domestic decisions concerning actions brought against other such ministerial orders, issued in other fields. It is therefore inconceivable that the action has been rarely used in the past (ibid.), and the Government have not argued that either. In failing to submit relevant case-law, the Government failed to prove that the administrative complaint constituted in practice an effective remedy.",

On this point, they argued that the Romanian language and literature exams were difficult, even for native speakers. They sometimes involved complicated and outdated language which had nothing to do with the practical use of the Romanian language and their real needs. Moreover, they were living in a region where Romanian was not spoken in daily life, which meant that they had no possibility of practising their language skills and preparing for the exams. They contended that as non-native speakers, their level would never be as high in Romanian as that of their native speaker peers.

The right not to be discriminated against in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under the Convention is also violated when States, without an objective and reasonable justification, fail to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different. The prohibition deriving from Article 14 will therefore also give rise to positive obligations for the Contracting States to make necessary distinctions between persons or groups whose circumstances are relevantly and significantly different (see J.D. and A. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos. 32949/17 and 34614/17, \u00a7 84, 24 October 2019 with further references, notably Thlimmenos v.

In this context, relevance is measured in relation to what is at stake, whereas a certain threshold is required in order for the Court to find that the difference in circumstances is significant.

On the contrary, according to Article 77 (5) of the NEA the content of the exam curriculum as well as the timetable, methodology and organisation of the baccalaureate exam were set by the Ministry of Education and publicly announced for each year group at the beginning of the last year of secondary school (see paragraph 11).",

Moreover, the High Court of Cassation and Justice declared his appeal null and void because he had not stated the reasons for his appeal (see paragraph 24). In other words, he had failed to exhaust all the available remedies.

In particular, they did not explain why the applicants did not realise the effect of the impugned measure until after their failure in the most recent exams, even though that effect had been perfectly foreseeable from the outset. It is neither clear nor comprehensible why the date the prejudice actually occurred should be decisive, if such consequences had been foreseeable and, therefore, the applicants had already become aware of the alleged violation of their Convention rights at an earlier stage. In this context, we would like to point out that the applicants\u2019 discrimination complaint concerns not the fact that they failed their exams but the alleged additional burden they had to endure as students having chosen to study in their mother tongue.",

Moreover, our view that the six-month period ran from the moment the applicant became aware of the possible consequences of the ministerial order for them, that is to say the date of the publication of the respective order itself, seems to be supported by the decision referred to in paragraph 157 of the Varnava judgment, namely Dennis and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76573/01, 2\u00a0July 2002.",
