In the latter case, the Court has accepted that the next-of-kin or heir may in principle pursue the application, provided that he or she has sufficient interest in the case (see Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2014). It is not only material interests which the successor of a deceased applicant may pursue by his or her wish to maintain the application. Human rights cases before the Court generally also have a moral dimension and persons near to an applicant may thus have a legitimate interest in ensuring that justice is done, even after the applicant\u2019s death (see Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a033071/96, ECHR 2000-XII). Whether the rights at issue are transferable to an heir willing to pursue an application on behalf of a deceased person is not therefore a decisive factor (see Ergezen v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a073359/10, \u00a7 29, 8 April 2014).",

It has reiterated in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely, to protect the individual from arbitrariness. In order to minimise the risks of arbitrariness, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and to secure the accountability of the authorities for that measure (see Kurt v.\u00a0Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012223, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III, and Fatma Akaltun F\u0131rat v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a034010/06, \u00a7 29, 10 September 2013). The requirements of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 with their emphasis on promptness and judicial control assume particular importance in this context (see Kurt, cited above, \u00a7 123). Prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of serious illtreatment which violates the fundamental guarantees contained in Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18\u00a0December 1996, \u00a7 76, Reports 1996-VI). What is at stake is both the protection of the physical liberty of individuals as well as their personal security in a context which, in the absence of safeguards, could result in subversion of the rule of law and place detainees beyond the reach of the most rudimentary forms of legal protection (see Kurt, cited above, \u00a7 123).",

That fact is confirmed by the police station logbook and the witnesses (see paragraphs 8 and 24 above). The next trace of the applicant\u2019s presence at the police station can be found in the record of his questioning by the investigator as a witness in the theft case (see paragraph 11 above) at midday the following day. According to the complaints lodged with the authorities by the applicant\u2019s wife, his mother and his lawyer, the applicant was not released after entering the police station on 5 May 2008 (see paragraphs 10 and 19 above). The record of his arrest as a suspect was drawn up by the investigator at 8.20\u00a0p.m. on 6\u00a0May 2008 (see paragraph 13 above). The Court also observes that in the course of the official inquiry into the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint of unlawful detention, the investigative authorities did not acknowledge that he had been detained continuously at the police station from 2 p.m. on 5 May 2008 until 8.20 p.m. on 6\u00a0May 2008, and their decision was fully endorsed by the domestic courts (see paragraph 30 above).",
