Firstly, referring to the case of Pellegrin v. France, a civil servant working in the financial administration of a government must be considered a \u201ccivil servant exercising specific public activities and acting as an agent of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State or other public authorities\u201d (see Pellegrin v. France [GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999VIII). The Government, taking note of the subsequent Eskelinen case (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, ECHR 2007II), further distinguished that case from the present case in that the present one only concerned a post transfer and thus was not an ordinary employment dispute. They further emphasised that the post transfer had only been executed on account of an extensive general reform of the government financial administration. Applying Article 6 to situations arising from such an administrative reform process would effectively make such a reform impossible in the future. Furthermore, the Government noted that the case in question did not involve proceedings concerning monetary disadvantage, but only the transfer itself. Finally, the Government stated that the Eskelinen case (cited above) would seem to allow for a member State to exclude groups of civil servants entirely from access to a court, which would lead to the undesirable result that, even though in some cases such civil servants would benefit from at least a number of the guarantees of Article 6, a member State might be forced to exclude them from access to a court altogether.",

A second essential criterion is the salary attached to the post. A transfer to another post directly affects the job profile, which is one of the defining factors of the employment relationship. If such a transfer is accompanied by a salary adjustment, a second major defining factor of that relationship is involved. In the present case, the applicant was transferred to a post with a lower grade and was subject to a reduction in salary after a three-year moratorium (see paragraph 11 above).
