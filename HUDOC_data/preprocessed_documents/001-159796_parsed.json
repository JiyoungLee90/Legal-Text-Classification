Ukraine, no.\u00a039884/05, \u00a7 43, 19 January 2012, with further reference). The arguments for and against release, including the risk that the accused would hinder the proper conduct of the proceedings, must not be assessed in the abstract, and the reasoned decision must be supported by factual evidence. The authorities must assess whether an applicant\u2019s placement in custody is strictly necessary to ensure his presence at trial and whether other, less stringent, measures could have been sufficient for that purpose (see Lutsenko v. Ukraine, no. 6492/11, \u00a7 66, 3 July 2012). Further, a very important factor in the balancing exercise is a defendant\u2019s age: thus, pre-trial detention of minors should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible period (see Korneykova v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044, with further reference).",

In particular, there is no evidence that the authorities notified the mother of the applicant\u2019s arrest or made any effort to collect and examine the information about her willingness and ability to ensure his proper conduct during the investigation. If the domestic courts considered that the fact that the applicant had run away from home proved his mother\u2019s inability to control his conduct or if they had other reasons to believe that she was unable to supervise him, this should have been clearly set out in the judicial decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s detention. The Court reiterates that, where circumstances that could have warranted a person\u2019s detention may have existed but were not mentioned in the domestic decisions, it is not the Court\u2019s task to establish them and to take the place of the national authorities which ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention.
