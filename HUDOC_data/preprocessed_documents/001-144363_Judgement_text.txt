The case originated in an application (no. 32806/09) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Ms Aylan Egić (“the applicant”), on 29 May 2009.
The applicant was first represented by Mr Đ. Radović, and later by Ms L. Radović, a lawyer practising in Biograd na Moru. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that she had been deprived of access to the Supreme Court.
On 4 February 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government of Serbia, having been informed of their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court), did not avail themselves of this right.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Novi Sad, Serbia.
On 8 March 1998 D.P.V. brought a civil action against M.V. (the applicant’s legal predecessor) in the Biograd na Moru Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Biogradu na moru) seeking (a) to be declared joint owner of a house and surrounding land on Pašman, an island off the coast of Croatia, and (b) payment of 30,000 German marks (DEM).
On 18 December 1998 the Biograd na Moru Municipal Court ordered an onsite inspection of the property, including an expert valuation. It took place on 29 December 1998.
The expert submitted his opinion to the Biograd na Moru Municipal Court on 19 January 1999, assessing the value of the property at 208,575.66 Croatian kunas (HRK).
On 16 September 1999 the Biograd na Moru Municipal Court ruled in favour of the plaintiff D.P.V., who was declared owner of a one half share of the property. M.V. was ordered to pay her DEM 30,000.
M.V. lodged an appeal but it was dismissed by the Zadar County Court (Županijski sud u Zadru) on 18 July 2001.
On 20 December 2001 M.V. simultaneously lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) and a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) against the appeal judgment. In using both of these remedies she challenged the judgments of the lower courts, arguing that they had failed to address all of her allegations.
On 22 March 2002 the Constitutional Court sent a letter to M.V., informing her that, while her appeal on points of law was pending, it would be unable to deal with her constitutional complaint, and that the proceedings in that regard would have to be terminated unless otherwise requested after the decision of the Supreme Court.
In examining the admissibility ratione valoris of the appeal, the Supreme Court noted that the value of the half share of the property had not been assessed. On 16 November 2004 the Supreme Court therefore requested the Biograd na Moru Municipal Court to determine the value of the subject matter of the dispute (vrijednost predmeta spora), in accordance with section 40(4) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Act.
On 15 February 2005 M.V. died and bequeathed all her property to the applicant, who took over the proceedings thereafter.
On 27 July 2005 the Biograd na Moru Municipal Court held a hearing and heard representatives of both parties. The plaintiff’s representative relied on his alleged statutory prerogative to set the value of the dispute at HRK 10,000, while the applicant’s representative relied on the expert valuation (see paragraph 9 above) and requested that the value of the dispute be set at at least HRK 101,000. The relevant part of the transcript of that hearing reads as follows:
“The plaintiff’s representative maintains that the value of the dispute in this case is HRK 10,000 in accordance with section 26 of the Court Fees Act ... and that this is the value the plaintiff has set.
The defendant’s representative objects to such an interpretation of the value of the dispute, arguing that [it] could only have been established after the expert valuation had been obtained from the court expert, who assessed the value of the property at HRK 200,000, which the Municipal Court is bound to accept, and that in any event the value of the dispute exceeds HRK 101,000.”
On the same day the Biograd na Moru Municipal Court issued a decision whereby it set the value of the ownership claim to HRK 10,000. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows:
“The value of the dispute in the civil action... between the plaintiff D.P.V... and the defendant M.V... for determination (radi utvrđenja) ... is set at HRK 10,000.
Pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court and in accordance with section 40(4) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Act, after a hearing held on 27 July 2005, in which the parties argued over the value of the dispute in the civil action between the plaintiff D.P.V. and the defendant M.V., for determination of ownership of the property, the value of the dispute has been set as stated in the operative part of this decision, relying on section 26 of the Court Fees Act.”
On 28 February 2006 the Supreme Court reversed the judgments of the first-instance and appellate courts by dismissing the plaintiff’s claim for DEM 30,000. It however declared the appeal on points of law concerning D.P.V.’s ownership claim inadmissible ratione valoris, finding that the value of the dispute was below the statutory threshold of HRK 100,000. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows:
“The plaintiff failed to specify the value of the dispute in her claim...The first-instance court set the value of the dispute... at HRK 10,000, in accordance with section 40(4) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Act.
... [The] appeal on points of law is inadmissible...as the value of the dispute... does not exceed the statutory threshold of HRK 100,000...”
The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court’s decision, arguing, inter alia, that the value of the dispute had been set disproportionately low when compared with the market valuation of the property as established by an independent expert. She relied on the provisions of the Constitution guaranteeing equality before the law and equality before the courts.
On 26 November 2008 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint, endorsing the view of the Supreme Court. This decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 16 December 2008.
The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998 (consolidated text), 113/2000, 124/2000 (consolidated text), 28/2001, 41/2001 (consolidated text), 55/2001 (corrigendum), 76/2010 and 85/2010) read as follows:
“All shall be equal before the law.”
“All nationals of the Republic of Croatia and foreigners shall be equal before the courts and other State or public authorities.”
“In the determination of his rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court established by law.”
The relevant provisions of the Constitutional Court Act (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 99/1999, 29/2002 and 49/2002), which have been in force since 15 March 2002, read as follows:
“1.  Anyone may lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court if he or she deems that the decision of a State authority, local or regional government or a legal entity invested with public authority, concerning his or her rights or obligations or the suspicion or accusation of a criminal offence, has violated his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms or the right to local or regional self-government, guaranteed by the Constitution (hereinafter: ‘constitutional right’) ...
If another legal remedy is available in respect of the violation of the constitutional rights [complained of], a constitutional complaint may be lodged only after this remedy has been exhausted.
In matters in which an administrative action or, in civil and non-contentious proceedings, an appeal on points of law [revizija] are available, remedies shall be considered exhausted only after the decision on these legal remedies has been given.”
“A constitutional complaint shall contain ... an indication of the constitutional right alleged to have been violated [together] with an indication of the relevant provision of the Constitution guaranteeing that right ...”
“... [t]he Constitutional Court shall examine only those violations of constitutional rights alleged in the constitutional complaint.”
On 9 July 2001 the Constitutional Court delivered decision no. UIII-368/1999 (Official Gazette no. 65/2001) in a case where the complainant relied in her constitutional complaint on Articles 3 and 19 § 1 of the Constitution, neither of which, under that court’s case-law, concerned a constitutional right. The Constitutional Court nevertheless allowed the constitutional complaint, finding violations of Article 14,  Article 19 § 2 and Article 26 of the Constitution, on which the complainant had not relied, and quashed the contested decisions. In so deciding it held as follows:
“... a constitutional complaint cannot be based on either of the constitutional provisions relied on [by the complainant in her constitutional complaint].
However, the present case, as will be explained further, concerns a specific legal situation, as a result of which this court, despite [its] finding that there have not been, and cannot be, any violations of the constitutional rights explicitly relied on by the complainant, considers that there are circumstances which warrant the quashing of [the contested] decisions.
...
Specifically, it is evident from the constitutional complaint and the case file that there have been violations of [constitutional] rights, in particular those guaranteed by Article 14 (equality, equality before the law), Article 19 § 2 (guarantee of judicial review of decisions of State and other public authorities) and Article 26 (equality before the courts and other State or public authorities) of the Constitution ...”
The relevant part of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, the Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 4/1977, 36/1977 (corrigendum), 36/1980, 69/1982, 58/1984, 74/1987, 57/1989, 20/1990, 27/1990 and 35/1991, and the Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 58/1993, 112/1999, 88/2001, 117/2003, 88/2005, 2/2007, 84/2008, 123/2008, 57/2011, 148/2011 and 25/2013), as in force at the material time, provide as follows:
“...
(2)  ... when an action does not concern a sum of money, the relevant value shall be the value of the subject matter of the dispute indicated by the plaintiff in the statement of claim (u tužbi).
(3)  If, in the case referred to in subsection 2, it is obvious that the value of the subject matter of the dispute indicated by the plaintiff is too high or too low, so that an issue arises over ... the right to lodge an appeal on points of law, the court shall, by the latest at the preparatory hearing or, if no preparatory hearing has been held, at the main hearing before the examination of the merits, quickly and in an appropriate manner verify the accuracy of the value specified.
(4)  If, after the defendant has begun litigation on the merits of the case, it is established that the plaintiff has failed to indicate the value of the subject of the dispute, the first-instance court shall quickly and in an appropriate manner, after giving the parties the opportunity to express their opinion, set the value of the subject of the dispute by a decision against which no separate appeal is permitted.
(5)  The court shall also proceed in a manner prescribed in subsection 4 after an appeal or an appeal on points of law has been lodged, before sending the case to a higher court for a decision on those remedies.”
“...
(2)  When the jurisdiction of the court or its composition, or the right to lodge an appeal on points of law, depends on the value of the subject matter of the dispute, and the subject of an action is not a sum of money, the plaintiff shall indicate the value of the subject matter of the dispute in the statement of claim (u tužbi).
...”
Section 382(1) provides that in civil (non-commercial) cases, the parties may lodge an appeal on points of law (revizija protiv presude) against an appeal judgment if the value of the subject matter of the dispute of the contested part of the judgment exceeds HRK 100,000.
Part 3 of the Court Fees Act (Zakon o sudskim pristojbama, Official Gazette nos. 26/2003 (consolidated version), 125/2011 and 112/2012), as in force at the material time, lays down rules for determining the value of a dispute for the purposes of charging court fees. Sections 20 to 30 deal with the value of disputes in civil proceedings.
Section 25 provides that the value of a claim in real property disputes should be set in accordance with the market value of the property at issue. It also specifies the minimum amounts for plots of land (five times the cadastral income), business premises and residential buildings (a year’s rent) and flats (a year’s rent).
Section 26 provides that in actions for the determination of a right, legal relationship or the validity of certain documents, as well as in actions for specific performance, it is assumed that the value of the dispute equals the amount stated in the statement of claim, but in any case should be no less than HRK 10,000.
