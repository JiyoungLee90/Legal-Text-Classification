Where these safeguards were concerned, the Government specified that the data registered were exhaustively listed and that the database could only be consulted on the basis of print comparisons (not with reference to a name or address). Moreover, only authorised police and gendarmerie officers could consult it.\u00a0Data processing was placed under the supervision of both the public prosecutor attached to the Court of Appeal and the National Commission on Data Processing and Civil Liberties (CNIL), which was an independent administrative authority. While limiting the period of retention of data to twenty-five years, the Decree also provided that the person concerned could request deletion of the data, and a judicial remedy to that end was available should the public prosecutor refuse deletion. In the instant case the Government noted that the applicant had had recourse to this remedy, applying to the judge responsible for civil liberties and detention matters and then to the First President of the Court of Appeal. They also submitted that the Court of Cassation had considered the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law from the angle of a fair trial, even though it had declared the appeal inadmissible.",

A margin of appreciation, the extent of which varies depending on a number of factors, including the nature of the activities restricted and the aims pursued by the restrictions (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 88, ECHR 1999-VI; Gardel v.

Germany, 6 September 1978, \u00a7 49, series A no. 28). The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual\u2019s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights (see Connors v. the United Kingdom, no. 66746/01, \u00a7 82, 27 May 2004, and S. and Marper, cited above, \u00a7 102). Where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State will be restricted (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2007-I; S. and Marper, cited above; and Gardel, B.B. v. France and M.B. v. France, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61, 60 and 52 respectively). Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, the margin will be wider (see Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2007V).",

In line with its findings in S. and Marper (cited above), the Court is of the opinion that the need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should notably ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored, and preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored.

Besides the fact that such a reason is not explicitly mentioned in the provisions of Article 1 of the impugned decree, barring a particularly extensive interpretation of this Article, the Court considers that accepting the argument based on an alleged guarantee of protection against potential identity theft would in practice be tantamount to justifying the storage of information on the whole population of France, which would most definitely be excessive and irrelevant.",
