The Court acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant, the authorities could justifiably have considered that such an initial risk was established. Regard being had to the fact that the applicant had been charged with being a member of a gang that traded in women and profited from their prostitution, the particular vulnerability of the victims, some of whom were minors, must be seen as relevant. Moreover, the Court agrees with the domestic court\u2019s assessment that there existed initially a risk of absconding given the fact that the applicant had been hiding from the police before his arrest.",
