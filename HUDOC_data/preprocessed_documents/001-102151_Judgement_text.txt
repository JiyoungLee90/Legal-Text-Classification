The case originated in an application (no. 37616/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Turkish nationals, Bozan Köse, İbrahim Halil Köse, Mehmet Köse, Meryem Köse, Müslüm Köse and Zöhre Köse (“the applicants”), on 17 May 1997.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Erkmen, a lawyer practising in Şanlıurfa. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 4 November 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible in respect of Mr Müslüm Köse, Mr Mehmet Köse, Mr Bozan Köse and Ms Meryem Köse and decided to communicate the application to the Government in respect of the other applicants, İbrahim Halil Köse and Zöhre Köse, in relation to parcels nos. 155, 193, 157, 195, 27, 150, 171, 135, 203 and 129 owned by them. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (former Article 29 § 3).
The applicants İbrahim Halil Köse and Zöhre Köse are Turkish nationals who were born in 1955 and 1927 respectively and live in Şanlıurfa. They are represented before the Court by Mr M. Erkmen, a lawyer practising in Şanlıurfa.
On an unspecified date the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources expropriated several plots of land, namely parcels nos. 155, 193, 157, 195, 27, 150, 171, 135, 203 and 129, belonging to the applicants in the Meteler , in Şanlıurfa, for the construction of the Birecik Dam.
In 1996, the applicants commenced proceedings before the  for additional compensation for their respective plots. Following the applicants’ requests, the Birecik Civil Court of First Instance awarded them additional compensation plus interest at the statutory rate. However, no interest was awarded for parcels nos. 203 and 129. The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources appealed and the Court of Cassation upheld the judgments of the first instance court.
In February and June 1997 the administration made payments to the applicants of additional compensation. The details regarding the proceedings and payments are indicated in the table below:
