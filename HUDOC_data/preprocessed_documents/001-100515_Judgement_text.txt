The case originated in seven applications (nos. 38126/08, 38341/08, 38345/08, 40593/08, 40596/08, 40598/08 and 45101/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by seven Russian citizens whose names and dates of birth are tabulated in the Annex (“the applicants”). The applications’ dates of introduction are also tabulated in the Annex.
The applicants were represented by Mr I. Fedotov, Ms L. Yerokhina, Mr M. Antonov, and Ms O. Gurova, consultants from the Moscow Region. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
The President of the First Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. In accordance with Article 26 § 1 of the Convention as amended by Protocol No. 14, the applications were assigned to a Committee of three Judges.
The applicants are pensioners who live in the Moscow Region. Before retirement, they used to work in hazardous industries. They had a dispute with a pension authority about the scope of their privileged pensions and appealed to the Region’s town courts.
In 2006 the courts held for the applicants and ordered the pension authority to recalculate the pensions. The courts based their findings on the Law on Labour Pensions. These judgments became binding and were executed.
On the pension authority’s request, in 2008 the town courts quashed their judgments due to discovery of new circumstances. The courts found, in particular, that the judgments had ignored the interpretation of the Law on Labour Pensions given by the Supreme Court in December 2005 and March 2007.
The applicants’ cases were remitted for a rehearing and eventually dismissed.
