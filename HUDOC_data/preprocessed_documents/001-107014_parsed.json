It was attended by 111 individuals, who unanimously resolved to form a nonprofit association named [Ilinden], adopted its articles and elected a managing council consisting of thirteen members. However, the wording of the articles \u2013 clauses 6 and\u00a07, [which set out] the association\u2019s goals and the means for attaining them \u2013 reveal their political character, which is impermissible for a nonprofit association. This follows from the interpretation of paragraph 2 of [the 2000 NonProfit Legal Persons Act], which provides that organisations intending to carry out political, tradeunion or religious activities must be regulated by separate statutes. For instance, in clause 6(1), (4) [and]\u00a0(5) of its articles the organisation proclaims itself as being a successor of and continuing the \u2018national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation\u2019, including \u2018the Macedonian fighters who fell victim to Bulgarian State terrorism and genocide\u2019, declares that \u2018it will express and defend the civil, social and economic rights of the Macedonians who live on Macedonian soil under Bulgarian occupation (jurisdiction) and of the Macedonians living in Bulgaria\u2019, insists that \u2018the assimilation process in Pirin Macedonia must stop\u2019, etc. All those goals set by the newly formed organisation are directed towards distorting the historical truth and ignoring the Bulgarian character of certain geographical regions, with a view to stirring overt confrontation between one group of Bulgarian citizens and another, which imperils both the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation. This is in breach of the imperative rule of Article 44 \u00a7 2 of [the Constitution] which provides that \u2018organisations whose activities are directed against the sovereignty [or] the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation, towards the incitement of racial, national, ethnical or religious enmity ... are prohibited\u2019. Moreover, the political goals and the ways of attaining them, set by the organisation in clause 7(2), (3) and (4) of its articles, are in breach of paragraph 2 of [the 2000 NonProfit Legal Persons Act] and Article 12 \u00a7 2 of [the Constitution]. Apart from that, the founders have elected thirteen members of the managing council, in breach of the articles which provide, in clause 32(5), that the first managing council will consist of three members who will manage and represent the association (clause 32(1)). This was equally in breach of section 20(6) and (9) in conjunction with section 18(1)(3) of [the 2000 NonProfit Legal Persons Act], because it engenders uncertainty as to the manner of managing and representing the organisation.",

The [Constitution] guarantees freedom of association, but only in line with the requirements of the law. It is not permissible for a nonprofit association to carry out political, tradeunion or religious activities. The assertion in the appeal that [Ilinden] does not seek to engage in political struggles is not substantiated. As correctly observed by [the Sofia Court of Appeal], an organisation which proclaims itself as being a successor and continuing the \u2018national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation\u2019, and its founders as spiritual successors of \u2018the Macedonian fighters who fell victim to Bulgarian State terrorism and genocide\u2019 has a markedly political character. The [lower court] correctly held that an activity consisting in \u2018safeguarding the social and economic rights of the Macedonians who live on Macedonian soil under Bulgarian occupation and of the Macedonians living in Bulgaria\u2019 is in breach of Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the [Constitution], which prohibits organisations whose activities are directed against the sovereignty [or] the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation, or towards the incitement of racial, national, ethnical or religious enmity. But even if [the court] were to accept the argument in the appeal that the organisation does not seek to attain goals which run counter to the constitutional order, those goals run counter to the [2000 NonProfit Legal Persons Act], as they are characteristic of a political party, not of a nonprofit association. Thus, the alleged violation of Article 38 of the [Constitution] has not been made out.",

Clause 32(5) makes special provision for the first managing council and says that it will consist of three members serving three years. That is, clause 32(5) does not merely set a minimum, as claimed in the appeal. For this reason, [the Sofia Court of Appeal] correctly found that the imperative rule of section 20(6) and (9) in conjunction with section 18(1)(3) of the [2000 NonProfit Legal Persons Act] has not been complied with \u2013 the manner of managing and representing the organisation is unclear.",

It was important to point out in that connection that the procedure for registering an association did not result in a ruling having res judicata, and that it was thus open to Ilinden to reapply for registration. To avoid another refusal, it simply had to bring its founding documents in line with the applicable requirements.

The Court has in a number of cases treated such refusals in themselves as interferences with the right to freedom of association (see Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, 10 July 1998, \u00a7 31, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV; APEH \u00dcld\u00f6z\u00f6tteinek Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge and Others v. Hungary (dec.), no.\u00a032367/96, 31 August 1999; Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a044158/98, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2004I; Partidul Comunistilor (Nepeceristi) and Ungureanu v. Romania, no. 46626/99, \u00a7 27, 3 February 2005; United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, \u00a7 53; Tsonev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 45963/99, \u00a7 43, 13 April 2006; Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia, no. 72881/01, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2006XI; Ramazanova and Others v. Azerbaijan, no. 44363/02, \u00a7 60, 1 February 2007; Zhechev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 57045/00, \u00a7 37, 21 June 2007; BekirOusta and Others v.\u00a0Greece, no. 35151/05, \u00a7 40, 11 October 2007; and Emin and Others v.\u00a0Greece, no. 34144/05, \u00a7 37, 26 March 2008). In one of those cases the Court specifically noted that although it could have regard to earlier or later registration proceedings, in so far as they could be relevant to the complaints before it, such proceedings fell outside the scope of the case (see United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 31). Separate registration proceedings are therefore of no relevance for the exhaustion of domestic remedies in the case at hand. Indeed, to hold otherwise might erect a permanent barrier to bringing such matters before the Court, because, as rightly pointed out by the Government, in Bulgaria a refusal to register a political party or an association does not preclude the possibility of making further applications for registration an indefinite number of times (see, mutatis mutandis, Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7 80, Series A no. 39; Nenov v. Bulgaria, no. 33738/02, \u00a7 38, 16 July 2009; and Naydenov v. Bulgaria, no. 17353/03, \u00a7 58, 26 November 2009). Moreover, the possibility of requesting an authority to reconsider the decision taken by it does not as a rule constitute an effective remedy (see Granger v. the United Kingdom, no. 11932/86, Commission decision of 9\u00a0May 1988, Decisions and Reports (DR) 56, p. 199, and Roseiro Bento v.\u00a0Portugal (dec.), no. 29288/02, ECHR 2004-XII (extracts)). Lastly, it cannot be overlooked that the instant refusal to register Ilinden was the third in a row (see Stankov, Trayanov, Stoychev, the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, Mechkarov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95, 29222/95, 29223/95, 29225/95 and 29226/95, Commission decision of 21\u00a0October 1996, unreported, and United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, \u00a7 30).",

For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively.",

It was quite conceivable that the Bulgarian courts could label any goals which were in some way related to the normal functioning of a democratic society as \u201cpolitical\u201d and accordingly direct the founders of legal entities wishing to pursue such goals to register them as political parties instead of \u201cordinary\u201d associations. Therefore, a classification based on that criterion was liable to produce incoherent results and engender considerable uncertainty among those wishing to apply for registration of such entities. The Court went on to observe that if associations in Bulgaria could, when registered as such, participate in elections and accede to power, it could prove necessary to require some of them to register as political parties, so as to make them subject to, for instance, stricter rules concerning party financing, public control and transparency. However, under Bulgarian law associations could not participate in national, local or European elections. There was therefore no pressing social need to require every association deemed by the courts to pursue \u201cpolitical\u201d goals to register as a political party. That would mean forcing the association to take a legal shape which its founders did not seek. It would also mean subjecting it to a number of additional requirements and restrictions, such as for instance the rule that a political party cannot be formed by less than a certain number of enfranchised citizens, which could in some cases prove an insurmountable obstacle for its founders. Such an approach ran counter to freedom of association, because, in case it was adopted, the liberty of action that would remain available to the founders of an association could become either non-existent or so reduced as to be of no practical value. On that basis, the Court concluded that alleged \u201cpolitical\u201d character of an association\u2019s aims was not a sufficient ground to refuse its registration (see Zhechev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 5557).",

It is true that it was apparently due to a certain lack of diligence on the part of Ilinden\u2019s founders. However, the domestic courts did not explain why they regarded that defect as so significant as to preclude registration and impossible to cure in the course of the registration proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 6569, and Tsonev, \u00a7\u00a7 55 and 57, both cited above). While States are entitled to require organisations seeking official registration to comply with reasonable legal formalities, that is always subject to the condition of proportionality (see Ertan and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 57898/00, 21 March 2006; Tebieti M\u00fchafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov v. , no. 37083/03, \u00a7 72, 8\u00a0October 2009; Hayvan Yeti\u015ftiricileri Sendikas\u0131 v.

For this Court, the defect appears to be of a relatively trivial character. Failing further explanations, it can hardly be regarded in itself as a sufficient reason to refuse to register Ilinden. Such a refusal is a radical measure, because it prevents the association or a political party in issue from even commencing any activity (see Gorzelik and Others, \u00a7 105; United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, \u00a7 80; Tsonev, \u00a7 63; and Zhechev, \u00a7 58, all cited above).",

To that amount should be added any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants, and it is to be paid into the bank account of the applicants\u2019 representative, the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee. As to the sum claimed by the applicants in respect of the Bulgarian translation of the Court\u2019s judgments in two previous cases and of documents sent to them by the Court, the Court, bearing in mind that the applicants were legally represented, and having regard to Rule 36 \u00a7 5 (a) of its Rules, does not consider that it was an expense which was necessarily incurred.
