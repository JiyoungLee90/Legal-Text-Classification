As to whether it could be \u201creasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), the Court notes that the applicant had already been tried and sentenced for the offence he had committed and that sub-paragraph (c) had ceased to apply on the date the conviction was pronounced. Hence, the deprivation of liberty to which the applicant was subjected did not have any legitimate purpose under Article 5 \u00a7 1 and was arbitrary. The Court also notes that the domestic courts did not identify any provisions of the domestic law which could have allowed the authorities to keep the applicant in custody after his having served the sentence in full.
