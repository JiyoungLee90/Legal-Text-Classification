In that connection, it notes that neither the trial court nor the Court of Cassation made an evaluation of the probative value of the absent witnesses\u2019 statements.

In that connection, the Court observes that during the course of the proceedings, the applicant\u2019s lawyers challenged the reliability of the contents of the computer disk, arguing that they had been excluded from the extraction procedure. Moreover, the applicant stated that the background information about him contained substantial mistakes, which proved that it had not been provided by him. Nevertheless, the trial court did not examine further the impugned evidence or respond to the applicant\u2019s allegations, nor did it provide the applicant with a copy of the computer disk.

Moreover, although the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court, which took over the case following the abolition of the State Security Courts, noted that \u015e.A. had not repeated his allegations against the applicant after his interview by the police, it went on to accept his police statements as evidence (see paragraph 21 above). In doing so, the trial court did not take any steps to assess the veracity of the evidence provided by \u015e.A. by, for example, taking account of the applicant\u2019s request to obtain further information concerning the dates of his military service.",
