In order for the right to a fair hearing to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires, as a rule, access to a lawyer as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the particular circumstances of the particular case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Having regard to the foregoing, and bearing in mind that the restriction imposed concerning access to a lawyer was systemic, pursuant to section 31 of Law no.\u00a03842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts, the Court concludes that although the applicant had met her lawyer during police custody, this meeting cannot be considered to have been sufficient by Convention standards.",
