The real keystone of French secularism, however, is the Act of 9 December 1905, known as the Law on the Separation between Church and State, which marked the end of a long conflict between the republicans, born of the French Revolution, and the Catholic Church. Section 1 provides: \u201cThe Republic shall ensure the freedom of conscience. It shall guarantee free participation in religious worship, subject only to the restrictions laid down hereinafter in the interest of public order.\u201d The principle of separation is affirmed in section 2 of the Act: \u201cthe Republic may not recognise, pay stipends to or subsidise any religious denomination.\u201d A number of consequences flow from this \u201csecular pact\u201d both for public services and users. It implies an acknowledgement of religious pluralism and State neutrality towards religions. In return for protection of his or her freedom of religion, the citizen must respect the public arena that is shared by all. The principle was then enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution of 27 October 1946, which has had constitutional status since a decision of the Constitutional Council of 15\u00a0January 1975, which states: \u201cThe Nation guarantees equal access for children and adults to instruction, vocational training and culture. The provision of free, public and secular education at all levels is a duty of the State.\u201d Lastly, the principle acquired actual constitutional status in Article 1 of the Constitution of 4 October 1958, which provides: \u201c shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic. It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without distinction of origin, race or religion. It shall respect all beliefs.\u201d",

The case quickly became a highly topical issue.

It is in this context that, on 1 July 2003, the President of the Republic instructed a commission to study the application of the principle of secularism in the Republic.

The Government had not provided any further explanations on this point. The applicant also pointed out that wearing the headscarf had given rise to strike action by a number of teachers in the school on the pretext of defending the principle of secularism and that it was those very teachers who had started the unrest and disruption and not in any way the applicant, who had not engaged in any form of proselytism.",

In that opinion the Conseil d'Etat laid down the principle that pupils were free to wear such signs on school premises, but specified the conditions in which they should be worn in order to be in conformity with the principle of secularism. The Conseil d'Etat observed that the acknowledged right of pupils to express and manifest their religious beliefs on school premises could not interfere with teaching activities, the content of the curriculum or the duty to attend classes regularly, or jeopardise their health or safety, disrupt teaching activities or the teachers' educational role, or, lastly, interfere with order in the establishment or the normal functioning of the public service. The Conseil d'Etat then left it to schools to determine in their internal rules how the principles thus defined would be applied. It indicated, lastly, that it was for the authority vested with disciplinary power to decide whether the wearing of a religious sign breached those rules and whether the breach justified a disciplinary penalty that could go as far as expulsion. The ministerial circulars of 1989 and 1994 accordingly gave school principals instructions regarding implementation of their disciplinary powers in this regard. The internal rules of  expressly banned \u201cconspicuous signs which are in themselves of proselytising or discriminatory effect\u201d.",

In that connection the Court reiterates that the scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. It must also be borne in mind that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, its application involves an inevitable element of judicial interpretation, since there will always be a need for clarification of doubtful points and for adaptation to particular circumstances. A margin of doubt in relation to borderline facts does not by itself make a legal provision unforeseeable in its application. Nor does the mere fact that a provision is capable of more than one construction mean that it fails to meet the requirement of \u201cforeseeability\u201d for the purposes of the Convention. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice (see Gorzelik and Others v.

They have thus systematically upheld disciplinary penalties imposed on pupils who have breached the duty to attend classes regularly by refusing to remove their headscarf during physical education and sports classes or refusing to attend these classes (see paragraph 29 above).

Accordingly, compelling a motorcyclist, who was a practising Sikh wearing a turban, to wear a helmet was a safety measure and any resulting interference with the exercise of his freedom of religion was justified on grounds of the protection of health (see X v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a07992/77, Commission decision of 12 July 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR)\u00a014, p. 234). Likewise, security checks enforced at airports (see Phull v. France (dec.), no.\u00a035753/03, ECHR 2005-I, 11\u00a0January 2005) or at the entrance to consulates (see El Morsli v. France (dec.), no.\u00a015585/06, 4\u00a0March 2008, ECHR 2008-...) and consisting in ordering the removal of a turban or a veil in order to submit to such checks do not constitute disproportionate interferences with the exercise of the right to religious freedom. Nor does the regulation of student dress or the refusal to provide administrative services, such as issuing a diploma, constitute a disproportionate interference where the individual concerned fails to comply with the rules (in the case in point requiring a student wearing the Islamic headscarf to appear with her head uncovered on a passport photo), regard being had to the requirements of the secular university system (see Karaduman v. Turkey, 16278/90, Commission decision of 3\u00a0May 1993, DR 74, p. 93). In the case of Dahlab (cited above), the Court held that prohibiting a teacher from wearing her headscarf while teaching a class of young children was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, having regard, among other things, to the fact that secularism, which presupposes denominational neutrality in schools, is a principle laid down in the Constitution of the canton of Geneva. The Court stressed the \u201cpowerful external symbol\u201d represented by wearing the headscarf and also considered the proselytising effect that it might have seeing that it appeared to be imposed on women by a religious precept which was hard to square with the principle of gender equality.",

It thus held that secularism was undoubtedly one of the fundamental principles of the State which were in harmony with the rule of law and respect for human rights and democracy. The Court thus noted that secularism in Turkey was the guarantor of democratic values and the principle that freedom of religion is inviolable and the principle that citizens are equal, that it also served to protect the individual not only against arbitrary interference by the State but also from external pressure from extremist movements and that freedom to manifest one's religion could be restricted in order to defend those values. It concluded that this notion of secularism was consistent with the values underpinning the Convention. Upholding that system could be considered necessary to protect the democratic system in  (see Leyla Sahin, cited above, \u00a7 114).",

The Court reiterates that an attitude which fails to respect that principle will not necessarily be accepted as being covered by the freedom to manifest one's religion and will not enjoy the protection of Article 9 of the Convention (see Refah Partisi (Prosperity Party) and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a093). Having regard to the margin of appreciation which must be left to the member States with regard to the establishment of the delicate relations between the Churches and the State, religious freedom thus recognised and restricted by the requirements of secularism appears legitimate in the light of the values underpinning the Convention.",

Subsequently, according to the information provided by the Government, the authorities concerned made many unsuccessful attempts over a long period of time to enter into dialogue with the applicant and a period of reflection was granted her and subsequently extended. Furthermore, the ban was limited to the physical education class, so cannot be regarded as a ban in the strict sense of the term (see K\u00f6se and Others, cited above). Moreover, it can be seen from the circumstances of the case that these events had led to a general atmosphere of tension within the school. Lastly, the disciplinary process also appears to have been accompanied by safeguards \u2013 the rule requiring conformity with statute and judicial review \u2013 that were apt to protect the pupils' interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Leyla Sahin, cited above, \u00a7 159).",

Greece, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a032, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). With regard to the applicant's proposal to replace the headscarf by a hat, apart from the fact that it is difficult for the Court to judge whether wearing a hat instead would be compatible with sports classes, the question whether the pupil expressed a willingness to compromise, as she maintains, or whether \u2013 on the contrary \u2013 she overstepped the limits of the right to express and manifest her religious beliefs on the school premises, as the Government maintain and appears to conflict with the principle of secularism, falls squarely within the margin of appreciation of the State.",
