The Court further accepts that possible flaws in the committal warrant do not necessarily render the detention unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see J\u0117\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR 2000IX and Svipsta v. Latvia, no. 66820/01, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2006III (extracts)).

This suspicion was based on a series of specific acts and evidence contained in the case file and presented to the applicant (see paragraph 10 above), evidence which suggested that he could have committed the offences of taking bribes, aiding and abetting aggravated theft and criminal conspiracy. While it is true that the exact date of the offences was not given, the prosecution service nonetheless based its decision on sufficient evidence to persuade a neutral and objective observer that the individual in question could have committed the offence (see, a contrario, Stepuleac v.

In this respect, the Court notes that the prosecution service specifically indicated that, as a police officer, the applicant could exert an influence on certain individuals who were due to be questioned during the investigation. In the Court\u2019s opinion, this was a relevant and sufficient reason to justify the applicant\u2019s placement in pre-trial detention at the outset of the investigation.
