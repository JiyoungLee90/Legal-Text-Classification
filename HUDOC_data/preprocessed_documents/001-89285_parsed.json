By virtue of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision, Article 263 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the extent it had been found to be unconstitutional would cease to have effect six months after publication of the said judgment in the Polish Journal of Law.",

In addition, it notes that the authorities were faced with the difficult task of determining the facts and the degree of alleged responsibility of each of the defendants. In these circumstances, the Court also accepts that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources, coupled with the fact that in the course of the investigation new suspects had been identified, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant\u2019s initial detention. However, with the passage of time, these grounds became less relevant. Moreover, the authorities relied heavily on the likelihood that a severe sentence might have been imposed on the applicant given the serious nature of the offences at issue. In this connection, the Court agrees that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Michta v. Poland, no.\u00a013425/02, \u00a7 49, 4 May 2006).",

Poland, no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4 October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent extensions of the detention (see Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present one concerning organised crime groups, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is in the nature of things often particularly high. Indeed, in this context the Court notes that some members of the organised criminal gang have not yet been apprehended.",

Poland judgment (no. 19583/07, 30 January 2007, \u00a7 54)) it observed that there were two possibilities available to Mr Ryckie under Polish law to claim compensation in relation to his detention on remand. He could have instituted proceedings for compensation for unjustified detention (Article 552 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) or he could have claimed compensation from the State Treasury for damage caused by the unlawful action of a State official carried out in the course of performing his duties (Article 417 of the Civil Code: see paragraphs 26 and 27 above).",

The applicant\u2019s case is still pending before the Supreme Court. Secondly, the new Article 417 sec. 3 of the Civil Code cannot be invoked by the applicant since the remedy cannot be used in respect of unlawful actions that have occurred before 1 September 2004.
