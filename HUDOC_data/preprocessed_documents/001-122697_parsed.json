The cell had a folding bed, a washbasin with cold water, a toilet, a shelf for toiletries, a chair and a table. The cell was ventilated naturally, and was lit by a day-time lamp and a night-time lamp (dezhurnoye osvescheniye). In addition, the cell had a window measuring 60 x 90 cm. The cell was equipped with a cistern for boiled water which was supplied by the warders when necessary. Referring to the certificates issued by the head of the remand prison, Mr Tagiyev, dated 7\u00a0August 2008, the Government alleged that illumination, temperature and humidity in the isolation cell had corresponded to the sanitary standards. The distance between the toilet and the bed was one metre, which was explained by the small dimensions of the cell; such a distance, however, respected basic requirements of hygiene. The bed was unfolded during the night, namely between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. During the daytime the second applicant could sit on the chair. The Government also attached a report of inspection of sanitary conditions of certain other premises of the remand prison (not apparently related to the cells where the second applicant was detained), dated January 2006, as well as two reports of the inspection of the ordinary cells where the second applicant was detained dated February 2004 and January 2005, which concluded that sanitary condition of the cells was satisfactory.

The inspector at the first control post demanded that Mr Shmidt should hand over to her for inspection a transparent plastic paper-case that he had with him. Mr Shmidt refused, explaining that it was his lawyer\u2019s file. In response, the inspector forcibly seized the papers from him. According to the first applicant, the seized document itself comprised two sheets. The first sheet was written by Mr\u00a0Simonov, the head of the Glasnost Defence Foundation. It was in Mr\u00a0Simonov\u2019s own handwriting and was a rough draft of a proposed letter in support of the applicant - that letter was published some time later. The second sheet was in Mr Shmidt\u2019s own handwriting. Both notes were written quite some time before the 11 March visit to the applicant. On 13\u00a0March 2004 Mr Karimov, the lead investigator, wrote to Mr Denisov at the Ministry of Justice stating that the note seized \u201ccontained an instruction on counteraction to the investigation by way of influencing the investigation through mass media\u201d. Mr Denisov then wrote on 26 March 2004 to the head of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Justice requesting measures to be taken against Mr Shmidt. On 7 May 2004 the Ministry of Justice Main Directorate wrote to the St Petersburg Bar Association requesting that disciplinary proceedings be started against Mr\u00a0Shmidt for breach of professional ethics. Mr Shmidt was subsequently exonerated at the disciplinary proceedings, where it was determined that Mr Shmidt had been entitled to take the document into and out of the remand prison and that it was legally privileged.",

It was said by the prosecution that the application was made pursuant to Article 281 of the RF Code of Criminal Procedure. The defence objected to the motion, as neither the testimony of accused individuals nor the decisions to charge them came within the ambit and scope of evidence that could be read out as defined by Article 281 of the RF Criminal Code.

Mr\u00a0Shchekin also explained that in his opinion there was no basis for characterising the trading companies as sham companies. He indicated that the question of where the oil products traded by those companies were produced and kept was irrelevant for granting them the tax cuts.

The granting of tax concessions had made it possible to rescue the Lesnoy town economy from a state of permanent crisis. In particular, the experts concluded that the refund of tax overpayments by Yukos promissory notes \u201chad not caused damage to the town and federal budgets\u201d and that the Lesnoy town trading companies had been entitled to pay tax in advance since this was the \u201cunconditional right of a taxpayer\u201d.

The report did not mention their names and was not signed by them. Mr Gage, a partner with Ernst and Young who testified before the court, named those persons in his oral submissions, but since they had not signed the report, it was impossible to establish their role in the preparation of the report and their qualifications. The only signature on the report was that of the general director. Furthermore, the report had been obtained at the request of ALM-Feldmans law firm, which was not participating in the criminal proceedings. The cover-letter with which that report was forwarded to ALM-Feldmans was irrelevant.

To reach Krasnokamensk from Moscow involved a minimum of two days. It was a long and strenuous journey, made even more difficult by the infrequency of flights from Moscow to Chita. A flight from Moscow to Chita took approximately six and a half hours (occasionally more, when the aircraft had to refuel in Yekaterinburg). On arrival in Chita, there was a seven-hour wait before boarding a train for Krasnokamensk, which took another fifteen hours to arrive. Alternatively, the visitors had the choice of a train ride from Moscow, 106 hours on an uninterrupted run. This made it very arduous for the first applicant\u2019s lawyers and family to gain access to him, and inevitably some of them were not seeing the first applicant as much as they otherwise would. The first applicant\u2019s lawyers described the journey as \u201cvery exhausting and debilitating\u201d. Mr\u00a0Mkrtychev, a lawyer who undertook the journey from Moscow to Krasnokamensk on eight occasions, testified that he had never seen any \u201csleeping wagons\u201d or a dining car on the trains on which he had travelled. Internet and mobile phone reception were also impossible, contrary to what the Government had maintained. The first applicant further maintained that Krasnokamensk itself was subject to huge extremes in climate. According to Mr\u00a0Mkrtychev, during his first journey there in October 2005 the temperature was approximately minus ten degrees Celsius, with a freezing and almost unbearable wind. On one of his later visits the temperature dropped to 41 degrees below freezing point. The short summer was equally oppressive, with blistering heat and swarms of mosquitoes.",

The District Court found that under Article 73 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences a convicted person had the right to serve his sentence in the region where he was convicted or where he had lived before. However, if in that prison there were no places vacant, the detainee could be sent to serve his sentence in the nearest region where it was possible to accommodate him. The District Court referred to a decision of FSIN which defined which colonies must accept convicts from Moscow and in what proportions. According to the District Court, that decision was taken within the competence of FSIN, and did not violate the law. The District Court also held that if the first applicant was placed in a nearer colony the rights of other prisoners might have been violated.

The Commercial Court\u2019s award included (but was not limited to it) reassessed taxes for 2000 attributable to the operations of Mitra, Vald Oil, and Business Oil, i.e. three of the four ZATO trading companies that formed the basis for the civil damages award made against the applicants within the criminal proceedings. The Commercial Court found that those companies (along with trading companies registered in low tax zones) had obtained tax cuts unlawfully. The Commercial Court further decided that their operations with Yukos oil had to be treated as operations of Yukos itself, because these companies were nothing more than a \u201cfa\u00e7ade\u201d for Yukos, and Yukos obtained all benefits from those operations. Consequently, the Commercial Court imputed the unpaid taxes of those trading companies directly to Yukos (for more details see the judgment in the Yukos case, \u00a7 48). The decision of the Commercial Court did not contain a detailed calculation of the amounts due by each trading companies.",

Mr\u00a0Shakhnovskiy also reported on his meeting with the then Minister of Finances, Mr Kudrin, who said, inter alia, that unpaid taxes had been just a pretext used to crush Mr\u00a0Khodorkovskiy and take away his company. Mr\u00a0Nevzlin, a former member of the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament and one of the co-owners of Yukos, has testified that in mid-spring 2003 he had been warned by Mr Lesin, the Media Minister, that a political decision had been taken to attack the first applicant and Yukos. Mr Dubov, another major shareholder of Yukos, testified that on 24\u00a0October 2003 (the day before the first applicant\u2019s arrest) Mr Surkov (one of the closest aids of President Putin) had said that \u201call government institutions had been forbidden from having any contact with Open Russia and that President Putin had stated that Yukos was going to be eliminated from the political sphere\u201d. Mr Dyatelev, one of the applicants\u2019 lawyers, gave evidence that a former Tax Minister, Mr Pochinok, was told by Mr\u00a0Surkov not to give evidence at the applicant\u2019s trial in relation to the tax charges. Mr\u00a0Ivlev, a lawyer with ALM Feldmans (a law firm working for Yukos), testified that in November 2003 he had met Mr Shuvalov, another aid to President Putin, who had said that there had been absolutely nothing he could do to stop the attacks on the first applicant and Yukos, and implied that decision concerning their fate had been taken at the highest level within the Presidential Administration.",

However, such limitations should not be arbitrary, should pursue a legitimate aim and should be proportionate to it. Legitimate aims may include preventing further criminal activity by the accused and preventing him from exerting pressure on witnesses or otherwise obstructing justice. The general rule is that lawyer-client correspondence is privileged and cannot be perused. Any departure from this rule is permissible only in exceptional circumstances where the authorities have valid reasons to believe that the lawyer and/or his client are abusing the confidentiality rule. Further, the Constitutional Court specified that the prison authorities should have \u201csufficient and reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the correspondence contains unlawful content and that they may peruse such correspondence only in the presence of the persons concerned and on the basis of a written motivated decision. The results of the inspection of the mail should also be recorded.

The Circuit Court ruled that the lower courts had failed to study and to take account of all of the circumstances relevant to the case at issue. In particular, the court noted the finding that the contract had been concluded specifically to avoid the payment of taxes. Accordingly, it reversed and invalidated the contract as unlawful, contrary to the legal order and morality, and ordered that the proceeds derived by the parties from the contract be seized in favour of the State.",

OOO TF Grin Haus (no.\u00a0A4031714/97-2-312) concerned a series of intertwined transactions (rent contracts and loan agreements) between the respondent entity and two third parties: as a result, the respondent leased a building in central Moscow to the third parties, but was able to avoid inclusion of the rent payments in the taxable base of its operations by claiming that they were interest payments in respect of the loan agreement. The Tax Service discovered the tax-evasion scheme, re-characterised the transactions in question as rent and ordered the taxpayer to pay RUB 2 billion in back taxes. The case was examined in three rounds of court proceedings by the courts at three levels of jurisdiction. Having regard to the substance of the transactions entered into by the respondent, the terms of payment and execution of the contested contracts, and, generally, to the conduct of the respondent company and the third parties, the courts decided that the contractual arrangement had been sham, re-characterised the arrangement as rent and upheld the decision of the Tax Service. In the first round of proceedings the courts adopted their decisions on the following dates: 1 December 1997, 27 January 1998 and 30 March 1998. In the second round of proceedings the decisions were adopted by the first-instance and appeal courts on 26 May 1998 and 21 July 1998. The decision of the cassation court was taken on an unspecified date. The third round of proceedings involved decisions on 17 November 1998, 25 January 1999 and 2 March 1999.",

It concerned the operation of a company (Chelpiks) registered on the territory of ZATO of the Snezhinsk town and operating there on the basis of a preferential taxation agreement concluded with the town administration. The Tax Inspectorate required that the company paid taxes in full. They argued that given the \u201cde facto location of the company\u201d preferential taxation agreement was not valid. The court of cassation disagreed.

The court of cassation noted that under the ZATO Act, in order to be eligible to tax cuts, the company should have at least 90 per cent of its assets and carry out at least 70 per cent of its business activities on the territory of the ZATO at issue; in addition, 70 per cent of the average number of personnel on payroll should be from ZATO, while at least 70 per cent of wage should be paid to workers who are permanent residents of ZATO. The court found that 70\u00a0per cent of the average number of staff in the company were ZATO residents and that they received more than 70 per cent of wages paid by the company. The central argument for the Tax Inspectorate was that the business activity of the defendant company (which consisted of processing and re-selling of oil-products) was not carried out on the territory of ZATO and that it was done by the industrial facilities which did not belong to the defendant company. The court however, rejected that argument as irrelevant and held that those factors did not affect eligibility of the defendant company to tax cuts.",

Under that agreement Mr K. was supposed to work as a general manager of the taxpayer company, in exchange of a fee. Mr K. was registered as an individual entrepreneur; at the same time he was the sole owner of the Vliran Ltd (i.e. the taxpayer company). As a result, the service agreement had his signatures on behalf of both sides: he signed it in the capacity of an individual entrepreneur and in the capacity of the sole owner of the company. The fees paid by the company to Mr K. were included in its declaration as \u201ccosts\u201d. The Tax Inspectorate considered that these fees could not be regarded as \u201ccosts\u201d on the ground that the service agreement between the company and Mr K. was null, since it was signed by the same person on both sides. The court of cassation, however, ruled in favour of the taxpayer company. It held, in particular, that the charter of the company did not provide for the position of a general director, and that his functions could therefore be transferred to an external person. Furthermore, there was nothing in the law to prevent the company from \u201coutsourcing\u201d the managerial function to somebody else.

It noted, in p. 55, that \u201csolitary confinement further restricts the already highly limited rights of people deprived of their liberty. The extra restrictions involved are not inherent in the fact of imprisonment and thus have to be separately justified\u201d. For the CPT, it is appropriate to apply the traditional tests developed by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. In particular, any further restriction of a prisoner\u2019s rights must be linked to the actual harm the prisoner has caused in the prison setting. During solitary confinement there should, for example, be no automatic withdrawal of rights to visits, telephone calls and correspondence or of access to resources normally available to prisoners (such as reading materials). Given the potentially very damaging effects of solitary confinement, the CPT considers that the principle of proportionality requires that it be used as a disciplinary punishment only in exceptional cases and as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time, no higher than 14 days for a given offence, and preferably lower. Prisoners undergoing solitary confinement as a disciplinary sanction should be entitled to at least one hour\u2019s outdoor exercise per day, from the very first day of placement in solitary confinement, and should also be permitted access to a reasonable range of reading material (for further details see Razvyazkin v. Russia, no. 13579/09, \u00a7 89, 3 July 2012). On the last point the 21st General Report reiterated recommendation made in respect of the Russian Federation in the Report on the 2001 visit to the Russian Federation (CPT/inf (2003) 30), made public on 30 June 2003, where it urged the Russian authorities in \u00a7\u00a0119 to \u201ctake steps to ensure throughout the country that prisoners placed in disciplinary cells have access to reading matter.\u201d",

Whatever the real reason for imposing a disciplinary sanction, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s fault, if any, was not particularly serious and did not probably call for such a measure (see in this respect the CPT\u2019s recommendation that such a serious punishment as solitary confinement should be commensurable to the disciplinary offence for which it was imposed, paragraph 455 above). The Court reiterates that although it is not for the Court to specify which security measures may be applied to prisoners, \u201cthe absence of any substantive reasons\u201d for placing a detainee in a solitary confinement cell for a considerable period of time can be a relevant factor for characterising this form of disciplinary punishment as \u201cinhuman and degrading treatment\u201d (see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a024027/07, 11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09, \u00a7 211, 10\u00a0April 2012; see also Razvyazkin, cited above, \u00a7 107).",

It is questionable whether such a window would provide enough natural light for a cell measuring 5.5 square metres. The permanent electric light in the cell may have been very disturbing for a detainee, and the one-metre distance between the open toilet pan and the sleeping place was clearly insufficient. Furthermore, the applicant had been deprived of all social contacts, could not read books or magazines or watch TV (see paragraph\u00a0452 above), and could not lie down on the bunk-bed, since it was unfolded only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",

However, the Court is not required to resolve this factual controversy on those points. Even if the applicant\u2019s description of the other conditions of detention was accurate, and even if such conditions might indeed be very uncomfortable, it is crucial to note that the situation complained of lasted for only seven days (cf. with Popandopulo v.

The Court concludes that in the circumstances of the present case the degree of suffering to which the applicant was exposed, given its short duration and in view of the applicant\u2019s age and mental and physical condition, did not reach the minimal threshold of severity to amount to \u201cinhuman or degrading\u201d treatment.

The Government\u2019s reference to certain \u201csecurity risks\u201d was too vague and was not supported by any specific fact. It appears that \u201cthe metal cage in the ... courtroom was a permanent installation which served as a dock and that the applicant\u2019s placement in it was not necessitated by any real risk of his absconding or resorting to violence but by the simple fact that it was the seat where he, as a defendant in a criminal case, was meant to be seated\u201d (see Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, cited above, \u00a7 127). Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s own safety or the safety of the co-accused was not at stake. Finally, the applicant\u2019s trial was covered by almost all major national and international mass media, so the applicant was permanently exposed to the public at large in such a setting. As in Ashot Harutyunyan the Court concludes that \u201csuch a harsh appearance of judicial proceedings could lead an average observer to believe that an extremely dangerous criminal was on trial. Furthermore, [the Court] agrees with the applicant that such a form of public exposure humiliated him in his own eyes, if not in those of the public, and aroused in him feelings of inferiority\u201d (\u00a7 128).",

However, the Court notes that these arguments did not constitute part of the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning. The Government further referred to the testimony of potential witnesses who had fled the country, allegedly at the insistence of the Yukos management (see paragraph 491 above). The Court notes that that testimony was collected only in 2007-2008 and, consequently, had not been relied upon by the domestic courts in 20032005. The same concerns information about credit cards issued by foreign banks in the applicant\u2019s name, real-estate abroad and private jets which had allegedly been at the applicant\u2019s disposal at Vnukovo airport: those factual elements were not mentioned in the extension orders under examination. The Court reiterates in this respect that \u201cit is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in [the detention orders] and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3\u201d (see, for example, Wiensztal v.

By the end of 2004 the court had completed its examination of evidence collected by the prosecution. These developments significantly reduced the risk of tampering with evidence. Furthermore, throughout 2004 the main assets of Yukos were attached and sold at auction (see the Yukos case, \u00a7\u00a7 92 et seq.). Thus, the second applicant ceased to exercise de facto control over the company; his ability to influence the company\u2019s personnel was accordingly reduced.

Thus, the mention of the second applicant\u2019s \u201cinternational connections\u201d was too vague and was not supported by any evidence. The Court stresses that, given the advanced stage of the proceedings, the domestic courts were in a position to take a closer look at the second applicant\u2019s alleged \u201cinternational connections\u201d and explain it in their decisions (compare Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, \u00a7 187, 22\u00a0December 2008, and Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, no. 15217/07, \u00a7\u00a0126, 12\u00a0March 2009). The reference to the second applicant\u2019s character \u201cwas not accompanied by any description of the applicant\u2019s character or an explanation as to why it made his detention necessary\u201d (see Polonskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no. 30033/05, \u00a7 152, 19 March 2009). The fact that other Yukos managers and shareholders had left Russia might probably have been relevant at the initial stage of the investigation, but \u201cthe fact that a person is charged with acting in criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account\u201d (see Sizov v. Russia, no.\u00a033123/08, \u00a7\u00a053, 15 March 2011). Furthermore, the Court notes that \u201cthe behaviour of a co-accused cannot be a decisive factor for the assessment of the risk of the detainee\u2019s absconding. Such assessment should be based on personal circumstances of the detainee\u201d (see Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7\u00a076, 1\u00a0June 2006).",

The Court reiterates that under Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 a detainee is entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention must be decided speedily by a court (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no.\u00a029462/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-88, ECHR 2000XII, and G.B. v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 27426/95, \u00a7\u00a7 34-39, 30\u00a0November 2000). Where domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04; at the same time, the standard of speediness \u201cis less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal.... The Court would not be concerned, to the same extent, with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees\u201d (see Shakurov v. Russia, no. 55822/10, \u00a7 179, 5 June 2012). In the case of Mamedova, cited above, which, like the present case, concerned appeal proceedings, it found that the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement was not complied with where the appeal proceedings lasted thirty-six, twenty-six, thirty-six, and twenty-nine days respectively, stressing that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see Mamedova, \u00a7 96; see also, for longer delays, Ignatov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a027193/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0112-114, 24 May 2007, and Lamazhyk v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020571/04, \u00a7\u00a7 104-106, 30 July 2009). By contrast, the length of appeal proceedings that lasted ten, eleven and sixteen days was found to be compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Yudayev v. Russia, no. 40258/03, \u00a7\u00a7 84-87, 15 January 2009, and Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), \u00a7\u00a0247). Finally, the Court reiterates that the delay for which the State may be held responsible should not include the time when the defence was preparing their brief of appeal (see Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), \u00a7 247), unless the defence was prevented from finalising it through the fault of the authorities (see Lebedev (no. 1), \u00a7 100).",

The Court has already addressed this problem above under Article 5 \u00a7 3. It follows that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04, in so far as it concerned the failure of the court of appeal to give reasons, does not require a separate examination.",

The applicants further claimed that the hearing in their case was not \u201cfair\u201d, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01, in particular due to the lack of time and facilities to prepare the defence (Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b)), impossibility to enjoy effective legal assistance (Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (c)), and the applicants\u2019 inability to examine prosecution evidence or adduce their own evidence (Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03 (d)).

Russia, no. 30024/02, \u00a7 182, 3 May 2011).

Thus, the central proposition of the Shakhnovskiy judgment was the fictitious character of his relations with Status Services. This was based on a number of other interim factual findings, including the fact that Mr Aleksanyan had given a legal opinion to the first applicant, describing the individual entrepreneur\u2019s scheme, the fact that the second applicant had been a chief executive of Status Services, and the fact that an identical service contract had existed between the second applicant and Status Services (see paragraph 142 above).",

These rooms were equipped with safe-boxes, where the defence was allowed to keep the materials of the case-file. The applicants were studying the materials in parallel with their lawyers; according to a letter from the head of the remand prison, the defence could ask the administration to make copies of the materials in the case file. In addition, the applicants were entitled to make notes and take materials from the case file to their cells, and transmit written comments to the lawyers, under the conditions established in sections 17, 18, 20 and 21 of the Detention on Remand Act. The second applicant had always had paper, writing accessories and law books at his disposal. The Government denied that the second applicant had not been allowed to use a magnifying glass or a calculator: although, as a rule, detainees could not have such objects, the applicant had been allowed to use them during the court hearings and when he studied the case file.",

In addition, the defence had only been permitted to use certain meeting rooms, even when others were vacant, which was very suspicious. The Government\u2019s assertion that the applicant was able to give written comments to his lawyers was misleading, in as much as it omitted to mention the fact that all such comments had had to be passed through a special division of the detention facility - i.e. lawyerclient confidentiality had systemically been violated.

The applicants had been entitled to read the case file only in the presence of the investigator.

The temporary absence of a magnifying glass and a calculator had seriously impaired the preparation of the defence of the second applicant. The applicants were very largely reliant on the notes that they had made when they were reviewing the case files in the presence of the investigator.

If one of the lawyers was studying a particular volume of the case-file in the premises of the GPO, the applicants were unable to study that volume at the remand prison. Although the applicants were allowed to take handwritten notes, it was impossible for them to make photocopies. The lawyers, by contrast, were allowed to make photocopies, but mostly for their own use. If they needed to give a copy of a document to the applicants, this was possible only through the remand prison administration and, in any event, the applicants could keep only a limited amount of printed materials in their cells. The second applicant was not allowed to use a magnifying glass and a calculator for some time, which must have slowed down his work. The case file was made available to the defence only in special rooms. The applicants and their lawyers were unable to discuss the case confidentially and, simultaneously, to work with the case file: if they needed to have the case file before them, the presence of an investigator was obligatory. In 2004 the case files were transferred to the remand prison, and, as follows from the applicants\u2019 lawyers\u2019 complaints to the investigative authorities, this made photocopying of documents impossible.

The Court reiterates that in Kamasinski v.\u00a0Austria (19 December 1989, \u00a7 87, Series A no. 168), which concerned the rights of the accused under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (e), the Court held that the system provided for under section 45 \u00a7 2 of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure which stipulated that the right to inspect and make copies of the court file is restricted to the defendant\u2019s lawyer, the defendant himself only having such access if he is legally unrepresented, was not in itself incompatible with the right of the defence safeguarded under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (b); see also Kremzow v. Austria, 21 September 1993, \u00a7 52, Series A no.\u00a0268B).",

The Court reiterates that in \u00d6calan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 141 et seq.,) it found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) because before the start of the trial the applicant had not been permitted to inspect the prosecution case file personally, even though the applicant\u2019s lawyers had had access to it. However, the present case must be distinguished from \u00d6calan. In the latter the applicant had no access to the case file whatsoever prior to the start of the trial, whereas in the present case both applicants had the case files at their disposal for several months. When in \u00d6calan the applicant was finally given direct access to the materials of the prosecution case, he had only twenty days to read 17,000 pages. The time given to the applicants in the present case was much longer. Finally, in \u00d6calan v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a0162, 12 March 2003) \u201cthe applicant\u2019s lawyers may have been prevented from giving the applicant an assessment of the importance of all these items of evidence by the sheer number and volume of documents and the restriction imposed on the number and length of their visits\u201d. No such drastic restrictions were imposed on the applicants in the present case (compare with the description of the conditions in which the applicant had to meet his lawyers in \u00d6calan, cited above, \u00a7 26 et seq.).",

The defence lawyers had at their disposal portable copying and scanning devices and were thus able to make and keep copies of the most important documents in the case file. The Court is aware that certain restrictions applied to the meetings between the applicants and their respective defence teams, in particular as regards the exchange of notes and documents. Those restrictions will be analysed separately under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention.

Furthermore, at least until the end of 2003 \u2013 beginning of 2004 there was a possibility for the defence lawyers to make copies of the materials. The Court previously held that unrestricted use of any notes and the possibility of obtaining copies of relevant documents were important guarantees of a fair trial. The failure to afford such access weighed, in the Court\u2019s assessment, in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see Matyjek v.

Their professional status is also an additional factor in favour of the Court\u2019s finding that the applicants\u2019 inability to study every document personally was somehow compensated by their lawyers\u2019 participation in examination of the case file: it must have been natural for the applicants, as senior managers, to delegate certain tasks to their lawyers.",

It follows that the applicants did not need to read every page of such contracts in order to counter the prosecution\u2019s arguments. As transpires from the judgment in the applicants\u2019 case, a large part of the materials in both cases must have been identical. This means that in reality the number of pages which the applicants needed to scrutinise after the joinder of the two cases was less than the overall number of pages in each co-defendant\u2019s case.",

Pursuant to the law the exchange of objects and documents between the defence lawyers and the defendant had to remain under the supervision of the investigators and the court, in order to exclude collusion. Under Article 275 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code the applicants were entitled to use notes, which had to be shown to the presiding judge if he or she so requested.

The judge needed to inspect notes transmitted from the applicants to their lawyers in order to decide whether they were related to the criminal proceedings, and in order to prevent the applicants giving their lawyers personal letters and similar documents that were not relevant to the case. The judge did not object to the contacts between the applicants and the lawyers during the breaks and even in the course of the hearing (to the extent that these did not pose a problem for the normal course of the hearing), but insisted on inspecting written documents passed between them.

However, the search of and subsequent seizure from Mr Shmidt occurred when he was leaving the remand prison, and it could not therefore be alleged that the measures were designed to prevent prohibited items being brought into it.

The defence complained to the Meshchanskiy District Court about the inability to discuss matters confidentially in the court room on a significant number of occasions. The trial court refused to alter the arrangements in any way, simply stating that the defence were able to discuss matters confidentially during the adjournments.

Those provisions related to a lawyer\u2019s participation in the trial, and did not govern the right of a lawyer to see his client. Section 18 of the Detention on Remand Act contained the applicable law in relation to access to a lawyer and provided that an accused was permitted to receive visits from his lawyer \u201cwith no limitation of their number or duration\u201d. Moreover, Section 18 expressly stated that \u201cvisits shall be granted to a defence lawyer upon presentation of a lawyer\u2019s ID and an authorisation.

An accused\u2019s right to communicate with his advocate out of hearing of a third person is part of the basic requirements of a fair trial. If a lawyer were unable to confer with his client and receive confidential instructions from him without such surveillance, \u201chis assistance would lose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective\u201d (see S. v. Switzerland, 28\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 220). Any interference with privileged material, and, a fortiori, the use of such material against the accused in the proceedings should be exceptional, be justified by a pressing need and will always be subjected to the strictest scrutiny by this Court (see Khodorkovskiy (no.1), \u00a7\u00a0198).",

Such limitations, however, had no firm basis in domestic law. Thus, the legislation referred to by the Government regulated the correspondence of detainees with the outside world (\u201ctelegrams [and] letters\u201d or \u201cproposals, declarations and complaints\u201d - see section 20 of the Detention on Remand Act, sections 84, 86, 91 and 99 of the Internal Regulations). It also mentioned \u201cobjects, substances and foodstuff\u201d which the detainees were not allowed to have or to use (see\u00a0sections 18 and 34 of the Detention on Remand Act, and, in particular, section 27 of the Internal Regulations, which associates \u201cobjects\u201d with physical objects rather than documents, or Article\u00a019.12 of the Code of Administrative Offences). The Court has doubts as to whether the drafts or notes made by a lawyer during a meeting with his or her client could be qualified as \u201ccorrespondence\u201d or \u201cprohibited objects\u201d within the meaning of the Detention on Remand Act or the Internal Regulations. The Government did not specify what set of rules applied to the notes and to other written materials which the applicants might have exchanged with their lawyers during the meetings, and the Court cannot accept that the law was applied by extension in such a sensitive area as intereference with privileged materials of the defence. The Court reiterates in this respect that any limitations imposed on a detainee concerning his contacts with lawyers should have a lawful basis and that the law should be sufficiently precise (see, mutatis mutandis, Nolan and K. v. Russia, no.\u00a02512/04, \u00a7\u00a7 98-99, 12\u00a0February 2009, with further references).",

Secrecy of written communications is no less important than the secrecy of oral exchanges, especially where the case is factually and legally complex. As follows from the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 29\u00a0November 2010 (see paragraph 396 above), notes, drafts, outlines, action plans, etc. prepared by the lawyer for or during a meeting with his detained client are to all intents and purposes privileged material. In addition, as noted by the Constitutional Court, certain exceptions from the general principle of confidentiality are permissible, but only if the authorities have a reasonable cause to believe that the professional privilege is being abused. The Court fully subscribes to this position. The Court reiterates that in Campbell, cited above, it stressed that the prisoner\u2019s correspondence with a lawyer should not be \u201csusceptible to routine scrutiny\u201d. Such correspondence can be opened only when the prison authorities have \u201creasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure\u201d. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. The reading of a prisoner\u2019s mail to and from a lawyer should only be permitted \u201cin exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature\u201d (\u00a7 48).",

This went so far as to assimilate \u201ccorrespondence\u201d with written notes made by the lawyers in preparation for the meetings with the client or during them. The only way for the defence to overcome that presumption was to submit their working papers to the prison authorities for inspection, i.e. to reveal their arguments to a body which could hardly be regarded as independent, and which was required by law to communicate all suspicious correspondence to the investigative authorities (see paragraph 392 above).",

However, the fact that a criminal defendant is detained is not sufficient to subject all of his written communications with his lawyers to perusal, and that for an indefinite period of time and without any justification specific for that particular case. The Court has repeatedly condemned the practice of \u201cindiscriminate, routine checking of all of the applicant\u2019s correspondence\u201d with his lawyer (see Jankauskas v. , no. 59304/00, \u00a7 22, 24 February 2005; see also Kepeneklio\u011flu v. , no. 73520/01, \u00a7 31, 23 January 2007). This is a fortiori true in respect of papers brought by the lawyer to a meeting with his client or prepared during the meeting. To have a reasonable cause for interfering with the confidentiality of lawyer-client written communications the authorities must have something more than a sweeping presumption that lawyers always conspire with their clients in disregard of the rules of professional ethics and despite the serious sanctions which such behaviour entails.",

Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7 47, see also Kr\u00f6cher and M\u00f6ller v. Switzerland, no.\u00a08463/78, Commission decision of 10\u00a0July 1981, DR 26, p. 40). The applicants were accused of non-violent economic crimes and had no criminal record (compare with Castravet v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 23393/05, \u00a7 58, 13 March 2007). There were no ascertainable facts showing that the applicants\u2019 lawyers might abuse their professional privilege. The Court stresses that the measures complained of were not limited to the first days or weeks after the applicants\u2019 arrest, when the risk of tampering with evidence, collision or re-offending was arguably higher, but lasted for over two years. In the circumstances the Court concludes that the rule whereby working documents of the defence, drafts, notes etc. were subject to perusal and could have been confiscated if not checked by the prison authorities beforehand was unjustified. Accordingly, the searches of the applicants\u2019 lawyers were also unjustified.",

However, the Court cannot regard this as a valid waiver of the defence\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c). It reiterates that a waiver of a right must be, amongst other things, voluntary, and must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2006XII, with further references; and, more recently, Vozhigov v. Russia, no.\u00a05953/02, \u00a7 57, 26 April 2007; Pishchalnikov v.

The \u201cwaiver\u201d in the present case satisfied neither of these two criteria. At the trial the defence expressed their concerns about the \u201csecurity plan\u201d implemented by the escort service in the courtroom. From the judge\u2019s reaction it was clear that she did not consider herself competent to deal with that issue (see paragraph 151 above), and that the judge deferred to the prison authorities in a matter clearly related to legal assistance. Be that as it may, having consulted with the prosecution and the escort service the judge proposed an alternative solution, namely that all defence documents would be passed through her. The defence seemingly had no other choice but to accept that new rule. Therefore, Mr\u00a0Padva\u2019s remark that he would comply with the new rule cannot be interpreted as an unequivocal and voluntary acceptance of it.",

Nevertheless, in the circumstances the new rule still fell short of the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03 (c). The Court reiterates in this respect that, first, the applicants\u2019 case was not such as to give reason to stringent restrictions on confidential exchanges, and that the authorities did not refer to specific facts which would justify the departure from the general rule of confidentiality of the lawyer-client contacts, including written communications. Second, the Court observes that Judge Kolesnikova, who requested the defence lawyers to show her all written communications, was also a judge of fact and law in the trial. While checking drafts and notes prepared by the defence lawyers or the applicants the judge might have come across information or arguments which the defence would not wish to reveal (see, for example, paragraph 155 above). Consequently, her role in checking the defence papers might have affected her opinion about the factual and legal issues involved in the case (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Erdem, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067) where the Court examined a similar procedure of checking prisoners\u2019 correspondence). In the Court\u2019s opinion, it would be contrary to the principle of adversarial proceedings if the judge\u2019s decision was influenced by arguments and information which the parties did not present and did not discuss at an open trial.",

The Court reiterates that it belongs primarily to the national courts to decide whether, on the facts of the case, a particular item of evidence could be considered as a reliable source of information. Nevertheless, where the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy, reliance on such evidence may undermine the overall fairness of the proceedings (see Jalloh v.

However, as indicated above, as a general rule admission of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and remains within the discretion of the domestic courts. What is more important is whether the rights of the defence have been respected. In particular, it must be examined whether the applicants were given the opportunity to challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use (see Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 95, see also Bykov v.

However, it remains the Court\u2019s task to ascertain whether the way in which evidence was taken was fair.

In the circumstances the applicants\u2019 attempts to obtain opinions of professionals in the fields of accounting, evaluation of assets and market prices were justified.

There was, however, no doubt that the reports emanated from the audit firms in question. Those firms were well known; they had their offices in Moscow and followed established practices and procedures. The District Court heard Mr\u00a0Gage, a partner with Ernst and Young, who testified amongst other things about the preparation of the report by his firm. If the court needed any further information about the names or qualifications of experts involved in the preparation of the reports, it was easy to obtain it.

The Court has therefore to examine the last argument, namely the inadmissibility of the reports from the standpoint of Russian law.",

Croatia, no. 34499/06, \u00a7 17, 27 March 2008). That being said, the Court stresses that the rules on admissibility of evidence may sometimes run counter to the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings, or affect the fairness of the proceedings otherwise (see, for example, Tamminen v. Finland, no.\u00a040847/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 15 June 2004). Although \u201cArticle 6 does not go as far as requiring that the defence be given the same rights as the prosecution in taking evidence\u201d (see Mirilashvili, cited above, \u00a7 225), the accused should be entitled to seek and produce evidence \u201cunder the same conditions\u201d as the prosecution (see, mutatis mutandis, Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0274; see also Peri\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 19). Clearly, those \u201cconditions\u201d cannot be exactly the same in all respects; thus, for example, the defence cannot have the same search and seizure powers as the prosecution.

However,\u00a0to obtain such a fresh examination it was incumbent on the defence to persuade the court that the report produced by the prosecution was incomplete or deficient.

Their report on money laundering in 1999-98 mentioned the use of offshore companies as a common tax-evasion technique.

The Government asserted that the tax-evasion schemes used by the applicants were \u201crelatively new\u201d and were discovered only in the course of the investigation into the applicants\u2019 case. Thus, the sham companies were registered and functioned on the territories enjoying a special taxation regime. However, the ZATO Act clearly established criteria which permitted companies incorporated and registered in those locations to use that special regime. In order to benefit from tax cuts the companies had to have up to 90 per cent of their fixed assets and 70 per cent of their human resources concentrated in those territories. Seventy per cent of the wage-fund was supposed to be paid to locally-hired employees. The companies which were buying oil from Yukos did not correspond to those requirements; consequently, they obtained tax cuts unlawfully and caused damage to the State. The provisions of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation which applied to the applicants\u2019 case were clear and did not change.

It follows that the offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied when the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it or by way of appropriate legal advice, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Liivik v. Estonia, no.\u00a012157/05, \u00a7 93, 25 June 2009; Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2006IV). Foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law concerned, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. A law may still satisfy the requirement of \u201cforeseeability\u201d where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Scoppola v. Italy (no.2) [GC], no. 10249/03, \u00a7 102, 17 September 2009).",

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances\u201d (see Moiseyev, cited above, \u00a7 234). The Court also reiterates that \u201cthe wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. That means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and their interpretation and application depend on practice\u201d (see Scoppola (no. 2) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 100). Furthermore, in most of the member States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.\u00a0Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2001-II; K.-H.W. v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2001-II (extracts); and Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, \u00a7 185, ECHR 2010). Even more so: \u201cit is a firmly established part of the legal tradition of the States party to the Convention that case-law, as one of the sources of the law, necessarily contributes to the gradual development of the criminal law\u201d (see Kruslin v.\u00a0France, 24\u00a0April 1990, \u00a7 29, Series A no.\u00a0176A).",

The Court did not find a violation of Article 7 in this case referring to the fact that the old distinction between \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d involuntary sexual intercourse was clearly obsolete, that the new interpretation continued \u201ca perceptible line of case-law development\u201d and that \u201cthe essentially debasing character of rape\u201d was so manifest that the judicial recognition of such behaviour as criminal was not \u201cat variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 of the Convention\u201d (see \u00a7\u00a7 42-44).",

The Court observes in this respect that the Meshchanskiy District Court convicted the applicants for two distinct counts of tax evasion under Article 199. The first count related to the allegedly unlawful tax cuts obtained by the trading companies. The second related to the payment of taxes with promissory notes (see paragraphs 111 et seq. above). The court of appeal (the Moscow City Court) quashed the District Court\u2019s judgment in so far as it concerned payment of taxes with promissory notes (see paragraph 318 above). It found that after the 2003 amendments to Article 199, such behaviour ceased to be a crime, since the law no longer referred to \u201cother methods\u201d of tax evasion. That second count was therefore removed from the list of accusations against the applicants, as upheld at final instance. In such circumstances the Court concludes that the applicants could not claim to be victims of the alleged violation of Article 7 in this respect, since they had not been \u201cheld guilty\u201d of a crime within the meaning of that Convention provision.",

For many purposes \u201csham\u201d is a synonym of \u201cfalse\u201d, so the logic of the State authorities in the two cases was broadly similar. A person cannot enter into a \u201csham\u201d transaction by inadvertence; it is always a deliberate act. In other words, submitting tax declarations based on sham operations can be construed as \u201cknowingly\u201d submitting \u201cfalse information\u201d to the tax authorities, a situation falling within the ambit of Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code.",

Quite the contrary: the system of oil sales set by Yukos was deliberately opaque. The trading companies were registered in the names of third persons not formally connected to Yukos or its managers, and had been managed by fictional directors. Benefits of the trading companies were returned to Yukos indirectly, through a special fund which received \u201cgifts\u201d from the trading companies. The fact that the Lesnoy town trading companies were wound up in 2001 following audits by the Tax Service, and that immediately afterwards similar entities were registered in other low-tax zones demonstrates that Yukos was not prepared to defend the lawfulness of the tax optimisation technique in courts. Such a coordinated reorganisation implies that it was done in order to render it more difficult for the authorities to scrutinize the business operations of those companies, to trace their assets and their affiliation with other companies and persons. In sum, by organising its sales in this way the applicants evaded application of the provisions of the Tax Code which permitted recalculation of taxes on the basis of \u201cmarket prices\u201d in the relations between affiliated companies.",

The Court will not turn a blind eye to such limitations which go beyond what would normally be accepted in the case of an ordinary detainee. Thus, for example, it is an essential part of a prisoner\u2019s right to respect for family life that the prison authorities assist him in maintaining contact with his close family (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2000-X). Limitations on contacts with other prisoners and with family members, imposed by prison rules, have been regarded by the Court as an \u201cinterference\u201d with the rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention (see Van der Ven v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, no. 50901/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2003-II).",

As the Commission already observed in Wakefield v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (no. 15817/89, decision of 1 October 1990, DR 66, p. 251): \u201cArticle\u00a08 requires the State to assist prisoners as far as possible to create and sustain ties with people outside prison in order to promote prisoners\u2019 social rehabilitation. In this context the location of the place where a prisoner is detained is relevant\u201d. Furthermore, the right to respect for family life imposes upon states a positive obligation to assist prisoners in maintaining effective contact with their close family members (see X.\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 9054/80, Commission decision of 8\u00a0October 1982, DR 30, p. 115). In the context of imprisonment the Commission recognised that the possibility for close family members to visit a detainee constitutes an essential factor in the maintenance of family life (see Hacisuleymanoglou v.\u00a0Italy no.\u00a023241/94, decision of 20\u00a0October 1994, DR no. 79-B, p. 121).",

In the present case the distances involved were much longer than those in Wakefield. Given the geographical situation of the colonies concerned, and the realities of the Russian transport system the Court has no difficulty in accepting that a trip from Moscow to the Krasnokamensk colony or the Kharp colony was a long and exhaustive endeavour, especially for the applicants\u2019 young children. Indeed, it was not the applicants themselves but the members of their respective families who suffered from the remoteness of the colonies. Still, the applicants were affected by this measure, albeit indirectly, because they probably received fewer visits than they would have received had they been located closer to Moscow.

Data referred to by the applicants and not contested by the Government suggested that at the time when the applicants were sent to Siberia and the Far North there were free places in the Russian penitentiary system, including in colonies situated in Central Russia (see paragraphs 328 and 347 above). Over thirty-five regions in Russia are closer to Moscow than the Yamalo-Nenetskiy region, and over fifty-five regions are closer than the Chita region.

There are other arguments speaking in favour of giving the authorities a large margin of appreciation in this sphere. However, that margin of appreciation is not unlimited. The distribution of the prison population must not remain entirely at the discretion of the administrative bodies, such as FSIN. The interests of the convicts in maintaining at least some family and social ties must somehow be taken into account. The Russian law is based on a similar assumption, as the spirit and the goal of Article 73 of the CES was to preserve the applicants\u2019 social and family ties to the place where they used to live before the conviction. However, practical implementation of that law in Russia could lead to a disproportionate result, as the applicants\u2019 case demonstrates. In absence of a clear and foreseeable method of distribution of convicts amongst penal colonies, the system failed to \u201cprovide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities\u201d (see Telegraaf Nederland Landelijke Media B.V. and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 39315/06, \u00a7 90, 22 November 2012).

Thus in the I. and K. case the Russian Supreme Court stated that there was no legal justification for upholding a civil claim filed by the tax authorities for the evasion of taxes that were not paid by a joint-stock company implicated in a criminal case to the private individuals convicted in the relevant case. The principles set out in I. and K. were applied by the Moscow Regional Court on 9 October 2002 in its report \u201cOn the results of an examination of criminal cases in the economic sphere by the Moscow region courts during 2000 and the first half of 2002\u201d:",

In a criminal case an individual may be recognised as a civil respondent only on the basis of the tax, which he failed to pay into the budget as a taxpayer paying income tax. But as a company\u2019s head or chief accountant, an individual cannot incur tax liability for the company, because the latter, being a separate object of taxation, has its own collection of rights and responsibilities as a taxpayer, particularly as the payer of tax on legal entities or companies, including tax on profit (income), VAT, transactions with securities, tax on profit from stock exchange and insurance operations. Therefore, in this example the company/taxpayer itself must be regarded as the civil respondent in respect of the unpaid taxes and duties. In granting the civil claim submitted by the prosecutor, the court actually shifted the obligation to pay tax arrears to the wrong taxpayer. Granting a civil claim for the collection of tax in a criminal case instigated on the indications specified under Article 199 of the Criminal Code (company tax evasion), from the personal funds of a private individual convicted under this article, has no basis in law\u201d.",

The Meshchanskiy District Court ordered the first applicant to pay the Federal Tax Service RUB\u00a017,395,449,282 in relation to the latter\u2019s claim for damages arising from the alleged non-payment of taxes by the ZATO trading companies.\u00a0The total award for damages related to the crime committed under Article 199 of the Criminal Code comprised: (a) damages related to the tax evasion for 1999 in the amount of RUB\u00a05,447,501,388; and (b) damages relating to the alleged tax evasion for 2000 in the amount of RUB\u00a011,947,947,894. On appeal, the Moscow City Court excluded from the total amount of unpaid taxes for 1999 and 2000 the amount of taxes which were paid by the four trading companies in promissory notes. The basis of the Moscow City Court\u2019s decision on this point was that even if one assumed that payment of tax by the Lesnoy companies by using promissory notes had been unlawful in 1999 and 2000, by the time that the first applicant\u2019s case came to trial the wording of Article 199 of the Criminal Code had been amended so as to exclude the possibility of his being convicted under that (or any other) provision of the Criminal Code in respect of such conduct, and the applicant was therefore entitled to invoke the benefit of that change. As a result, the total amount of unpaid taxes was reduced by the Moscow City Court to RUB\u00a01,217,622,799 for 1999 and to RUB\u00a01,566,046,683 for 2000.

The States, when framing and implementing policies in the area of taxation, enjoys a wide margin of appreciation, since decisions in this area will commonly involve the appreciation of political, economic and social questions which the Convention leaves within the competence of the States parties. The second paragraph of Article 1 explicitly reserves the right of Contracting States to enact such laws as they may deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes. In the case of Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands (23 February 1995, \u00a7 59, Series A no.\u00a0306B), the Court stated that \u201cthe importance which the drafters of the Convention attached to this aspect of the second paragraph of Article 1 may be gauged from the fact that at a stage when the proposed text did not contain such explicit reference to taxes, it was already understood to reserve the States\u2019 power to pass whatever fiscal laws they considered desirable, provided always that measures in this field did not amount to arbitrary confiscation (see Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, Rapporteur of the Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, Second Session of the Consultative Assembly, Sixteenth Sitting (25 August 1950), Collected Edition of the Travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, vol. VI, p. 140, commenting on the text of the proposed Article 10A, ibid., p. 68)\u201d. The power of appreciation of the States parties in such matters is therefore a wide one (see Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060; see also Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v.

The Court considers, however, that the Government\u2019s reading of Ferrazzini is misconceived. The question for the Court in the present case is not to define whether the \u201ctax proceedings\u201d are \u201ccivil proceedings\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1, but to define whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is applicable to the court order recovering a certain amount of unpaid taxes from a taxpayer. Even if tax proceedings are not civil (cf. Yukos judgment, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0527 and 528), a pecuniary award made against a taxpayer within such proceedings may still constitute an \u201cinterference\u201d with his possessions. As the Court held in Burden, cited above, \u201ctaxation is in principle an interference with the right guaranteed by the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, since it deprives the person concerned of a possession, namely the amount of money which must be paid\u201d (\u00a7 59).

Article\u00a053 of the CCrP provided that an advocate must be formally admitted to act in the proceedings by the official in charge of the case.

The Court is not persuaded by this argument. Although the Court found several violations of the second applicant\u2019s rights under Articles 3, 6 and 8 in the present case, the loss of his earnings can be attributed to many other factors, primarily to the tax proceedings involving Yukos, which eventually led to its bankruptcy and liquidation. The second applicant\u2019s detention throughout 2004 and 2005 undoubtedly played some part in those proceedings. However, the Court does not need to speculate in this respect. It observes that the link between the violations found in the present case and the loss of the second applicant\u2019s earnings, if any, is too remote and uncertain. The Court concludes that the second applicant\u2019s claims for pecuniary damages are unjustified and must be rejected.",
