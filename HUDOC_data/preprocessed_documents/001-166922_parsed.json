The applicant provided the investigators with a detailed description of those three servicemen\u2019s appearance. At the military unit the applicants had been given medical assistance. The applicant had asked the unit commander to drive her cattle over to pasture land lying closer to the village. The commander had promised to do that but he had not kept his promise and her cattle had gone missing. Then the head of the village administration had arrived and taken the applicants and Mr M.R. home. The applicant provided the investigators with a detailed description of the unit commander. She further stated that after the military unit had left the place where it had been stationed, she had gone to the field and found an envelope with the address of one of the servicemen who had been stationed there and that she still had the envelope and could provide it to the investigators. Subsequently the unit commander, Vadim, had visited her at home with a nurse to assist with the treatment of her wounded arm. Between August 1999 and February 2000 the applicant had not been able to seek official medical assistance, as hospitals in Chechnya had not been functioning. In February 2000, when the local hospital had resumed its activities, she had gone there and sought medical assistance for her wounded arm; she had stayed in the hospital for one month but had been left with a disability.",

The applicants complained about the events in question to the authorities in July 2000 \u2013 that is to say shortly after the law-enforcement bodies in the Chechen Republic had begun functioning again \u2013 and that was not contested by the Government. Furthermore, shortly after the beginning of the investigation in October 2000, the applicants provided detailed statements to the investigators, underwent expert medical examinations and handed over the piece of evidence found by the first applicant (see paragraphs 17 and 21 above). The steps taken by the authorities must have appeared to the applicants as a promising start to the investigation into the attack on them. However, from the documents submitted it can be seen that the investigation was suspended on 12 December 2000 and that the applicants were not informed of that suspension. Further, the documents submitted indicate that \u2013 unaware that the investigation had been suspended \u2013 on several occasions in 2005 (including in July 2005) the first applicant tried to obtain information on the progress of the proceedings; the documents further indicate that that upon her requests for information and access to the investigation file proceedings in respect of the criminal case were resumed in January 2006 (see paragraphs 29-32 above). Therefore, considering that the applicants lodged an offical complaint without undue delay and that they demonstated an active stance in the proceedings, the Court does not find that the lack of progress in the criminal proceedings during their five-year suspension should be held against the applicants or interpreted as a failure on their part to demonstrate due diligence and to comply with the six-month requirement (see, by contrast, Nasirkhayeva v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a01721/07, 31\u00a0May 2011, and Kukavica, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05-6 and 32).",

Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7\u00a0301, ECHR 2011). What form of investigation will achieve the purposes of Article\u00a02 of the Convention may vary depending on the circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once a matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (Al-Skeini and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, \u00a7 165, ECHR 2011).",

However, the criminal investigation into the incident was only initiated almost three months later, on 12 October 2000. Within the following couple of weeks, the investigators obtained from the applicants and from Mr M.R. a detailed description of the alleged culprits and the piece of evidence found by the first applicant and carried out an expert examination of the wounds the applicants had sustained as a result of the attack (see paragraphs 20-26 above). However, in December 2000, without any examination of the crime scene or the evidence obtained and without questioning key witnesses such as Mr Kh.S. (who had negotiated the applicants\u2019 release from the military unit) or any attempt to establish the identity of the lieutenant-colonel named Vadim \u2013 the proceedings were suspended; and the applicants were not informed of that suspension. It appears that \u2013 being unaware proceedings had been suspended \u2013 the applicant lodged requests for information with the investigators and that those efforts to obtain information galvanised the investigators into resuming the suspended proceedings in January 2006; basic steps were taken, such as an examination of the crime scene (see paragraphs 29-31 above). Considering the inactivity on the part of the investigators after the initiation of the official investigation in 2000 and the fact that they took important steps only several years after the events, it is doubtful that the delay of eight months in the lodging of the complaint with the authorities could have hampered the investigation to such an extent as to undermine its overall progress. Moreover, the Court also notes that a number of important steps were taken only after the applicants spurred on the proceedings (see paragraphs 32 and 43 above) and reiterates in this connection that the authorities cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin to conduct an investigative procedure (see Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, \u00a7 165).",
