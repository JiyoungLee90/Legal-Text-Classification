In his written grounds of appeal of 8\u00a0August\u00a02013, the applicant raised, inter alia, a complaint regarding the four counts of people trafficking of which he had been convicted by the Court of Appeal. The applicant contended that the Court of Appeal had convicted him of facilitation of unauthorised \u201cresidence\u201d, as defined in Article 197a \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, whereas the evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal to uphold that conviction did not prove that the Iraqi migrants had had \u201cresidence\u201d in the Netherlands, Germany or Denmark. Instead, the evidence demonstrated that the applicant had organised and financed the Iraqi migrants\u2019 transportation to Denmark via the Netherlands and Germany, which had been intercepted on each occasion in Germany. As the migrants\u2019 stay in the Netherlands and Germany had only been brief and transitory, and given that they had never even entered Denmark, there was, according to the applicant, no proof of \u201cresidence\u201d in those countries. In that regard, the applicant referred to European Union law, namely Council Directive 2002/90/EG of 28 November 2002 defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence (hereinafter \u201cthe Directive\u201d) and Council Framework Decision 2002/946/JBZ of 28 November 2002 on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence (hereinafter \u201cthe Framework Decision\u201d). Submitting that Article 197a of the Criminal Code had been amended in order to implement the Directive, the applicant argued that the notion of the facilitation of unauthorised \u201cresidence\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a0197a \u00a7 2 should be understood as entailing a long-term stay, to be distinguished from \u201ctransit\u201d or \u201centry\u201d as defined in the first paragraph of Article 197a, which had been added to Article 197a when the Directive was implemented. The applicant\u2019s grounds of appeal in cassation did not include a request that the Supreme Court put a question to the CJEU for the purpose of obtaining a preliminary ruling.",

With regard to the applicant\u2019s complaint that the evidence did not show that there had been any \u201cresidence\u201d of the migrants in the countries at issue, the Advocate General was of the opinion that Article 197a \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code called for a broad interpretation of \u201cresidence\u201d, as had been the case prior to the implementation of the Directive and the Framework Decision. Since that implementation was intended to broaden the scope of Article 197a of the Criminal Code, the second paragraph of that provision retained its broad meaning of \u201cresidence\u201d, thereby encompassing \u201ctransit\u201d. The separate penalisation in the first paragraph of Article 197a of the facilitation of unauthorised \u201ctransit and entry\u201d did not change the broad scope of paragraph 2. The Advocate General thus concluded that the applicant\u2019s complaint in this matter should be dismissed.",

The Bill is intended to enable the Supreme Court to concentrate on its core tasks as a court of cassation. The adequate execution of these core tasks is under pressure as a result of cassation appeals being lodged in cases that do not lend themselves to a review in cassation, and because certain issues about which it would be desirable for the Supreme Court itself to pronounce do not reach the Supreme Court in time or at all. The establishment of quality requirements for counsel is aimed at ensuring that cassation appeals are accompanied by statements of grounds of appeal that are of decent quality.",

In the applicant\u2019s view, a mere reference to section 81 of the Judiciary (Organisation) Act, as contended by the Government, could not be accepted as adequate in this regard. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s argument that it followed from Hansen v. Norway (no. 15319/09, 2 October 2014) that the refusal of a request for a preliminary ruling without providing specific reasons is compatible with Article 6 of the Convention when a legal provision allowing summary reasoning by an appellate court has been applied. He noted that Hansen did not concern a request for a preliminary ruling by the CJEU but a filtering procedure on appeal. Furthermore, according to the applicant, unless the Court unequivocally decided otherwise, the \u201cCilfit obligation\u201d was a special obligation to provide reasons, with its own requirements.",

According to the Government, the duty to provide reasons when refusing to refer a question to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling is \u201ca specific element of the general duty of courts to give reasoned decisions\u201d and, referring to Hansen (cited above, \u00a7 80), an appellate court was not required to provide more detailed reasoning when it applied a specific legal provision to dismiss an appeal in cassation as having no prospects of success, without further explanation. Therefore, in the Government\u2019s view, the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment containing a summary reasoning based on section 81 of the Judiciary (Organisation) Act was compliant with Article 6 of the Convention and it should be read as that court\u2019s conclusion that the applicant\u2019s request for the referral of a question to the CJEU did not relate to a point of law that required answering.",

It reiterates that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, the right to have a case referred by a domestic court to another national court or to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. The Court has previously observed that this matter is, however, not unconnected to Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention since a domestic court\u2019s refusal to grant a referral may, in certain circumstances, infringe the fairness of proceedings where the refusal proves to have been arbitrary. Such a refusal may be deemed arbitrary in cases where the applicable rules allow no exception to the granting of a referral or where the refusal is based on reasons other than those provided for by the rules, or where the refusal was not duly reasoned. Indeed, the right to a reasoned decision serves the general rule enshrined in the Convention which protects the individual from arbitrariness by demonstrating to the parties that they have been heard and obliges the courts to base their decision on objective reasons (see Ullens de Schooten and Rezabek v. Belgium, nos. 3989/07 and 38353/07, 20 September 2011, \u00a7\u00a7 54-59). As the Court has often noted, the rule of law and the avoidance of arbitrary power are principles underlying the Convention (see, among many other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a032555/96, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2005-X). In the judicial sphere, those principles serve to foster public confidence in an objective and transparent justice system, one of the foundations of a democratic society (see Taxquet v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], 16 November 2010, no. 926/05, \u00a7 90 and the cases cited therein).",

It is necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments.
