Furthermore, it was established that the accused Nenad Kova\u010devi\u0107 had been found guilty by the above-mentioned final judgment of the Osijek County Court of the offence of murder ... for which he had been sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment. It was also established that the accused Nenad Kova\u010devi\u0107 ... had been arrested [in Bosnia and Herzegovina] because a sentence-execution judge of this court ordered that he should start to serve his prison sentence, and therefore the objection that the general conditions for ordering detention under Article 123 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have not been met is unfounded. The final judgment adopted in the criminal proceedings conducted in the absence of the accused, by which he was found guilty on charges of murder and sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment, represents a reasonable suspicion that the accused Nenad Kova\u010devi\u0107 committed the offence of murder ... The fact that he fled, given that the order for his pre-trial detention and the arrest warrant remained futile and there was no possibility for the police to bring him [before the court] for a hearing, and that he was arrested only on the basis of [an arrest warrant] for the execution of the prison term to which he had been sentenced, suggests the existence of grounds for ordering pre-trial detention under Article 123 \u00a7 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure; that is to say, special grounds justifying a risk that, if at large, the accused might abscond and thus hinder the proper conduct of these criminal proceedings.",

Russia, no. 51857/13, \u00a7 106, 27 November 2014). The Court does not find any arbitrariness in the assessment of the relevant circumstances of the case by the competent domestic courts, nor does it find any of the reasons on which they relied manifestly unreasonable or unfounded. This is particularly true in view of the fact that the applicant\u2019s argument that he was not aware of the pending criminal proceedings against him in Croatia was duly examined and dismissed by the domestic courts.",

In particular, as emphasised by the domestic courts, during the criminal proceedings at issue the applicant was questioned by an investigating judge, and he was detained from 5 February to 21 May 1997 (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). Moreover, on the basis of the material from the case file, the domestic courts also found that the indictment had been duly served on the applicant. The Court cannot therefore accept his assertion that he was not aware of the pending criminal proceedings against him. Moreover, he has not provided either the domestic courts or the Court with any concrete reasons for his sudden flight from the territory of Croatia after being released from detention, without ever informing the competent authorities of his whereabouts for a period of some fourteen years.",

Indeed, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s Serbian nationality is not in dispute and that Serbia does not extradite its nationals (see paragraph 33 above). Moreover, even without the passport offered to the authorities, the applicant could very easily have left Croatia (see paragraph 32 above; and compare Bolech v.
