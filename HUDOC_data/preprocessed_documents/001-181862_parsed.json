He added that he had not been aware of having avoided a criminal investigation through the assistance of certain suspected members of an illegal organisation, and that this was a matter to be taken up with the police officers allegedly responsible. Furthermore, he had visited Fetullah G\u00fclen as a member of a group of journalists, for purely professional reasons linked to his role as a journalist, and had never kissed anyone\u2019s hand. Lastly, the one-dollar bill was of no special significance.",

At the end of the hearing, the magistrate ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, having taken the following factors into consideration: the strong suspicions against him; the nature of the alleged offences and the fact that they were among the offences listed in Article\u00a0100 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d) \u2013\u00a0the so-called \u201ccatalogue offences\u201d, for which a suspect\u2019s pre-trial detention was deemed justified in the event of strong suspicion; the risk of absconding; and the risk that alternative measures to detention might be insufficient to ensure the applicant\u2019s participation in the criminal proceedings. In the reasons for his decision, the magistrate noted the following: during the attempted military coup, members of FET\u00d6/PDY had used heavy weapons; since February 2012 the organisation in question had been explicitly waging a campaign against the political authorities; the members of FET\u00d6/PDY had attempted to force the government\u2019s resignation by discrediting it in public opinion, especially through judicial operations carried out between 17 and 25\u00a0December 2013; and the organisation had taken control of several media outlets with a view to achieving its aim. The magistrate further noted that during the television broadcast on 14 July 2016, the applicant had said: \u201cWithin the State of the Republic of Turkey, there is probably another structure, whose components outside Turkey are closely observing and documenting all these events. It is not clear exactly when [it] will pull its hand out of the bag or how [it] will do so\u201d (\u201cT\u00fcrkiye Devleti i\u00e7inde de muhtemelen b\u00fct\u00fcn bu geli\u015fmeleri d\u0131\u015f d\u00fcnyada daha fazla belgeleyen, izleyen bir ba\u015fka da yap\u0131 var.

After examining the substance of these items of evidence, the Constitutional Court held that the investigating authorities had been unable to demonstrate any factual basis that might indicate that the applicant had been acting in accordance with the aims of FET\u00d6/PDY or with the purpose of preparing the ground for a possible military coup. The Constitutional Court observed that, as well as having published the above-mentioned articles and made the statements in question, the applicant was accused of holding an account with Bank Asya, having avoided a criminal investigation through the connivance of members of the national police suspected of belonging to FET\u00d6/PDY, and having in his possession a United States one-dollar bill with an \u201cF\u201d serial number. Addressing those allegations, the Constitutional Court held, having regard to the applicant\u2019s testimony and line of defence, that no specific facts had been established that could refute his explanations, which were \u201cconsistent with the normal course of life\u201d. Similarly, regarding the contents of the messages exchanged by other individuals via ByLock, the Constitutional Court held that the messages could not in themselves be regarded as significant indications that the applicant had committed an offence. Accordingly, it concluded that \u201cstrong evidence that an offence had been committed\u201d had not been sufficiently established in the applicant\u2019s case. Next, the Constitutional Court examined whether there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security in the light of Article 15 of the Constitution (providing for the suspension of the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms in the event of war, general mobilisation, a state of siege or a state of emergency). On this point, it noted firstly that in a state of emergency, the Constitution provided for the possibility of taking measures derogating from the guarantees set forth in Article 19, to the extent required by the situation. It observed, however, that if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre-trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed an offence, the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless. Accordingly, it held that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was disproportionate to the strict exigencies of the situation and that his right to liberty and security, as safeguarded by Article 19 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, had been breached.",

Taking into account his arguments regarding the lawfulness of his pre-trial detention, the Constitutional Court held that such a measure, which had serious consequences since it resulted in deprivation of liberty, could not be regarded as a necessary and proportionate interference in a democratic society. It further noted that it could not be clearly established from the reasons given for ordering and extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention whether the measure met a pressing social need or why it was necessary. Lastly, it found that it was clear that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and of the press, in so far as it had not been based on any concrete evidence other than his articles and statements (see paragraph 235 of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment). Regarding the application of Article 15 of the Constitution, it referred to its findings concerning the lawfulness of his pre-trial detention (as set out in paragraphs 155-57 of its judgment \u2013 see paragraph 36 above) and held that there had also been a violation of freedom of expression and freedom of the press as enshrined in Articles 26 and 28 of the Constitution.",

The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant and his lawyer had been present at the hearing on 22\u00a0September 2016, following which the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention.

Noting firstly that the examination of the merits of an individual application to the Constitutional Court against a judicial decision entailed determining whether there had been a violation of fundamental rights and what measures would be appropriate to put an end to the violation, and secondly that grounds of appeal on points of law could not be examined by the Constitutional Court in the context of an individual application, it found that the Constitutional Court did not have jurisdiction to assess the evidence in the case file. On that account, the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment no.\u00a02016/23672 was not in compliance with the law. The Assize Court added that ordering the applicant\u2019s release as an automatic consequence of the judgment in question would run counter to the general principles of law, the independence of the courts, the principle that no authority could give orders or instructions to the courts, and the \u201cnatural judge\u201d principle. Lastly, by two votes to one, it ordered the continuation of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention. In so holding, it took the following into account: the evidence before it; the large scale of the attempted military coup; the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding; the current state of the case file; and the severity of the potential sentence in the event of a conviction.",

It carried out a detailed examination, from a constitutional perspective, of the facts leading to the declaration of the state of emergency. As a result of this examination, it found that the attempted military coup had been a clear and serious attack both on the constitutional principles that sovereignty was unconditionally and unreservedly vested in the people, who exercised it through authorised organs, and that no individual or body could exercise any State authority not emanating from the Constitution, and also on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. According to the Constitutional Court, the attempted military coup had been a practical illustration of the severity of the threats posed to the democratic constitutional order and human rights. After summarising the attacks carried out during the night of 15 to 16 July 2016, it emphasised that in order to assess the severity of the threat posed by a military coup, it was also necessary to consider the risks that might have arisen had the coup attempt not been thwarted. It found that the fact that the attempted coup had taken place at a time when Turkey had been under violent attack from numerous terrorist organisations had made the country even more vulnerable and considerably increased the severity of the threat to the life and existence of the nation. The Constitutional Court noted that in some cases, it might not be possible for a State to eliminate threats to its democratic constitutional order, fundamental rights and national security through ordinary administrative procedures. It might therefore be necessary to impose extraordinary administrative procedures, such as a state of emergency, until such threats were eliminated. Bearing in mind the threats resulting from the attempted military coup of 15 July 2016, the Constitutional Court accepted the power of the Council of Ministers, chaired by the President, to issue legislative decrees on matters necessitating the state of emergency. In that context, it also emphasised that the state of emergency was a temporary legal regime, in which any interference with fundamental rights had to be foreseeable and the aim was to restore the normal regime in order to safeguard fundamental rights.",

Turkey, no. 39322/12, \u00a7\u00a063, 23 May 2017). The Court notes that one of the reasons why the Constitutional Court declared this complaint inadmissible was that there was no information in the case file as to whether the applicant had lodged an objection under Article 91 \u00a7 5 of the CCP against his detention in police custody (see paragraph 39 above). However, the Court observes that on 10\u00a0September 2016 the applicant did lodge an objection seeking his release from police custody, which was dismissed by the Istanbul magistrate\u2019s court on 12\u00a0September 2016 (see paragraph 21 above). He therefore availed himself of the remedy provided for in Article 91 \u00a7 5 of the CCP. Next, as regards the possibility of bringing a compensation claim under Article 141 \u00a7\u00a01 (a) of the CCP, the Court notes that Emergency Legislative Decree no.\u00a0667, adopted following the declaration of a state of emergency, allowed individuals to be held in police custody for up to thirty days, not including the time needed to convey them to a court. In those circumstances, having regard to the wording of the relevant provisions, the Court has doubts as to the effectiveness of the remedy provided for in Article 141 \u00a7 1 (a), given that the applicant\u2019s period in police custody does not appear to have exceeded the statutory maximum duration prescribed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (a) of Emergency Legislative Decree no. 667 as in force at the material time.",

In the majority of cases where journalists had been placed in pre-trial detention, they had been charged with terrorism-related offences without any evidence corroborating their involvement in terrorist activities.

With regard to the application of Article 15 of the Constitution (providing for the suspension of the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms in the event of war, general mobilisation, a state of siege or a state of emergency), it concluded that the right to liberty and security would be meaningless if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre-trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed a criminal offence.

In reaching that finding, it noted in particular that the Constitutional Court had jurisdiction to find violations of Convention provisions and was vested with appropriate powers to secure redress for violations, by granting compensation and/or indicating the means of redress; on that account the Constitutional Court could and should be able, if necessary, to prohibit the authority concerned from continuing to breach the right in question and to order it to restore, as far as possible, the status quo ante (see Ko\u00e7intar, cited above, \u00a7 41). The Court observed that where the Constitutional Court found a violation of the right to liberty as guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution and the applicant remained in detention, it decided to transmit its judgment containing that finding to the appropriate court so that it could take \u201cthe necessary action\u201d. Taking into account the binding nature of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions in accordance with Article\u00a0153 \u00a7 6 of the Constitution (by which such decisions are binding on all State authorities and on all natural and legal persons), the Court found that the question of compliance in practice with that court\u2019s decisions on individual applications should not in principle arise in Turkey and that there was no cause to doubt that the judgments in which the Constitutional Court found a violation would be effectively implemented (ibid., \u00a7\u00a043).",

Firstly, it found that the Constitutional Court did not have jurisdiction to assess the evidence in the case file and that that court\u2019s judgment was therefore not in compliance with the law. Secondly, it found that ordering the applicant\u2019s immediate release on the basis of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment would run counter to the general principles of law, the independence of the judiciary, the principle that no authority could give instructions to the courts, and the right to a court. The 26th Assize Court, having regard to the evidence before it, the large scale of the attempted military coup, the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding, the current state of the case file and the severity of the potential sentence in the event of a conviction, ordered the continuation of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.",

It thus observes that the reasons given in the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment and in the decision delivered by the 26th Assize Court suggest that the criteria applied by the two courts coexist, particularly as regards the discretion to assess the evidence in the case file. In this context, the Court cannot accept the 26th Assize Court\u2019s argument that the Constitutional Court should not have assessed the evidence in the case file. To hold otherwise would amount to maintaining that the Constitutional Court could have examined the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the lawfulness of his initial and continued pre-trial detention without considering the substance of the evidence produced against him.",

This argument reinforced the Government\u2019s view that an individual application to the Constitutional Court was an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention. Such a position is, moreover, consistent with the Court\u2019s findings in the case of Ko\u00e7intar (cited above). To put it briefly, the Court considers that this argument by the Government can only be interpreted as meaning that under Turkish law, if the Constitutional Court has ruled that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention is in breach of the Constitution, the response by the courts with jurisdiction to rule on the issue of pre-trial detention must necessarily entail releasing him, unless new grounds and evidence justifying his continued detention are put forward. However, in the event, the 26th Assize Court rejected the application for the applicant\u2019s release following the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 11\u00a0January 2018 by interpreting and applying domestic law in a manner departing from the approach indicated by the Government before the Court.",

Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 73, 9 July 2009). The Court must, moreover, ascertain whether the domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein. On this last point, the Court emphasises that where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty should be satisfied (ibid., \u00a7 76). In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be \u201clawful\u201d and be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. Lastly and above all, no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01, the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in this context extending beyond the lack of conformity with national law. In the context of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1, the reasoning of the decision ordering a person\u2019s detention is a relevant factor in determining whether the detention should be regarded as arbitrary (ibid., \u00a7 77 and 79).",

Furthermore, with regard to complaints under Article 5 of the Convention, in Ko\u00e7intar (cited above) the Court considered the nature and effects of decisions delivered by the Constitutional Court in accordance with the Turkish Constitution. Article\u00a0153 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution provides that the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgments are \u201cfinal\u201d. Moreover, as the Court noted in Ko\u00e7intar, Article\u00a0153 \u00a7 6 provides that decisions of the Constitutional Court are binding on the legislative, executive and judicial organs (see, to similar effect, Uzun, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066). In the Court\u2019s view, therefore, it is clear that the Constitutional Court forms an integral part of the judiciary within the constitutional structure of Turkey and that \u2013 as the Court has previously noted in Ko\u00e7intar, and as the Government explicitly submitted before the Court in the present case \u2013 it plays an important role in protecting the right to liberty and security under Article 19 of the Constitution and Article 5 of the Convention by offering an effective remedy to individuals detained during criminal proceedings (see also Mercan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 17-30).",

For another court to call into question the powers conferred on a constitutional court to give final and binding judgments on individual applications runs counter to the fundamental principles of the rule of law and legal certainty. The Court reiterates that these principles, inherent in the protection afforded by Article 5 of the Convention, are the cornerstones of the guarantees against arbitrariness (see paragraph\u00a0137 above). Although the Constitutional Court transmitted its judgment to the Assize Court so that it could take \u201cthe necessary action\u201d, the Assize Court resisted the Constitutional Court by refusing to release the applicant, with the result that the violation found by the Constitutional Court was not redressed. The Court has already stated (see paragraph 129 above) that it endorses the findings reached by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 11\u00a0January 2018 regarding the period of pre-trial detention up to the date of that judgment. It observes that the case file discloses no new grounds or evidence showing that the basis for the detention has changed following the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment. In that connection, it notes in particular that the Government have not demonstrated that the evidence purportedly available to the 26th Istanbul Assize Court justifying the strong suspicion against the applicant was in fact any different from the evidence examined by the Constitutional Court. That being so, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s continued pre-trial detention, after the Constitutional Court had given its clear and unambiguous judgment finding a violation of Article\u00a019 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Constitution, cannot be regarded as \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d as required by the right to liberty and security.",

Accordingly, it found that the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty was disproportionate to the strict exigencies of the situation. This conclusion is also valid for the Court\u2019s examination. Having regard to Article 15 of the Convention and the derogation by Turkey, the Court considers, as the Constitutional Court did in its judgment, that a measure of pre-trial detention that is not \u201clawful\u201d and has not been effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d on account of the lack of reasonable suspicion cannot be said to have been strictly required by the exigencies of the situation (see, mutatis mutandis, A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 182-90).

However, as matters stand, the Court will not depart from its previous finding that the right to lodge an individual application with the Constitutional Court constitutes an effective remedy in respect of complaints by persons deprived of their liberty under Article 19 of the Constitution (see Ko\u00e7intar, cited above, \u00a7 44). Nevertheless, it reserves the right to examine the effectiveness of the system of individual applications to the Constitutional Court in relation to applications under Article 5 of the Convention, especially in view of any subsequent developments in the case-law of the first-instance courts, in particular the assize courts, regarding the authority of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgments.

France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, and Mooren, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). Where the original detention order or subsequent decisions on continued detention were given by a court (that is to say, by an independent and impartial judicial body) in a procedure offering appropriate guarantees of due process, and where the domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the Court is prepared to tolerate longer periods of review in proceedings before a second-instance court (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 96, 25 October 2007, and Shcherbina, cited above, \u00a7 65). These considerations apply a fortiori to complaints under Article 5 \u00a7 4 concerning proceedings before constitutional courts which were separate from proceedings before ordinary courts (see \u017d\u00fabor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a089). In this context, the Court notes that the proceedings before constitutional courts such as the Turkish Constitutional Court are of a specific nature. Admittedly, the Constitutional Court does review the lawfulness of an applicant\u2019s initial and continued pre-trial detention. However, in doing so it does not act as a \u201cfourth-instance\u201d body but determines solely whether the decisions ordering the initial and continued detention complied with the Constitution.",

It notes that in the present case the applicant made several such applications for release, which were examined in conformity with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement (see paragraphs 27-29 above). The Court observes in addition that the question of a suspect\u2019s detention is automatically reviewed at regular intervals of no more than thirty days (see paragraph 73 above). In a system of that kind, the Court can tolerate longer periods of review by the Constitutional Court. Where an initial or further detention order was imposed by a court in a procedure offering appropriate guarantees of due process, the subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees based primarily on an evaluation of the appropriateness of continued detention. Nevertheless, the Court considers that even in the light of those principles, in normal circumstances a period of fourteen months and three days cannot be regarded as \u201cspeedy\u201d (see G.B. v. Switzerland, no.\u00a027426/95, \u00a7\u00a7 28-39, 30 November 2000; Khudobin v.

However, in the present case the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s application to the Constitutional Court was a complex one, being one of the first of a series of cases raising new and complicated issues concerning the right to liberty and security and freedom of expression under the state of emergency following the attempted military coup. Moreover, bearing in mind the Constitutional Court\u2019s caseload following the declaration of a state of emergency, the Court notes that this is an exceptional situation.",

The coup attempt and other terrorist acts have clearly posed a major threat to democracy in Turkey. In this connection, the Court attaches considerable weight to the conclusions of the Constitutional Court, which noted, among other things, that the fact that the attempt had taken place at a time when Turkey had been under violent attack from numerous terrorist organisations had made the country even more vulnerable (see paragraph 80 above). However, the Court considers that one of the principal characteristics of democracy is the possibility it offers of resolving problems through public debate. It has emphasised on many occasions that democracy thrives on freedom of expression (see, among other authorities, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, \u00a7 57, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I; Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2012; and Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) and Others v. Turkey, nos. 3840/10 and 6 others, \u00a7 74, 12 January 2016). In this context, the existence of a \u201cpublic emergency threatening the life of the nation\u201d must not serve as a pretext for limiting freedom of political debate, which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society. In the Court\u2019s view, even in a state of emergency \u2013 which is, as the Constitutional Court noted, a legal regime whose aim is to restore the normal regime by guaranteeing fundamental rights (see paragraph 80 above) \u2013 the Contracting States must bear in mind that any measures taken should seek to protect the democratic order from the threats to it, and every effort must be made to safeguard the values of a democratic society, such as pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness.",

Moreover, even where such serious charges have been brought, pre-trial detention should only be used as an exceptional measure of last resort when all other measures have proved incapable of fully guaranteeing the proper conduct of proceedings. Should this not be the case, the national courts\u2019 interpretation cannot be regarded as acceptable.",

Importantly, it is not the Strasbourg Court that is entrusted with the day-to-day responsibility of securing Convention rights; it is the member States. In other words, in accordance with Article 1 of the Convention, it is the national authorities which are the primary guarantors of human rights, subject to the supervision of the Court. When the member States fulfil their Convention role by applying in good faith the general principles deriving from the Court\u2019s case-law, the principle of subsidiarity implies that the Court may defer to their findings in a particular case. Its aim is thus to incentivise national authorities to fulfil their obligations to secure Convention rights, thus raising the overall level of human rights protection in the European legal space.",

Article 35 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides: \u201cThe Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted ...\u201d It follows that in the Convention system, the domestic courts are the ordinary courts in relation to Convention law. They are entrusted with primary responsibility for enforcing the rights safeguarded by the Convention. This equates to the principle of subsidiarity, which underpins the Convention system (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sudre, Droit europ\u00e9en et international des droits de l\u2019homme, 9th edition, PUF, Paris 2008, p. 204). The Court has repeatedly stated that \u201cthe machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights\u201d (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7\u00a0December 1976, Series A no. 24; Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v. Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 25\u00a0March 2014; and Brusco v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no.\u00a069789/01, ECHR 2001IX). The Convention leaves it first and foremost to the national authorities \u2013 and more specifically, the courts with jurisdiction in matters relating to the Convention \u2013 to secure the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms it enshrines. The Convention is therefore of a secondary nature in relation to national legislation, and its fundamental rules are in no way intended to replace the rules of domestic law. This rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention \u2013 with which it has close affinity \u2013 that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, and Brusco, cited above).",

Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s compliance with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies is normally assessed with reference to the date on which the application was lodged with the Court (see Baumann v. France, no. 33592/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001V (extracts)). Nevertheless, in certain exceptional cases \u201cthe Court accepts that the last stage of such remedies may be reached shortly after the lodging of the application but before it determines the issue of admissibility\u201d (see Karoussiotis v. Portugal, no.\u00a023205/08, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). Moreover, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 74).

Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406), a great thinker, legal scholar, historical philosopher and sociologist and the founder of the science of civilisation (umran), explains in his masterpiece Muqaddimah that \u201cone cannot imagine a [State] without civilisation, while a civilisation without [a State or] authority is impossible\u201d (Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddimah: an Introduction to History, IV, 19, translated by Franz Rosenthal, Princeton University Classics, 1967) and that human rights violations (or injustices) ruin civilisation, and the ruin of civilisation leads to the complete destruction of the State (ibid., III, 41). Despite the difference in eras, some striking similarities can be noted between the two perspectives. These words and principles assume full significance during a state of emergency following an attempted military coup. In order to assess the severity of the threat posed by an attempted military coup, consideration should also be given to the risks that might have arisen had the coup attempt not been foiled. Practice has shown that the most serious violations of fundamental rights tend to occur during such periods. Moreover, the alarming conditions in a number of States dominated by regimes installed as a result of a military coup and the tragic situation in such societies, at the present time and throughout the world, corroborate the aforementioned great thinker\u2019s observations and the Council of Europe\u2019s founding principles. By preventing this serious public emergency threatening the life of the nation, the Turkish people have demonstrated how a people can preserve democracy, the rule of law and civilisation and take control of its own destiny.",

Furthermore, judgments delivered after 15 July 2016 have established a link between this terrorist organisation and the attempted coup. The conclusions reached on this point by the Criminal Division of the Plenary Court of Cassation are fairly instructive: \u201cFrom the first years of the organisation\u2019s existence ... it appears from statements by individuals who were formerly active in the organisation that their goal was to take control of all constitutional institutions (legislature, executive, judiciary) of the Republic of Turkey, and at the same time to become a major political/economic power with an international impact by taking advantage of pupils who were trained in accordance with their principles and aims in educational establishments set up abroad and in Turkey through funds collected by way of \u2018favour\u2019 (himmet), and by making use of the economic and political power thus acquired to promote the organisation\u2019s interests and their ideology.\u201d The Criminal Division went on to observe: \u201cIt is understood that FET\u00d6/PDY uses public powers that should be under State control to further its own organisational interests. After going through various stages, members of the organisation embarking on a career \u2013 while remaining FET\u00d6/PDY soldiers and maintaining very strong links to that organisation \u2013 within the Turkish armed forces, the police and the National Intelligence Organisation are required to undergo ideological training so that they are ready to exploit their own authorisation to use weapons and force in following the orders of this illegal organisational hierarchy. A person in this position is [described] as a servant by the head of the organisation: \u2018persons linked to the service must be determined, persistent, obedient, responsible for everything, must not falter when attacked, must prioritise their rank within the service over their own rank when they have attained a high rank, must be aware that the duties to be accomplished can be difficult in the service, and must be ready to sacrifice their entire existence, life and love for the service [that is, the terrorist organisation] ...\u201d According to the judicial authorities\u2019 findings, the following three principles have been established as FET\u00d6\u2019s working principles: confidentiality, intra-organisational solidarity and strict hierarchical relations. FET\u00d6\u2019s complex organisation is based on the principle of confidentiality, which it has faithfully observed since its creation, from the lowest cell to the highest branches.",

The Court has found that the attempted military coup created a \u201cpublic emergency threatening the life of the nation\u201d within the meaning of the Convention. However, it reached a different conclusion concerning the proportionality of the measures, without giving detailed reasons. In the assessment of proportionality, two dimensions must be taken into account. Firstly, it must be borne in mind that the applicant\u2019s complaints relate only to rights from which a derogation is permitted. That being so, the State should have had a greater margin of appreciation and the Court should have had regard to the risks and the difficulties with which the State was confronted.",

As was emphasised in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by consensus at the World Conference on Human Rights by the representatives of 171 States on 25 June 1993, a legal hierarchy between human rights should not in principle be accepted: \u201cAll human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.\u201d However, Article 15 of the Convention does provide for a kind of hierarchy between right by classifying rights as derogable and non-derogable. Despite the clarity of the text of Article 15, a conclusion that creates a legal hierarchy between rights from which a derogation is permitted will run counter to the concern for practicality expressed by the drafters of the Convention. The derogation mechanism seeks to promote the balance which States must ensure between respect for human rights and preservation of the life of their nation.",

In that regard, several factors are known to the Court, such as the severity of the threat to the life of the nation, the fact that the complaint concerns a judicial measure against which an objection may be lodged, the extreme complexity of the case concerning the media wing of the terrorist organisation behind the severe threat, the significant role of the FET\u00d6/PDY media wing in concealing the organisation\u2019s illegal activities and in legitimising the actions that gave rise to the despicable attempted military coup, the declaration of a state of emergency on account of the coup attempt and its extension since 21 July 2016, on each occasion with the approval of the Turkish Grand National Assembly. On account of those factors, and as the case is strictly linked to the incidents that gave rise to the state of emergency and the derogation, it has to be concluded that the measures taken were strictly required by the exigencies of the situation. For that reason, the derogation relating to an exceptionally severe threat should have prevailed in the assessment of the merits of the case.",
