It likewise dismissed the claim against the two individuals, whose actions had had no connection with the accident. It went on to say that the applicants\u2019 claims for damages were rather excessive and were not supported by evidence.

Relying on the Court\u2019s judgment in Stankov v. Bulgaria (no. 68490/01, 12 July 2007), the applicants argued that in reply to that judgment, the 1988 Act had been changed and no longer required the payment of court fees by claimants in case their claims against the State had been allowed in whole or in part by the courts (see paragraph\u00a034 below). In the alternative, they submitted that even though their claim had been re-characterised under general tort law, in line with the applicable rules of procedure, before having examined the case on the merits, the Plovdiv Court of Appeal should have first instructed them to pay the court fees. Instead, that court had ordered the payment of the court fees, whose amount had significantly exceeded the awarded compensation, only at the close of the proceedings.",

Only in certain cases, a party to the proceedings could be exempted from the payment of the court fees.

As a result, where a court held that a claim for damages against the State was wellfounded but excessive as to quantum, it ordered the defendant State authority to pay damages to the claimant and at the same time ordered the claimant to pay court fees to the State budget.

However, the municipality appealed against this judgment and this appeal was accepted for examination concerning the substantive question of vicarious liability in the applicants\u2019 case. While the Supreme Court of Cassation ultimately upheld the Plovdiv Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling in the appealed part, the compensation the applicants would receive and the amount they would have to pay in court fees was therefore not decided with a final decision until the final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 10 March 2010 (see paragraph 15 above). Thus, the applicants were in an uncertain position until that moment as to whether their compensation claim would be allowed by the courts, and if allowed, what court fees they would have to pay as well as what the final ratio between the court fees and the damage award would be, which is the central element of their complaint before this Court (contrast Aydarov and others v.\u00a0Bulgaria (dec.), no. 33586/15, \u00a7 66, 2 October 2018). The present case is therefore similar to those where the Court had rejected the Government\u2019s objection of non-exhaustion because the national courts had examined the substance of an applicant\u2019s complaint (see paragraph 48 above).",

However, the amount of the fees assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of a given case, including the applicant\u2019s ability to pay them, and the phase of the proceedings at which that restriction has been imposed are factors which are material in determining whether or not a person enjoyed his right of access to a court (see Kreuz v.

It is true that, as in Stankov (cited above), they were required to pay the fees only at the close of the proceedings. Whilst this was not in line with the applicable rules of procedure (see paragraph 31 above), it allowed them to enjoy access to all stages of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the Court has already found that the imposition of a considerable financial burden, even after the conclusion of the proceedings, could also operate as a restriction on the right to a court (see Stankov, cited above, \u00a7 54). In the present case, the amount of the court fees that the applicants were ordered to pay, compared with the amount of the awarded compensation, even including interest, could be seen as such a restriction.",

However, in a number of cases in which the applicants brought proceedings against State entities and were ordered to pay court fees despite their claims being allowed by the domestic courts, the Court has concluded that the court fees ordered were excessive. The Court has further held that rules regarding legal costs must avoid placing an excessive burden on litigants where their action against the State is justified, as it is paradoxical that, by imposing various taxes, the State takes away with one hand what it has awarded with the other (see Stankov, cited above, \u00a7 59, and Scordino v.\u00a0Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 201, ECHR 2006V). Thus, in Stankov the fee payable by the applicant amounted to approximately 90% of the compensation the State was ordered to pay him (see Stankov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051), and in Mihalkov v. Bulgaria (no. 67719/01, \u00a7\u00a7 6065, 10 April 2008), the fee was higher than the award itself. In another followup case in which the Court likewise found a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1, the fee amounted to 72% of the award (see Tzvyatkov v. Bulgaria, no. 20594/02, \u00a7\u00a7 2527, 12\u00a0June 2008). By contrast, in Zaharieva the Court dismissed a similar complaint where the court fee only amounted to about 8.3% of the awarded compensation (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96).",

As the award included also statutory interest, the court fees, including interest (BGN 146,743.22, EUR 75,029; see paragraphs\u00a02223 above) amounted to around 55% of the compensation received by the applicants, including interest (BGN 267,868.86, EUR\u00a0136,960; see paragraph 21 above).

Instead, that court only briefly noted in its judgment that no fees had been collected at the beginning of the proceedings and ordered the applicants to pay them for both the first\u00a0and second-instance proceedings, amounting to BGN 126,000 (EUR\u00a064,423). In this respect the Supreme Court of Cassation found that the Plovdiv Court of Appeal had committed a gross violation of the rules of procedure (see paragraph 17 above).

Bulgaria (dec.), no. 47436/07, 1 July 2014). It also takes into account the amount of the court fees that the applicants had been ordered to pay and the sums which they retained after payment of all the fees along with the interest (see paragraphs 12 and 24 above). It finally refers to its finding that the value of the applicants\u2019 claims was rather excessive (see paragraph 62 above). In view of the above considerations and ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards a total of EUR 12,500 in respect of both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, to be paid to the second applicant.",

Bulgaria, no. 63638/14, \u00a7 100, 19 January 2017 and the cases cited therein). It is therefore not reasonable as to quantum. Having regard to these points and the material in its possession, the Court awards the second applicant EUR 2,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable to her, in respect of legal costs. Since the fee agreement and the time-sheet submitted specified that the second applicant had paid her legal representatives the equivalent of EUR 1,226, that sum is to be paid to the second applicant, and the remainder of the award (totalling EUR 774) to her legal representatives\u2019 firm, Ekimdzhiev and Partners. As regards the claim for other expenses, the second applicant did not submit any supporting documents other than a contract for translation services and postal receipts for documents sent to the Court. In such circumstances, the Court awards EUR\u00a0184 in respect of those expenses. This sum is likewise to be paid to her legal representatives.",
