The Government submitted that the proceedings related to the applicant\u2019s request for a first licence for chimney sweeping to which the applicant, in the absence of any need for further chimney sweeping business in the area concerned, had no right. Furthermore, chimney sweepers may be required by regional legislation to carry out tasks falling in principle to public authorities and act as organs assisting the municipality. The Government referred in particular to the carrying out of flue gas measurements (Abgasmessungen) as preventive measures, the preparation of expert opinions, the sweeping, cleaning and controlling of chimneys, fireplaces and furnaces, flue gas appliances and joining pieces, the testing of the functioning and fire safety of technical installations, regular checks under the Clean Air Act (Luftreinhaltegesetz) and the report of any defects to the fire authorities. The Government alleged that on average 75 % of the activities carried out by chimney sweepers constituted sovereign tasks of the State. Referring to the findings of the Pellegrin\u00a0v.\u00a0France judgment ([GC], no. 28541/95, \u00a7 66, ECHR 1999VIII) the Government therefore disputed that the applicant could rely on a \u201ccivil right\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.",
