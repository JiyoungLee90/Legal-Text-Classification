It sought to have decisions nos. 9 and 10 of 21 and 22 July 1999 (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above) set aside. It also sought, making reference to Article 498 of the Code (see paragraph 51 in fine below), to have the corresponding entries in the register of companies annulled. It argued that the decisions were null and void because (i) in 1995 there had been no resolution of MTFU\u2019s shareholders to elect a new board of directors and (ii)\u00a0such a body had only been envisaged for the first time in MTFU\u2019s new articles of association, adopted in 1996 (see paragraph 15 above). There had therefore been no grounds to correct errors in decision no. 6 of 28 July 1995. Furthermore, the Sofia City Court had accepted that MTFU\u2019s new board of directors had validly elected a managing director on 20 July 1999, a day before that board had been entered in the register of companies and had thus acquired capacity to act. Lastly, the Sofia City Court had disregarded the requirements of Article 192 \u00a7 2 of the Code (see paragraph\u00a053 below) because it had acted on its own initiative and had not held a hearing.",

It also held that it was impossible to suspend the enforcement of decisions nos. 9 and 10, because they had already led to changes in the register of companies. It went on to say that by barring MTFU\u2019s new board of directors and executive director from taking managerial decisions and disposing of company assets, the injunction had in effect rendered nugatory decisions nos. 9 and 10 and the changes which they had brought about in MTFU\u2019s registration details, which was inacceptable in interim proceedings. Lastly, the court held that it was not appropriate to prevent a general meeting of shareholders from taking place in connection with a claim for the annulment of preexisting entries in the register of companies.

On the basis of these conclusions, on 22 May 2000 the Minister of Justice proposed to the Supreme Judicial Council (\u0412\u0438\u0441\u0448 \u0441\u044a\u0434\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442) that disciplinary proceedings against the judge be opened. This was done, and in a decision of 6 October 2000 the Council\u2019s disciplinary panel gave Judge R.P. a disciplinary warning. It found that in issuing decision no. 9 she had impermissibly acted on her own initiative and not pursuant to a request by the company, had committed a number of procedural violations, and had distorted the evidence in the case file and made perverse findings of fact. Her actions, which had been deliberate and not due to a mere lack of professional experience, had amounted to a breach of her professional obligations. In the panel\u2019s view, Judge R.P. had \u201cin fact created\u201d a new board of directors of MTFU.

However, when two other applicants, Motorengineering OOD and Vitex AD, also brought a legal challenge against that decision in April 2000, the courts stayed the proceedings to await the outcome of the earlier action brought by Shesti Mai Engineering OOD. After decision no. 9 and the corresponding entries in the register of companies had been annulled as a result of those earlier proceedings, the proceedings brought by Motorengineering OOD and Vitex AD were resumed. However, the courts dismissed their claim, finding that they no longer had an interest in pursuing the matter (see paragraphs 35-37 above). In those circumstances, the Court fails to see how the remaining applicants could have also challenged decision no. 9, as they risked obtaining a similar result (see, mutatis mutandis, Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 58, ECHR 2010-...).

The applicants\u2019 legal challenges to that decision had been examined within a reasonable time. It had been entirely normal that the claims, which concerned a dispute between shareholders, had been examined under the usual procedure applicable to civil proceedings through the three levels of the court system, which had taken approximately four years in the cases of both Shesti Mai Engineering OOD and Mr Evtimov. That could hardly be regarded as unreasonable. However, if the applicants had considered that the examination of their cases had been unduly delayed, they could have made complaints about delays under Article 217a of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952. The Government further submitted that the courts had not acted in breach of the interim injunction obtained by Shesti Mai Engineering OOD, because it had been set aside shortly after being granted. As to the executive authorities, to whom the applicants had addressed numerous complaints, they had not been in a position to interfere with judicial decisions, as the judiciary was independent. In any event, the developments complained of had not had a negative effect on MTFU \u2013 it was still a going concern and, in 2010, had had a share capital of BGN\u00a01,251,500.

After that, the courts and the authorities had not only made possible, but had also tolerated and sanctioned \u2013 at one point in breach of the interim injunction issued by the Sofia District Court \u2013 the unlawful actions of the new management of the company, which had, amongst other things, resolved to cancel all existing shares and MTFU\u2019s company register and had thus extinguished the applicants\u2019 shareholdings in the company. Despite the numerous complaints lodged by the applicants, neither the prosecuting nor any other authorities had intervened to prevent that from happening. As for the courts, instead of reacting swiftly to the legal challenges brought by the applicants, they had taken an unreasonably long time to examine them, disregarding the very high stakes involved. Those developments had had a negative effect on MTFU, which had been a successful, growing company before July 1999. As a result of the actions of the new management, it had, in fact, stopped functioning. As of 2010 it had retained only two employees and had declared losses.

The boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 do not lend themselves to precise definition. However, whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the part of the State or in terms of interference by a public authority which needs to be justified, the criteria to be applied do not differ in substance. The first and most important of these is the requirement of lawfulness (see Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 147; HuttenCzapska v. Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, \u00a7 163, ECHR\u00a02006VIII; Kushoglu v. Bulgaria, no. 48191/99, \u00a7 49, 10 May 2007; Belev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 86; and Sedelmayer v. Germany (dec.), nos.\u00a030190/06 and 30216/06, 10 November 2009). That presupposes, amongst other things, that domestic law must provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference with property rights (see Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, \u00a7 134, 24 November 2005; Zl\u00ednsat, spol. s r.o. v. Bulgaria, no. 57785/00, \u00a7 98, 15 June 2006; Dru\u017estevn\u00ed z\u00e1lo\u017ena Pria and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 72034/01, \u00a7 89, 31 July 2008; and Forminster Enterprises Limited, cited above, \u00a7 69), and that the State must afford judicial procedures that offer the necessary procedural guarantees and enable the domestic courts to adjudicate effectively and fairly on any disputes between private persons (see UkraineTyumen v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 22603/02, \u00a7 51, 22 November 2007). Indeed, the latter requirement is also one of the positive obligations stemming from Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Sovtransavto Holding, cited above, \u00a7 96; AnheuserBusch Inc. v. Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2007I; Kushoglu, cited above, \u00a7 47; Freitag, cited above, \u00a7 54; and Marini, cited above, \u00a7 171). In ascertaining whether those requirements have been satisfied, the Court must take a comprehensive view of the applicable procedures.",

As a result of the events in issue those shareholdings were radically diluted. In July 1999, taken together, the applicants had a 49.83% stake in it. After several increases of the company\u2019s share capital carried out by the management installed as a result of decision no. 9, at the end of 2008 three other companies held a total of 99.1% of MTFU\u2019s share capital (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). Therefore, by that time, the applicants held, at best, a total of not more than 0.9% of the company\u2019s shares (see, mutatis mutandis, Sovtransavto Holding, \u00a7 92, and Olczak, \u00a7 71, both cited above).",

The court\u2019s decision made possible a change of control of MTFU, which was sanctioned by its subsequent decisions nos. 10, 11 and 12 (see paragraphs 1821 above). The company\u2019s new management later issued new shares, increasing its share capital by more than twenty times, from BGN 60,000 to BGN 1,251,000, and prevented the applicants from subscribing for those new shares (see paragraphs 9, 47 and 48 above). In view of that, and noting that decision no.\u00a09 was not merely a response to the fraudulent actions of private persons, as would have been the case if it had been made pursuant to a registration application based on forged documents, but was a serious deviation from the normal functions of the Sofia City Court as custodian of the register of companies, the Court is satisfied that the dilution of the applicants\u2019 shareholdings in MTFU was linked to the actions of the State to a degree that is sufficient to justify the conclusion that the authorities interfered with the applicants\u2019 possessions. However, that interference was not comparable to a deprivation of possessions (see Sovtransavto Holding, cited above, \u00a7\u00a094), but was rather an act that created a situation in which third parties were able to interfere with the applicants\u2019 possessions (see, mutatis mutandis, Kushoglu, cited above, \u00a7 61).",

That allowed them to take a number of steps prejudicial to the applicants\u2019 interests as shareholders, both directly, by diluting their shareholdings, and indirectly, by disposing of company assets and by assuming obligations on behalf of the company. Indeed, it seems that among the first steps taken by the fraudulent board of directors were its resolutions to call two general meetings of the shareholders, which the applicants were prevented from attending, with a view to effecting further changes to the company\u2019s constitution and management (see paragraphs 20 above). The Sofia City Court, apparently based on the entry in the register made pursuant to decision no. 9, considered those meetings as validly conducted and entered the resolutions passed by them in the register of companies, while at the same time refusing to enter the resolutions taken at the \u201cparallel\u201d meeting held by the applicants, on the grounds that it had not been called by the legitimate board of directors (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above).",

Two of them \u2013 Shesti Mai Engineering OOD and Mr Evtimov \u2013 almost immediately sought the decision\u2019s annulment (see paragraphs 24 and 31 above). Another two applicants, Motorengineering OOD and Vitex AD, also challenged the decision, as well as three subsequent decisions (see paragraph 35 above). In addition, Shesti Mai Engineering OOD sought and obtained an interim injunction barring the board \u201ccreated\u201d by that decision from taking any managerial decisions and disposing of company assets, and prohibiting the first general meeting of shareholders called by that board from taking place (see paragraph 25 above). Those steps seem entirely reasonable under the circumstances, for two reasons. First, the situation engendered by decision no. 9 was highly unusual and out of line with the normal way in which the register of companies ought to have operated. Secondly, at that time the Bulgarian courts\u2019 caselaw on the procedure to be followed in order to challenge unlawful resolutions of company bodies and erroneous entries in the register of companies and on the availability of interim remedies in connection with such challenges was apparently not settled, as evidenced by the need for the Supreme Court of Cassation to give in December 2002 \u2013 more than two years after the events in issue \u2013 an interpretative decision resolving the divergences in the courts\u2019 caselaw in that domain (see paragraph 58 above). However, as a result of the reaction of the courts to the applicants\u2019 requests, their efforts proved fruitless. That allowed the fraudulent board of directors, unchecked, to take a number of steps in relation to the corporate affairs of MTFU and the applicants\u2019 shareholdings in it.",

It is also conceivable that they could have tried to seek compensation for the damage occasioned by the actions of that board\u2019s members \u2013 or their representatives, such as Mr B.S. \u2013 under the special rules providing for liability of board members (see paragraph 57 above) or under the general law of tort. The existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile does not absolve an applicant from having to use his or her recourse to it (see, among other authorities, Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 40; Brusco v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no. 69789/01, ECHR 2001IX; Milo\u0161evi\u0107 v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 77631/01, 19 March 2002; and Kamburov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a014336/05, \u00a7 61 in fine, 6 January 2011). However, the Court does not consider that the applicants can be criticised for not having made use of a remedy which would have been directed to essentially the same end as the ones that they had used and which would not have had a better prospect of success (see Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 1999II, and, more recently, Mileva and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43449/02 and 21475/04, \u00a7\u00a7 77 and 82, 25 November 2010). Moreover, even assuming that such claims would have had a reasonable chance of succeeding, in the very unusual circumstances of this case they would have been unlikely to fully and adequately wipe out the consequences of the interference with the applicants\u2019 possessions and to ensure compliance with the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, for two reasons. First, as apparent from the fate of the proceedings brought by Motorengineering OOD and Vitex AD (see paragraph 36 above), any claim brought by the applicants in relation to the board\u2019s actions would have, in all probability, been stayed to await the outcome of the proceedings against decision no. 9, and would have thus taken many years to examine, possibly allowing the board ample time to shield themselves from liability. Secondly, the applicants would have been required to bring individual challenges against the multitude of resolutions passed by that board throughout the considerable period of time \u2013 more than four years \u2013 during which it was still considered by the outside world, including the courts, as validly constituted by reason of its featuring in the register of companies. As evident from the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s interpretative decision no. 1 of 2002, the annulment of a resolution of a board or of a general meeting of shareholders of a company under sections 71 and 74 does not have retrospective effect (see paragraph 58 above). That would have made it very difficult for the applicants to untangle the board\u2019s actions. That said, their failure to have recourse to those remedies, and to thus try to mitigate their loss, may be taken into account for the purposes of Article 41 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Hornsby v. Greece, 19 March 1997, \u00a7\u00a037 in fine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, and Iatridis, cited above, \u00a7 47).",

The interim injunction obtained by Shesti Mai Engineering OOD on 21 September 1999 was not fully complied with even while it was still in effect, that is until 3 November 1999 (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). It had ordered, inter alia, that the general meeting of MTFU\u2019s shareholders scheduled for 30 September 1999 be postponed. However, the meeting took place and its decisions were given official sanction by the Sofia City Court, which entered the changes to MTFU\u2019s board adopted by it in the register of companies (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).

They arrived at that sum in the following manner. According to an expert report obtained by them in December 2009 (see paragraph 98 below), the fair market value of the right of use at that time was BGN 29,257,000. This sum was to be reduced by twenty per cent, because in July 1999 the right had been already been enjoyed for almost ten years, which represented twenty per cent of its overall duration (fifty years). The resulting sum was BGN 23,405,600. Multiplied by 49.83% (the applicants\u2019 combined stake in MTFU in July 1999), that gave the figure of BGN 11,663,010.",

After the events in question, its main line of business had been abandoned, and in 2007 and 2008 it had posted no revenue at all from professional training. The number of people employed by the company had also declined. The revenue before the interference had been chiefly due to the company\u2019s main asset \u2013 the right of use of the training centre in Bistritsa. In 1990 the company had paid the full value of that right, and later had taken good care of the property, investing considerable amounts of money to maintain and develop it.

Bulgaria (just satisfaction), no. 48191/99, \u00a7\u00a7 1115, 3 July 2008). Moreover, there must be a clear causal connection between the damage claimed by the applicant and the breach (see, among other authorities, Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, \u00a7 47, 24 June 2003). In addition, the Court enjoys a certain discretion in the exercise of the power conferred by Article 41, as is borne out by the adjective \u201cjust\u201d and the phrase \u201cif necessary\u201d in its text (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7 114, Series A no. 39). Indeed, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate if national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made (see Comingersoll S.A. v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, \u00a7 29, ECHR\u00a02000IV; Wolkenberg and Others v.

If domestic law and the nature of the injury suffered by the applicant make such reparation possible, the Court takes that into consideration under Article 41, sometimes applying an appropriate reduction of the just satisfaction award (see Todorova and Others (just satisfaction), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 4346, and contrast De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium (Article 50), 10 March 1972, \u00a7 20, Series A no. 14), and sometimes declining to make any award at all (see Patrikova v.

The Court has already found that this was not comparable to a deprivation of possessions (see paragraph 81 in fine above). The second aspect of the breach consisted in the ensuing failure of the State to afford the applicants appropriate means of protecting themselves effectively against the actions taken by those persons. That cannot be equated to a deprivation of possessions either. Therefore, the compensation to be set does not necessarily need to reflect the idea of total elimination of the consequences of the breach. That said, had it not been for the breach, the applicants would have, in all probability, kept their shareholdings in the company, which would have entitled them to the payment of dividends and, in the event of a windingup of the company, to a pro rata share of its remaining assets. They may therefore be regarded as having suffered a real loss of opportunity that the State must indemnify (see, mutatis mutandis, Sovtransavto Holding (just satisfaction), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 55 in fine, 68 and 71, and Sildedzis v. , no. 45214/99, \u00a7 58, 24 May 2005).

Thirdly, there is some doubt as to whether after the adoption of paragraph 6 of the transitional and concluding provisions of the State Property Act 1996, even if account is taken of the provision\u2019s subsequent abrogation by the Constitutional Court, the company continued to have good title in law to the largest and most important of its assets \u2013 the right of use of the Stateowned training centre in Bistritsa (see paragraphs 4145 and 5960 above). Fourthly, the Court cannot overlook the facts that the primary actor in the fraudulent takeover of the applicants\u2019 company were not the authorities but private persons, and that none of the applicants tried to obtain compensation for the damage caused by the persons who fraudulently took control of their company and thus mitigate their losses (see paragraph 86 above). Lastly, the calculation of the loss suffered by the applicants inevitably involves a degree of speculation (see, mutatis mutandis, Zl\u00ednsat, spol. s r.o. v.

Among these, account should be taken of the company\u2019s reputation, uncertainty in planning and decision making, disruption in the management of the company and lastly, albeit to a lesser degree, anxiety and inconvenience caused to the members of the management team (see, among other authorities, Comingersoll S.A. v.

As for Shesti Mai Engineering OOD and Nov Bryag OOD \u2013 companies wholly owned by Mr Evtimov and Ms\u00a0Stoycheva (see paragraph 1 above) \u2013 the Court does not consider that they suffered any nonpecuniary damage additional to that suffered by those two applicants.
