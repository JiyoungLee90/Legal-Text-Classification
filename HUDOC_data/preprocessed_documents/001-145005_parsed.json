Since she had not done everything required of her in order to discover the child\u2019s genetic abnormality in a timely manner, it had not been possible for the applicant to prevent the birth of a child with a congenital disorder. The applicant argued that the court had erred in finding that she did not belong to a risk group due to her age, since Ordinance No. 324 indicated that pregnant women above the age of 35 should have the AFP test. She also contended that the court had erred in concluding that she had been referred for the test. She maintained that the court\u2019s conclusion that she herself was to blame for the fact the test was not carried out was unfounded since the case file contained no evidence in that regard. Furthermore, she claimed that the court had given no reasons for relying on the medical records used by the MADEKKI instead of the earlier copy of the medical record that she had submitted. In any event, the applicant argued that even if she had been referred for the test, the referral was already too late as on the day allegedly fixed for the test she was already in her nineteenth or twentieth week of pregnancy. She further contended that had she refused to take the test, the doctor would have made a corresponding note in the medical record. As regards her eldest son, the applicant pointed out that Dr L. had never asked her about the health of her other children and explained that her son had developed schizophrenia at the age of twelve. She insisted that there was in her view a causal link between the Dr L.\u2019s failures and the birth of her child and that damages ought to be paid.",

She argued that the Civil Chamber had not assessed correctly whether the failure of Dr L. to ensure that the AFP test was carried out had infringed the applicant\u2019s right to find out about any foetal abnormality. Even though the court had concluded that she had been referred for the AFP test, the judgment did not address whether the referral complied with section 41 of the Medical Treatment Law, i.e. whether she had received all the necessary information about the test (see paragraph 47 below). Further, the applicant submitted that the court should have applied section 23 of the Medical Treatment Law and insisted that any refusal of the treatment should have been in writing (see paragraph 46 below). She also submitted that the court had wrongly interpreted section 25 of the Medical Treatment Law (see paragraph 46 below) by stating that she had been obliged to carry out the AFP, as it had not taken into account the need for free and informed consent before any medical intervention. Finally, she argued that in assessing whether Dr L.\u2019s actions had been wrongful, such as to give rise to damages, the court should have assessed whether the doctor had complied with the applicable rules, including the Ordinance No. 324. The court\u2019s conclusions as to the lack of a causal link were not compatible with the Ordinance, since had Dr L. complied with her legal obligations, the applicant could have found out that the foetus had a genetic disease and could have availed herself of her right to have an abortion on medical grounds, thereby preventing the birth of the child. Accordingly, she maintained, the necessary causal link existed between Dr L.\u2019s wrongful actions and the birth of the child with Down\u2019s syndrome.",

Individuals\u2019 involvement in the choice of medical care provided to them and consent to such treatment fall within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention (Trocellier v. France; and Spyra and Kranczkowski v. Poland, no. 19764/07, \u00a7 70, 25 September 2012). The Court has previously found that the decision of a pregnant woman to continue her pregnancy or not belongs to the sphere of private life and autonomy and that, as a consequence, legislation regulating the interruption of pregnancy touches upon the sphere of private life (see R.R., cited above, \u00a7 181, and the references therein). However, the present case does not directly concern the applicant\u2019s decision whether to continue or not her pregnancy but rather the questions whether the necessary information was provided to her and whether her medical care complied with domestic law. In this respect, the Court\u2019s case-law confirms that where a complaint concerns the exercise of the right of effective access to information concerning health, it is linked to private and family life within the meaning of Article 8 (see K.H. and Others v.

She argued that the medical professional responsible for prenatal care in her case had an obligation to identify the medical risks. She also contended that she had the right to be informed about the necessity and the possible advantages of the AFP test before the sixteenth week of pregnancy in order to enable her to decide whether to undergo the test between the sixteenth and eighteenth weeks. These requirements, she claimed, were set out in section 41 of the Medical Treatment Law and Ordinance No. 324. She contended that Dr\u00a0L. should have informed her about the nature of the AFP test as well as other methods for detecting foetal abnormalities, including ultrasound and amniocentesis, and about the possible effects of these procedures. However, Dr\u00a0L. had failed in these duties, preventing the applicant from enjoying her legal rights during her antenatal care and regulating her conduct accordingly. Although it was true that a patient could refuse treatment, there was no written signed record, as required by Article 23 of the Medical Treatment Law, of the applicant\u2019s alleged refusal to undergo the AFP test.

It therefore could not be alleged that Article 8 conferred a right to a specific prenatal examination, in particular given the differing policies at European level concerning the screening for Down\u2019s syndrome. However, the Government accepted that once a State provided an entitlement to a specific medical examination it was required to devise a legal framework which was coherent and allowed different interests to be taken into account. At the Government Agent\u2019s request, the Ministry of Health provided a letter for the purposes of the Government\u2019s submissions in this case which has been provided to the Court and confirms that any pregnant woman above the age of thirty-five is automatically considered to be in the pregnancy risk group. The Government pointed out that the applicant had not disputed that the domestic regulations in force at the relevant time entitled her to an AFP test. Further procedures were available depending on the results of the AFP test. It was also open to the applicant immediately to request a referral for any further examinations. However, none of the prenatal examinations were mandatory and the applicant had the right to reject any or all of them at any time. She did not allege that she had requested a referral for the AFP test or any other procedure and been refused. Nor did she claim that there was a lack of effective mechanisms enabling her to seek access to prenatal examinations. The Government emphasised that the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case were far removed from those in R.R., cited above, where the applicant had persistently but unsuccessfully sought access to prenatal tests and an abortion.\u00a0They Government further argued that had the applicant had any complaints or concerns about her antenatal care, she could have complained to the MADEKKI at any time during her pregnancy.

Prior genetic problems were even stronger indicators for referral for risky genetic examinations. As the MADEKKI had found, had the applicant informed Dr L. of her eldest son\u2019s illness, she would have been referred for further examination during her first trimester.

According to the expert report of July 2006 (see paragraph 28 above), no falsification had been established. The report\u2019s conclusion that the entries made in the medical records were recorded over an extended period of time confirmed the evidence of Dr\u00a0L. that the record was continuously updated with new information. Although the expert report was not put before the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court when it decided the applicant\u2019s case in April 2007, the report did not contain any information that could overturn the conclusions reached by the appellate court since it did not establish that the entry had been falsified. No witness was able to testify to the authenticity of the copy of the medical record made by the applicant in June 2002.

Before the Civil Chamber and the Senate of the Supreme Court, she maintained her complaints and further alleged failings in the manner in which the Regional Court had examined her claim (see paragraphs 33 and 40-41 above). In the proceedings before the domestic courts she invoked a number of sections of the Medical Treatment Law. Several aspects of the domestic proceedings give rise to concern.",

Thus the Regional Court found that the applicant was not in a risk category solely on account of her age (see paragraph 32 above) but did not explain how this finding was to be reconciled with the provisions of Ordinance No. 324 (see paragraph 48 above) or refer to any other official document supporting its findings on this matter. The court\u2019s finding is also at odds with the information provided by the Ministry of Health to the Government Agent for the purposes of the present proceedings (see paragraph 73 above). Although the applicant argued before the Civil Chamber that the Regional Court had erred, the Civil Chamber does not appear to have addressed the point in its judgment. It also appears from the parties\u2019 submissions that there is a lack of clarity as to the date of commencement of the applicant\u2019s pregnancy (see paragraph 7 above). Although medical record no. 43 indicated that she had been referred for an AFP test in her eighteenth week (see paragraph 8 above), Dr L. later told the police that she had been referred in her seventeenth week (see paragraph 20 above), while the applicant now contends that she was actually in her nineteenth week at the time of the referral (see paragraph 68 above). Assuming that the medical record was correct, the applicant\u2019s appointment for the AFP test, scheduled for six days after the referral, appears to have been in the nineteenth week, which was outside the period stipulated in Ordinance No.\u00a0324 (the Ordinance required the test to be undertaken between the sixteenth and eighteenth weeks \u2013 see paragraph 48 above). There is no evidence that this anomaly, or the inconsistent evidence of Dr\u00a0L. to the police, was investigated by the domestic courts.",

The disappearance of the medical record does not appear to have been investigated by Dr L. or A.\u00a0Hospital at the time, even though the inability of Dr L. to make her notes promptly was arguably incompatible with the terms of Ordinance No. 393 on the keeping of medical records (see paragraph 52 above). There is also no evidence that the disappearance of the applicant\u2019s medical record led to a review of her case and a decision to repeat all necessary examinations and tests, despite Dr L.\u2019s evidence to the police that such steps had to be taken when a file went missing (see paragraph 20 above). Again, while it seems that there was some discussion of the loss of the records at the hearing before the Civil Chamber (see paragraph 34 above), the subsequent steps taken by Dr L. and A. Hospital do not appear to have been considered when assessing whether Dr L. had been negligent in the antenatal care accorded to the applicant.",

The applicant attended subsequent appointments with Dr L. (see paragraph 10 above) and it appears logical that it would have come to light during the appointment following the missed AFP test that the test had not taken place. In these circumstances, one would expect to find a relevant reference in the applicant\u2019s medical records to a discussion with her and the provision of information concerning possible further tests. However, neither the Government nor the domestic courts have drawn attention to any such entry in the applicant\u2019s medical notes. It appears, therefore, that no such discussion ever took place.",

According to the MADEKKI statute, the MADEKKI can impose an administrative fine where it finds that a violation of healthcare has taken place (see paragraph 51 above). Pursuant to Article 92 of the Constitution and Article 1635 of the Civil Law, infringements of individuals\u2019 rights give rise to a right to adequate compensation (see paragraphs 53-54 above). Domestic case-law demonstrates that infringements of the Medical Treatment Law can lead to payment of compensation (see paragraph 55-56 above). However, there is no evidence in the applicant\u2019s case that the civil courts considered whether, in light of the infringement of the applicant\u2019s rights which had been established by the MADEKKI and in light of the alleged infringements of her right to information under the Medical Treatment Law (see paragraphs 30 and 40 above), she was entitled to payment of non-pecuniary damages. This is a wholly separate question to the one examined by the courts as to the existence of a causal link between the failure to ensure that the applicant had the test and the birth of the child from Down\u2019s syndrome (see paragraphs 32 and 36 above).",

While the taking of evidence is generally a matter for domestic courts, it is nonetheless surprising that despite the various factual inconsistencies identified above (see paragraph 88) the applicant\u2019s evidence was considered unnecessary.

My difficulty is my inability to find justified on the facts my colleagues\u2019 conclusion that \u201cthe domestic courts\u2019 approach to the applicant\u2019s claim discloses the appearance of arbitrariness\u201d (see paragraph 94 of the judgment in the present case \u2013 \u201cthe present judgment\u201d). The fact that the international judges in this Court may themselves disagree with the national judges or personally prefer that a different procedural treatment have been afforded to the case at national level does not carry the consequence of non-compliance with the procedural requirements inherent in Article 8 of the Convention and certainly not the consequence of arbitrariness on the part of the national courts.",

In my view, not only as a matter of principle does this kind of micro-management of the conduct of particular proceedings at national level by this international Court run counter to the effective functioning of the Convention system in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, but the facts of the instant case do not support the conclusion arrived at by my colleagues. Consequently, although I believe that a re-assessment of the merits of the evidential and procedural facts is not the proper role of this Court, I will be obliged to say something in this connection since I cannot agree either with my colleagues\u2019 re-assessment.",

What is more, they are not wholly convincing. For example, the so-called failure of the first appeal court (the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court) to answer the applicant\u2019s arguments directed against the first-instance court\u2019s (the Regional Court\u2019s) finding of her not being in a risk category despite, inter alia, the provisions of Ordinance 324 turns out, on examination, to be more apparent than real. The applicant\u2019s doctor had testified before the Civil Chamber that the fact that the applicant was 40 years of age was not as such an indicator that she ought to have the specific test for patients at risk of having a baby with Down\u2019s syndrome (see paragraphs 34 and 50 of the present judgment); and the Civil Chamber\u2019s judgment, apart from dealing with various other arguments pleaded by the applicant and also with the crucial point of causality, went into the question of the AFP test, which was required by Ordinance No. 324 for all patients aged over 35 years, that is to say, patients who could be considered to be in a risk category (see paragraphs 35-38 of the present judgment).",

The applicant, in the absence of her legal representatives, is herself recorded as having made submissions on her own behalf and answered questions posed by the Court.

There is no need to specify in detail these considerations, which may be said to be of some pertinence to the issue of compliance with the procedural aspect of Article\u00a08. Suffice it to say that the picture presented of the national courts\u2019 procedural and substantive treatment of the applicant\u2019s claim appears somewhat one-sided. Even if my colleagues can be taken to have identified some factors showing that that treatment was less than ideal, to my mind those factors, even taken cumulatively, come nowhere near \u201cdisclos[ing] the appearance of arbitrariness\u201d or grounding a conclusion that \u201cthe domestic courts did not examine the applicant\u2019s claim ... in a manner sufficient to ensure the protection of her interests\u201d for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention (in the words of paragraph 94 of the present judgment). It is important to bear in mind that the procedural requirements of Article 8 of the Convention do not guarantee litigants, any more than does the fair-trial clause of the Convention (Article 6\u00a71), the entitlement to have every single procedural request granted, or every single one of their arguments examined, by the national courts in the way or to the degree they would wish. As the present judgment itself observes (at paragraph 87), the procedural complaints the applicant submitted to this Court, notably as to alleged failings in the manner in which her claim had been examined, were raised by her before the national appellate courts (see paragraphs 33 and 4041 of the present judgment). While my colleagues do not agree with the conclusions of the national courts in regard to those complaints and evidently would have decided otherwise had they been in the place of the national courts, where I am sorry to part company with them is their conclusion of arbitrariness and of judicial treatment not sufficiently addressing the applicant\u2019s interests from the standpoint of the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention.",
