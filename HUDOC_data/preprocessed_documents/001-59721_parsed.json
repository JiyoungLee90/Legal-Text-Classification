The evidence before the court from Detective Constable S. was to the effect that he attended a briefing at 5.30 a.m. on 28\u00a0December 1985 in which he was told that he was to carry out a search to find evidence and arrest persons, including the applicant, suspected of involvement in the murder of Kurt Konig.

The information acted upon by the arresting officer need not be based on his own observations, as he is entitled to form a suspicion based on what he has been told; his reasonable suspicion may be based on information which has been given to him anonymously, or it may be based on information which turns out later to be wrong. While the evidence about the matters disclosed at the briefing was indeed scanty, he found that the trial judge was entitled to weigh up the evidence in the light of the surrounding circumstances and, having regard to the source of that information, and to draw inferences as to what a reasonable man, in the position of the independent observer, would make of it.",

The present application is therefore to be distinguished from those in Fox, Campbell and Hartley and  (both cited above) in which the Court examined complaints about arrest effected under provisions requiring only an honest suspicion. In the applicant\u2019s case, his claims that his arrest was not justified by a suspicion, held on reasonable grounds, that he had committed an offence, was examined by three levels of domestic courts. In those proceedings, evidence was given by the arresting officer, Detective Constable S., concerning the circumstances of the arrest and the applicant was given the opportunity to cross-examine.

No further questions were asked by the applicant\u2019s counsel as to what information passed at the briefing. Nor were any steps taken to have other officers involved in the arrest and detention, such as the briefing officer, called to give evidence. Furthermore, the applicant did not make any requests for discovery in relation to the existing documentary evidence concerning the arrest. The applicant argued before the Court that it was for the defendant police authorities to call the necessary witnesses to establish the lawfulness of the arrest. The Government pointed out that they had no reason to call any other officers as no issue had been raised concerning their role in the events. The Court observes that indeed very little (\u201cscanty\u201d in the words of the High Court judge) evidence was produced concerning the background to the applicant\u2019s arrest, largely because at the trial level the applicant was in fact concentrating on his claims of assault and ill-treatment. The defendants in that action, not unreasonably, would have geared their response to the allegations which he was making. To the extent therefore that the applicant complains before this Court that no information was elicited during the domestic proceedings concerning the briefing, the Court considers that this was the consequence of the way in which the applicant pursued his claims.",

The applicant disputed that this information was in fact received or that it could be regarded as reliable, since he was not involved in the incident. He argued that he was arrested as part of an arbitrary police policy which targeted him as a prominent member of Sinn Fein. The Court recalls, however, that no challenge was made in the domestic proceedings by the applicant to the good faith of any of the officers involved in the arrest or detention. It was never suggested, for example, that the arrest had been motivated by malice or was an arbitrary abuse of power, as the applicant had succeeded in proving concerning an incident on 16 March 1993 (see paragraph 8 above). It had not been disputed by the applicant that a briefing had occurred, attended by police officers, at which information was passed on concerning the identity of persons involved in the murder of Kurt Konig and steps taken to plan a number of arrests.",

There had allegedly been information known to the police prior to this incident that they were suspected of being members of the IRA and involved in intelligence gathering. The third applicant had been arrested on suspicion of involvement in a kidnapping, without any indication given as to the basis for the suspicion beyond reference to sensitive material available to the police connecting him with the incident. This was found by the Court in respect of all three applicants not to meet the minimum standard set by Article 5 \u00a7 1 for judging the reasonableness of an arrest of an individual. On the other hand, in Murray (cited above, p. 28, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061-62) the standard was satisfied when the arrest of the applicant, on suspicion of involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms, was based on information provided to the arresting officer that the applicant\u2019s brothers had been convicted of similar offences in the United States, which implied collaboration with \u201ctrustworthy\u201d persons in Northern Ireland and the applicant was known to have visited the United States and maintained contacts with her brothers, elements which were not necessarily incriminating of the applicant. There may thus be a fine line between those cases where the suspicion grounding the arrest is not sufficiently founded on objective facts and those which are. Whether the requisite standard is satisfied and whether the guarantee against arbitrary arrest laid down by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) is thereby satisfied depends on the particular circumstances of each case.",

The arrest was therefore a pre-planned operation, more akin to the arrest in , and was based on slightly more specific detail than in Fox, Campbell and Hartley. In these circumstances, and having regard to additional distinguishing elements referred to above (see paragraphs 38-40), the Court considers that the domestic courts\u2019 approach \u2013 that the judge was entitled on the sparse materials before him to infer the existence of reasonable grounds of suspicion \u2013 was not incompatible with the standard imposed by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.",

His claim was based on the narrow legal argument concerning the state of mind of the arresting officer relevant under section 12(1)(b) of the 1984 Act. Nor is the Court persuaded that there was any immunity conferred on other police officers, as a result of the finding by the domestic courts, that the arresting officer had the required suspicion. If the briefing officer or any other superior officer had deliberately passed on misleading or inaccurate information to the arresting officer, the police authorities would have been liable for wrongful arrest or false imprisonment in respect of that misconduct (see paragraph 25 above).",

What really matters is the actual material, produced before the court, and not the tactics used by the parties in respect of the presentation of that material.

I would add that no two cases can be identical. Still, if a comparison on the basis of similarities is to be embarked upon in respect of the above cases, I believe that this case is nearer to Fox, Campbell and Hartley than to Murray, the reason being that both in this case and in the first-mentioned case no grounds at all in support of the reasonableness of the suspicion were submitted to the domestic courts, while in Murray certain facts in support of the suspicion were in fact adduced in the competent national courts.",

I believe that the liberty of an individual is a very important value in a democratic society and can only be interfered with when there are objective and well-founded reasons. It is not enough to establish a reasonable suspicion justifying an arrest on the basis of a mere statement by the arresting constable to the effect that \u201cmy boss suspects a person and therefore he ordered me to arrest him\u201d.
