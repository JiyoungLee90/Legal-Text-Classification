It noted at the outset that it was difficult for Somali citizens to prove their identity since there was no authority that could issue passports or other acceptable identity documents. Accordingly, the applicants\u2019 stories were decisive for determining their origin. The Board found that the first applicant had provided detailed information about Hosingo village, situated in southern Somalia. However, his pronunciation of some words was typical of that in northern Somalia. In addition he had stamps in his passport, dated 2000 to 2005, from airports in Somaliland. There were no entry or departure stamps from trips to or from southern Somalia. Finally, he had provided contradictory statements about the crucial event in 2008, notably whether the leader was killed immediately or six days after the negotiation with Al Shabaab, and why he was being sought by them, and he had been vague about the situation in south and central Somalia. The language analysis of the second applicant indicated that she originated from Somaliland. Moreover, she had not been able to give any detailed information about the village or her clan, which could be verified. In conclusion, the Migration Board did not find it credible that the applicants had been living in Hosingo until their departure from Somalia. It found it much more likely that the applicants\u2019 most recent home had been in northern Somalia.",

According to a local Hargeisa-based NGO, gang rapes constituted 30 percent of reported rape cases and 55 percent of reported cases involved a minor as the victim. Many cases went unreported. In May 2013 IRIN reported that stiffer penalties and reduced reliance on traditional justice systems could help end the rising incidence of rape in Somaliland, with an estimated 5,000 rape cases to have taken place in 2012. The same news article noted that the extent of rape in Somaliland remains difficult to measure, with most cases going unreported or being resolved between families. While rape is punishable with a jail term of five to 15 years in Somaliland, cases are often settled outside the courts by traditional leaders, with perpetrators typically paying compensation or marrying the victim.

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

Turkey [GC], nos.  and , \u00a7 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. , \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, \u00a7 40).",

It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, \u00a7 167, 26 July 2005). In this respect, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker\u2019s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and Akasiebie v.
