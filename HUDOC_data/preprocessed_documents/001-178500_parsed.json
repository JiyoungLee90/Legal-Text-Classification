Moreover, the Court notes that the settlements in issue were concluded almost five years after the judgments in the applicants\u2019 favour became final. In that connection, the Court reiterates that in similar cases it found that an applicant may still claim to be a victim in relation to the period during which the decision of which he or she complained remained unenforced (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubenko v.

It reiterates that by virtue of Article 46 the High Contracting Parties have undertaken to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they are parties, execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. It follows that a judgment in which the Court finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41, but also to implement, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, appropriate general and/or individual measures (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 198, ECHR 2004II, and Greens and M.T. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 60041/08 and 60054/08, \u00a7\u00a0106, ECHR 2010 (extracts)). The State is obliged to take such measures also in respect of other persons in the applicants\u2019 position, notably by implementing the general measures indicated by the Constitutional Court in the decisions of 17 September 2014 and 26 February 2015 (see, by analogy, Karanovi\u0107 v.
