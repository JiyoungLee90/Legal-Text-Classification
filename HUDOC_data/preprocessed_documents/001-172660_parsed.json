The note contained a mobile telephone number and the names of the people with whom the terrorists wanted to negotiate: the North Ossetian President Mr Dzasokhov, the Ingushetian President Mr Zyazikov and a paediatrician, Dr Roshal. The note also stated that the school building had been mined and would be blown up in the event of an attempt to storm it, and that the terrorists would shoot fifty hostages for any one of them killed.

Hand grenades, RPG20 portable grenade launchers and Shmel flamethrowers had been used for the first time after 6 p.m. At 9 p.m. a T-72 tank had been used to make openings in the walls and suppress enemy firing points, since further movement in the building had been impossible because of mines laid by the terrorists.

The group had used RPG26 grenade launchers and RPOA flame-throwers, but not at the premises where the hostages had been present (page 131 of the report). One witness, M.K., a member of a storming group, stated on 23\u00a0November 2004 that he had used RPG26 grenade launchers and RPOA flame-throwers upon \u201cenemy firing points which had been designated in advance and identified during the storming\u201d. The firing points identified in advance had been located in the window of the attic area and the third window on the first floor of the main building. No hostages had been there at the time. For the second time the flame-thrower had been used at night, at about midnight, upon a group of terrorists in the craft classrooms on the ground floor. At that time the rest of the building had been in the firm control of the security forces and Emercom staff had been finishing carrying the bodies out of the gymnasium (page 183 of the report). The report listed the main characteristics of an RPOA Shmel: a thermobaric charge of over 2 kilograms upon explosion creates a powerful combustion zone (a sphere of fire 5 to 7 metres in diameter) burning at temperature of about 1,800oC; accompanied by an extremely powerful shock wave caused by a complete burning of oxygen in the detonation zone. An expert described the effects of this charge upon people, which would include severe fractures caused by the shock wave and lung collapse; and upon buildings as a \u201cblowing out\u201d of the external walls and collapse of the structure. The report referred to the records of two experiments carried out on 13 October 2005 wherein disused buildings had been fired at with RPOA flamethrowers, as a result of which the buildings had been demolished but no fire had started (page 183 of the report). Relying on the testimonies of security personnel, the pattern of destruction of the roof in the main part of the building, parts of RPOA charge found in the attic of the \u201cleft wing\u201d of the school and the absence of any such parts in the gymnasium, the conclusion was that there had been no explosions of a thermobaric charge from an RPOA there.

The extent of damage caused by the fire and explosions prevented any detailed analysis of the number of places where the fire had started and its exact cause and spreading in the building (pages 215-17 of the report).",

The report focused on the examination of the IEDs used by the terrorists in the gymnasium. It concluded that the terrorists had placed at least sixteen IEDs in the gymnasium, joined into a single chain by electric cables and detonators. On 3 September at least three IEDs had exploded in the north-west part of the gymnasium: one at the basketball hoop on the west wall (made of an OZM72 anti-personnel mine, equivalent to about 0,66 kilograms of TNT), the second on the right-hand side of the door leading into the gymnasium on the west wall (a sphereshaped IED equivalent to at least 0.5 kilograms of TNT) and the third on the windowpane of the first window on the north-west wall (an IED in a plastic bottle equivalent to at least 1 kilogram of TNT). The total force of the explosions had been equivalent to no less than two kilograms of TNT; however it was impossible to confirm their exact timing and sequence. The most likely cause of the explosions was intentional or non-intentional impact upon the detonator pedal; the reasons why the whole chain had failed to react were unclear, but it could be that the first explosions had damaged the electric cables connecting the rest of the IEDs (pages 18-29 of the report).",

It appeared to dismiss the doubts expressed, notably, by a member of the State Duma investigative committee and a renowned expert in the field of explosions, Mr Savelyev, about the external origins of the first two explosions in the gymnasium (see paragraphs 406, 408, 410 below). The conclusions of report no.\u00a016/1 are found on pages 264 to 273. They can be summarised as follows: the first explosion was the result of the detonation of a large IED, equivalent to between three and six kilograms of TNT. The origin of this explosion was not linked to the electric wires and detonator, but resulted, most probably, from mishandling of the device by the terrorists guarding it. This IED exploded in the north-east part of the gymnasium, at a spot about a metre away from the north wall and 5 metres away from the east wall. The second explosion occurred about twenty seconds later and consisted of the simultaneous detonation of several (between five and ten) smaller IEDs in the north-west part of the hall; this explosion most probably resulted from one of the terrorists intentionally or unintentionally using the detonator pedal. It could not have been caused by a cumulative charge launched from the outside. The report also concluded that out of all the recorded damage to the gymnasium walls, only two marks could have been caused by either a thermobaric charge or a cumulative charge projected from outside. These projectiles could not have been launched from the roofs of houses at 37, 39 or 41 Shkolny Lane (as alleged by some experts). The damage caused to the south wing of the school could have been caused by the use of various weapons and explosives, including a tank cannon, flame-throwers and grenade launchers; however, the extent of the destruction excluded the possibility of any detailed reconstruction of the events. The report dismissed as improbable the launching of a thermobaric charge from a helicopter, pointing out that it could lead to the destruction of the helicopter and death of the crew. Lastly, the report listed the following types of weapons used by the members of the counter-terrorist operation, reconstructed on the basis of video material and the documents contained in criminal case file no. 20/849:",

It was completed on 11\u00a0December 2009 (see paragraph 406 below). Like report 16/1, it was carried out by experts of Bazalt. The experts tested all the possibilities suggested by Mr Savelyev, including the use of various types of grenade launchers and flame-throwers upon a similar construction and concluded that their impact had been incompatible with the damage in the gymnasium. The report ran to over 130 pages and concluded that the \u201corigin of the hole in the north-west wall of the gymnasium ... was the detonation of an IED with the equivalent of about six kilograms of TNT, placed at a height of about 500 millimetres from the floor, near the radiator...

The document stated that the investigation had established that the personnel of the army and Ministry of the Interior had used automatic weapons, RPG25 grenade launchers, RPOA Shmel flamethrowers and T72 tanks. The document then proceeded to describe the events of the siege and storming, in line with witness statements of General Sobolev of the 58th Army. In particular, the document stated that on 1\u00a0September 2004, during the first meeting of the OH, it had been decided that Mr Dzasokhov\u2019s involvement in the negotiations was \u201cdevoid of purpose\u201d (\u043d\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e) since there was a threat of his being taken hostage as well. It further stated that although the decision to clear the area around the school of civilians and armed \u201cvolunteers\u201d had been taken at about 12\u00a0noon on 1\u00a0September, it had not been implemented until 3\u00a0September. Furthermore, on 2 September the terrorists had demanded that Mr\u00a0Dzasokhov, Mr\u00a0Zyazikov, Mr Aslakhanov and Dr Roshal arrive for negotiations, but the OH had decided that such talks were also \u201cdevoid of purpose\u201d. After the first explosions at 1.10 p.m. the terrorists had opened fire at the hostages running out of the gymnasium, following which the servicemen of the second security perimeter had returned fire. At 2 p.m. a group of sappers under the command of Colonel Nabiyev had started to demine the gymnasium; at the same time he had called for firemen to extinguish the fire. The first fire vehicle had arrived at 2.45 p.m. and contained 2,000 litres of water; the second vehicle had arrived at 3.45 p.m. and proceeded to extinguish the fire. By 9\u00a0p.m. the storming of the building had been over, while the search for and elimination of terrorists had continued until 12.30 a.m. on 4 September 2004.",

Hence, they first used mobile cisterns. The staff in charge had drawn up a plan of access for the fire engines to the school, but it was not within the firefighters\u2019 powers to ensure that these routes were accessible \u2013 that should have been coordinated by the OH on the basis of that plan. Failure to intervene during the initial stage had been based on the instructions of the OH. Lastly, the use of more powerful hydraulic cannons was deemed impractical by the commission, in view of the limited choice of locations where they could be placed, the distance to the source of the fire of about 60 metres, narrow access to the fire and the danger from the \u201chot vapour\u201d to those who might still be alive in the burning building.

The decision referred to witness statements made by Colonel Romanov, Mr Dzgoyev and a number of other firefighters and officials of the service. They confirmed that the information about the fire had first come in after the first explosions, soon after 1 p.m., but that the OH had only allowed the firefighters to intervene after 3.20 p.m. They said that seven fire engines had been ready to take part in the operation, but that the access routes to the school had remained busy with cars and people. The two closest fire hydrants had not been accessible; at first the engines had used cisterns to extinguish the fire from two water cannons; later a line to the next hydrant had been made. The decision discussed the question whether the firefighters could have used a more powerful hydraulic water cannon, but the firefighters argued that it could only have produced the desired effects if the distance to the source of fire had been less than 30 metres \u2013 that could not have been ensured in view of the ongoing fighting. The decision concluded that at the time of the firefighters\u2019 intervention, the general management of the operation had been taken by the OH headed by the FSB, without whose permission no action could have been taken. The FSB had not allowed the firefighters to intervene for about two hours, in view of a lack of special equipment for them, and thus their members could have been injured or died. In such circumstances, the actions of the Emercom officials contained no elements which could lead to the conclusion that a crime had been committed.

In particular, they argued that no necessary preventive measures had been taken prior to the terrorist act; that the OH had remained passive and failed to ensure meaningful negotiations with the hostage takers; that as a result of the inaction of the OH the hostages\u2019 conditions had deteriorated from 1 to 3 September 2004, thus rendering them weak by the time of the storming; that the failure of Mr Dzasokhov, Mr Zyazikov and Mr Aslakhanov to appear for negotiations had excluded the possibility of a dialogue; that the security perimeter around the school had not been properly ensured; and that the storming operation had not been thoroughly prepared. The victims also alleged that the military and security forces had acted without a plan and used excessive and indiscriminate weapons after 1\u00a0p.m. on 3\u00a0September. In support of that assertion they referred to several dozen witness statements collected during the trial of Mr Nurpashi Kulayev attesting to the use of flame-throwers, grenade launchers, tanks and APCs. They further alleged that there had been a one-and-a-half hour delay between the start of the fire in the gymnasium and the commencement of the extinguishing operation, and that the firefighters had been unprepared since they had lacked water supplies. As a result, dozens of hostages including children in the gymnasium had been burnt alive, since they were injured, shellshocked, disoriented or too weak to leave on their own.",

The terrorists had often interrupted the contact, saying that they would call back. The OH had involved a professional negotiator, who was a staff member of the FSB. The terrorists had behaved in an aggressive and hostile manner and refused to discuss any proposals unless the four men indicated by them came to Beslan. General Andreyev insisted that Mr Zyazikov, the Ingushetian President, could not be found, while the three other men had been in contact with the OH (Mr Aslakhanov had talked to the terrorists over the telephone and had arrived in Beslan on the afternoon of 3\u00a0September). The OH had invited two influential men of Ingush origin, Mr\u00a0Aushev and Mr Gutseriyev, to take part in the negotiations. The terrorists had been inflexible and refused to consider any proposals aimed at aiding the hostages or the possibilities of a ransom and exit. No written demands had been issued and a number of political demands had been made verbally through Mr Aushev. Responding to the questions about the number of hostages, General Andreyev insisted that there had been no exact lists beyond the 354 names and the OH had not wanted to release unreliable information. Responding to the victims\u2019 questions, he reiterated that in the course of the negotiations the terrorists had not referred to the number of hostages and that in his opinion they had not been particularly interested in the figure announced. He testified that on the evening of 2 September Mr\u00a0Gutseriyev had talked to Mr\u00a0Zakayev in London and the latter had promised to establish contact with Mr Maskhadov.

The second explosion, which had created a half-metre-wide opening in the brick wall under the window, had not been the result of an IED either, since the floorboards immediately near the hole had not been damaged, unlike the floorboards under the basketball hoop where the IED had later detonated.",

The terrorist holding the \u201cdead man\u2019s switch\u201d right under the detonation had been killed instantly. The explosion had created a zone of powerful smouldering combustion in the wood and attic insulation material, which had later caught fire. The second explosion had occurred twenty-two seconds later under the first window of the north side of the gymnasium, destroying the brick wall and throwing the bricks outside, while the windowpane situated immediately above the opening had remained intact. Mr Savelyev concluded that the nature and extent of destruction in this particular area ruled out the idea that it had come from an IED inside the gymnasium. He argued that the explosion had probably been caused by a portable anti-tank missile fired from the roof of a house at 41\u00a0Shkolny Lane. The projectile had entered the gymnasium from the opposite window and created the opening in the wall below the windowpane.",

The fire had raged in the attics with sufficient force to destroy the wooden beams holding the roof slates, which had finally collapsed by 3.20 p.m., burying the hostages unable to leave under the burning fragments. The firemen had intervened after 3.20\u00a0p.m., by which time the fire from the collapsed roof had spread to the floor and walls of the gymnasium.",

These tubes had been transmitted to the prosecutor\u2019s team carrying out the criminal investigation. According to the report, volume\u00a02 of criminal case file no. 20/849 contained a document dated 25\u00a0September 2004 and signed by LieutenantColonel Vasilyev from military unit no.\u00a077078 of the 58th Army. This document stated that the FSB units had received seven RPOA flamethrowers from military storage and listed their serial numbers. After the operation two flame-throwers with the indicated numbers, plus one with a different serial number, had been returned to storage (see paragraph 219 above). At the same time, Mr\u00a0Savelyev noted that the serial numbers of flamethrowers mentioned in the commission\u2019s record of 22\u00a0September 2004 and in the document issued by Lieutenant-Colonel Vasilyev on 25\u00a0September 2004 differed. He referred to other contradictory evidence given by military servicemen and statements by the Deputy Prosecutor General concerning the use of flamethrowers, concluding that at least nine disposable RPOA flamethrowers had been used by the special forces. Mr Savelyev also referred to the witness statements of one serviceman of the FSB given to the investigation (volume\u00a05 p. 38 of file no.\u00a020/849), according to whom RPG26 grenade launchers and RPOA flame-throwers had been used during the storming, in daytime (see paragraph 220 above), and the statement General Tikhonov of the FSB made to the commission on 28\u00a0October 2004 saying that the RPG grenade launchers and RPOA flamethrowers had been used at 3 p.m.",

From photographs and video footage of the events and witness accounts, Mr Savelyev concluded that between 1.05 p.m. and 2.20\u00a0p.m. the terrorists had evacuated about 300 people to the south wing. The hostages had been divided in more or less equal numbers between the canteen and kitchen on the ground floor and the main meeting room on the first floor. The south wing had become an area of fierce fighting between the terrorists and the assault troops; eight out of ten FSB elite officers had died there. The presence of hostages in that wing had not been taken into account by the assaulting troops, who had used indiscriminate weapons. Mr\u00a0Savelyev noted the absence of any detailed description of the location of the hostages\u2019 bodies, even though this could have allowed the circumstances of the hostages\u2019 deaths in the south wing to be established. He argued that the bodies in the gymnasium had been exposed to fire, while the number of people who had been found dead adjacent to the gymnasium had been known. He thus estimated the number of hostages who had lost their lives during the fighting in the south wing at about 110.",

The document listed various problems related to the collection, transportation and storage of remains, the organisation of the identification process and the compiling of forensic reports. In view of the large number of remains, many with extensive injuries and difficult to identify, together with the presence of numerous aggrieved relatives, on 4\u00a0September the prosecutor\u2019s office had taken the decision first to permit the relatives to identify the remains and then to carry out forensic examinations. As a result, there had been a number of incorrect identifications which later had to be corrected. Furthermore, in view of these constraints most bodies had been subjected to an external examination only. The exact cause of death had been established in 213\u00a0cases: of those, gunshot wounds in 51 cases (15.5 %), shell wounds in 148 cases (45%), burns in 10 cases (3%), and blunt force trauma injuries in 4 cases (1.2%).

Some of them had run to the first floor while others had broken windows and doors on the ground floor so that the hostages could enter the building. At this point the GAZ-66 vehicle stationed on Kominterna Street near the school fence had approached the main school entrance and up to fifteen people had descended from it. This vehicle had left after the fighters had descended. Lastly, a second GAZ-66 vehicle with a different registration plate had entered from Lermontovskaya Street to Kominterna at high speed, raising a large column of dust mentioned by many witnesses. Over twenty fighters, including four women, had descended from it and run towards the school; the vehicle had then broken down the school gates and stopped in the courtyard.

This threat could be classified as real, as it had been verified by various orders, telexes and other documents issued by the Federal [Ministry of the Interior]. It could also be classified as immediate, as the information disseminated by the authorities pointed to an attack taking place on a specific day: 1 September\u201d. The experts also pointed out that, in addition to the date, the information had referred to a specific area \u2013 near the border between North Ossetia and Ingushetia \u2013 and the potential target, as the attack had been planned to coincide with the Day of Knowledge. As Beslan was the largest town in Ossetia within 20 kilometres of the border with the Malgobek District, where terrorists had apparently been gathering, they concluded that \u201cBeslan, and other towns in the vicinity, were clearly under a real and immediate threat of an attack on a school on 1 September\u201d. Such a large-scale attack against a civilian target would have the potential for significant loss of life. The experts concluded that the level of detail available even from the relatively \u201csanitised versions\u201d in the telexes and other communications indicated that there might have been a \u201ccovert human intelligence source\u201d in the terrorist group, as well as technical coverage, such as the interception of communications.

They divided the possible responses into three broad categories: (i) target denial, (ii) intervention and (iii) security. An example of target denial would involve postponing the opening of the school year in a defined area. Although unprecedented, this would have denied the terrorists the high-profile target sought. As to intervention, in the absence of any additional information, any comment would necessarily be speculative. It could be that the authorities did not conduct any preventive strike on the basis that to do so would have compromised the sources, or for other reasons \u2013 for example in view of the serious risk to the lives of the members of the security forces. Nevertheless, it was clear that \u201cthe risk would be likely to be greater in the event that the group succeeded in carrying out their intentions\u201d and that the need to protect sources could not be used as a valid reason to put human life at serious risk.

The mortuary in Vladikavkaz could not have possibly coped with the influx of over 300 bodies \u2013 as, in fact, no mortuary in the world could have. Alternative solutions should therefore have been considered, such as establishing a temporary mortuary elsewhere (a storage warehouse or cool facility \u2013 he recalled the use of an ice-rink in the Lockerby events) and bringing in refrigerator trucks or distribution to other mortuaries. In view of the potentially high number of expected casualties from the siege, some sort of system should have been planned in advance, with a suitable location, equipment and personnel identified and available at short notice. He noted that \u201cthe matter of body storage and preservation would have been uppermost in the minds of the pathologists, particularly with the warm weather\u201d. A more orderly fashion of dealing with the bodies could have not only helped to avoid wrong identifications, but also alleviated the pressure on the forensic team. It would have permitted them to carry out a more in-depth examination of the bodies, where necessary, in order to establish the causes of death and identify and extract the objects that could be helpful to the investigation, such as bullets, fragments of IEDs and so forth. A clear explanation to the relatives as regards time expectations and the need for examination would have helped both them and those dealing with the bodies.",

The wide range of terminology applied to these weapon types, and the inaccurate ways such munitions are defined, has led to some confusion and hyperbole in reporting on the use of incendiary, thermobaric, and FAE weapons. Incendiary weapons, devices or bombs are designed to start fires or destroy sensitive equipment, using materials such as napalm, thermite, chlorine trifluoride, or white phosphorus. Whilst incendiary weapons are not explosives, and thus fall outside of the scope of this report, it is important to distinguish between incendiary munitions as opposed to thermobaric and FAE munitions. The former deflagrate, whilst the latter detonate. Incendiary weapons are primarily intended to provide sufficient heat and fuel to ignite, and possibly sustain, a fire at the target. The intention of a thermobaric or fuel-air-explosive weapon is to create a gross overpressure, combined with very high temperatures, such that the target suffers severe physical damage almost instantaneously.",

In particular, the applicants argued that whilst the individuals targeted had not been named, they nonetheless comprised a sufficiently identifiable class of individuals: schoolchildren and their families and teachers, in reasonably identifiable schools. Educational facilities in Beslan, particularly school no. 1, as the largest in the town, should have been considered among the primary potential targets for the terrorists. In view of the particular vulnerability of the potential target group, the known danger presented by the hardened terrorists and their intent to cause harm to civilians, reasonable measures should have been taken in order to disrupt, deter or minimise the attack. However, no reasonable preventive measures had been taken. In particular, no prior counter-terrorist operation had been set up in advance, and there had been no apparent plans for contingencies to adequately address either the threat or immediate aftermath of a successful attack. It appeared that no other measures, except providing the regional and local authorities with detailed information about the intended attack, had been taken. None of the various preventive measures called for appeared to have been implemented, nor was there any evidence that there had been any oversight of the provision of such instructions. No official had been held accountable for those failures. In sum, the applicants argued that the measures had fallen deplorably short of an appropriate and adequate response to a threat of such magnitude and foreseeability, and had been insufficient to discharge the Government\u2019s obligation to protect life under Article 2.",

The usual traffic police officer posted in front of the school had been absent, apparently fulfilling other duties, the one police officer at the school had been unarmed and without any means of communication, there had been no reaction from the police during the first few minutes of the attack, and the number of firearms available to the police after the attack appeared to have been insufficient. The applicants pointed to the Government\u2019s admission that the actions of the local police had contributed to the successful seizure of the school.

For the Court to find a violation of the positive obligation to protect life, it must be established that the authorities knew, or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of identified individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see Osman, cited above, \u00a7 116; Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2002\u2011II; Medova v.

Geographically, the risk was located at the border between Ingushetia and North Ossetia, more specifically in the forested area of the Malgobek District in Ingushetia, where the movement and gathering of the illegal armed group had been recorded, and the adjoining areas in North Ossetia, including the Pravoberezhny District. The nature of the threat was described as a terrorist attack involving hostage-taking of a civilian object. Several documents issued after 25 August 2004 linked the attack with the opening of the academic year and the Day of Knowledge \u2013 1 September, when every school holds a celebratory gathering of all pupils and staff and where many parents and visitors are present. The threat was considered imminent enough to put the local security forces on high alert. On the strength of the above warning, the North Ossetian and Ingushetian Ministries of the Interior ordered the local police to undertake preventive measures. These included provisions for tracking and checking suspicious looking people and vehicles, blocking secondary roads to avoid unsupervised passage between the two republics, warning the local authorities and the school administrators, taking special measures to protect educational facilities, establishing clear communication channels and preparing contingency plans in case of emergency (see paragraphs 16-18, 132, 291-292, 364-365, 401 above).",

In June 1995 a group of terrorists under the command of Shamil Basayev captured over 1,500\u00a0people in a hospital in Budennovsk in the Stavropol Region; in January 1996 a group headed by Salman Raduyev seized, among other targets, a maternity ward with patients and staff in Kizlyar, Dagestan; and in October 2002 a group under the leadership of Movsar Barayev took hold of a theatre in Moscow with over 800 people during a popular youth show.

The monitoring of vehicles through security checks had been organised on the roads crossing the administrative border between the two republics, although it was later acknowledged that the local police had insufficient resources to ensure a constant inspection that would be commensurate with the threat (see paragraphs 291, 334, 375 above). As a result of these gaps in security, at a relatively busy time in the morning, over thirty armed terrorists unimpededly covered a distance of at least 35 kilometres from the administrative border in Khurikau to Beslan. They also had no problems entering the district centre with a population of about 35,000 \u2013 the largest town in the vicinity \u2013 and arriving in the centre where the school no. 1 was located.

It appears that the security arrangement at the school was not heightened, but was reduced even in comparison to the usual standards (see paragraphs 21, 279, 284).

There is no information that any warning was given to the civilian authorities or the school administration.

The Court finds that despite a foreseeable threat to life there was no discernible effort to set up some sort of command centre that could carry out its evaluation and containment. It is unclear, for example, whether the insufficient resources for road security at local level were taken into account at regional level, since there is no information about the involvement in the preventive security measures of the North Ossetia operational management group tasked with counter-terrorist activities (see paragraph 312 above).",

The intelligence information likened the threat to major attacks undertaken in the past by the Chechen separatists, which had resulted in heavy casualties. A threat of this kind clearly indicated a real and immediate risk to the lives of the potential target population, including a vulnerable group of schoolchildren and their entourage who would be at the Day of Knowledge celebrations in the area. The authorities had a sufficient level of control over the situation and could be expected to undertake any measures within their powers that could reasonably be expected to avoid, or at least mitigate this risk. Although some measures were taken, in general the preventive measures in the present case could be characterised as inadequate. The terrorists were able to successfully gather, prepare, travel to and seize their target, without encountering any preventive security arrangements. No single sufficiently high-level structure was responsible for the handling of the situation, evaluating and allocating resources, creating a defence for the vulnerable target group and ensuring effective containment of the threat and communication with the field teams.",

This is especially so in respect of counter-terrorist activity, where the authorities often face organised and highly secretive networks, whose members are prepared to inflict maximum damage to civilians, even at the cost of their own lives. In the face of an urgent need to avert serious adverse consequences, whether the authorities choose to use a passive approach of ensuring security of the potential targets or more active intervention to disrupt the menace, is a question of tactical choice. However, such measures should be able, when judged reasonably, to prevent or minimise the known risk.

The Court has already acknowledged the difficulties faced by the Russian authorities in this case. Nevertheless, it reiterates that as this was a situation of violent loss of life, once the identifications had been carried out, individual and more conclusive scrutiny about its causes should have been one of the crucial tasks of the investigation. Where the exact causes of deaths were not established with precision, the investigation failed to provide an objective ground for the analysis of the use of lethal force by the State agents.

The quality of the forensic work at the site is further undermined by the claims made by the victims\u2019 relatives that they had found many potentially important pieces of evidence and the hostages\u2019 personal belongings at the town rubbish dump; it was also asserted that the one video tape filmed by the terrorists inside the building during Mr Aushev\u2019s visit on 2 September and depicting them and their leader had been found by local residents among the rubble removed from the site (see paragraphs 101-102, 428 above).

The documents showed that during the operation the army and internal troops personnel had used at least 7,000 cartridges for automatic and machine guns, over 2,000 tracer bullets, ten disposable anti-tank rocket launchers, 18\u00a0anti-tank charges for reloadable grenade launchers, eight high-fragmentation warheads for a tank cannon and ninety smoke grenades (see the \u201cjoint record\u201d of 10\u00a0September 2004 and other relevant evidence cited in paragraph\u00a0219). In addition, an unclear amount of powerful thermobaric flame-throwers (RPO\u2013A Shmel) were used (see two separate expert reports that listed twelve RPO\u2013A spent tubes with individual batch and serial numbers, paragraph 209; see also information about the use of five devices with different batch numbers in paragraph 210). Other documents referred, in addition, to 450 armour-piercing incendiary cartridges for large-calibre machine guns and ten hand grenades (see separate act on the use of weapons, paragraph 206 above). The explosions expert report dating from September 2007 added to this already impressive list an unspecified number of other modifications of anti-tank and grenade launchers, as well as propelled attack grenades with a thermobaric warhead (RShG\u20131) and light infantry flame\u2013throwers with a thermobaric charge (LPO\u201397), the use of which was marked as \u201cprobable\u201d, even though over forty spent charges had been found at the site (see paragraphs 211 and 226 above). The parties disagreed whether the investigation had been able to establish the circumstances of use of these weapons and ammunition, particularly weapons that could be characterised as indiscriminate, and to clarify the possible causal link between the use of lethal force and the casualties among the hostages.",

Information about the quantity of the weapons used and the units that had used them is scattered throughout different proceedings and disjointed documents. The \u201cjoint record\u201d of 10 September 2004, although cited in several subsequent documents, such as the fire expert\u2019s report of\u00a022\u00a0December 2005, does not take into account one of the most powerful weapons used \u2013 the Shmel flame-throwers. Nor does it appear to tally with another record, of 9 September, which named different types of charges and explosives used. The comprehensive forensic report on explosions completed in September 2007 failed to indicate the quantity of the charges used, and was not certain about the use of light infantry flame-throwers with a thermobaric charge, despite over forty spent capsules specific to that weapon being found. Neither the quantity nor provenance of the Shmel flame\u2013throwers used was listed in any single document (see paragraphs 210, 211 and 219 above). The same is true for the use of other explosive and armour\u2013piercing weapons, including various modifications of grenade launchers (reloadable and dispensable), numerous and inconsistent references to which are scattered throughout a multitude of documents. This failure is difficult to explain in view of the availability of extensive information concerning the batch and individual numbers recorded for many such weapons (see paragraphs 209, 214-216 above). The absence of a complete record of the weapons and ammunition used by the State agents effectively precluded the investigation from undertaking a meaningful evaluation of the adequacy and proportionality aspects of the use of force.",

The Court remarks that, on the one hand, these witnesses provided accounts of the use of powerful indiscriminate weapons soon after the first explosions, while the military and security officials denied their use prior to 6 p.m. when, allegedly, no hostages remained in the building (see paragraphs 207, 220, 306 and 323 above). In order to resolve that contradiction, the investigators should have first established with some precision the types and amount of weapons used, as well as the time, targets and people who had used them and then matched this information with the objective data about the casualties and impact traces. As the Court has already noted, the absence of an inventory of the weapons used virtually precluded any progress in this respect. For example, the fire expert report confirmed that indiscriminate Shmel flame\u2013throwers had been used upon the building, but not upon the hostages, and their use could not have harmed them (see paragraph 220 above).

In the Court\u2019s view, this evidence was not fully assessed by the investigation. The lack of objective and impartial information about the use of such weapons constituted a major failure by the investigation to clarify this key aspect of the events and to create a ground for drawing conclusions about the authorities\u2019 actions in general and individual responsibility. Other failures included the absence of detailed information about the location of the hostages\u2019 bodies, failure to establish the causes of death of at least one third of the victims and gaps in collecting and securing other relevant forensic evidence, as described above. In view of these considerations, the Court cannot accept as tenable the investigation\u2019s conclusion that no one among the hostages was injured or killed by the lethal force used by the State agents (see, for example, paragraph 233 above).",

The first decision was adopted by a military prosecutor in Vladikavkaz on 3 December 2004 (see paragraphs 229 et seq. above) and concerned the unnamed personnel of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior. This document preceded most of the crucial investigative steps, including expert report no.1 and the expert reports on fire, ballistics and explosions. It contained hardly any details about the weapons used and their potential or actual impact, and failed to match that with the recorded injuries and causes of death. Even though this document was later set aside, this line of inquiry did not seem to have progressed over the years when the investigation remained pending. Similar conclusions were reached on 20\u00a0April 2006 in respect of the head and members of the OH who had led the rescue operation (see paragraph 239 above). The Court finds unconvincing the assumption that the use of a massive amount of indiscriminate lethal force by the servicemen resulted in the terrorists\u2019 elimination, but at the same time caused no harm to any of the hostages in the same building, which was retained throughout the investigation without much critical analysis (see paragraph 254 above).",

Coupled with incomplete forensic evidence on the causes of death and injuries, deficiencies in the steps to secure and collect the relevant evidence from the site, any conclusions reached about the criminal responsibility of the State agents in this respect are without objective grounds and are thus inadequate.",

It was delivered in January 2007 and contained an all-encompassing overview of the relevant evidence available by that time, completed with analytical and research material that served to disprove his propositions. The experts confirmed the investigation\u2019s initial conclusion about the origins of the first explosions lying in the IEDs placed by the terrorists. They also excluded the possibility that the projectiles launched from the locations suggested by Mr\u00a0Savelyev could have led to the consequences he had implied (see paragraph 226 above). An additional report, produced in October 2007, also examined the available evidence and confirmed the above results (see paragraph 227).

Certain conclusions are difficult to reconcile, for example where the reports indicated the different places and yield of the first explosions (see paragraphs 139, 221, 223 and 226 above). This incoherence on one of the most important aspects of the events makes the investigation\u2019s unconditional reliance on them questionable. Where allegations are made against security and military servicemen, the element of public scrutiny plays a special role, and if the investigation bases its conclusions on confidential documents prepared by the staff of the same agencies that could be held liable, it risks undermining public confidence in the independence and effectiveness of the investigation and gives the appearance of collusion in, or tolerance of, unlawful acts.",

Firstly, they criticised the functioning of the OH, saying that there had been serious delays in its formal establishment, its command and decision-making. They referred to the counter-terrorist expert report which had formulated some very critical conclusions about a lack of structure and unclear key decision-making process (see paragraphs 436 et seq. above). They further highlighted the failure to secure the perimeter of the operation, confirm the number of hostages and communicate it early enough to the relevant services, make senior people available for negotiation, coordinate or plan a rescue operation and ensure some sort of recording of the orders, decisions, appointments and other relevant information for future evaluation. The OH had also failed in the planning of the rescue operation in its assessment of appropriate weapons to be chosen and used. They condemned the fact that, despite the likelihood of a high number of casualties and the difficulties presented by the weather, no one appeared to have considered a plan for a mortuary, refrigeration or other storage provisions for the bodies, or for autopsy tables with sufficient specialists. With respect to the provision of fire services, the applicants believed that there appeared to have been no clear lines of command, communication or coordination between the OH, Emercom and the personnel directly responsible for fire services. As specific examples of the failures to plan accordingly, the applicants pointed to the following: despite having had more than two days to prepare and the high probability of fire resulting from explosions, no fire engines had been deployed on standby in the vicinity of the school; the firefighters had not been provided with protective bulletproof vests or military helmets, nor had any other measures provided for by the relevant manuals applicable to the extinguishing of fires in dangerous conditions been implemented, particularly at sites containing explosive materials; the positioning and availability of water sources had not been determined in advance; owing to the same lack of coordination the Ministry of the Interior had not undertaken efforts to clear the route to the school, which had remained blocked by cars and people on 3 September, obstructing and delaying the emergency access of fire engines to the site; there had been a shortage of water and delays in laying down water hoses because of a failure to attach connecting parts; and the number of fire engines deployed had been seriously inadequate. In any event, the firefighters had been deployed too late to save anyone in the gymnasium.",

The decision had then stated that the two-hour delay between the call for the firemen to intervene and the time when they had done so had been the result of an absence of protective gear, which could have put the firemen in a life-threatening situation. In addition, on 20\u00a0April\u00a02006 the investigation had decided not to open criminal proceedings in respect of Colonel Romanov and Mr Kharkov, the head of the fire service of the Pravoberezhny District, since in expert report no. 1 and the technical fire expert\u2019s report there had been no grounds for concluding that their actions had contained the constituent elements of the offence of professional negligence (see paragraph 240 above).

In particular, it is necessary to examine whether the operation was planned and controlled by the authorities so as to minimise, to the greatest extent possible, recourse to lethal force. The authorities must take appropriate care to ensure that any risk to life is minimised. The Court must also examine whether the authorities were not negligent in their choice of action.

Normally, the planning and conduct of the rescue operation can be subjected to a heightened scrutiny. In doing so, the Court has taken into account the following factors: (i) whether the operation was spontaneous or whether the authorities could have reflected on the situation and made specific preparations; (ii) whether the authorities were in a position to rely on some generally prepared emergency plan, not related to that particular crisis; (iii) the fact that the degree of control of the situation was higher outside the building, where most of the rescue efforts took place; and (iv) that the more predictable a hazard, the greater the obligation was to protect against it (ibid., \u00a7 243).",

The health services were not informed by the OH of the number of hostages, which was three times higher than the officially announced figure. Mr Goncharov obtained this information personally from Mr Aushev on the evening of\u00a02\u00a0September and only after that took steps to arrange for sufficient medical resources (see paragraph 335 above). No plan for a rescue operation, however general, was prepared and communicated to the responsible services until two and a half days after the unfolding of the crisis (see, for example, paragraphs 322 and 323 above). No sufficient provisions were made for forensic work, body storage and autopsy equipment, which later contributed to difficulties with identifications and prevented the circumstances of the victims\u2019 deaths from being fully established. Lack of responsibility and coordination on the part of the OH was identified and criticised in the North Ossetian Parliament\u2019s report, and, to some extent, in the Duma\u2019s report (see paragraphs 376 et seq., and 401 above).",

This body should be responsible for collecting and distributing information, choosing negotiation strategies and partners and working out the possible outcomes, including the possibility of a storming and its consequences. It is therefore striking to see that the majority of the members of the body tasked precisely with those questions were effectively excluded from any discussions or decision-making processes. The absence of any records, however concise, of the OH meetings and decisions adopted, highlight the appearance of a void of formal responsibility for the planning and control of the operation, as the situation developed. The subsequent domestic proceedings were unable to fill in this void, and it is still unclear when and how the most important decisions had been taken and communicated with the principal partners, and who had taken them. It is also undisputed that the organisation of the OH had been entirely under the authorities\u2019 control, that it should have relied on the pre-existing legislative and operational framework provided for such situations, and that the magnitude of the threat commanded that the maximum available State resources be mobilised.",

In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained may also be taken into account. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0181, with further references). The Court further reiterates in this connection that, in all cases where it is unable to establish the exact circumstances of a case for reasons objectively attributable to the State authorities, it is for the respondent Government to explain, in a satisfactory and convincing manner, the sequence of events and to exhibit solid evidence that can refute the applicant\u2019s allegations (see Mansuro\u011flu v. Turkey, no.\u00a043443/98, \u00a7 80, 26 February 2008, with further references). The Court has also noted the difficulties for applicants to obtain the necessary evidence in support of allegations in cases where the respondent Government are in possession of the relevant documentation and fail to submit it. If the authorities then fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the Court to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation, strong inferences may be drawn (see Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7 184, ECHR 2009, with further references). The Court\u2019s reliance on evidence obtained as a result of the domestic investigation and on the facts established within the domestic proceedings will largely depend on the quality of the domestic investigative process, its thoroughness and consistency (see Finogenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0238, with further references).",

Furthermore, a Contracting State\u2019s obligation under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible in cases of fatal assault might be rendered illusory if, in respect of complaints under those Articles, an applicant were required to exhaust an action leading only to an award of damages (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0122).",

In such circumstances, where a criminal investigation into a lethal attack has been ineffective and the effectiveness of any other remedy that might have existed, including the civil remedies suggested by the Government, has consequently been undermined, the State would fail in its obligation under Article 13 of the Convention (see Khashiyev and Akayeva, \u00a7 183, and Isayeva, \u00a7 229, both cited above).",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the authority referred to in Article 13 may not necessarily in all instances be a judicial authority in the strict sense.

The amounts of compensation varied depending on the individual circumstances, but they were extended to all victims of the terrorist attack of 1 to 3 September 2004. The Court has already noted that it is impossible to speculate on the exact circumstances of the victims\u2019 individual deaths and injuries. Given that the situation arose from a terrorist attack and led to numerous casualties, the authorities\u2019 choice to allocate compensation on the basis of the degree of damage suffered, regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation, appears to be victim-based and thus justified. The Court also notes that the victims were granted procedural status in the criminal trial of Mr Kulayev, where civil damages could be sought. The Court acknowledges the different nature of the awards, but considers that any awards to the victims should take into account the overall situation and the compensation allocated under the no-fault scheme.

It is true that the violations found above in respect of the respondent State, such as the failure to minimise the risks of the known danger to life, to plan and control the operation with the aim of minimising accidental harm to civilians and the use of indiscriminate weapons in breach of Article 2, were not properly elucidated within the framework of the criminal proceedings, notably case no.\u00a020/849. At the same time, neither Article 13 nor any other provision of the Convention guarantees an applicant a right to secure the prosecution and conviction of a third party or a right to \u201cprivate revenge\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Perez v. France ([GC], no.\u00a047287/99, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, ECHR 2004I). What appears to be of special importance under Article 13, apart from the compensation mechanisms, is access to information and thus the establishment of truth for the victims of the violations alleged, as well as ensuring justice and preventing impunity for the perpetrators. Access to information and the effectiveness of any ensuing remedies are interlinked, as at the heart of a complaint under Article 13 lies the applicant\u2019s inability \u201cto use any remedy available to him for obtaining relief, given that the knowledge necessary to elucidate facts ... is often in the sole hands of State officials or authorities\u201d (see \u00d6neryildiz, cited above).",

It notes the nuanced examination by the North Ossetian commission of questions on prevention of the terrorist act, the functioning of the OH, the actions of the security forces and detailed statistical information about the victims and fighters (see paragraphs 374 et seq. above). The Federal Assembly commission obtained first-hand testimonies from the most senior officials involved, and formulated its own conclusions, some directly relevant to the applicants\u2019 complaints (see paragraphs 398-401 above), as well a number of general measures to be taken. Lastly, a major effort to elucidate the minutiae about the use of force and other questions was undertaken by a member of the State Duma, Mr\u00a0Savelyev, himself an expert in explosions and ballistics (see paragraphs 402 et seq. above). This ensured access by the applicants, and the public in general, to knowledge about the aspects of the serious human rights violations that would have otherwise remained inaccessible. In this sense, their work could be regarded as an aspect of effective remedies aimed at establishing the knowledge necessary to elucidate the facts, distinct from the State\u2019s procedural obligations under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention.",

The Court points out that, in the context of the execution of judgments in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, a judgment in which it finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation under that provision to put an end to the breach and make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach. If, on the other hand, national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a violation of the Convention or its Protocols imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to make all feasible reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach (see Assanidze v.

In the Court\u2019s view, the above found violations should be addressed by a variety of both individual and general measures consisting of appropriate responses by the State institutions, aimed at drawing lessons from the past, raising awareness of the applicable legal and operational standards and deterring new violations of a similar nature. Such measures could include further recourse to non-judicial means of collecting information and establishing the truth, public acknowledgement and condemnation of violations of the right to life in the course of security operations, and greater dissemination of information and better training for police, military and security personnel in order to ensure strict compliance with the relevant international legal standards (see Abakarova, cited above, \u00a7 112). The prevention of similar violations in the future should also be addressed in the appropriate legal framework, in particular ensuring that the national legal instruments pertaining to large-scale security operations and the mechanisms governing cooperation between military, security and civilian authorities in such situations are adequate, as well as clearly formulating the rules governing the principles and constraints of the use of lethal force during security operations, reflecting the applicable international standards (see paragraphs\u00a0598-599 above).",

The terrorists had been much better prepared and were more resistant to releasing the hostages than in the Nord-Ost theatre in Moscow two years earlier (see Finogenov and Others v. Russia, nos. 18299/03 and 27311/03, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). It was the last attack on such a massive scale.

The present case is very different because it is impossible to pinpoint any action taken by the authorities which could have been planned in advance and subsequently controlled, especially during the first few hours after a series of explosions, apart from the organisation of medical assistance for surviving hostages, but this issue lies outside the scope of the complaints in the present case.",

In support of this conclusion, the majority referred, in particular, to the absence of any records of the OH meetings and decisions adopted which made it impossible to understand how the most important decisions had been taken and communicated with the principal partners (see paragraph 570).

It was established that before the explosions all the hostages had been concentrated in the gymnasium, where deaths were caused by three explosions, fire, destruction of the roof and gunfire from the terrorists.

Also, the records of the site examinations and video material showed that no dead hostages had been found in the places where the terrorists had been killed by heavy arms and indiscriminate weapons (see paragraph 142).",

We would suggest that this issue is much more complex, as it requires detailed assessment of the concrete circumstances of the situation which may include, in particular: the total arsenal of weapons belonging to and used by the terrorists, the safety of their positions during the storming operation, difficulties with the identification of hostages during the storming operation, possibility of coordinated gunfire minimising the threat to hostages, and the proportion of losses (dead and injured) among the State agents and the terrorists.",

Therefore, apart from the danger presented by the terrorists, the commanders had to consider the lives of over 1,000 people held by them, including hundreds of children. The hostages, who had been left exhausted by more than fifty hours of detention in stressful conditions, without access to food or water, clearly constituted a vulnerable group (see paragraph 607).",

However, the Charlie agents were not prosecuted, and the Court did not find that the agents were obliged to carry out such verification as a part of the security operation.

The rhetoric of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d does not yet permeate the interpretation of Article 2 of the Convention, as it has done with the interpretation of Article 5. Second, this judgment innovates, in so far as a positive obligation to prevent terrorist acts has been acknowledged in certain circumstances.
