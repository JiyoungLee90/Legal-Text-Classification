The prosecutor also heard witnesses, including the applicant's neighbour N.U., who testified that he had seen the applicant in front of the house being pulled by two policemen and then kicked once by each of them. He could not see what happened when the applicant was being placed in the police van. The applicant's mother-in- law, S.S., also testified that she had seen the applicant being hit on the head by police officers, strangled and kicked. The prosecutor also heard employees of the sobering-up centre, who confirmed that the applicant had been behaving aggressively. The police officers who took part in the intervention denied kicking the applicant and submitted that the physical force used against the applicant had been necessary, taking into account his aggressive behaviour.",

What is more, an expert opinion was produced in the context of the investigation into the\u00a0applicant's allegations of ill-treatment on 23 December 2002 (see\u00a0paragraph 24 above). It is to be noted that the prosecutor failed to give reasons as to why he had not found the testimonies given by the applicant's family and neighbour to be credible and the case had to be returned twice for further examination (see paragraphs 26 and 29 above). In the decision of 27\u00a0February 2004, which was appealed against but eventually upheld by the Regional Prosecutor (see paragraph 30 above), the prosecutor likewise failed to explain convincingly the reasons for accepting the version of\u00a0events given by the police officers. The prosecuting authorities accepted the statements of the police without taking any note of the fact that they had obviously had an interest in the outcome of the case and in exonerating themselves.

In the Court's view, the domestic court did not give sufficient consideration to the statements given by the applicant's mother-in-law. In particular, the police officers' version according to which the applicant's mother-in-law had remained in her room and had not seen the intervention was not convincingly corroborated. The Court considers that this circumstance was crucial for establishing the course of events in the applicant's apartment. Nor does the Court find convincing the reason for not hearing the evidence of the applicant's mother-in-law, namely her speech impediment. Her\u00a0testimony was of obvious relevance and measures could have been taken to allow her to provide her account of the incident.
