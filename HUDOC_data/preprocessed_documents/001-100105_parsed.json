In particular, the Court observes that the detention order of 14 October 2003 did not set any time-limit for the applicant's detention. Under the provisions governing the general terms of detention (Article 108 of the CCP), the time-limit for detention pending investigation was fixed at two months. A judge could extend that period to up to six months. Further extensions could only be granted by a judge if the person had been charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences. However, upon the expiry of the maximum initial two-month detention period (Article 109 \u00a7 1 of the CCP), no extension was granted by a court in the present case. The applicant was in detention pending extradition for more than one year, at least until 29\u00a0July 2004, when the extradition order against him was finalised by the Supreme Court. During that period, no requests were lodged for his detention to be extended. Thus, the national system has failed to protect the applicant from arbitrary detention, and his detention cannot be considered \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. In these circumstances, the Court does not need to separately consider whether the extradition proceedings were conducted with due diligence.",
