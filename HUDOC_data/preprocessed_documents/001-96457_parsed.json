The court pointed out that the applicant\u2019s sentence was due to run until 27 May 2019 and that his criminal record mentioned another conviction for sexual abuse of a minor under the age of 15 by a person in authority (a sentence of six years\u2019 imprisonment and a judicial and social supervision order imposed by the Nancy Court of Appeal on 29 August 2002 for sexual assault of a minor). The court also took into consideration medical reports according to which the applicant suffered from congenital heart disease which made any physical activity impossible. The report advocated his placement under an enhanced prison regime with an individual cell, no exercise or physical activity, a salt-free diet and regular medication. The court also referred to a psychiatric expert report from November 2004 according to which the applicant\u2019s psychological development \u201cappears very limited in so far as he has failed to reflect on his own conduct. He has expressed no feelings of guilt or responsibility for the offences which he denies committing.

Nevertheless, they argued that the measure complained of did not constitute a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7. They sought to demonstrate this by referring to the criteria established by the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular in Welch v. the United Kingdom (9 February 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 307A) and Jamil v.\u00a0France (8 June 1995, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 317B). While the Court had found, in Jamil, that imprisonment in default was a penalty, on the ground that \u201c[t]he sanction imposed on Mr Jamil was ordered by a criminal court, was intended to be deterrent and could have led to a punitive deprivation of liberty\u201d (\u00a7 32), it had also ruled that special supervision was not comparable to a criminal sanction since it was designed to prevent the commission of offences (they referred to Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 43, Series\u00a0A no. 281A). In the Government\u2019s submission, that was precisely the aim of security measures including placement on the Sex Offenders Register. They could be defined as social protection measures designed to prevent persons from reoffending or to remove a source of danger. They were based not on the offender\u2019s guilt but on the danger he or she represented. Hence, placement on the Sex Offenders Register was carried out \u201cas a security measure\u201d (Article 706-53-5 of the CCP) and was not a sanction. Point 4 of Article 706-53-2 of the CCP provided for a person\u2019s details to be entered in the register even where a decision had been given discontinuing the proceedings or discharging or acquitting the person concerned on the basis of the first paragraph of Article 122-1 of the Criminal Code, according to which \u201cpersons who, at the time of the offence, were suffering from a psychiatric or neuropsychiatric disorder which deprived them of the ability to discern or control their actions [were] not criminally liable\u201d.",

In their view, the establishment of the Sex Offenders Register was part of the gradual introduction of a specific set of rules governing sexual offences, which was justified by the comparatively recent increase in awareness concerning the special character of such offences. The latter stemmed from the fact that these offenders often had personality disorders, which were a real factor in reoffending, and from the particular suffering caused to the victims, especially if they were minors at the time of the offence. Hence, the national authorities had put in place a combination of punitive and preventive measures. The establishment of the Sex Offenders Register in that connection had been aimed at filling gaps in the system of prevention in relation to the particularly serious category of sexual offences. The Government added that it was clear from the Court\u2019s case-law that the Court did not dispute States\u2019 right, in seeking to prevent offending, to gather and store personal data provided that \u201cthere exist[ed] adequate and effective guarantees against abuse\u201d (they referred to Leander v.

In line with its findings in S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos.\u00a030562/04 and 30566/04, \u00a7 103, ECHR 2008), the Court is of the view that the need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should notably ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored and that they are preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above, in particular Article 5 of the Data Protection Convention and the Preamble thereto and Principle 7 of Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector).
