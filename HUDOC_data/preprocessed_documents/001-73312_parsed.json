They noted his pride, his taste for publicity and his need for a sense of self-worth. They referred to the substantial administrative file on Lucien L\u00e9ger, whose time in custodial establishments had been highly eventful. The two experts emphasised that Lucien L\u00e9ger was very keen to publish his version of events. This, they concluded, was likely to cause a quite considerable scandal. His release risked causing a significant disturbance to public order, and they believed that it could give rise to fears of a publicity stunt.",

Dr Denis Cayet concluded from this that Lucien L\u00e9ger had scarcely changed since the assessment by Dr Follin and Dr\u00a0Roumajon, finding him to be just as combative, prone to look for hidden meaning, and seemingly determined to assert in future, by any possible means, what he considered to be his justification and the expression of the truth.",

In Croatia, the most severe sanction is a sentence from 20 to 40 years that may only be imposed exceptionally. Conditional release may be granted after one-half, exceptionally one-third, of the sentence has been served. Three persons were sentenced to exceptionally long-term imprisonment between 1998 and 2001. In Norway, the most severe sanction is a determinate sentence of imprisonment for 21 years. Conditional release is possible after 12 years has been served. In Portugal, the maximum prison sentence is for 25 years, exceptionally for 30 years. Slovenian legislation provides for a maximum of 30 years but such a sentence has never been imposed to date. Prisoners serving more than 15 years may be conditionally released after three-quarters of the sentence has been served. In Spain the maximum sentence is imprisonment for 30 years. In Iceland, the legislation provides for life sentences but no such sentence has been imposed since 1940.\u201d",

In western Europe this increase was linked to the growing number of convicted persons and the decreasing number of prisoners being released. These phenomena were combined with tougher policies on certain crimes in respect of which conditional release was granted under very restrictive conditions (for example, sexual, violent or drug-related offences). In central and eastern Europe the considerable number of long-term and life-sentence prisoners was attributable not only to the imposition of long sentences but also to the abolition of the death penalty.",

As regards the psychiatric reports, although the one issued in 1999 had concluded that there were no formal obstacles to the applicant\u2019s release, the 1997 report had stated that \u201c[the applicant\u2019s] personality appears to have changed little since his initial incarceration, with paranoid traits persisting\u201d and that \u201cthe complexity of his personality means that it cannot be ruled out that he might pose some form of danger in the community\u201d. All the expert reports had been included in the file on the applicant and the judges dealing with his case had been required to take into account all the evidence before them, whether or not it supported his release. The Government added that even the least unfavourable reports had expressed reservations, referring to the 1999 report which had stated that the eventuality of a surge of paranoia could not be entirely excluded. In emphasising that the experts had not ruled out his potential dangerousness, the Regional Parole Court had taken note of the reservations that emerged from the various findings; it could not therefore be said to have made an unreasonable assessment in the proper sense of the term. The same was true, the Government argued, in relation to the need for psychological counselling, which the applicant had never shown any interest in undergoing. As regards the applicant\u2019s attitude in relation to the offence, the Government disputed his argument that the courts had punished him for seeking to protest his innocence. They stressed that whether there had been a confession or a denial was not relevant as such; the important factor was what such a statement revealed about the prisoner\u2019s personality. In the case of very serious offences, denials often indicated an absence of self-analysis by the individual in relation to the acts of which he or she had been found guilty, and the significance of such a lack of self-criticism was clearly crucial in a context in which personality traits were of paramount importance. As a result, they argued, the fact that a convicted person\u2019s denials were taken into account in a decision to refuse his release on licence did not mean that the judge was punishing his failure to confess. The judge was simply drawing inferences from the person\u2019s failure to change. Prisoners were in no way prohibited from protesting their innocence and could avail themselves of a specific procedure to that end, namely an application for a retrial.",

The arguments relating to the psychiatric reports and the applicant\u2019s conduct were directly linked to his initial conviction, seeing that the serious offence of which he had been convicted had warranted attaching priority to his psychological profile and his development while in prison. Furthermore, the emphasis placed on the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s plans for employment had been justified by the need to provide him with an environment in which he would not reoffend. Such an approach reflected the concern expressed by the Assize Court, which had been anxious to protect society from potential offences by the applicant.

The Assize Court convicted him of murder in 1964. It found that the offence could not be characterised as premeditated murder and that there were mitigating circumstances. The applicant was accordingly not sentenced to death but to life imprisonment. The law in force at the time did not provide for a minimum term that had to be served before life prisoners became eligible for parole. Lastly, since retracting his initial confession, the applicant has continually maintained his innocence. He applied for a retrial in 1971 and 1974, unsuccessfully on both occasions.",

In other words, a person who was detained lawfully can, as circumstances change over time, become a person whose continued detention is unlawful (see, mutatis mutandis, in relation to a person of unsound mind, Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, judgment of 24\u00a0June 1982, Series A no. 50; see also Weeks v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114, and, more recently, the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment in Stafford v. the United Kingdom, no. 46295/99, ECHR 2002-IV).

The Court\u2019s case-law is suspicious about the exercise of such power by a member of the executive (see the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgments of 16\u00a0December 1999 in T. and V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 24724/94 and 24888/94, ECHR 1999-IX). But the counter-argument does not apply here because, as is pointed out in paragraph 65 of the judgment, the applicant considered his continued detention to be arbitrary specifically on account of the refusal of his application for release by the specialist courts dealing with post-sentencing measures, which were assigned jurisdiction by virtue of the Law of 15 June 2000 (amended in this respect by the Law of 9\u00a0March 2004).",

Secondly, the reasons given by the courts can easily become stereotyped or irrelevant and must therefore be reviewed, as in the case of continued pre-trial detention (see, for an early example, Neumeister v. Austria, judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, and the subsequent settled case-law). Admittedly, the Court is even more demanding when it comes to pre-trial detention \u2013 because of the presumption of innocence \u2013 but it is becoming increasingly so in relation to continued detention (or, indeed, decisions to re-detain), as is shown by the Stafford judgment cited above.",

However, this is in no way the approach taken by the respondent State, either in its domestic law, since parole has existed in France for well over a century, or in the practice it applied in the present case, since the applicant\u2019s applications for release on licence were always examined by the relevant authorities in turn and were refused on various grounds but never on the ground that the applicant had no such right \u2013 parole differs in this respect from the granting of a presidential pardon \u2013 or, lastly, in its written and oral submissions before the Court. Should the Court then of its own motion construct a theory to the effect that decisions on parole are both discretionary and unreviewable? I would be reluctant to do so, not only because there are already instruments laying down procedures and criteria for granting or refusing release (the fact that no such right exists means only that it will not automatically be granted to anyone who requests it, and not that it can be refused arbitrarily), but also because the right to liberty is too essential for our Court to make \u201creal\u201d life imprisonment an automatic and unreviewable process. I would add, lastly, that if the purpose of the legislation was to increase the role of the courts in dealing with applications for release, it would be ludicrous for the European Court of Human Rights to fly in the face of this trend by refusing to review the relevance, adequacy and lack of arbitrariness of the grounds on which the appropriate courts\u2019 decisions were based.",

I would first point out that the 1999 expert report was generally in favour of the applicant\u2019s release, that the opinion of 7 February 2000 by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences was clearly in favour, and that in February 2001 the sentence enforcement board gave a unanimous opinion in favour of granting his application for release on licence.

Article 729 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force at the time, referred only to serious efforts to readjust to society; however, the first-instance court considered that the applicant\u2019s refusal to undergo psychological counselling invalidated any such efforts, whereas the appellate court accepted the validity of his efforts but refused to take them into account for commercial law-related reasons which were quite unjustified in the view of the people who were prepared to assist the applicant\u2019s reintegration. Lastly, if those grounds had been reasonable in 2001, why were they dismissed in 2005? Because the applicant\u2019s release on licence, deemed unadvisable after thirty-seven years of imprisonment, had become necessary after forty-one years, apparently without any new circumstances arising in the meantime?

But as was observed by the judges who allowed the applicant\u2019s application in 2005, this risk was limited, and \u201ca zero risk of reoffending is so rare\u201d. In my opinion, there is unfortunately no such thing as zero risk, but if we take that approach, then we should never release prisoners on licence: life sentences would always be served for a whole-life term, and determinate sentences would always be served in full. Potential victims would perhaps be better protected (except where prisoners escaped) \u2013 but would transforming prisoners into wild beasts or human waste not mean creating further victims and substituting vengeance for justice?",

Should the mere fact that the experts are unable to exclude with 100% certainty the risk of reoffending be sufficient to justify refusing to adjust a convicted person\u2019s sentence in any way at all after forty years of imprisonment? As the  rightly pointed out in 2005, a refusal of the applicant\u2019s application for release on licence would have amounted to \u201chis virtually permanent exclusion from society, which does not seem justified in view of his resettlement plan and the limited nature of the risk of his reoffending\u201d (ibid.).",

What was at stake in the present case was the \u201clawfulness\u201d of his detention \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, and more specifically his continued detention after four decades of incarceration. In this connection, I find it regrettable that the majority did not place more emphasis on the autonomous meaning of the concept of detention after conviction. Looking beyond appearances, the Court has always held that the \u201clawfulness\u201d required by the Convention presupposes not only conformity with domestic law but also, as confirmed by Article 18, conformity with the purposes of the deprivation of liberty permitted by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, pp. 17-18, \u00a7 39, and Stafford, cited above, \u00a7 64); it is required in respect of both the ordering and the execution of the measures involving deprivation of liberty. Furthermore, in other circumstances the Court has held that the causal link between conviction and detention might be broken if a decision not to release were based on grounds that had no connection with the objectives of the legislature or the relevant court or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives (see paragraph 71 of the judgment). Prison sentences are intended not only to protect society and punish offenders but also to prepare them for resettlement (see the decision of the Constitutional Council cited in paragraph 59 of the judgment), and Article 729 \u00a7 1 expressly provides that parole is designed to encourage the rehabilitation of convicted prisoners. Recommendation Rec(2003)22 of the Committee of Ministers on conditional release states that \u201cconditional release is one of the most effective and constructive means of preventing reoffending and promoting resettlement, providing the prisoner with planned, assisted and supervised reintegration into the community\u201d. The question is therefore whether the national courts took the aim of reintegration sufficiently into account when examining Mr L\u00e9ger\u2019s application for release on licence in 2001, by which time he had been deprived of his liberty for more than thirty-five years, and if not, whether his detention became arbitrary as a result.",

That factor is clearly apparent in the decision by the Regional Parole Court (see paragraph 27 of the judgment) and, more insidiously, in the decision on appeal (see paragraph 30). It was mentioned in conjunction with Mr L\u00e9ger\u2019s dangerousness, which was not completely ruled out, and his unwillingness to undergo psychological counselling, which was held to be the cause of this continuing risk. These two grounds made it impossible to conclude that the applicant was making \u201cserious efforts to readjust to society\u201d as required by Article 729 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP). It is clear to me that the national authorities are better placed than an international court to assess whether this criterion is satisfied in a particular case; I shall not therefore enter into a discussion of this point.
