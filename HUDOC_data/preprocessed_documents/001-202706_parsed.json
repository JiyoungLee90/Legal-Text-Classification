In this context he took into account, inter alia, the nature and seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant, in particular the armed robbery of 21 October 2011 (see paragraph 11 above). The Deputy Minister further had regard to the fact that the applicant had been born in the Netherlands and had always lived there. It was noted that, although the applicant had stated that he had learned from his mistakes, his early release had been revoked for his failure to comply with the conditions attached to that release and he had been convicted of multiple offences. Moreover, the applicant, an adult who had indicated that he wished to move out of his parents\u2019 home, had failed to explain why family life could not be enjoyed in another country, and his family would be able to visit him in their country of origin and support him there financially if necessary.",

The applicant had had no control over this as he had been twelve years old at the time.

In addition, he claimed that he would not be able to fend for himself in Morocco as he had no contacts in that country and no knowledge of its culture and society, he did not speak Arabic, and \u2013 according to a forensic psychological examination \u2013 he had an intellectual disability. Moreover, apart from the time spent in detention, he had always lived in the parental home and the ties with his parents and siblings were very strong, especially since the car accident (see paragraph 9 above), with the family members needing each other for support in order to come to terms with what had happened. His parents could not be expected to accompany him to Morocco because they were long-time residents of the Netherlands, where some of his younger siblings still went to school.",

In this respect the Deputy Minister referred to section\u00a03.86, subsection 4, of the Aliens Decree 2000 (see paragraph 40 below). The applicant had committed at least five serious offences and had received unsuspended custodial sentences totalling forty-one months, whereas the threshold in subsection 4 of section 3.86 of the Aliens Decree 2000, for persons whose period of lawful residence was between six and seven years, was seven months. The Deputy Minister noted, moreover, that even if the threshold of thirty months set out in the first two subsections of section 3.86 of the Aliens Decree 2000 were taken as the starting-point, this would also lead to the revocation of the applicant\u2019s residence permit.",

In addition, owing to his lack of legal residence he had no means of generating an income and was therefore dependent on his family for his survival.

This view was strengthened by the fact that the applicant had been able to function effectively on many occasions throughout his life, such as at secondary school where, according to his records, he had outperformed many of his peers and as a result had been moved from the lower level practical education (praktijkonderwijs) to the higher level of pre-vocational secondary education (voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs).

They noted that the application submitted in 2005 had been for the renewal of the applicant\u2019s temporary residence permit (see paragraph 5 above), and thus not for a residence permit of indefinite duration or for naturalisation.

However, it has not insisted on such further elements of dependency in a number of cases concerning young adults who were still living with their parents and had not yet started a family of their own (see Bouchelkia v.\u00a0France, 29 January 1997, \u00a7 41, Reports 1997I; Ezzouhdi v.

Indeed, domestic law currently reflects that case-law (see paragraph 45 above). Since those were also the circumstances in which the applicant found himself at the relevant time, the Court sees no reason to address the parties\u2019 submissions as regards the existence or not of further elements of dependency.

Despite the fact that the applicant subsequently expressed a desire to complete the treatment on a voluntary basis after he had finished serving his sentence (see paragraph 25 above) (completion of the treatment apparently did not come about due to the fact that he no longer had lawful residence in the Netherlands), the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s conduct during that period carries less weight than the serious nature of his criminal offences.",
