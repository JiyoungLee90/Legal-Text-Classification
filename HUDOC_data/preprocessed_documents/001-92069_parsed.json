Lithuania, nos.\u00a055480/00 and 59330/00, ECHR 2004VIII, and Rainys and Gasparavi\u010dius v. Lithuania, nos.\u00a070665/01 and 74345/01, 7 April 2005), the present case was materially different. The first of the above-mentioned cases concerned applicants who had brought proceedings contesting the conclusions of the State authorities that they had been employees of the Lithuanian branch of the Committee of State Security (the KGB) as well as their actual dismissal from their jobs in the public sector as, respectively, a tax inspector and a prosecutor. The applicants in the second case also contested the conclusions of the State authorities that they had been employees of the KGB, as well as their actual dismissal from their jobs in the private sector \u2013 they were, respectively, a lawyer in a private telecommunications company and a barrister. However, in the present case, before the national courts the applicant had only contested the decision of 12\u00a0September 2000, by which the Commission had established the fact that in the past he had secretly collaborated with the KGB and the Commission\u2019s decision to publish such information in the \u201cOfficial Gazette\u201d. Therefore at the domestic level the applicant failed to raise the issue of the legal effects which the Commission\u2019s decision had produced, notably whether it was reasonable and legitimate to apply to him the employment restrictions and to dismiss him from the civil service as well as to revoke his barrister\u2019s licence. Since the applicant had not instituted domestic proceedings against the specific restrictions which were applied to him under the Law, he had failed to exhaust all the remedies at his disposal and, therefore, his complaint was inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

In the latter cases the statutory restrictions on holding certain jobs, functions or tasks were automatically applied to the applicants merely on the ground that at a certain time they had worked for the Committee of State Security of the Lithuanian SSR. However the Law applied to the applicant in the present case did not impose unconditional restrictions on a person\u2019s employment. First, the person had to have intentionally collaborated in secret with the special services of the former . Secondly, by the statutory deadline, the individual concerned had to have failed to confess to the State authorities about his or her secret collaboration. Thirdly, after the failure to confess, the fact of that person\u2019s secret collaboration had to have been published in the \u201cOfficial Gazette\u201d. The Government maintained that 1,500 people had appeared before the Commission to admit their collaboration within the six-month period prescribed by the Law. The applicant had been free to take this step \u2013 if he had confessed, he would have avoided the unfavourable legal consequences. However, as the applicant had intentionally chosen not to confess about his past collaboration within the above-mentioned period, the State had had the right and duty to apply to him the employment-related restrictions. Moreover, under Article 8 of the Law, information concerning persons who had confessed about their collaboration in the past was to be classified as a State secret and the State assumed the obligation to protect them against possible blackmail and the declassification of information. Taking this into consideration, the Government argued that the State had not overstepped its margin of appreciation and that the Law constituted a proportionate measure to safeguard national security and to protect the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Therefore the Law did not impose collective responsibility on all \u201cformer secret collaborators\u201d without exception. Given that only those \u201cformer secret collaborators\u201d who had not confessed were affected by restrictions on their employment prospects, there had been no discriminatory treatment within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention.

He argued that Article 9 of the Law obliged an employer to dismiss the employee from his or her job no later than the day after the information about the collaboration had been published. Likewise, if the published information concerned a person who was engaged in legal practice, the Bar Association of Lithuania had an obligation to revoke the person\u2019s accreditation as a lawyer. Therefore the requirements of the Law were peremptory. When contesting the lawfulness of the Commission\u2019s decision about his \u201cformer secret collaboration\u201d and the publication of that information, the applicant had simultaneously sought to prevent the entry into force of the Commission\u2019s decision and, consequently, his removal from the list of practising lawyers, in order to defend his right to practise law or pursue other private-sector activities. In the applicant\u2019s view, only effective remedies would have been relevant for the purposes of Article 35 \n\u00a7 1 of the Convention, but he had had none at his disposal.",

The Court reiterates, however, that there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a067, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV). It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v.\u00a0Belgium, 6 November 1980, \u00a7\u00a035, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a040).",

The Court places particular emphasis on the unconditional obligation which Article 9 of the Law imposed on employers or the Bar Association of Lithuania to, respectively, terminate the work contract of an employee or disbar a practising lawyer, should facts about their former secret collaboration be made public. The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s argument regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies insofar as the applicant only initiated domestic proceedings in respect of the establishment of the fact of his collaboration as such, as well as the Commission\u2019s decision to make that information public, whereas he did not initiate domestic proceedings as to the legality of his dismissal. However, in view of the above-mentioned unconditional obligation, the Court considers that any proceedings regarding the applicant\u2019s actual dismissal from the civil service and his disbarment would have been futile.

Consequently, the Court will confine itself to examining whether the restriction on employment in the private sector, as applied to the present applicant, was compatible with Article 8 of the Convention. In this connection the Court refers to its conclusions in the cases of Sidabras and D\u017eiautas and Rainys and Gasparavi\u010dius where it found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, in conjunction with Article 8, to the extent that the law precluded those applicants from employment in various branches of the private sector on the basis of their \u201cformer KGB officer\u201d status under the relevant Act.

In particular, Article 9 of the Law specifies the private sector positions from which the applicant, as a person deemed to be lacking loyalty, should be excluded \n(see paragraph 16 above).

In this context, the Court notes the lack of differentiation in the Law itself between different levels of former involvement with the KGB. Furthermore, there are no objective materials in the case file verified by the domestic courts to indicate that the applicant poses a current danger to national security if he were to be employed in certain sectors of private business. The Court also observes that the Law came into force in 2000, i.e. almost a decade after  had declared its independence on 11\u00a0March 1990. Thus the restrictions on the applicant\u2019s professional activities were imposed on him at least a decade after he had ceased collaborating with the KGB. The fact of the Law\u2019s belated timing, although not in itself decisive, may nonetheless be considered relevant to the overall assessment of the proportionality of the measures taken. Finally, the Court takes into account the fact that the Lithuanian authorities had themselves recognised the applicant\u2019s loyalty to the Republic by bestowing State awards upon him (see paragraph 6 above).",

The applicant complained that it had been impossible for him to obtain the Rules of Procedure of the Commission and that the domestic courts\u2019 decisions had been unfair. The Court recalls that it is not its task to act as an appeal court of \u201cfourth instance\u201d by calling into question the outcome of the domestic proceedings. The domestic courts are best placed for assessing the relevance of evidence to the issues in the case and for interpreting and applying rules of substantive and procedural law (see Pekinel v. , no. 9939/02, \u00a7\u00a053, 18\u00a0March 2008). On the basis of the material in its possession, the Court observes that the complaint at hand is, indeed, essentially of a \u201cfourth instance\u201d nature. In the domestic proceedings the applicant was afforded ample opportunity to state his case before the courts, at two levels of jurisdiction. Furthermore, in order to better examine the evidence, the proceedings were reopened (see paragraph 13 above). The applicant and his lawyer were present at the court hearings and were able to contest the evidence which the applicant considered false. The fact of his former secret collaboration was established on the basis of evidence given by witnesses whose reliability the applicant was able to question. Moreover, the applicant conceded that he had had unrestricted access to the court files and all the documents of the Commission, except for its Rules of Procedure \n(see, a contrario, Bobek v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a058-70).

We would emphasise, however, that State-imposed restrictions on a person\u2019s opportunities to find employment in the private sector by reason of a lack of loyalty to the State cannot be justified from the Convention perspective in the same manner as restrictions on access to employment in the public service (see Rainys and Gasparavi\u010dius v.

Unlike the Law applicable to former employees that was reviewed by the Court in those cases, the Law applicable in the present case, in our opinion, was intended also to protect collaborators of the \u201cspecial\u201d (security) services of the former Soviet Union. The personal motives for becoming an informer may range from envy, political loyalty or conformism, to material or any other interests. Some of them may have simply been victims of the regime.

Pursuant to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Law, the \u201cformer secret collaborators\u201d had a time-limit of six months in which to admit to their collaboration to the State authorities. Furthermore \u2013 a very important aspect to be taken into account \u2013 only if a person failed to admit to such collaboration within the prescribed time-limit were Articles 8 \u00a7 4 and 9 of the Law to be applied. In such circumstances, the fact of collaboration was to be published in the \u201cOfficial Gazette\u201d and, consequently, that individual would then be prevented from pursuing certain types of professional activities in the private sector. In the present case the applicant had failed to admit to his collaboration. This resulted in the fact of his collaboration with the special services of the former  being published in the \u201cOfficial Gazette\u201d. We note that the applicant had not presented any arguments which would explain and/or justify his failure to admit to his past collaboration, or his attempt to circumvent a legitimate requirement imposed on him by the Law. He could not deny the fact of his previous collaboration, notwithstanding the availability of a fair judicial procedure and access to his personal file. Furthermore, the admission of past collaboration in itself would not have led to any penalties. On the contrary, had the applicant admitted to his collaboration, that fact would have remained secret and he would not have faced any employment-related restrictions. The non-public admission of reproachable past behaviour does not result in negative consequences, and it does not therefore raise concerns of unfair criminal proceedings (contrast Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, \u00a7\u00a7 57-65, ECHR 2007...) or punishment.
