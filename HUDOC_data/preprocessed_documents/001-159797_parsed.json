The Court has found that this investigative procedure does not comply with the principles of an effective remedy because an enquiring officer can take only a limited number of procedural steps within that procedure, at a point where victims have no formal status and are therefore excluded from participating effectively in the procedure (see Skorokhodov v. Ukraine, no. 56697/09, \u00a7 34, 14 November 2013, with further references). It is notable that numerous decisions to terminate the pre-investigation enquiries were quashed as unfounded by the supervising authorities, which each time remitted the case for a new round of enquiries. The repetition of such remittal orders discloses a serious deficiency (see, for example, Spinov v. Ukraine, no. 34331/03, \u00a7 56, 27 November 2008). Indeed, the court decision of 3 August 2011 suggested that, after a period of more than five years, the investigating authorities had failed to take any significant measures.",
