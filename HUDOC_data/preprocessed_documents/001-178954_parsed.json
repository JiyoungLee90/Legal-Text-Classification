Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention. One general principle established in the case-law is that detention will be \u201carbitrary\u201d where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a067-69, ECHR 2008).",

However, the decision setting the time-limit for posting bail was issued in the absence of the applicant and his counsel and reached them only eight days later. It is not disputed, moreover, that it was materially impossible for the applicant to post bail because the competent district court did not have a deposit account. There is no evidence that the Russian authorities took any steps to open such an account or considered any alternative arrangements for receiving the amount of the bail. The Court finds therefore that, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith on the part of the authorities which indicates that the applicant\u2019s detention in that period was arbitrary.",
