The notion of an \u201ceffective remedy\u201d under this provision entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see, among many other authorities, A\u015fan and Others v. Turkey, no. 56003/00, \u00a7 82, 31 July 2007). The Court also points out that a civil court is itself unable to pursue any independent investigation and is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings as to the identity of the perpetrators of assaults, still less of attributing responsibility (see, mutatis mutandis, Ya\u015fa v.\u00a0Turkey, 2\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7\u00a074, Reports 1998-VI, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-21, 24 February 2005).",

From this report it appears that the first applicant suffered a head injury and ecchymosis, neck ecchymoses and abrasions in the area of the wrist joints. In his statement of 2 June 2003 to the Cypriot Ombudsman the first applicant maintained that the police officers had reacted violently when he had asked the reasons for the detention and deportation of all the applicants but admitted that, when they had tried to handcuff him, he had managed to free his arms.

The Government relied on the Court's judgment in the case of Chahal v. the United Kingdom (15 November 1996, \u00a7\u00a0112, Reports 1996V). The applicants' arrest and detention had been based on and in conformity with domestic law and procedure and there had been no arbitrariness in the exercise by the authorities of their powers of arrest. The applicant's landing permits had been revoked from the moment they had been asked by the immigration authorities to leave the Republic. At that point they had become prohibited immigrants under the Aliens and Immigration Law. Consequently, the immigration authorities had been entitled to proceed with the execution of the detention and deportation orders against them in accordance with section 14 of the Law. In the alternative, the Government claimed that as the applicants' conduct had posed a risk to public order and safety, the immigration authorities had had the right to execute the orders under section 10 of the Aliens and Immigration Law (see paragraph 62 above) irrespective of whether they were prohibited immigrants or not. Furthermore, in compliance with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the applicants had been informed of the reasons for their arrest and deportation from the outset, both by the Ukrainian captain of the ship and by a Russian-speaking member of the immigration police.",

In the event of a refusal the deportation orders could then have been executed. If the authorities had requested the applicants to leave when they were still on board the ship, they would not have been able, in the event of a refusal, to arrest them or to proceed with the execution of the deportation orders. Criminal liability did not extend to offences committed by aliens on a vessel flying a foreign flag unless the offences fell within the ambit of section 5 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 73 above). In connection with the above the Government stressed that the applicants, unlike the applicants in the case of \u010conka v.  (no.\u00a051564/99, ECHR\u00a02002I), had no place of abode and/or work in the Republic. They also emphasised that this had not been an ordinary case of aliens residing and/or working in a State's territory where different possibilities existed for arresting and deporting those not lawfully resident. Calling the applicants to attend the immigration police offices at the harbour had been the only option left to the authorities to secure their deportation. It was not a course of action that had been used merely to facilitate their deportation or make it more effective.",

As regards the accessibility of a remedy within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, this implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy in question (see \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7 46). However, this was not the position in the present case since, during their detention and before their deportation, the applicants were not afforded any such possibility.",

It appears from the material submitted to the Court that the applicants had a lawyer in  (see paragraphs 9 and 52 above). Furthermore, certain of the applicants had proceedings pending before the  (see paragraph 9 above). The Court considers, therefore, that it was feasible for the applicants, once in their respective countries, to bring their complaints before the Cypriot courts. The Court cannot accept the applicants' claim that they were denied this possibility because they were not allowed to enter . The Court reiterates that the object of the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is to allow the national authorities (primarily the judicial authorities) to address the allegation made of violation of a Convention right and, where appropriate, to afford redress before that allegation is submitted to the Court (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2000-XI). In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, the argument of violation of the Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used. The Court points out in this connection that applicants have been required to exhaust domestic remedies even where they are not within the jurisdiction of the respondent State (see for example, Abbasi v. Cyprus (dec.), no.\u00a021713/06, 5 July 2007, and Ostoji\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.), no.\u00a016837/02, 26 September 2002). The Court further notes that the applicants have not put forward any arguments casting doubt on the effectiveness or adequacy of the remedies proposed by the Government. Finally, the Court observes that an examination of the case, such as it has been submitted, does not disclose the existence of any circumstances which might have absolved the applicants from availing themselves of these remedies.",

In view of the fact that the applicants had been invited to the immigration office to enable photographs to be taken so that new landing permits could be issued and had not expected to be deported on that date, it was doubtful that there had been sufficient time between the arrest and the deportation for the fourth applicant to collect everything she needed for her baby.",

Further, it has not been shown that it was not possible to secure such clothing or covering on board the aircraft prior to disembarkation. With regard to the adult applicants, it would indeed appear, in view of the Ombudsman's conclusions on the matter, that they were deported in the clothes they were wearing at the time of their arrest. Assuming therefore that the applicants did not have sufficiently warm clothing when deported, there is no indication of any intention to humiliate or debase them; rather, this situation was due to the hastiness of the deportation.
