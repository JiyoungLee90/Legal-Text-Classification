(III.25.) AB of the  had found this limitation to be in compliance with the Constitution. That court argued that orders and instructions might be criticised by lodging a service complaint (section 194 of the Service Act) or through a representative organisation (section 29). The assessment of criticism should be different depending on the type of service within the armed forces and whether it had occurred in an armed conflict, state of danger or emergency, or in peace. Thus, the limitation on the right to freedom of expression was necessary to ensure the undisturbed performance of tasks of the armed forces, and could not be regarded as disproportionate in view of the specific nature of the service relationship.",

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is generally impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, 8\u00a0July 1986, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 103; Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7 63). The classification of a statement as a fact or a value judgment is a matter which, in the first place, falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard v.  [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 2004XI). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it may be excessive (see Jerusalem v.

However, she also uttered, repeatedly, critical views about the manner in which police leaders managed the force, and accused them of disrespect of citizens and of serving political interests in general (see paragraph 8 above). For the Court, these latter views overstepped the mandate of a trade union leader, because they are not at all related to the protection of labour-related interests of trade union members. Therefore, those statements, being made outside the legitimate scope of trade union-related activities, must be considered from the general perspective of freedom of expression rather than from the particular aspect of trade union-related expressions. In this connection, the Court would reiterate that paragraph 2 in fine of Article 11 indicates that the State is bound to respect the freedom of association of its employees, subject to the possible imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise by members of its armed forces, police or administration of the rights protected in that Article; however, the restrictions imposed on the three groups mentioned are to be construed strictly and should therefore be confined to the \u201cexercise\u201d of the rights in question, that is, these restrictions must not impair the very essence of the right to organise (see Demir and Baykara v.

As a high-ranking officer and trade union leader she should have had to exercise her right to freedom of expression in accordance with the duties and responsibilities which that right carries with it in the specific circumstances of her status and in view of the special requirement of discipline in the police force (see also Rekv\u00e9nyi v.

In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.
