The Government cited the examples of three individuals of Uzbek ethnic origin who had received a suspended sentence and had been released on parole, or whose criminal case had been dismissed.

The latter were satisfied with the conditions of their detention and denied having been subjected to any form of ill-treatment during preliminary investigations.

In a previous case concerning extradition to Kyrgyzstan it found that in 2012 the situation in the south of the country was characterised by torture and other illtreatment of ethnic Uzbeks by law-enforcement officers. Such incidences had increased in the aftermath of the events of June 2010 and remained widespread and rampant, being aggravated by the impunity of lawenforcement officers. Moreover, the Court established that the issue needed to be seen in the context of the rise of ethnonationalism in the politics of Kyrgyzstan, particularly in the south, the growing interethnic tensions between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks, continued discriminatory practices faced by Uzbeks at institutional level and the underrepresentation of Uzbeks in, amongst others, law-enforcement bodies and the judiciary (see Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7 72). As is clear from the reports by UN bodies and reputable NGOs, the situation in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan had not improved since 2012. In particular, various reports are consistent in their descriptions of biased attitudes based on ethnicity in investigations, prosecutions, condemnations and sanctions imposed on ethnic Uzbeks who have been charged and convicted in relation to the 2010 events in the Jalal-Abad Region. They also agree about the lack of full and effective investigations into the numerous allegations of torture and illtreatment imputable to Kyrgyz law-enforcement agencies, arbitrary detention and the excessive use of force against Uzbeks allegedly involved in the events of June 2010. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the current overall human rights situation in Kyrgyzstan remains highly problematic (see Gayratbek Saliyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061; Kadirzhanov and Mamashev v. Russia, nos.\u00a042351/13 and 47823/13, \u00a7\u00a091, 17 July 2014; and Mamadaliyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060).",

In those circumstances, the Court will not then insist that the applicant demonstrate the existence of further special distinguishing features (see Saadi v.

They considered, however, that these circumstances could not in themselves be considered sufficient for refusing the applicant\u2019s extradition to Kyrgyzstan. Relying on Article\u00a03 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 10 December 1984 and the legal position of the UN Committee against Torture, the Russian Supreme Court stressed that the refusal of an extradition would be possible not only where the existence of gross and mass violations of human rights would be established in a requesting State, but also where it would be established that an individual concerned would run a personal risk of torture if returned to his or her country. In making an assessment of the applicant\u2019s personal risk of illtreatment in case of his return to Kyrgyzstan, the Supreme Court held that the latter did not belong to any political or other party, organisation or group in opposition to the present government of Kyrgyzstan, that while living in Kyrgyzstan he had not been subjected to any torture, inhuman or degrading treatment by the authorities, that he had arrived in Russia many months after the crimes of which he stood accused had been committed in June 2010, that his wife and daughter remained in the Kyrgyz Republic, and that no evidence had therefore been provided to show that he or his relatives were persecuted by the Kyrgyz authorities. The applicant\u2019s argument as to his Uzbek ethnic origin which gave him reason to believe that he would be subjected to repressive criminal prosecution and unfair conviction was dismissed as unsubstantiated. The Court further notes that the domestic courts attached particular importance to the diplomatic assurances provided by the Kyrgyz authorities, which were sufficient, in their view, to eliminate the risk of the applicant\u2019s being subjected to inhuman treatment in the event of his extradition (see paragraphs 17 and 20 above).",

The Court notes, in particular, that the applicant is an ethnic Uzbek charged with a number of serious offences allegedly committed in the course of the violent inter-ethnic clashes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in June 2010. Given the widespread use by the Kyrgyz authorities of torture and ill-treatment in order to obtain confessions from ethnic Uzbeks charged with involvement in the interethnic riots in the Jalal-Abad Region, which has been reported by both UN bodies and reputable NGOs, the Court is satisfied that the applicant belongs to a particularly vulnerable group, the members of which are routinely subjected to treatment proscribed by Article\u00a03 of the Convention in the requesting country (see Gayratbek Saliyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062, and Kadirzhanov and Mamashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a092).",

While those assurances appear to be formally binding on the local authorities, the Court has serious doubts, in view of the poor human-rights record in the south of the country, whether the local authorities there can be expected to abide by them in practice (see Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-46). Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated before the Court that Kyrgyzstan\u2019s commitment to guaranteeing access to the applicant by Russian diplomatic staff would result in effective protection against proscribed ill-treatment in practical terms, as it has not been shown that the aforementioned staff would be in possession of the expertise required for effective follow-up of the Kyrgyz authorities\u2019 compliance with their undertakings. Nor was there any guarantee that they would be able to speak to the applicant without witnesses. In addition, their potential involvement was not supported by any practical mechanism setting up a procedure by which the applicant could lodge his complaints with them or facilitating their unfettered access to detention facilities (see Mamadaliyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069).

The Government claimed, furthermore, that the applicant could also have asked a prosecutor to reconsider the imposition of custodial detention under Article 110 of the CCrP after the interim measures had been applied by the Court.

Moreover, he disagreed with the Government\u2019s assertion that it had been open to him to initiate proceedings for release under Article\u00a0110 of the CCrP, as in his view it had been incumbent on the State agencies to initiate such proceedings of their own motion. He further claimed that the application procedure under Articles\u00a0119-122 of the CCrP could not be regarded as an effective remedy in his case as it was applicable only to parties to criminal proceedings instituted in Russia. Moreover, any prosecutor\u2019s decision taken on the basis of that procedure could only be challenged in court under Article 125 of the CCrP, which does not empower a court to order a detainee\u2019s release, even if it finds the impugned detention order unlawful or unjustified (see Zokhidov v.

Poland, no.\u00a028358/95, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR 2000III). Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for an appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review in such appeal proceedings. Accordingly, in order to determine whether or not there has been compliance with the requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings have been conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction (see Mooren v.

At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before an appellate court (see Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a04493/04, \u00a7\u00a096, 25\u00a0October 2007).",

Germany, 12 May 1992, \u00a7 22, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0237A).

The Court has previously addressed similar arguments and dismissed them, having found that the Government have not provided any explanation as to the manner in which applications under Articles 119-122 of the CCrP could have amounted to a request for release or periodic judicial review at reasonable intervals of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention pending extradition, and that Article\u00a0110 of the CCrP did not provide for a clear mechanism of applying for cancellation or varying the preventive measure in the context of detention pending extradition (see Kadirzhanov and Mamashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0131-32).",

Namely, on 28\u00a0January 2014 the Court applied an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see paragraph 4 above) with the result that, although on 30\u00a0January 2014 the extradition order was upheld at final instance and the domestic extradition proceedings were thereby terminated, any preparation for the enforcement of the extradition order had to be suspended for an indefinite period of time. The Court considers that this constituted a new relevant factor that might have affected the lawfulness of, and the justification for, the applicant\u2019s continued detention. The applicant was therefore entitled under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 to proceedings to have that new relevant factor assessed by a court without unreasonable delay.",
