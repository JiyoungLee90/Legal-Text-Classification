The Court does not find the fact that Ch. (M.) was not charged immediately after the events to be evidence of the inefficiency of the investigation, since from the materials in the case it follows that the investigating authorities made diligent efforts to establish the circumstances of the events and to reconcile conflicting versions of events. Likewise, the Court considers that the long duration of the investigation did not detract from the acknowledgement of the violation, since in the present case it was caused by \u2019s (M.\u2019s) absconding from the investigating authorities and the need to establish his whereabouts, which was further complicated by his change of name. The Court has no evidence to imply that the authorities either acted in bad faith or failed to take all appropriate steps to locate him. It further notes that in the present case the applicants did not allege that they had not been duly informed of the progress of the investigation. Finally, the domestic investigation resulted in a trial which led to the serviceman who had killed the applicants\u2019 son being convicted of murder and sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. The Court thus finds that the domestic investigation was effective for the purposes of Article 2 of the Convention and that the conviction constituted express acknowledgement by the authorities of a violation of Ayub Salatkhanov\u2019s right to life.",
