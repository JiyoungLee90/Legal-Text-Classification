These provisions, which are rather vaguely worded and whose scope of application may be subject to various interpretations, are said to have been used in numerous allegedly fabricated cases and to have led to harsh prison sentences. The four crimes that, following recent amendments, are now the only capital offences are said to lead to a death sentence only if they are combined with aggravated murder charges. Evidence gathering in such cases is said to rely exclusively on confessions extracted by illegal means. It is reported that religious leaflets as well as weapons or bullets have been planted as evidence that a person belongs to banned groups such as Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a transnational Islamic movement which calls for the peaceful establishment of the Caliphate in Central Asia. It is also reported that torture and ill-treatment continue to be used against inmates convicted on such charges, inter alia to force them to write repentance letters to the President of the Republic or to punish them further...",

She gave examples of cases when Muslim detainees had been ill-treated, and in certain cases killed, because of their religious beliefs, or unjustifiably subjected to disciplinary penalties such as placement in punishment cells without food or water, in particular because of their attempts to pray. She also referred to recent reports on the allegedly appalling conditions of detention and the lack of monitoring of detention facilities in . The applicant\u2019s representative also relied on the third-party interveners\u2019 submissions before the Court in the cases of Mamatkulov and Askarov v.\u00a0Turkey ([GC], nos.\u00a046827/99 and 46951/99, ECHR\u00a02005I) and Ismoilov and Others v. Russia (no.\u00a02947/06, 24 April 2008). According to the applicant\u2019s representative, the applicant\u2019s expulsion had been in fact \u201can extradition in disguise\u201d, as a result of which the applicant had been convicted of the offences in respect of which the Russian authorities had refused extradition. The applicant had been expelled in flagrant violation of Russian law before his appeals against the expulsion order and the dismissal of his refugee application could be examined. Besides, no diplomatic assurances had been obtained from the Uzbek authorities in the present case and, even if they had been obtained, they could not have been effective in the context of an administrative expulsion formally unrelated to any pending criminal proceedings against an applicant. With reference to the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia (no.\u00a036378/02, ECHR 2005III), it was argued that the respondent Government\u2019s failure to comply with an indication under Rule\u00a039 should not necessarily prevent the Court from examining on the merits a complaint under Article 3. Otherwise, it would be less burdensome for a respondent State to remove an applicant from its territory in cases in which Rule 39 was applied and to be held in violation of Article 34 of the Convention than to comply with Rule 39 and to be found to have breached Article 3 and/or Article 6.",

It was dismissed because, in the migration authorities\u2019 view, he did not fall within the scope of the definition of a \u201crefugee\u201d under the Refugees Act. It does not transpire from the record of the applicant\u2019s interview with the migration officer that the applicant made any specific allegations of a risk of ill-treatment in the event of his being returned to . It also appears that, having learnt about the accusations against him in November 2005, the applicant intended to return to  in order to obtain further particulars. The Court observes, however, that, when appealing against the refusal of his refugee application, the applicant put forward specific and detailed arguments pertaining to a risk of torture in  (see paragraph 20 above). It is noted that the Russian authorities, including the courts, dismissed the applicant\u2019s arguments with reference to his failure to prove that he had left Uzbekistan for \u201cpolitical reasons\u201d and that his fears of persecution for such reasons were justified. The Court reiterates that it is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see N. v. Finland, no.\u00a038885/02, \u00a7 167, 26\u00a0July 2005). The national authorities did not give any consideration to the applicant\u2019s argument relating to persecution for religious rather than purely \u201cpolitical\u201d reasons (see also paragraphs 19 and 23 above). The Court is satisfied that the applicant\u2019s application for judicial review of the refusal to examine his application for refugee status was substantiated by the reference to reports by international organisations on the human-rights situation in Uzbekistan, in particular as regards the risk of persons being persecuted on account of their religious beliefs. In such circumstances, it was for the Russian authorities to dispel any doubts about that risk. That did not happen since the applicant was expelled before a Russian court could take cognisance of his application for judicial review.",

The main thrust of his grievance was, however, his persecution by the Uzbek authorities from April 2005 onwards in connection with allegations of serious criminal offences punishable by long terms of imprisonment. In such a situation it would be appropriate to consider whether the applicant fell within the definition of a refugee \u201csur place\u201d.

Thus, the Court considers that the argument based on the balancing of the risk of harm if the person is sent back against the dangerousness he or she represents to the community if not sent back is misconceived (see the domestic findings in paragraph 19 in fine above). The concepts of \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cdangerousness\u201d in this context do not lend themselves to a balancing test because they are notions that can only be assessed independently of each other. Either the evidence adduced before the Court reveals that there is a substantial risk if the person is sent back or it does not. The prospect that he or she may pose a serious threat to the community if not returned does not reduce in any way the degree of risk of ill treatment that the person may be subject to on return (Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 138).",

It does not transpire from the case file that any verbatim record was drawn up at that hearing, although such a possibility existed under Russian law. Therefore, it is not possible to establish with any certainty the contents of the applicant\u2019s submissions to the district judge. The Court reiterates in that connection that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory, but practical and effective (see, mutatis mutandis, Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024833/94, \u00a7 34, ECHR 1999-I). As the Court held in \u010conka v.  (no.\u00a051564/99, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2002I) the requirement of accessibility of a remedy within the meaning of Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford an applicant a realistic possibility of using the remedy. In the same vein, the applicant was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to plead his case. Besides, the Court is inclined to consider that the district judge should have been made sufficiently aware of the facts preceding the applicant\u2019s apprehension on 17\u00a0October 2006, as those facts were relevant to the examination of the case before it. The Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must therefore be dismissed.",

His successor in this post announced in 2006 that his mandate continued to receive serious allegations of torture by Uzbek law-enforcement officials. In 2006 the UN Secretary General also drew attention to the continuing problems of the widespread mistreatment of prisoners and complained that inadequate measures were taken to bring those responsible to justice.\u00a0The evidence before the Court, which it considers reliable, discloses that during the period under consideration problems persisted in  in connection with the ill-treatment of detainees.",

After his forced return to the country, an Uzbek court convicted the applicant of unlawful actions against the constitutional order and participation in the activities of HT, and sentenced him to five years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. The court found that in 1999 the applicant had engaged in propaganda concerning HT\u2019s activities aimed at subverting the constitutional regime and creating an Islamist state.",

In those circumstances, the Court will not then insist that the applicant show the existence of further special distinguishing features if to do so would render illusory the protection offered by Article 3 (see NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7\u00a0116, 17 July 2008). The above findings apply to the applicant in the present case, who was persecuted on account of his alleged involvement in the activities of HT, which he consistently denied. Regard being had to the materials submitted by the applicant and obtained by the Court proprio motu (see, inter alia, paragraphs 73 and 74 above), the Court considers that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice of persecution of members or supporters of that organisation, whose underlying aims appear to be both religious and political. In that connection, the Court refers to the above-mentioned UN Special Rapporteur\u2019s Report, which affirmed the existence of a persisting practice of torture against persons who, like the applicant, were accused under Articles 159 and 244 of the Uzbek Criminal Code, with a view to extracting self-incriminating confessions and to punishing those who were perceived by public authorities to be involved in religious or political activities contrary to State interests (see paragraph 67 above). It was reported that evidence-gathering in such cases relied on confessions extracted by unlawful means and that ill-treatment continued to be used against inmates convicted on such charges.",

The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s reference to the relevant provisions of Uzbek law and their indication of certain improvements in the protection of human rights in  which, in the Government\u2019s opinion, negated the risk of ill-treatment. The Court reiterates, however, that the existence of domestic laws and accession to international treaties guaranteeing respect for fundamental rights in principle are not in themselves sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment where, as in the present case, reliable sources have reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the authorities which are manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 147 in fine).

(dec.) [GC], no.\u00a048321/99, \u00a7\u00a099, ECHR 2002II). Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes, however, that the applicant\u2019s expulsion was ordered in the first instance by a district judge as a subsidiary penalty under the Code of Administrative Offences. The Court has already found that the proceedings before the district judge were defective (see paragraph 90 above). Thus, an adequate opportunity to lodge an appeal against the judge\u2019s decision and to obtain suspension of the enforcement of the expulsion order pending its review was particularly important in the circumstances of the present case. As regards the availability of suspension, the Court reiterates that it is inconsistent with Article 13 for measures having potentially irreversible effects to be executed before the national authorities have examined whether they are compatible with the Convention, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see Gebremedhin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). The necessity for a remedy with suspensive effect has also been indicated by the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Ministers and Commissioner for Human Rights (paragraphs 63 and 64 above). As was confirmed by the Butyrskiy District Court of Moscow in its judgment of 24 May 2007 (see paragraph 44 above), the applicant\u2019s expulsion before the examination of his appeal against the expulsion order was unlawful. Thus, the applicant was denied an effective opportunity to suspend the enforcement of the expulsion order against him.",

As regards the Custody Act, the Court notes that it derives from the Code of Criminal Procedure and concerns persons suspected or accused of criminal offences in . There is no indication that this Act applied at the material time to persons who were detained pending extradition. Thus, the Court is uncertain that the remedies suggested by the Government related to the breaches alleged. In such circumstances, the Government was required, but failed, to show that the existence of the above remedies was sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among other authorities, A. and E.

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur\u00a0v.

It is not in dispute that the applicant\u2019s initial arrest and placement in custody were lawful. The issue that the Court has to determine is whether that court decision was sufficient for holding the applicant in custody for more than seven months until the decision on the extradition request had been given (see Nasrulloyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73 et seq.).",

Besides, it refers to its findings in the Nasrulloyev case concerning the divergent approaches taken by the Russian authorities on the issue of provisions applicable to detainees awaiting extradition, in particular on the issue whether Article 109 of the CCrP, which lays down the procedure and specific time-limits for reviewing detention, was applicable (see also Ryabikin v. Russia, no.\u00a08320/04, \u00a7\u00a0129, 19 June 2008, and Ismoilov and Others v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a02947/06, 12 December 2006).

In particular, the Court observes that the detention order of 4 February 2006 did not set any time-limit for the applicant\u2019s detention. Under the provisions governing the general terms of detention (Article 108 of the CCrP), to which the domestic court referred when ordering the applicant\u2019s detention, the time-limit for detention pending investigation was fixed at two months. A judge could extend that period up to six months. Further extensions could only be granted by a judge if the person was charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences. However, upon the expiry of the maximum initial detention period of two months (Article 109 \u00a7 1 of the CCrP), no extension was granted by a court in the present case. The applicant spent over seven months in detention pending extradition. During that period no requests for extension of his detention were lodged. Neither could the prosecutor\u2019s instructions to the administration of the remand centre be regarded as a valid authorisation for the applicant\u2019s continued detention (see paragraph 13 above). Thus, the national system failed to protect the applicant from arbitrary detention, and his detention cannot be considered \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention. In these circumstances, the Court does not need to consider separately the applicant\u2019s additional argument concerning his delayed release.",
