Thus the purpose of the remedy under Article 11 of the Civil Code is not to provide redress for an alleged violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a7 1 or 4 as such, but to examine, as the case might be, whether any misconduct was objectively capable of interfering with one\u2019s personal rights. An award of compensation for damage of a non-pecuniary nature in proceedings under Article 11 et seq. of the Civil Code is made subject to conditions and invokes considerations which are distinct from the question whether or not a person\u2019s rights under Article 5 of the Convention have been violated. In particular, it has not been shown that a person\u2019s suffering and distress occasioned by a violation of Article 5 are taken into consideration, these being criteria established by the Court\u2019s case-law when it rules under Rule 41 of the Convention on the question of just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

In that judgment, which apparently has not yet become final, the first instance court granted the plaintiffs compensation for damage of a non-pecuniary nature occasioned by criminal proceedings in which they were finally discharged. The reasoning of the relevant part of that judgment does not specifically refer to the detention of one of the plaintiffs nor does it examine whether or not that detention was unlawful or otherwise contrary to Article 5 of the Convention.
