Moreover, the High Court of Cassation and Justice fixed a first hearing in the case for about one year and five months after receipt of the case file (see paragraph 16 above). No explanations have been given by the Government in respect of this period of inactivity. Nor have they explained the three-month period it took the High Court to send the file back to the Court of Appeal for the final judgment to be endorsed with a writ of execution (see paragraphs 17-18 above).",
