According to international law, States have the power to expel aliens, though this power is not absolute. Aliens must be treated in a civilised manner and the power of expulsion must be exercised in good faith. Due consideration must be given to the interests of the individual, including his basic human rights, his family and other links with the State of residence. These must be weighed against the competing demands of State interests as regards such matters as public safety and prevention of disorder or crime. International law allows States a fairly wide margin of appreciation in determining whether these interests justify an expulsion. They have the right to judge by national criteria whether the facts and circumstances warrant the expulsion. As regards both the grounds for expulsion and the question whether an individual qualifies for expulsion on those grounds, the expelling State is in the best position to pronounce upon such matters.

In this context, I observe that in a number of cases it found a residence prohibition disproportionate on account of its unlimited duration (see, for instance, Ezzouhdi v. France, no. 47160/99, \u00a7 35, 13 February 2001; Yilmaz v.\u00a0Germany, no. 52853/99, \u00a7\u00a7 48-49, 17 April 2003; and Radovanovic v.\u00a0Austria, no. 42703/98, \u00a7 37, 22 April 2004) while, in other cases, it has considered the fixed duration of a residence prohibition as a factor speaking in favour of its proportionality (see Benhebba, cited above, \u00a7 37; Jankov v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), no. 35112/92, 13 January 2000; and \u00dcner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065).",

Moreover, I observe that although the residence ban was imposed when the applicant was still a minor, the authorities did not proceed to his expulsion before he reached majority (see, a contrario, Jakupovic v. Austria, no. 36757/97, \u00a7 29, 6 February 2003, where we attached weight to the fact that the applicant was only 16 years old when he was expelled). Although, in the present case, his expulsion must have uprooted the applicant, he was already an adult at the time and was moreover not left without any perspective of returning to . I therefore find that the measures complained of were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",
