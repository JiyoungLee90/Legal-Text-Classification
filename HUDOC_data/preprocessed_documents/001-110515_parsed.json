The circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s fourth admission to the mental health facility did not affect other aspects of the application relating to the previous instances of the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation in a mental health facility. Neither did they affect the applicant\u2019s submissions to the effect that she was compulsorily kept in hospital during the fourth hospitalisation after the admission procedure had been completed. Lastly, proper regard should be given to the applicant\u2019s further arguments as to the alleged lack of her real agreement for the fourth admission to the hospital. In sum, the applicant\u2019s failure to initially specify the circumstances referred to by the Government did not relate to a greater part of the application, that failure cannot be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court and in the end it did not impede the proper conduct of the proceedings before the Court.

However, not every fault discovered in a detention order renders the underlying detention as such unlawful for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1. A period of detention is, in principle, \u201clawful\u201d if it is based on a court order. For the assessment of compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention a basic distinction has to be made between ex facie invalid detention orders \u2013 for example, given by a court in excess of jurisdiction or where the interested party did not have proper notice of the hearing \u2013 and detention orders which are prima facie valid and effective unless and until they have been overturned by a higher court. A detention order must be considered as ex facie invalid if the flaw in the order amounted to a \u201cgross and obvious irregularity\u201d in the exceptional sense indicated by the Court\u2019s case-law (see Mooren v.  [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7\u00a7 74 and 75, 9 July 2009 with further references). The reasoning of the detention order is a relevant factor in determining whether a person\u2019s detention must be considered as arbitrary. The Court has considered the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time to be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Sta\u0161aitis v. Lithuania, no. 47679/99, \u00a7 67, 21 March 2002; Nakhmanovich v.\u00a0Russia, no. 55669/00, \u00a7 70, 2 March 2006; and Belevitskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a072967/01, \u00a7 91, 1 March 2007).",

The Court further notes that, according to section 17 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act, following the compulsory admission of a person to a mental hospital on the basis of judicial decision his or her mental health is subject to automatic review by a panel of psychiatrists at least once a month to determine whether it is necessary to keep the person in hospital.

However, where the complaint is about a continued and arbitrary deprivation of liberty conducted in the absence of a fair and proper procedure for admission to the facility, as in the present case, an adequate remedy is primarily one capable of immediately terminating the continued violation by ordering release. The specific requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention concerning the judicial character of a necessary procedure, including guarantees of independent and impartial review based on the adversarial nature of the procedure and the principle of equality of arms, are inherent in such a remedy. A retrospective compensatory relief could be supplementary to that remedy.",
