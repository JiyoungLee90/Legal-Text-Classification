The Court held that the burden to ensure compliance with a judgment against the State lies primarily with the State authorities starting from the date on which the judgment becomes binding and enforceable (Burdov v.

In the Court\u2019s understanding, this option was meant to facilitate and accelerate the payment of judicial awards by the State. If, however, the applicant for any reason obtains himself the writ of execution from the trial court, it would appear logical, in the Court\u2019s view, to require that he submits it to the competent authority with a view to enforcement of the judgment (see Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v.

Nor did he claim the legal requirement to impose a disproportionate burden on him or to be otherwise unreasonable or unnecessary. Finally, the applicant has not pointed to any valid circumstance preventing or dispensing him from taking the necessary actions to restore, without unreasonable delay, the writ of execution which had allegedly been stolen from his office, or from complying with other formalities to allow the authorities paying him the judgment debt within a reasonable time.",

In the absence of any explanation from the applicant, the Government\u2019s assumption that he had deliberately withheld the writ of execution for several years does not appear unfounded. In the Court\u2019s view, the present situation differs from that observed in virtually all other non-enforcement cases decided against Russia, in which the applicants took the necessary steps with a view to payment of the judicial awards by the State (see also Gadzhikhanov and Saukov, cited above, \u00a7 29).",
