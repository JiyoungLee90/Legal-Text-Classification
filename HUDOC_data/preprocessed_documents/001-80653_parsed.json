The first set of these proceedings, concerning the applicant's claim for the eviction of the tenants ended with the 's decision of 13 October 2004. In these proceedings the domestic courts dismissed the applicant's claim. The applicant also instituted proceedings for regulation of the rent which are still pending. Furthermore, the tenant, M.V., instituted proceedings against the applicant in order to secure a lease agreement with a protected rent, pursuant to the Lease Act. The proceedings are presently pending. The Court considers that these proceedings are intrinsically linked to the issues raised by the applicant under Article 8 of the Convention and under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court cannot speculate what the outcome of these proceedings would be and how this outcome would affect the applicant's right to respect for his home and his property rights.",
