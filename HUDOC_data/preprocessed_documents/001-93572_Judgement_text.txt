The case originated in ten applications (nos. 4889/05, 4897/05, 24009/05, 33694/05, 37759/05, 42996/06, 43031/06, 43019/06, 43038/06 and 43054/06) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by thirty-one Turkish nationals (“the applicants”, see the annex hereto), on 27 December 2004, 10 June, 5 and 29 September 2005 and 4 October 2006 respectively. Certain applicants were party to more than one application.
The applicants were represented by Mr S. Kaya, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 28 August 2008 the Court declared application no. 4897/05 partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings. On 15 January and 12 June 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the remaining applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
All of the applicants are from the Çayçatı  Numerous plots of land in the village have been used by the applicants’ parents or grandparents without a title deed since the 1930s. These plots were registered in the name of the Treasury in 1960 pursuant to Law no. 4753. In 1977 they were re-registered in the name of the Treasury pursuant to the Land Registry Act (Law no. 766).
On various dates in 1989, the applicants instituted civil proceedings in the Varto Civil Court of First Instance pursuant to Law no. 3402 and requested the annulment of the titles to the plots. Claiming that the plots in question had been in their families’ possession for many years, the applicants further requested that the land be registered in their name. The first-instance courts delivered their initial judgments on various dates between 1989 and 1991 in the presence of the representatives of both parties. The claims made by İsmail Akbulut, one of the applicants in cases nos. 4897/05 and 33694/05 were rejected on 20 December 1990 on the ground that he had already been granted the maximum amount of land in the same area permitted by the relevant law. The applicant did not appeal.
