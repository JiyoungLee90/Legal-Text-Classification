The Court reiterates that it is first of all for the domestic courts to assess the pertinence and admissibility of witness statements. However, the absence of any decision by the domestic courts in response to the applicant\u2019s request to hear O.G. raises in itself a serious issue under Article 6 of the Convention since it deprived the applicant of possibly an important means of defence (see, for instance, Vidal v.

Indeed, it was for the applicant and her lawyer to decide whether they could use the materials in question in her defence, while the final conclusion as to the importance of that evidence for the outcome of the case rested with the courts.
