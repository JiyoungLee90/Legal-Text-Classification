It held that the regulations which entitled the President of the NJO to reassign cases among courts (notably, sections 62 and 63 of Act no.\u00a0CLXI of 2011 on the Organisation and Administration of Courts, as in force between 1 January and 16 July 2012, see paragraph 20 below) had been unconstitutional and in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. According to the Constitutional Court, the right for one\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d (lawful) judge flows from the right to have one\u2019s case examined by a court \u201cestablished by law\u201d and requires that a case be heard by a judge belonging to the court with competence and territorial jurisdiction and designated by the pre-established objective rules of case assignment of that court. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, the impugned regulations, which had conferred responsibility for the reassignment of cases, at least in the material period, entirely on the President of the NJO, had been in breach of those principles. Moreover, it had violated the requirement of the appearance of impartiality. The Constitutional Court also held that the lack of a remedy against the decision of the President of the NJO had violated the Fundamental Law, as well as Article 13 of the Convention.",

However, this power involves an element of discretion, which could be misused as a means of putting pressure on judges by overburdening them with cases or by assigning them only low-profile cases.

The Constitutional Court had found that provision contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. The fact, that some courts in Hungary are so small that the designation of such a court would effectively amount to the designation of a single judge or a special chamber, further adds to this. Even though the reasonable time requirement is part of both Article XXVIII Fundamental Law and Article 6.1 ECHR, it is not absolute, but forms a field of tension with the often conflicting right to a fair trial with respect to the fact that having and exercising more procedural rights necessarily goes hand in hand with a longer duration of the proceedings. Taking into account the importance of the right to a lawful judge for a fair trial, the state has to resort to other less intrusive means, in particular to provide for a sufficient number of judges and court staff.

This can be done for example on the basis of alphabetical order, on the basis of a computerised system or on the basis of objective criteria such as categories of cases. The general rules (including exceptions) should be formulated by the law or by special regulations on the basis of the law, e.g. in court regulations laid down by the presidium or President.

The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these conditions are satisfied (see, among other authorities, McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, \u00a7 107, 10 September 2010). The application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article\u00a035 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 IV). An applicant who has availed himself of a remedy capable of redressing the situation giving rise to the alleged violation, directly and not merely indirectly, is not bound to have recourse to other remedies which would have been available to him but the effectiveness of which is questionable (see Manoussakis and Others v.\u00a0Greece, 26 September 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports 1996-IV, and Anakomba Yula v.\u00a0Belgium, no. 45413/07, \u00a7 22, 10 March 2009).",

Assuming that this was an effective remedy in the circumstances, the Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant had brought to the attention of the authorities its alleged grievance, thereby securing an opportunity for them to redress the issue. When arguing non-exhaustion, the Government have not pointed to any relevant legal provision or jurisprudence according to which the reassignment issue was a matter mandatorily to be severed from the fairness of the main procedure. The Court therefore considers that the applicant could reasonably expect that a comprehensive constitutional complaint introduced within the statutory time-limit counted from the service of the second-instance decision which includes the reassignment aspect will be entertained by the Constitutional Court as a whole, offering a reply to all the issues with bearing on the fairness of the procedure. For the Court, the fact that the Constitutional Court eventually severed the reassignment decision from the main procedure and sanctioned a different time-limit in that respect was not foreseeable in the least and cannot be reproached to the applicant with the benefit of hindsight.",

AB (see paragraph 16 above) that the provisions on reassignment, namely sections 62 and 63 of Act no. CLXI of 2011 on the Organisation and Administration of Courts, as in force between 1 January and 16 July 2012, had been unconstitutional. Although that conclusion was reached in the context of constitutional complaints originating in criminal proceedings, the Constitutional Court\u2019s findings were not limited to the reassignment of criminal trials in the sense that sections 62 and 63 had provided legal basis for reassignments in civil and criminal cases alike.",

For the Court, however, remains the fact that the legal provisions ultimately underlying the reassignment of the applicant\u2019s case were unconstitutional \u2013 and were found to be so by the Constitutional Court for reasons (see paragraph 21 above) which the Court agrees with. Indeed, the constitutional criticism of the impugned measure casts serious doubts on the Zalaegerszeg High Court being a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d in the applicant\u2019s case. The Court would add at this juncture that the failure of the domestic authorities to attach adequate legal consequences to the declaration of unconstitutionality affecting litigants in the applicant\u2019s position sits uncomfortably with the requirement of the effective protection of Convention rights including the ones enshrined in paragraph 1 of Article 6.",

Again, the Court would stress that the discretionary reassignment of the applicant\u2019s litigation was open to concerns in terms of domestic constitutionality.",
