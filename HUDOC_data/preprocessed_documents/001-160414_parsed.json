The decision to quash in the instant case occurred on 3\u00a0February 2006, that is to say before the applicant, the only party to the domestic proceedings complained of, passed away; unlike in other similar cases, he had not additionally complained about the nonenforcement of the judgment in his favour prior to its quashing (see, by contrast, Streltsov and other \u201cNovocherkassk military pensioners\u201d v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a08549/06 et al., \u00a7 41, 29\u00a0July 2010). Moreover, it appears that no outstanding judgment debt existed at the moment the present application was lodged. All payments due to the applicant under the judgment of 3\u00a0February 2006 had been made prior to its quashing on 1 February 2007. There is no indication that he or his heirs had to repay them after this judgment had been set aside. The Court further notes that unlike in many other similar cases concerning quashing of domestic judgments ordering regular payments in the applicants\u2019 favour, the judgment of 3 February 2006 of the Oktyabrskiy District Court specifically indicated that these payments were due to the applicant until 1 February 2007, that is to say until his next medical examination.
