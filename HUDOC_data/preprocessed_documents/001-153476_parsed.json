Accordingly, the execution of a judicial decision cannot be prevented, invalidated or unduly delayed (see, among other authorities, Hornsby v.\u00a0Greece, 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II). In terms of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court notes that a \u201cclaim\u201d can constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d if it is sufficiently established to be enforceable (see Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002-III) and reiterates that it is under this provision, as well as Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that the State has a positive obligation to organise a system for enforcement of judgments that is effective both in law and in practice and ensures their enforcement without undue delay (see Fuklev v. Ukraine, no.\u00a071186/01, \u00a7 84, 7 June 2005). The State must also make sure that the procedures provided for in the relevant domestic legislation are complied with (see ibid, \u00a7 91).",

Moreover, a failure to enforce a judgment because of the debtor\u2019s indigence cannot be held against the State unless and to the extent that it is imputable to the domestic authorities, for example, to their errors or delay in proceeding with the enforcement (see, mutatis mutandis, Omasta v.

Secondly, having adopted the enforcement order, the domestic courts were under an obligation to proceed ex officio. Thirdly, Serbia ratified the Convention on 3 March 2004, meaning that the proceedings in question have been within the Court\u2019s competence ratione temporis for a period of almost eleven years. Fourthly, during this time, the domestic courts attempted four times to seize the debtor\u2019s movable assets, terminated the enforcement proceedings, which decision was quashed on appeal, and most strikingly, took no substantive steps after the proceedings were stayed on 11 October 2007. Fifthly, the Municipal Court failed to inform the deceased debtor\u2019s heirs, the names and addresses of which had been apparently known to it, about the enforcement proceedings or else, to appoint them a temporary representative, contrary to Article 32 of the Enforcement Procedure Act 2000. Lastly, the applicant cannot be reproached for having failed to abide by contradictory instructions of the Municipal Court orders of 16 April and 8 June 2009. The Court therefore considers that the Serbian authorities did not act diligently or take sufficient steps to execute the final judgment of 18 February 2003, as modified on 23\u00a0August 2003.",
