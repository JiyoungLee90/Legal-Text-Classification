His appeal raised a number of points contesting inter alia the trial court\u2019s decision on the admissibility of certain pieces of evidence and the court\u2019s assessment of the evidence. Given the gravity of the charges against the applicant and the heavy custodial sentence to which he was liable, the Court considers that the assistance of a lawyer was essential for the applicant, as a lawyer would have been able to draw the appeal court\u2019s attention effectively to any substantial argument in the applicant\u2019s favour which might influence the court\u2019s decision. Therefore, in the Court\u2019s point of view, the interests of justice demanded that the applicant should have had legal assistance at this stage of the proceedings.",
