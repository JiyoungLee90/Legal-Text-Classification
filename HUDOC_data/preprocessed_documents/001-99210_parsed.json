Thereafter, the second applicant was brought from Kurgan remand centre no.\u00a01 to Shadrinsk and made confessions in respect of murdering victim K. and some other offences. The second applicant was questioned by investigator P. in relation to the murder; Officer Ya. was in charge of the video recording of the interview; Officer Ba. was also present. The second applicant was then brought to Kurgan remand centre no.\u00a02. A week later he was brought to the Unit for questioning and a visit from his family. However, in the meantime, he cut his veins and was admitted to hospital for treatment. On the same day he was brought back to the Unit and retracted his earlier confessions in the presence of investigator P. and chose to remain silent. The applicant was brought back to the remand centre. Subsequently, it was established that the first applicant had tried to compel the second applicant to retract his confessions. Officer Ya. also stated that in May 1999 the first applicant had been brought in for questioning. After his refusal to testify, he had been taken for a medical examination (for unspecified reasons) and had then been placed in the temporary detention centre of Shadrinsk. Both applicants had lodged numerous complaints against various officers of the Organised Crime Unit. However, the inquiries had disclosed no unlawful actions on their part. Except for the murder of K., the other episodes of criminal activity had been dealt with by the Shadrinsk office of the Interior.",

However, she should, for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) of the Convention, be regarded as a witness because her statement during the identity parade procedure, as taken down by the investigating authority, was used at the trial. In the circumstances, the Court considers that there was no material difference between a recorded deposition by a witness and the result of an identity parade since both are capable of furnishing evidence against a defendant in a criminal trial (see also Mirilashvili v.\u00a0, no.\u00a06293/04, \u00a7 159, 11\u00a0December 2008).",

The trial court also referred to the pre-trial statement by the applicants' accomplice (see paragraph 40 above). The remaining witness statements referred to by the trial court without any further discussion of their probative value were secondary, in particular in so far they mostly concerned the assessment of the relationship between the victim and the first applicant.",

As a general rule, they require that the defendant be given an adequate opportunity to examine a witness against him or have that witness examined, either when he or she makes statements or at a later stage (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, \u00a7\u00a051, Reports 1997-III, and L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, 15\u00a0June 1992, \u00a7 49, Series A no.\u00a0238). Indeed, it may prove necessary in certain circumstances to refer to statements made before the trial. If the defendant has been given an adequate opportunity to challenge the statements, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (see, for instance, Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, \u00a7\u00a0117, 1\u00a0March 2007).",

Bulgaria, no.\u00a060018/00, \u00a7 43, 8 June 2006).",

Indeed, as submitted by the Government, the trial court did not refer to the record of her pre-trial interview with the investigative authority. Instead, the trial court relied on the identification report. It has not been submitted, and the Court does not consider, that besides seeking S.'s examination at the trial the second applicant failed to use any other procedural means for effectively contesting the incriminating evidence received from S. (see, mutatis mutandis, Craxi v. Italy (no. 1), no.\u00a034896/97, \u00a7\u00a7 90-93, 5 December 2002). The available material before the Court does not disclose that every reasonable effort was made to bring S. before the trial court (see paragraph 44 above). Nor do the circumstances of the case disclose any valid excuse for failure to comply with the court summons. This being so, the second applicant was not afforded an effective opportunity to examine S. or have her examined at another stage of the proceedings (see Melnikov v.
