Another plot could not be taken into account as the respective contract had not been concluded within the one-year period provided for under section 1a(2) of the supplementary provisions of the 1996 Act (see paragraph 26 below), namely between July 2010 and July 2011; the contract at issue had been concluded in April 2010, and the plot concerned had been sold for about BGN 6 (EUR 3) per square metre.

The price of that plot had been about BGN 225 (EUR 115) per square metre.

It agreed to pay compensation of BGN 20.05 (equivalent to EUR 10) per square metre to the owners.

As regards the latter plot, the Court takes note of the Government\u2019s arguments (see paragraph 50 above) that it was not comparable to the first applicant\u2019s land, as well as the more general arguments about the quality of his land (see paragraph 48 above). While such arguments might be, in principle, relevant, it is significant that in the case at hand the Supreme Administrative Court found the plot at issue to be comparable, complying with the requirements of domestic law, and that had at least one other comparable plot been found, its value (BGN 225, equivalent of EUR 115 per square metre) would have been relied on to calculate the fair market value of the first applicant\u2019s land.

Neither do the documents provided to it allow the Court to determine precisely such market value. Nevertheless, the materials submitted to it are sufficient to establish major discrepancies between the values discussed above as being indicative of market prices, between BGN\u00a06 (EUR 3) and BGN 225 (EUR 115) in the case of the first applicant and between BGN 20.05 (EUR 10) and BGN 25 (EUR 13) in the case of the second and third applicants (see paragraphs 82-83 above), and the compensation actually awarded \u2013 an average of BGN 0.22 (EUR 0.11) per square metre in the case of the first applicant and BGN 0.84 (EUR 0.43) per square metre in the case of the second and third applicants. The question of these discrepancies was never explained by the Supreme Administrative Court in terms of individual characteristics of the applicants\u2019 property or other relevant factors, as it never actually addressed it. Yet, these discrepancies seem to justify precisely the fears expressed by the judges who dissented in the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 4 July 2006, stating that compensation calculated under section 32(3) of the 1996 Act, as in the cases under examination, would be \u201cevidently and dramatically lower\u201d than fair market values (see paragraph 38 above).",
