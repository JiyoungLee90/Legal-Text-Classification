It appears that until now the courts only dealt with the specific case of providing a report by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office on the essential results of the investigations to lay judges, which they considered as unlawful. The Supreme Court of the German Reich, referring to the legislator\u2019s will as apparent from the law\u2019s drafting history, specified in this respect that providing [the report to lay judges] contravened the principles of oral proceedings and immediacy. Lay judges risked mixing up their impressions from that report with those from the main hearing whereas professional judges, as a rule, were able to distinguish between the two sources of information due to their training and professional experience (see Collection of the Decisions of the Supreme Court of the German Reich (RGSt), vol.\u00a069, pp. 120, 124). The Federal Court of Justice has until now shared this legal opinion (BGHSt, vol. 5, pp.\u00a0261 et seq.; ... BGHSt, vol. 13, pp. 73 et seq. ...; Juristische Rundschau (JR), 1987, p.\u00a0389). However, the First Senate, in an obiter dictum, raised doubts as to whether it would further follow these precedents, because different treatment for professional and lay judges was not provided for by law and no convincing reasons could be given for it. Lay judges, who were called upon to decide on all difficult factual and legal issues together and of equal rank with the professional judges, could well be believed to be capable of understanding the sense and meaning of the bill of indictment (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 23 February 1960, no.\u00a01 StR 648/59).",

As confirmed not only by Article 126 \u00a7 3 of the Directives for Criminal Proceedings and Proceedings Concerning Regulatory Offences, but in particular by the well-established case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, lay judges risked being unduly influenced by this pre-assessment of the evidence made by the prosecution and thus risked being prejudiced against a defendant if they took note of this part of the bill of indictment before or during the trial.

Despite having been cautioned by the professional judges, the lay judges could not be considered as having been able to distinguish between the criminal proceedings against the applicant and those against his sister. This was proved by the fact that even the professional judges had confounded the different defendants and the assessment of the evidence in the two sets of proceedings in their judgment against the applicant.

Lay judges had equal status as professional judges during the trial. There was no statutory provision which precluded giving lay judges a full copy of the bill of indictment. On the contrary, the exercise of their functions with equal voting rights (see Article 30 of the Courts Organisation Act) warranted that they disposed of the same information as professional judges. Article 126 \u00a7 3 of the Directives for Criminal Proceedings and Proceedings Concerning Regulatory Offences only lay down recommendations which were not binding for the courts and of which the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office could diverge if the special circumstances of a case called for such divergence. After all, lay judges were also considered capable of basing their judgment only on the admissible evidence taken at the trial in other circumstances, for example in cases of biased media coverage of the proceedings or in cases in which the use of evidence taken at the trial later proved to be prohibited.",

The contents of the latter therefore had to be introduced into her trial. This had been done by providing the lay judges with a copy of the bill of indictment, instead of reading the bill out in its entirety in open court, in order to help the lay judges with the performance of their task. By cautioning the lay judges that the essential part of the investigations reflected the prosecution\u2019s view and could not be considered as a basis for the judgment in the applicant\u2019s case, the professional judges had taken the necessary measures to enable the lay judges to distinguish between the two sets of proceedings.

It follows that when it is being decided whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular body lacks impartiality, the standpoint of those claiming that it is not impartial is important but not decisive.

Even though it recently expressed doubts as to whether it would uphold that case-law in the future, the Federal Court of Justice has nevertheless consistently found until the 1980s that providing the essential results of the investigations to lay judges would contravene the Code of Criminal Procedure as lay judges risked mixing up the contents of the essential results of the investigations, containing the prosecution\u2019s evaluation of the evidence, with the matters from the main hearing. Likewise, Article 126 \u00a7 3 of the Directives for Criminal Proceedings and Proceedings Concerning Regulatory Offences provides that that part of the indictment may not be disclosed to lay judges.",

Moreover, the reason for this disclosure was not to provide the lay judges with the prosecution\u2019s evaluation of the available evidence but to give them the necessary information on the exact contents of a confession made in the court hearing itself: The applicant\u2019s sister had made a general statement that she confessed to the offences as described in the essential results of the investigations without, however, being willing to set out her confession in a more detailed manner. It was therefore necessary to clarify at the trial the full contents of her confession which she had made by merely referring to a part of the bill of indictment. Normally this would be done by reading out the essential results of the investigations in open court. Instead of reading out the information, the lay judges read it themselves.

It emerges from the lay judges\u2019 declaration made following the applicant\u2019s motion for bias against them that the president of the chamber had explained to them the nature of the essential results of the investigations prior to providing them with a copy. They had understood that the prosecution\u2019s view expressed therein was not the basis for the judgment to be rendered in the applicant\u2019s case, which was to be grounded on the evidence taken in the main hearing alone. The Court further notes that the lay judges had knowledge of the impugned part of the bill of indictment since the fifteenth day of the hearing in the applicant\u2019s case and that more than twenty further hearings were held afterwards in which evidence was taken before the  delivered its judgment in the applicant\u2019s case.
