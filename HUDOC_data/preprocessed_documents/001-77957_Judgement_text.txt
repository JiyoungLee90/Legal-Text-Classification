The case originated in two applications (nos. 12023/04 and 12096/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Mr Eduard Sergiyovych Bagriy (“the first applicant”) and Mr Fedir Vasylyovych Krivanich (“the second applicant”), on 10 March 2004.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs V. Lutkovska and Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 7 July 2005 the Court decided to communicate the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
The first applicant was born in 1970. The second applicant was born in 1965. Both of them are Ukrainian nationals, who live in the city of Kirovograd, .
On unspecified dates the applicants retired from the army. Upon retirement, the applicants became entitled to compensation for their uniforms and travel expenses. As these compensations remained unpaid, they instituted proceedings in the Kirovogradskiy District Court (Місцевий суд Кіровоградського району) against their former employer, a military unit. The first applicant instituted proceedings in 2003 seeking compensation for his uniform and travel expenses. The second applicant instituted proceedings in 2002 seeking compensation for his uniform and moral damage.
On 10 September 2003 the court awarded the first applicant UAH 1,740.91 for the uniform and UAH 360 for travel expenses. On 20 February 2003 the court awarded the second applicant UAH 2,532.05 for the uniform and UAH 2,000 in compensation for moral damage.
The above judgments have been enforced in part. The first applicant received UAH 360, the outstanding judgment debt being 1,740.91. The second applicant received UAH 3,805.04, the outstanding judgment debt being UAH 732.05.
In January and February 2004, the Kirovograd Regional Department of Justice informed the applicants that the rest of the amounts awarded could not be paid due to the debtor's lack of funds and that the procedure for the forced sale of assets belonging to the debtor was barred by the Law of 26 November 2001 “On the Introduction of a Moratorium on the Forced Sale of Property” (Закон України “Про введення мораторiю на примусову реалiзацiю майна”).
On 18 June 2004 the Kirovograd Bailiffs' Service returned the writs of execution to the applicants.
