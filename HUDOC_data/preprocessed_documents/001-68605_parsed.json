Section\u00a0162 provides for oral hearings in succession proceedings on the determination of an heir (Verfahren \u00fcber das Erbrecht), in particular. Section 185 stipulates that, with the exception of proceedings on the determination of an heir (Section\u00a0162), there are no public hearings in succession proceedings (Verlassenschaftsverfahren).",
