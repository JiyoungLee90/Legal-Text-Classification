The Court considers that the applicant's right to have his case re-examined on appeal under these new rules of criminal procedure was protected by the fundamental guarantees contained in Article\u00a06 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Delcourt v.

Furthermore, in accordance with Article 391.3 of the CCrP, if the Court of Appeal finds that it has no such competence, it must issue a decision on refusal to admit the appeal for examination and/or refer it to a competent court. Accordingly, even if the Court of Appeal were to find that it had no competence to hear the applicant's appeal on the merits, it was still obliged under the domestic law to hold a preliminary hearing and adopt a decision on the inadmissibility of the appeal within 15 days of receipt of the applicant's appellate complaint.",

Ireland, judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p.\u00a01213, \u00a7\u00a024). At the time of lodging his appeal and during the following period of at least two years, the applicant was not afforded sufficient safeguards to prevent a misunderstanding of the procedure made available to him under the Transitional Law and was led to believe that his case would be examined by the Court of Appeal. In view of the peculiarities of this case, the Court finds that it was for the Court of Appeal to take steps to ensure that the applicant enjoyed effectively the right to which he was entitled under the Transitional Law.
