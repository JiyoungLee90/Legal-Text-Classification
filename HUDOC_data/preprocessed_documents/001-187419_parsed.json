It identified three different periods\u00a0in this regard: the first period up until 15 August 2008,\u00a0the date of publication of Framework Decision no.\u00a02008/675/JAI; the second extending between that date and the date of publication of Organic Law no. 7/2014 of 12\u00a0November 2014 on the exchange of information from police records and taking account of criminal court decisions in the EU, which had come into force on 3\u00a0December 2014; and lastly, the third period from the date of publication of the aforementioned organic law to the present day. As regards the first period, the Supreme Court noted that the Spanish courts had only agreed to take account of sentences imposed abroad alongside those imposed in Spain where the sentence imposed abroad was to be served in Spain under an international treaty on the execution of criminal judgments (for example a bilateral treaty or the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on the Transfer of Convicted persons). On the other hand, it pointed out that when the sentence had already been served abroad, there was no reason to consider it in connection with sentences to be served in Spain for the purposes of implementing the maximum prison term (judgment\u00a0no.\u00a02117/2002 of 18 December 2002). Concerning the second period (mid-August 2008 to November 2014), the Supreme Court observed that under the Framework Decision itself (Article\u00a03 \u00a7 5),\u00a0it was not compulsory for States to take account of a sentence imposed in another Member State for the purposes of applying the maximum prison term set out in the Penal Code. The court added, however, that as it transpired from its judgment no.\u00a0186/2014 of 13 March 2014, in the absence of domestic legislation transposing the Framework Decision or of rules expressly governing this matter, the rules in force should be interpreted in a manner as compatible as possible with the content of European regulations, provided that such interpretation was not contra legem where domestic law was concerned. It pointed out that it was in that context that judgment no.\u00a0186/2014, which had been enacted before the transposition of the Framework Decision, had agreed to take into consideration a sentence imposed in France for the purposes of grouping it together with sentences subsequently imposed in Spain. Finally, as regards the third period, the Supreme Court noted that Organic Law no. 7/2014 had incorporated the Framework Decision into Spanish law, while expressly ruling out the effects of sentences imposed in another Member State in calculating the length of sentences given in Spain for offences committed before any sentences handed down by the courts of the other Member State (section 14 (2) of Organic Law no. 7/2014). It considered that under those circumstances, even though the aim was not to apply that law directly, its existence meant that it was no longer possible to interpret Spanish law (Article\u00a070.2 of the Penal Code and section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act) in the previously accepted sense, that is to say in favour of taking into account sentences imposed in another Member State for the purposes of calculating the maximum prison term. Given that the Spanish State, through the intermediary of its legislature, had expressed its choice in the transposition of the Framework Decision, ruling out any consideration of sentences imposed in another Member State, the previous interpretation was no longer possible, because it was no longer praeter legem but contra legem.",

It took the view that the change of interpretation could not be compared with the reversal of case-law which had given rise to the case of Del R\u00edo Prada. Firstly, the Supreme Court held that it would be difficult for an interpretation based on such a legal instrument as a Framework Decision, which itself introduced optional exceptions for its transposition, to give rise to legitimate expectations. Secondly, it considered that it was a case of a pre-established case-law or interpretative practice laying down the general rule of consideration of sentences already served abroad. Thirdly, it pointed out that judgment no.\u00a0186/2014 of 13 March 2014 had been the first decision in which it had been called upon to interpret the Framework Decision, at a time when the commonly accepted practice of the courts in similar cases had been to refuse to take account of sentences served abroad. Fourthly, the court emphasised that in the absence of any established case-law, the first applicant could not, when he had been serving his prison sentence, have legitimately expected that the sentence already served in France would be taken into consideration for the purposes of applying the maximum prison term in Spain. It concluded that even though the impugned interpretation differed from that adopted in judgment\u00a0no.\u00a0186/2014, that change was not such as to infringe any expectation on the first applicant\u2019s part based on reasonable foreseeability. Moreover, it considered that that foreseeability could never have existed either at the time the first applicant had committed the offences in France (1987) or at the time the decision was taken to group together sentences in Spain (2006), since the Framework Decision had not yet been adopted then and no judicial precedent had supported the taking into account of sentences served abroad. Finally, the Supreme Court held that the first applicant must have known that the Framework Decision had to be implemented at the domestic level, and pointed out that such transposition would determine whether or not sentences imposed in another Member State could be taken into account under the optional exception set forth in Article 3 \u00a7 5 of the Framework Decision itself. It noted that ultimately, Spanish law as a whole, including the relevant case-law, had not been drawn up sufficiently precisely for the argument advanced by the applicant to be accepted as established and evident.",

According to the case-law of the CJEU (case of Pupino, judgment of 16 June 2005, C-105/3), the binding nature of such framework decisions imposes on the national authorities, and in particular the national courts, an obligation of interpretation in conformity with national law. In applying national law, a national court called upon to interpret the latter is required to do so as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the framework decision in order to achieve the outcome pursued by that decision. This obligation ceases where national law cannot be the subject of a mode of application leading to a result compatible with that pursued by the framework decision. In other words, the compatible interpretation principle cannot serve as the basis for an interpretation contra legem of national law. That principle nevertheless requires the national court to take account, where appropriate, of national law in its entirety in order to assess the extent to which it can be applied in such a way as to avoid a result contrary to that pursued by the framework decision.",

The decisions given by that court concerning the three applicants in the present case followed the same reasoning (see paragraphs 16, 39 and 61 above). Those decisions did not become final, since they were set aside by the Supreme Court following the appeals on points of law lodged by the public prosecutor\u2019s office for the purposes of clarifying the law. Moreover, it transpires from the information supplied by the parties that in three different cases concerning other defendants, the sectional decisions in their favour were not the subject of an appeal on points of law and therefore became res judicata (two decisions of 9 June 2014 and one decision of 24\u00a0November 2014).",

It held that such an action did not have to be lodged where the judicial authorities had already had an opportunity to decide on the fundamental rights subsequently relied on in the framework of the amparo appeal. The Constitutional Court considered that the aim of the rule on exhaustion of available domestic remedies was to preserve the subsidiary nature of the amparo remedy, so that the ordinary courts could consider and, where appropriate, remedy the alleged fundamental rights violations. The Constitutional Court pointed out that this reasoning also applied in cases where the rights violation had originated in a single judicial decision given by a court at first instance and where the subject matter of the dispute before that court had entailed assessing the alleged violation of the fundamental right in issue. In that case, the aim of bringing an action for annulment would merely be to seek a re-examination of the merits of the decision by the same court, on the basis of arguments analogous to those used during the main proceedings.",

The court held that the Supreme Court had not retroactively applied Organic Law no. 7/2014 \u2013 which had entered into force after the applicant\u2019s request to group his sentences together \u2013 but had mentioned it solely in order to back up its interpretation of Framework Decision no.\u00a02008/675/JAI, particularly in relation to the exception set out in Article\u00a03 \u00a7 5 of that legal instrument. As regards the allegation of possible retroactive application of case-law unfavourable to the convicted person, the Constitutional Court drew a distinction between the case in question and Del R\u00edo Prada. It noted that when the total sentence to be served had been fixed in 2007 and throughout the execution of the sentence in Spain, the applicant had obtained no decision in favour of taking account of the sentence served in France. The court therefore considered that criminal legislation had been applied clearly and in complete conformity with existing judicial practice, without ever encouraging the applicant to hope that the sentence which he had served in France would be taken into account in determining the maximum prison term in Spain. It noted that the only requests which the applicant had submitted for such an eventuality had been in 2013, that is to say after the 2007 decision to group decisions together, and they had all been dismissed. It consequently considered that in the instant case there had been no retroactive application of an unfavourable interpretation inconsistent with the judicial practice applicable at the time when the sentence had been determined. The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant had only claimed that a possible interpretation of a previous legal rule, that is to say the rule laid down in judgment no.\u00a0186/2014 of the Supreme Court, had been applied to him retroactively. In fact, under the principle of equality before the law, it had noted that that interpretation \u2013 adopted by a five-judge section of the Supreme Court the first time that court had been called upon to adjudicate on the Framework Decision \u2013 had remained isolated and been rejected a few months later by the Plenary Supreme Court in its judgment no.\u00a0874/2014. Moreover, the Constitutional Court observed that the detailed reasoning of that judgment had not been based on an arbitrary or unreasonable interpretation of the applicable legislation. For all those reasons it declared the amparo appeal inadmissible, since there had manifestly been no violation of the fundamental rights relied upon (including the principle that only a statute can define offences and lay down penalties, the right to liberty, the right to equality before the law, the right to equality before the law).",

In that connection, the Government relied on judgment no.\u00a0216/2013 of 19 December 2013 of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph\u00a086 above). They pointed out that that court had declared the amparo inadmissible for failure to exercise the action for annulment before the ordinary courts. Furthermore, in the case of the applicant, his lawyer had not even lodged an action for annulment and, in the case of the other two applicants, their lawyers had requested the withdrawal of the actions which they had lodged with the Supreme Court.

Spain, no. 38695/97, \u00a7 36, ECHR\u00a02000-II, and De la Fuente Ariza v. Spain, no. 3321/04, \u00a7 22, 8\u00a0November 2007). Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Zubac v. Croatia [GC], no. 40160/12, \u00a7 78, 5 April 2018, and Arribas Ant\u00f3n v. Spain, no. 16563/11, \u00a7 41, 20 January 2015). The right of access to a court is impaired when the rules cease to serve the aims of legal certainty and the proper administration of justice and form a sort of barrier preventing the litigant from having his or her case determined on the merits by the competent court\u00a0(see Kart v. Turkey [GC], no. 8917/05, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2009 (extracts)).",

Furthermore, the compatibility of limitations laid in domestic law with the right of access to a court as secured by Article 6 depends on the specific features of the proceedings in issue. The Court has several times found that the imposition by the national courts of compliance with formalities in order to lodge an appeal is liable to breach the right of access to a court. This is the case when an excessively formalistic interpretation of a legal provision prevents de facto the consideration of the merits of a remedy exercised by a litigant (see, for example, Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04855, ECHR\u00a02002IX; De la Fuente Ariza, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 24-28; and Ferr\u00e9 Gisbert, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28-33).

It is true that those two applicants subsequently withdrew their actions for annulment before applying to the Constitutional Court, but the Supreme Court nonetheless served them with a decision declaring the actions inadmissible as irrelevant. That decision was served after the expiry of the thirty-day legal time-limit for lodging the amparo appeal and after the applicants in question had lodged that appeal with the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 31 and 50 above).

It notes in that regard that the Government relies on a Constitutional Court judgment of 2013 establishing the criteria for determining when the exercise of an action for annulment was required before an application to that higher court (see paragraph\u00a086 above). The Court notes, however, that that judgment stated that the use of such an action was not required where the court having originated the impugned judicial decision given at first instance had already adjudicated on the allegations of fundamental rights violations which were subsequently to be put forward in the framework of the amparo appeal.

Furthermore, the decisions of the Audiencia Nacional in the three applicants\u2019 favour had been given one day before the entry into force of that law and had been immediately challenged before the Supreme Court, and the latter had quashed and annulled them in line with the approach adopted in its leading judgment no.\u00a0874/2014 of 27\u00a0January 2015, which was adopted by the plenary court.

In the case of the first and third applicants, that measure was also the result of a decision to group together the various sentences imposed in the framework of separate sets of criminal proceedings, having regard to the chronological connection between the offences committed, on the basis of section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Under Spanish law, a sentence to be served resulting from that maximum prison term and from those decisions to group sentences together and/or set au upper limit on them was conceived of as a new independent sentence (see, to that effect, Del R\u00edo Prada, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97-99). Furthermore, it was from that latter sentence that such prison benefits as remissions of sentence (see paragraphs 14, 41 and 59 above; see also Del R\u00edo Prada, cited above, \u00a7 99) and periods spent in pre-trial detention were to be deducted.",

On the contrary, it was a measure which concerned the extent of the sentences imposed on the applicants (see also, as regards combining multiple sentences into an overall sentence, Koprivnikar v.

Latvia [GC], no. 17502/07, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2016).",

The subject matter of the dispute before the Spanish courts was whether, in order to implement that maximum term, account should be taken of sentences already served by the applicants in France under the convictions handed down in France for criminal offences committed in that State. The decisions given by the Audiencia Nacional in favour of taking account of those sentences never became res judicata, because the public prosecutor\u2019s office appealed against them on points of law to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the Spanish judicial system, with jurisdiction to determine divergences among the lower courts in the application of the law. The fact that the first and second applicants were released on licence pursuant to the Audiencia Nacional\u2019s decisions in favour of considering the French sentences, pending the outcome of the appeals on points of law, did not alter the non-final nature of those decisions.",

Section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act on the consideration of sentences imposed in the framework of separate criminal proceedings did not include any specific rule on taking account of sentences imposed abroad. The only precedents in favour of such consideration of sentences concerned sentences imposed abroad prior to being served in Spain under an international treaty on the transfer of convicted persons, but not sentences already completed abroad (see paragraph 21 above). In the only case similar to that of the applicants (Supreme Court judgment no.\u00a02117/2002, see paragraph\u00a082 above), the Supreme Court had refused to take into account a sentence already served in France. That lack of foreseeability might explain the fact that at the time the applicants had not requested the consideration of the sentences served in France, even though the latter had ended in 1995, 1996 and 2000 respectively. Even the third applicant, who had requested consideration of his sentence on 4 December 2012, when Framework Decision no.\u00a02008/675/JAI was already in force, had not referred to the sentence served in France and/or the Framework Decision (see paragraph 57 above).

In that judgment the Supreme Court had been called upon for the first time to interpret Framework Decision no.\u00a02008/675/JAI, and even though it had been in favour of the possibility of taking account of sentences served in another EU Member State for the purposes of grouping sentences together, it pointed out that this stance had been adopted because there was no national legislation transposing the Framework Decision or any explicit regulation on that matter (see paragraph 83 above). Pursuing that approach, some sections of the Criminal Division of the Audiencia Nacional have grouped sentences served in France together with sentences imposed in Spain for the purpose of determining the maximum thirty-year prison term. All these decisions, apart from three isolated cases, were set aside by the Supreme Court after the public prosecutor\u2019s office had lodged appeals on points of law and after the adoption by the Plenary Criminal Division of the Supreme Court of its judgment\u00a0no.\u00a0874/2014 of 27 January 2015 (see paragraph 85 above). The Court observes that under Spanish law, precedents are not a source of law and that only case-law repeatedly established by the Supreme Court can complement law (see paragraph 89 above). At all events, irrespective of whether isolated judgment no.\u00a0186/2014 of 13\u00a0March 2014 set an authoritative precedent under Spanish law (see, mutatis mutandis, Del R\u00edo Prada, \u00a7\u00a0112), the Court considers that that judgment was not accompanied by a judicial or administrative practice consolidated over time which could have created legitimate expectations in the applicants as regards a stable interpretation if criminal law. The present case clearly differs in that respect from Del R\u00edo Prada, where the applicant could reasonably have thought, while she was serving her prison sentence and when the decision to combine the sentences and fix a maximum prison term was taken, that the remissions of sentence for work done in prison would be deducted from the maximum thirty-year prison term in accordance with the established practice that had been applied consistently by the Spanish prison and judicial authorities for many years (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 98-100, 103, 112-113). It was with regard to that previous practice concerning the interpretation of criminal law and the scope of the sentence imposed that the Court considered that the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law reversal (the \u201cParot\u00a0doctrine\u201d) as applied to the applicant could not be deemed foreseeable, and that consequently there had been a violation of Article 7 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 111-118).",

It accepts that achieving consistency of the law may take time, and periods of conflicting case-law may therefore be tolerated when the domestic legal system is capable of accommodating them (see, mutatis mutandis, Borcea v.\u00a0Romania (dec.), no. 55959/14, \u00a7\u00a066, 22\u00a0September 2015). In the present case, the highest court in Spain in matters of criminal law, that is to say the Supreme Court (its plenary Criminal Division), settled the divergence in question by adjudicating on the issue of taking account of sentences served in another EU Member State.
