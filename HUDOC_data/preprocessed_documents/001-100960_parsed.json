Therefore the Court considers that the applicant could have challenged the investigator\u2019s order to seize the amount. Furthermore, irrespective of whether the amount continued to be seized as a guarantee or as physical evidence, it was open for the applicant to request its return from the prosecutor or from the court (see paragraphs 32, 33 and 35 above). He however, did not try to avail himself of any of these remedies. As to his argument that he stood no chance of success (see paragraph 54 above), the Court reiterates that the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies (see, among many other authorities, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 71, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV; T.A. and Others v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), no. 44911/98, 19 January 1999; and Muazzez Ep\u00f6zdemir v.
