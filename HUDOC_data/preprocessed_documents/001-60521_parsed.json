Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3. Treatment has been held by the Court to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them. In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of violation of Article 3 (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, 6.4.2000, \u00a7\u00a7 119-120, ECHR 2000-IV). Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (loc. cit., \u00a7 121).

The Court considers that the degree of bruising found by the various experts who examined the applicants indicates that the injuries were sufficiently serious to amount to ill-treatment within the scope of Article 3 (see, mutatis mutandis, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 24760/94, 28.10.1998, \u00a7 95, ECHR 1998-VIII). It remains to be considered whether the State should be held responsible under Article 3 in respect of these injuries.",

It is also uncontested that the police officers used force on 4 October 1993 at the athletics club and while carrying the applicants to the police van in order to effect the arrest against which the applicants resisted. The parties disagree however on whether the applicants were beaten up whilst being taken to the police station in the police vehicle (see \u00a7\u00a7 16-18 above). It must be noted that the applicants' allegation that they had been beaten up while lying handcuffed in the van had not been confirmed following the domestic investigation of their complaints at two levels (see \u00a7\u00a7 38-39 above; also see \u00a7\u00a7 66-71 below). While the Court is not bound by the findings of the domestic authorities as to facts alleged to be in breach of the Convention, the Court, on the basis of the parties observations and the material in possession, finds it impossible to establish whether any ill-treatment occurred in the police van as alleged by the applicants.

Secondly, while the six police officers outnumbered the two applicants, account must be taken of the fact that the applicants were practising bodybuilders, and that they effectively resisted the legitimate actions of the police officers - by refusing to comply with the verbal demands to leave the athletics club, resisting the attempts of the policemen to apprehend them, and kicking two officers (see, by contrast, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, 28.11.2000, ECHR 200-XII, where thirteen police officers had had sufficient time to evaluate the possible risks in connection with the arrest of three suspects, and where an applicant had shown no sign of resisting the arrest). Worse still, the applicants submitted to the arrest only when threatened with a gun, and were subsequently convicted of an assault on the policemen. The Court agrees with the domestic courts' conclusion that the applicants lacked a critical judgment of their own conduct when faced with a simple obligation to submit to the legitimate requirements of the law enforcement officers - an obligation which is part of the general civil duty in a democratic society. These circumstances count heavily against the applicants, with the result that the Government's burden to prove that the use of force was not excessive in this case is less stringent (see, mutatis mutandis, loc. cit., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a065-78).

Thus, Article\u00a06\u00a0-\u00a0especially paragraph 3 - may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions. The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) is to be applied during the preliminary investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case (see Brennan v. the United Kingdom, no. 39846/98, 16.10.2001, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2001-X).

The question, in each case, is whether the restriction, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, has deprived the accused of a fair hearing (also see the Brennan case cited above, ibid.). ",

It is also uncontested that the applicants' request for an official lawyer to be appointed was ignored by the authorities, with the result that they had no defence counsel for more than a year. Given that a number of procedural acts, including questioning of the applicants and their medical examinations, were carried out during that period (see \n\u00a7\u00a7 40-45 above), the Court finds no justification for this restriction which deprived the applicants of the right to adequately defend themselves during the investigation and trial.
