While accepting that such directions may have the effect of speeding up the course of the proceedings if the court in question acts upon them immediately, the Court notes that this rule does not lay down any practical steps the Supreme Court can take to expedite the proceedings complained of or any sanction for failure of the relevant court to comply with the specific directions.

Notwithstanding, having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that this is not sufficient to justify the overall length of the proceedings before the District Court of Limassol, the latter also being responsible, inter alia, for failing to review the progress of the case when it was off the trial list.
