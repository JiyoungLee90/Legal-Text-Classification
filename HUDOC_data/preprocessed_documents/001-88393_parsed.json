In this connection, the Court notes that a medical examination, together with the right of access to a lawyer and the right to inform a third party of the detention, constitute fundamental safeguards against the ill-treatment of detained persons which should apply as from the very outset of deprivation of liberty, regardless of how it may be described under the legal system concerned (apprehension, arrest, etc.) (see the 2nd General Report of the European Committee for Prevention of Torture, CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 - Rev. 2006, \u00a7\u00a036). The Court observes that three months after the events in the present case, Turkish legislation was aligned with these CPT standards, when the medical examination of suspects on being taken into custody became a requirement through the Directive on Apprehension, Arrest and Taking of Statements dated 1 October 1998 (see paragraph 28 above).",

Furthermore, the use of force in the context of an arrest, even if it entails injury, may fall outside Article 3, particularly in circumstances resulting from an applicant\u2019s own conduct (see Berli\u0144ski v. , nos.\u00a027715/95 and 30209/96, \u00a7 64, 20 June 2002).

In this context, the Court attaches great importance to the fact that the applicant, in his statements to the investigating authorities (11, 12, 16, 17, 18 and 25), was unequivocal in his account that he had been illtreated by police officers while in custody at the Esenler terminal police station. He gave a detailed account of the treatment he had suffered and a description of the police officers who had inflicted the illtreatment (see paragraph 12 above). Furthermore, the investigating authorities did nothing to determine the cause of the physical trauma suffered by the applicant. In view of the police officers\u2019 denials and the defence submissions that the injuries in question could have been inflicted by the persons with whom the applicant had allegedly had a fight, the judicial authorities could have taken statements from those persons and any possible witnesses at the bus terminal with a view to verifying such allegations.",
