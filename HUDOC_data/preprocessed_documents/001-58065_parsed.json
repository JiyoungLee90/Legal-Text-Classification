It is to be assumed that, by virtue of the requirements of Article 977 NCCP, a copy of that judgment would, in any event, have formed part of the case file forwarded to the registrar of the Court of Cassation from the registry of the Court of Appeal, so that its absence from the material annexed with the pleadings lodged by the applicant company would have been readily apparent.

Even, however, if this should have been foreseeable, the question remains whether the limitation on the right of access to a court represented by Article 979 NCCP and the way in which that Article was applied in the present case restricts that right to an impermissible extent, having regard to the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1) as interpreted by the Court.",

For a court of final jurisdiction to be in a position to declare, of its own motion and three years to the day after the appeal was lodged, that an appeal on a point of law is inadmissible because a party has failed to produce a document which is required to be among those available in any event in that court\u2019s own registry, and which could also be obtained by a simple request to that party, in our view goes beyond reasonable proportionality. Rules of procedure and their observance are, of course, generally necessary for the administration of justice; but the dismissal of an appeal on so minor a matter of form, and the consequent removal of the possibility of an adjudication on the merits, without the appellant\u2019s having been given an opportunity to remedy an omission which could so easily have been repaired, seems to us to be excessive.",
