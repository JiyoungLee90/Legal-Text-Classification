The decision to quash that final judgment was also based on the ground that the lower courts, without properly assessing the evidence, had presumed that the applicant\u2019s injuries had been committed by the defendant in that case, without proving his guilt, thus violating the principle of the presumption of innocence. While concluding that there had been no breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in that case, the Court held (\u00a7\u00a7 36 et seq.) that the proceedings had been reopened for the purposes of correcting a fundamental judicial error which could not have been neutralised or corrected by any means other than quashing the final judgment which was grossly prejudicial to the convicted person.

The Court has emphasised that the requirements of legal certainty are not absolute, in particular in criminal proceedings. In such cases, they must be assessed in the light of, for example, Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7, which expressly permits a State to reopen a case if new facts emerge, or where a fundamental defect which could have affected the outcome of the case is detected in previous proceedings (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a055 and 56). The possibility of re-examining or reopening cases has also been considered by the Committee of Ministers as a means of achieving restitutio in integrum, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments. In its Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at the domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, it encouraged the Contracting Parties to review their domestic legal systems with a view to ensuring that adequate opportunity for the re-examination of a case, including reopening of proceedings, exists in instances where the Court has found a violation of the Convention.",
