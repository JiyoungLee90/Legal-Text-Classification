The court also held that the change in the mother\u2019s circumstances constituted grounds for changing the contact regime between father and child, but did not adjudicate on that matter.",

More specifically, there was a risk that a parent applying for such permission could take the child to countries which were in a state of war or where there was a high risk of natural disasters, thus endangering the child\u2019s well-being and depriving the State of the opportunity to ensure his or her protection. Also, if the parent took the child to a country which was not a member of the European Union, or with which Bulgaria had no reciprocal agreement regarding legal assistance, the authorities would not be able to ensure that the contact rights of the other parent were enforced.",

Importantly, the first applicant had not sought in court a change in the regime for contact between the child and the father with a view to her and the child moving their primary place of residence to the United Kingdom. In any event, the first applicant had presented in the proceedings before the court only her personal assertions in respect of her future in the United Kingdom, but no evidence to demonstrate the facts she claimed. She purported that she would get married; however, this was an uncertain future occurrence which did not depend solely on her will. The situation would have been entirely different, if she had been married and had settled in good material conditions in another country. In such a case, the question of whether it would be in the child\u2019s interest to join her mother abroad would be open for discussion. However, as this was not the case, in view of the young age of the child, the court found that it was not in her interest for her mother to be granted permission to take her abroad at any time, for an unlimited duration and to unknown destinations throughout the period before the child reached majority.",

The court had examined all relevant factors and taken its decision in the light of those factors.

Lastly, the Government emphasised that well-established national judicial practice had unequivocally recognised that, in the absence of both parents\u2019 agreement, it was unacceptable for courts to approve a minor\u2019s travel abroad for an unlimited period of time to an unspecific destination, as that was never in the child\u2019s best interests.",

In March 2009, at the time the first applicant had made her application for the child to travel (see paragraph 7 above), the old 1985 Family Code had been in force. According to its provisions, in the absence of parental consent regarding the issue of which parent a child should live with, as opposed to the issue of where this should be, a first-instance civil court determined the issue under Article 71(2) of the 1985 Code (see paragraph 18 above, second sentence). In the first applicant\u2019s case, the court which had ruled on her divorce had also decided that the child would live with her, without specifying where she would live (see paragraph 5 above). The first applicant submitted that she had complied with all the applicable legal requirements at the time she had made her application for permission to travel, and referred to the fact that her claim had been granted in 2010 following her appeal (see paragraphs 9-10 above). She also believed that she had not been required to initiate new sets of proceedings to determine a matter which, in her opinion, had already been covered by the initial judgment granting her parental rights.",

Bulgaria (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-58). In accordance with those principles, it is not for the Court to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in regulating disputes related to contact, residence or travel; it has to rather review under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of their power of appreciation. In particular, the Court is called upon to review whether the domestic courts conducted a thorough examination of the entire situation and a series of factors \u2013 particularly those of a factual, emotional, psychological, material and medical nature \u2013 and whether they made a balanced and reasonable assessment of each person\u2019s respective interests, always bearing in mind the best interests of the child.",

However, unlike the situation in Penchevi (cited above, \u00a7 61), the Court finds that in the present case the impossibility for the child to follow her mother to the United Kingdom represented an interference only with her mother\u2019s Article 8 rights. The reasons was that in Penchevi the travel refusal prevented both applicants from being together while the first applicant pursued her studies in Germany and the second applicant remained in the care of his maternal grandparents (see Penchevi, cited above, \u00a7 13), while in the instant case the first applicant remained in Bulgaria with her daughter throughout the relevant period.",

The Court has already concluded in Penchevi (cited above, \u00a7 67) that this requirement in law does not appear to impose an unreasonable or disproportionate limitation on people\u2019s right to respect for their private and family life, given in particular that it provides protection for parents whose children might be abducted by the other parent.

Unlike in the case of Penchevi, the court in the instant case examined the request in the light of the concrete information in the file concerning the child\u2019s and her parents\u2019 situation. It observed in the first place that the request had clearly indicated that it did not concern a one-off trip or several such of a short duration, but was made instead in respect of travel which was unlimited in time and place. This was explained by the first applicant\u2019s intention to move her and the child\u2019s residence to the United Kingdom. In Penchevi, the Court criticised the domestic courts for having overlooked a number of elements in the file showing that: (1) the child had adapted well to a kindergarten in Germany; (2) his mother had the financial means to offer him adequate living conditions there; (3) the father had been imposed a restraining order in the past; and that (4) the latter\u2019s access rights had been determined in a manner compatible with the child\u2019s living with his mother in Germany. In the present case, however, this type of circumstances is precisely what the domestic court looked into. In particular, the court observed that the first applicant intended to move to another country together with the child but had not shown that she could provide adequate material conditions to her daughter there or any certainty of ensuring even temporary stability. In fact, there was nothing to demonstrate that she had either settled in the United Kingdom or at the very least had a source of income with which to cater for the child\u2019s needs, independently of the presence or absence of good will of a third unrelated party who was the person she claimed she intended to marry. It was expressly after examining the specific situation of the child and the first applicant that the court formed misgivings about the former\u2019s wellbeing in case she were relocated to the United Kingdom in the abovedescribed circumstances. The court perceived that there was a real risk for the well-being of the child and this is was what led it to refuse permission for her unlimited travel. It cannot be said therefore that the last instance domestic court decided the matter solely relying on its earlier mandatory case-law and not examining the situation in the light of the particular circumstances of the case.",

The first applicant argued on this point that, at the time she had brought the proceedings for the child\u2019s travel, the applicable law had not required that the place of residence of the child be determined explicitly; it sufficed for the court to determine with whom of the parents the child had to live and the child then followed that parent (see paragraph 18 above). She pointed out that only as of October 2009 did the Family Code necessitate that the place of residence of the child following disagreement between the parents be determined specifically. As she had brought the proceedings for travel in March 2009, the developments in the Code were not relevant to those proceedings.",

A move of the child\u2019s residence to the United Kingdom would have made this court-approved arrangement impossible to comply with. However, no attempt was made by the first applicant to seek a solution whereby her and her child\u2019s relocation abroad would allow for continued contact between daughter and father, despite that she had had the possibility of seeking such a change in the same judicial proceedings deciding on the child\u2019s unlimited travel. The Court considers in this connection that, if the State were called upon to ensure a fair balance between the competing interests at stake (see paragraph 37 above), it is difficult to say that the place where the child lives and how or whether contact rights are exercised is irrelevant. Given that there was no consent between the two parents on the matter of relocating the child to the United Kingdom, and that such a move would have affected the family life of both child and father, the issue had to be decided by the courts which, however, were never asked to do that.",

The Court reiterates in that connection that it has to confine itself, as far as possible, to an examination of the concrete case before it, as its task is not to review national law in abstracto, but to determine whether the manner in which it was applied gave rise to a Convention violation (see Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 130; see also Penchevi, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

Article 13 guarantees the availability of a remedy at national level to enforce \u2013 and hence to allege non-compliance with \u2013 the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order (see the Lithgow and Others judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, p. 74, \u00a7 205, and the authorities cited there). The Court finds that, in the instant case, the refusal of the domestic court to allow the child\u2019s travel lies at the heart of the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 13. The issues linked to the court\u2019s refusal to allow travel have been examined under Article 8 above.
