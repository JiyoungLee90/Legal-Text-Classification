Russia, no. 28639/03, \u00a7 25, 14 June 2007). The Court next reiterates that personalities of a shareholder, who did not formally participate in the proceedings, and the company concerned which did, have been generally recognised as dissociable from one another for the purposes of determining the applicant\u2019s victim status under Article 6 of the Convention (ibid). On the other hand, where the company which participated in domestic proceedings had a sole owner, the Court has recognised this owner\u2019s standing to bring a complaint under Article 6 in his or her personal capacity, having acknowledged a close connection between the applicant\u2019s personality as an individual and a company owner (see, for example, Furman v.

It further observes that, according to the Farming Act in force at the material time, the applicant could have owned his farm either individually or jointly with his family members (see paragraph 36 above). It is, however, unclear from the case file materials whether members of his family were engaged in his farm as its official members. On the other hand, even assuming that the applicant was not the sole owner of his farm, according to applicable law the farm property was to be managed by all the members\u2019 mutual consent (see paragraph 39 above). Further, it is notable that the applicant alone acted on behalf of the farm in all interactions with the authorities, while the other farm members (if any) never disputed his position. Finally, he was granted the disputed land in 1992 in his own name as an individual and he also obtained the Land Use Act in his own name.",

In particular, without any legal basis they had refused to allocate him the plot of land in kind, even after his entitlement had been confirmed by the 1994 court judgment. Furthermore, in 1998 they had unjustifiably revoked the 1992 decision, thus divesting him of the legal basis for possession on grounds which had not been foreseen by applicable substantive law. In addition, the procedure by which this decision had been revoked had been unlawful and unconstitutional, since according to the applicable legal provisions the District Council\u2019s decision could be revoked only at the close of adversarial judicial proceedings, as confirmed in 2009 by a ruling of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. As a result of the unlawful and prolonged interference of the authorities with the applicant\u2019s right to farm a land plot lawfully granted to him, not only had he suffered psychologically, but he had also sustained pecuniary damage. In particular, between 1992 and 1998 he had had to pay land tax on the land, which he had never used. In addition, he had uselessly bought some farm equipment and other merchandise, and forsaken considerable profits. In the meantime, there had been no public interest in precluding him from farming his land, since de facto it had been usurped by two founders of the \u201cL.\u201d company, who had never transferred it to its employees.",

It is therefore unclear whether this revocation constituted a \u201cdeprivation\u201d of possessions for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1. However, this act, which in fact extinguished the legal basis on which the applicant\u2019s initial entitlement to the land had emerged, constituted an interference with the above entitlement.

It requires that where an issue in the general interest is at stake, in particular when the matter affects fundamental human rights such as property rights, the public authorities must act in good time and in an appropriate and above all consistent manner (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000I; \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7 128, ECHR 2004XII; Megadat.com S.r.l. v.

In particular, it is incumbent on the public authorities to put in place internal procedures which enhance the transparency and clarity of their operations, minimise the risk of mistakes (see, for example, Lelas v. Croatia, no. 55555/08, \u00a7 74, 20 May 2010, and To\u015fcu\u0163\u0103 and Others v.

Holding otherwise would, inter alia, amount to sanctioning an inappropriate allocation of scarce public resources, which in itself would be contrary to the public interest (ibid.). On the other hand, the need to correct an old \u201cwrong\u201d should not disproportionately interfere with a new right which has been acquired by an individual relying on the legitimacy of the public authority\u2019s action in good faith (see, mutatis mutandis, Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc v.\u00a0the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2002VIII). In other words, State authorities which fail to put in place or adhere to their own procedures should not be allowed to profit from their wrongdoing or to escape their obligations (see Lelas, cited above, \u00a7 74). The risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State itself and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individuals concerned (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc, cited above, \u00a7 58; Gashi v.

While the applicant complains that the conclusions drawn by the courts in his case were at variance with the Constitutional Court\u2019s 2009 ruling (see paragraph 42 above), the Court notes that this ruling was taken after the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case had ended. Furthermore, while the Court may review the findings of domestic courts where they appear manifestly arbitrary, the task of interpreting domestic law belongs primarily to the national judicial authorities, while the Court, giving due deference to their findings, is charged with ensuring that they are compatible with the Convention (see, for example, Seryavin and Others v.

Firstly, it appears that this procedure enables the State authorities to extinguish retrospectively individual entitlements granted by mistake without any reparation to their good-faith holders. Secondly, it appears to enable the State authorities to extinguish such entitlements at their own volition, at any time and without any involvement of the affected parties. The Court notes that the ability of the interested parties to challenge such extinguishments in court admittedly reduces the possibility of arbitrary interpretation of applicable substantive law provisions by the public authorities claiming to have been mistaken. On the other hand, the fact that no time frame is attached to their power to reconsider their decisions, including after the discovery of a mistake, significantly undermines legal certainty in the realm of individual rights and civil transactions, which is detrimental to the \u201cgood governance\u201d principle and the \u201clawfulness\u201d requirement under Article 1 of Protocol no. 1.",

This judgment, in turn, was never challenged by the Village Council on appeal, although after it had become final, the Council took an official decision not to enforce it. Likewise, on several occasions the judicial rulings finding the 1998 revocation of the applicant\u2019s entitlement unlawful, were not reviewed on appeal and subsequently quashed under extraordinary procedures. At the same time, after the courts eventually approved the revocation, no action was taken to invalidate the applicant\u2019s Land Use Act or revoke the 1994 court judgment confirming his entitlement. This judgment was still treated as valid by domestic courts in 2010, although the applicant\u2019s request to oblige the bailiffs to enforce it was rejected by them. Based on these conflicting documents, it is not possible to make a clear conclusion, whether or not at the present time the applicant has entitlement to the disputed plot of land under domestic law.",
