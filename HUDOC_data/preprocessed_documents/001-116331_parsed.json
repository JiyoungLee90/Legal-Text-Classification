In its decision no. 101-O of the same date, the  declared the application inadmissible. In its view, the absence of any specific regulation of detention matters in Article 466 \u00a7 1 did not create a legal lacuna incompatible with the Constitution. Article 8 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Minsk Convention provided that, in executing a request for legal assistance, the requested party would apply its domestic law, which in the case of Russia was the procedure laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure. Such procedure comprised, in particular, Article 466 \u00a7 1 of the Code and the norms in Chapter 13 of the Code (\u201cPreventive measures\u201d), which, by virtue of their general character and position in Part I of the Code (\u201cGeneral provisions\u201d), applied to all stages and forms of criminal proceedings, including proceedings for the examination of extradition requests. Accordingly, Article 466 \u00a7 1 of the Code did not allow the authorities to apply a custodial measure without complying with the procedure established in the Code or the time-limits fixed in the Code.

A flagrant denial of justice goes beyond mere irregularities or lack of safeguards in the trial procedures such as might result in a breach of Article 6 if occurring within the  itself. What is required is a breach of the principles of fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 which is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification, or destruction of the very essence, of the right guaranteed by that Article (see Othman (Abu Qatada) v. the , no. 8139/09, \u00a7 260, 17 January 2012). In assessing whether this test has been met, the Court considers that the same standard and burden of proof should apply as in Article 3 expulsion cases. Therefore, it is for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if he is removed from a Contracting State, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to a flagrant denial of justice (ibid., \u00a7 261).",

The establishment of that responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention.

Since the nature of the Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under Article 3 in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill-treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of the extradition (see Cruz Varas and Others v.

The Court notes that under the relevant national legislation a formal record should be drawn up in respect of persons detained under that Article, who should sign it. Also, such persons should be questioned and a transcript of their interview should be drawn up (see paragraph 66 above). Therefore, assuming that the applicant was detained on the basis of the aforementioned legal provision, as alleged by him, he should, in principle, be in possession of copies of those documents and could have submitted them to the Court to corroborate that allegation. Moreover, the applicant submitted no documentary evidence to prove that he had made any attempts to appeal to a court against his alleged detention during the period under consideration, a possibility open to him under domestic law (see paragraph 72 above). The Court finds it important to note in this connection that, as is clear from the facts of the case, the applicant was represented by a lawyer throughout the proceedings pending his extradition to Uzbekistan, and he never alleged that he had been unable to contact that lawyer at any moment during his alleged detention between 31 August and 2 September 2011.",

Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no.\u00a0656/06, \u00a7 71, 11 October 2007, with further references).",

However, the Court is not persuaded that the maximum time-limit provided for in Article 109 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure should be applied implicitly each time when an individual\u2019s placement in custody is being authorised. Indeed, the Russian Constitutional Court emphasised on several occasions that the national courts were under an obligation to set a time-limit each time they were taking decisions under, inter alia, Articles 108 and 109 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure on the placement of an individual into detention or on the extension of a period of an individual\u2019s detention (see paragraph 84 above). Although the period under examination, in itself, does not appear unreasonably long and might be justified by the need for the authorities to ensure the proper conduct of various measures in the context of an extradition check in the applicant\u2019s respect, the Court agrees with the Russian Constitutional Court that, however short a period of detention may be, it should be clearly defined in a detention order, this being an essential guarantee against arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Fedorenko v. , no. 39602/05, \u00a7 50, 20 September 2011).",

In this connection, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d.

Thus, in order to establish whether the Russian authorities complied with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) as regards the length of the applicant\u2019s detention with a view to extradition, the Court considers it reasonable to assess their conduct in respect of each set of extradition proceedings separately.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 48205/09, \u00a7\u00a7 49-51, 15 November 2011; and Al Husin v.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 3727/08, \u00a7\u00a7 67-69, 7 February 2012). As a result of the application of the interim measure, the respondent Government could not remove the applicant to  without being in breach of their obligation under Article 34 of the Convention. During that time the extradition proceedings, although temporarily suspended pursuant to the request made by the Court, were nevertheless in progress for the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (see, for similar reasoning, Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no. 25389/05, \u00a7\u00a7 73 and 74, ECHR 2007-II; Al Hanchi, cited above, \u00a7 51; and Al Husin, cited above, \u00a7 69). The Court has previously found that the fact that expulsion or extradition proceedings are provisionally suspended as a result of the application of an interim measure does not in itself render the detention of the person concerned unlawful, provided that the authorities still envisage expulsion at a later stage, and on condition that the detention is not unreasonably prolonged (see Keshmiri v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 2), no. 22426/10, \u00a7 34, 17 January 2012, and S.P. v.

It is also relevant that, as the Court has established in paragraph 154 above, the applicant\u2019s detention during that period was in compliance with the procedure and time-limits established under domestic law and that after the expiry of the maximum detention period permitted under Russian law the applicant was immediately released (see, for similar reasoning, Gebremedhin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74 and 75).",
