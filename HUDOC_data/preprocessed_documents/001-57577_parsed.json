The conduct of business by prisoners was further dealt with by Orders 1C 4-6, the basic provision being that \"an inmate\" - whether convicted or not - \"may not conduct any business activity in prison, but should be allowed reasonable facilities for arranging its conduct on his behalf\". However, subject to this general rule, governors had discretion to allow an inmate to deal with certain limited personal business matters, in particular to dispose of private property, to sign a cheque or to make or sign a will or other document. The broad effect of the regulations was that, although a prisoner could not participate personally on a continuing basis in a business concern, he was allowed to make arrangements to protect the value, for his own and his family\u2019s benefit, of his personal property and any business interests.",

However, the wording of Rule 34(8) (see paragraph 29 above) is itself quite explicit: a reader would see not that correspondence with persons other than friends or relatives is allowed subject to certain exceptions but rather that it is prohibited save where the Secretary of State gives leave. Moreover, the Court considers that account should also be taken of Rule 33(2) - which contains a prohibition similar to that found in Rule 34(8) - and of Rule 34(2), from which it would be apparent that there were limits on the quantity of the correspondence of convicted prisoners (see paragraphs 29 and 38 above).",
