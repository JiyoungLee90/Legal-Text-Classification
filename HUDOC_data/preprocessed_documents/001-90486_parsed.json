It is the Court\u2019s finding that the delays to which the Government conceded contributed considerably to the length of the proceedings. It further observes that it took over four years for that court to decide on the merits the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraphs 4 and 6 above). In addition, the preliminary assessment of the admissibility of the successors\u2019 appeal, which that court carried out, was also longer than necessary. In this connection, the Court notes that it took two years for that court to declare the successors\u2019 appeal as having been withdrawn. The overall time which elapsed before the first-instance court cannot be regarded as reasonable.",
