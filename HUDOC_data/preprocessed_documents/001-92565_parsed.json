The court of first instance dismissed the applicant\u2019s action since he was neither A.Z.\u2019s spouse nor a person having lived with him in a \u201clong-lasting life community\u201d, such a community being tantamount to an extramarital relationship of persons of the opposite sex, nor his close relative for the purposes of Section 56. The first instance court found that the relationship of the applicant and A.Z. could merely be qualified as an \u201ceconomic community\u201d. By the same judgment, the Ljubljana Municipality\u2019s counterclaim was upheld and the applicant ordered to vacate the apartment.",

His situation is thus clearly distinguishable from that of the applicant in the case of Karner. Moreover, although he maintains that he was unable to succeed to the tenancy because he and A.Z. were of the same sex, the Court considers that this assertion is based on a partial misconception of the reasons relied on by the domestic courts. In essence, those courts declined to recognise the applicant\u2019s right to succeed to the tenancy on the ground that his cohabitation with A.Z. amounted only to an \u201ceconomic community\u201d and did not fall within any of the categories listed in Section 56 of the Housing Act, namely the tenant\u2019s spouse, a person who had lived with the tenant in a \u201clong-lasting life community\u201d or one of the tenant\u2019s close family members. While it it true that the lower courts relied on an interpretation of the notion of \u201clong-lasting life community\u201d which limited its scope to extramarital relationships between persons of the opposite sex \u2013 a position which the Constitutional Court found might be contrary to the Constitution \u2013 the applicant\u2019s claim was ultimately dismissed because his relationship with A.Z. was of a different nature from a \u201clong-lasting life community\u201d, being rather an \u201ceconomic community\u201d, and not because he and A.Z. were of the same sex. In that respect, the  expressly stated that an \u201ceconomic community\u201d could not be equated with a \u201clong-lasting life community\u201d irrespective of whether it was constituted of persons of the same sex or the opposite sex. In these circumstances, it does not appear that the applicant\u2019s sex was at all a decisive element in the rejection of his claim or that a person of the opposite sex would have been treated any differently. Consequently, the Court finds that the applicant has not been discriminated against on the grounds of either his sexual orientation or his sex.",

Therefore, distinguishing between different forms of cohabitation does not necessarily give rise to discrimination prohibited by Article 14. For similar reasons, the Court does not consider that the applicant\u2019s situation was comparable to that of a married couple and finds that there has been no discrimination in that respect.",

However, it does not consider that the applicant\u2019s situation can be compared to such a relationship either. In this connection, the Court notes that an extramarital relationship is a legally recognised alternative to marriage in Slovenian law, by virtue of Article\u00a012 of the Marriage and Family Relations Act, which provides that \u201c[a] long-lasting community of a man and a woman who have not entered into [a marriage] shall have for them the same legal consequences ... as if they had entered into a marriage\u201d. Consequently, the relationship of long-term partners under Slovenian law may be readily equated to that of a married couple, being of the same nature, notwithstanding the absence of formal recognition through some form of registration. In that respect, the Court further notes that in Section 56 of the Housing Act the category of \u201ca person who has lived with the tenant in a long-lasting life community\u201d immediately followed the expression \u201cthe tenant\u2019s spouse\u201d and, in accordance with the ejusdem generis principle, could reasonably be interpreted as being an extension of that specific status rather than as a wholly independent category of general application. Moreover, the fact that the lower courts limited their interpretation of the expression \u201clong-lasting life community\u201d to heterosexual couples does not change that conclusion, since in the present case the distinction between heterosexual and homosexual couples is not at issue.",

The Court considers that similar considerations to those relied upon in Burden are applicable to the distinction made between family members on the one hand and unrelated persons on the other. Notwithstanding the potentially close nature of the relationship between two unrelated people, the Court considers that the two situations are not comparable for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention, since ties of filiation similarly entail specific rights and obligations in law, albeit not entered into voluntarily, which is not the case with the relationship between two unrelated people, irrespective of the intimacy of that relationship.",

It further recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. According to Article 19 of the Convention, the Court\u2019s duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Garcia Ruiz v. Spain, no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999-I). In the present case, the Court observes that the domestic courts examined the relevant facts of the case in depth and explained in detail why they considered that the applicant and A.Z. had lived in a merely \u201ceconomic community\u201d. The Court considers that the reasons on which the domestic courts based their decisions in question are sufficient to exclude the assumption that the way in which they established and evaluated the applicant\u2019s situation was unfair or arbitrary.
