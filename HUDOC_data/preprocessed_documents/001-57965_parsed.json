She went to her next door neighbours and called the police, who subsequently visited and spoke to both the applicant and his wife separately.  Later the same evening she re-entered the house and the applicant had sexual intercourse with her.  Shortly afterwards she left the house, having first tried to take their child with her.  She went to the neighbours crying and distressed, complaining to them and to the police, whom she telephoned, that she had been raped at knife-point. ",

Steele ([1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22) that the implied consent could be withdrawn by agreement between the parties.  Such an agreement could clearly be implicit; there was nothing in the case-law to suggest the contrary.  Thirdly, he was of the view that the common law recognised that a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse has been terminated, would amount to a revocation of the implicit consent.

Further,  made an analysis of previous court decisions, from which it appears that in R. v. Clarence (1888), the first reported case of this nature, some judges of the Court for Crown Cases Reserved had objected to the principle.  In the next reported case, R. v. Clarke (1949), the trial court had departed from the principle by holding that the husband\u2019s immunity was lost in the event of a court order directing that the wife was no longer bound to cohabit with him.  Almost every court decision thereafter had made increasingly important exceptions to the marital immunity (see paragraph 24 below).  The Court of Appeal had accepted in R. v. Steele (1976) that the implied consent to intercourse could be terminated by agreement.  This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Roberts (1986), where it held that the lack of a non-molestation clause in a deed of separation, concluded on expiry of a non-molestation order, did not revive the consent to intercourse. ",

It stressed that the common law was capable of evolving in the light of changing social, economic and cultural developments.  Whilst Sir Matthew Hale\u2019s proposition had reflected the state of affairs at the time it was enunciated, the status of women, and particularly of married women, had changed out of all recognition in various ways. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes had been that marriage was in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband (R. v. R. [1991] 4 All England Law Reports 481). ",

It was usual practice, when considering the reform of common law rules, to consider the grounds expressed in the cases or other authorities for the current state of the law, in order to analyse whether those grounds were well-founded.  However, that step was of little assistance here, not only because there was little case-law on the subject but also, and in particular, because there was little dispute that the reason set out in the authorities for the state of the law could not be supported (paragraph 4.1 of the Working Paper). The basis of the law was that intercourse against the wife\u2019s actual will was excluded from the law of rape by the fictional deemed consent to intercourse perceived by Sir Mathew Hale in his dictum.  This notion was not only quite artificial but, certainly in the modern context, was also quite anomalous.  Indeed, it was difficult to find any current authority or commentator who thought that it was even remotely supportable.  The artificial and anomalous nature of the marital immunity could be seen if it was reviewed against the current law on the legal effects of marriage (paragraph 4.2).",

This point had been emphasised by Mr Justice Hawkins in R. v. Clarence (1888) when he said: \"The intercourse which takes place between husband and wife after marriage is not by virtue of any special consent on her part, but is mere submission to an obligation imposed on her by law \" (paragraph 4.3).",

Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused\u2019s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused\u2019s detriment, for instance by analogy.  From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law.  In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.  The Court thus indicated that when speaking of \"law\" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, as a recent authority, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37).",

They could not be said to have adapted the law to a new kind of conduct but rather to a change of social attitudes.  To extend the criminal law, solely on such a basis, to conduct which was previously lawful was precisely what Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention was designed to prevent.  Moreover, the applicant stressed, it was impossible to specify with precision when the change in question had occurred.  In September 1990, change by judicial interpretation was not foreseen by the Law Commission, which considered that a parliamentary enactment would be necessary. ",

In particular, given the recognition of women\u2019s equality of status with men in marriage and outside it and of their autonomy over their own bodies, the adaptation of the ingredients of the offence of rape was reasonably foreseeable, with appropriate legal advice, to the applicant.  He was not convicted of conduct which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when it was committed. ",

The applicant does not dispute that the conduct for which he was convicted would have constituted rape within the meaning of the statutory definition of rape as applicable at the time, had the victim not been his wife.  His complaint under Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention relates solely to the fact that in deciding on 18 April 1991 that the applicant had a case to answer on the rape charge, Mr Justice Rose followed the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling of 14 March 1991 in the case of R. v.

(summarised at paragraph 11 above) related to the definition of rape in section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act: \"unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it\".  The question was whether \"removal\" of the marital immunity would conflict with the statutory definition of rape, in particular whether it would be prevented by the word \"unlawful\".  The Court of Appeal carefully examined various strands of interpretation of the provision in the case-law, including the argument that the term \"unlawful\" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape.  In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v.  (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37).  It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 12 above), that the word \"unlawful\" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from \"removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive\" and from declaring that \"a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim\" (see paragraph 11 above).

The decisions of the Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords did no more than continue a perceptible line of case-law development dismantling the immunity of a husband from prosecution for rape upon his wife (for a description of this development, see paragraphs 11 and 23-27 above).  There was no doubt under the law as it stood on 18 September 1990 that a husband who forcibly had sexual intercourse with his wife could, in various circumstances, be found guilty of rape. Moreover, there was an evident evolution, which was consistent with the very essence of the offence, of the criminal law through judicial interpretation towards treating such conduct generally as within the scope of the offence of rape.  This evolution had reached a stage where judicial recognition of the absence of immunity had become a reasonably foreseeable development of the law (see paragraph 36 above). ",

What is more, the abandonment of the unacceptable idea of a husband being immune against prosecution for rape of his wife was in conformity not only with a civilised concept of marriage but also, and above all, with the fundamental objectives of the Convention, the very essence of which is respect for human dignity and human freedom.
