The lavatory pan was placed in the corner of the cell, near the door.

Photos produced by the Government show that the window had been covered with two layers of thick horizontal and vertical bars blocking access to natural air and light. The window was double glazed and had a casement which measured 30 centimetres in length and 26 centimetres in width. Inmates could request warders to open the casement to bring in fresh air. Twice a day warders turned on a ventilation system.\u00a0The cells were constantly lit by a bulb placed in a niche above the door. The walls were covered with so-called \u201cshuba\u201d, a sort of abrasive concrete lining, designed to prevent detainees from leaning on the walls or writing on them. Inmates were allowed to take a shower once a week for fifteen minutes. A central-heating system was installed in the building. However, there had been no hot water since 1996. Warders boiled water and gave it to detainees on request. The applicant was not provided with bedding because the detention ward had scarce financial resources. The Government also submitted copies of contracts according to which the disinfestation and extermination of insects had been done twice a month and twice a year respectively.",

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the decisive question in assessing the effectiveness of a remedy concerning a complaint of inhuman and degrading treatment is whether the applicant could have raised that complaint before domestic courts in order to obtain direct and timely redress, and not merely an indirect protection of the rights guaranteed in Article\u00a03 of the Convention. The remedy can be either preventive or compensatory in nature (see, among other authorities, Koval v. , no.\u00a065550/01, \u00a7\u00a094, 19 October 2006). The Court notes that the Government did not explain whether a complaint to a court could have offered the aforementioned preventive or compensatory redress or both for allegations of the conditions of transport which had been contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. The Government did not make reference to any legal norm on the possibility of lodging an action seeking damages for treatment already suffered as a result of the conditions of transport, or on the possibility of such an action being preventative of further sufferings. Nor did the Government supply any example from domestic practice showing that, by using the means in question, it was possible for the applicant to obtain such redress.",

The Court finds it particularly striking that those regular \u201cchecks\u201d are prescribed by domestic legal regulations governing transport of detainees. The applicant\u2019s sleeping conditions were further aggravated by the constant lighting in the cell. The resulting deprivation of sleep must have constituted a heavy physical and psychological burden on the applicant (see Yakovenko v. , no.\u00a015825/06, \u00a7\u00a085, 25\u00a0October 2007).",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the clear insufficiency of food given to an applicant may in itself raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Kadi\u0137is\u00a0v.
