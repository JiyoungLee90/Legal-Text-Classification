Very high sums of money are often involved in disputes in this field and insurance cover plays a major role.  Shipowners are also protected by rules on limited liability.  Generally speaking there is nothing unusual or oppressive in promulgating legal rules according to which the liability for negligent piloting, even if it is provided or authorised by the State, is imposed on the shipowners.  Therefore the only problem in this case concerning Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) is the retroactivity clause in the 1988 Act. ",

                        "content": "It seems that the Court of Cassation did not give any judgments on the liability of pilots from 1896 to 1983.  The \"La Flandria\" judgment, delivered in 1920, concerned the general rules on State liability under the law of tort.  It has not been shown that at the time of those of the accidents in this case that took place before 1983, the shipowners could rely on a legal rule in  on State liability for the actions of pilots.  Between 1983 and 1988 the situation was not the same.  Nevertheless, it needs to be demonstrated that this led to changes in insurance clauses and thereby deprived the shipowners of the possibility of suing the insurance companies.  This has not been done.  The rules promulgated in 1988 did not, moreover, deprive the shipowners of all possibility of having their losses covered by others because in many cases they could rely on the liability of other shipowners.  It is accordingly not clear in what way serious burdens were in fact imposed on the applicants as a result of the accidents in respect of which they claim, less still that any such burdens were individual and excessive.  To this it may be added, in my opinion, that a general ban on retroactivity of measures in the field of civil law cannot be read into our Convention.  The exact limits of the guarantees set out in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) are difficult to draw and the claims in the possession of the applicants had not been finally determined.  In these circumstances I find the Government's arguments, which are summarised in paragraph 40 of the judgment, relevant and convincing.  Accordingly, I do not find that the fact that the national legislature enacted rules with retroactive effect such as those promulgated in  in 1988, amounts, on the basis of a proportionality test, to a violation.
