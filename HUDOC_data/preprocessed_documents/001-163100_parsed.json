In its reasoning, the court emphasised that once elected, MPs should be accountable primarily to the voters who elected them, not to their political party. This flows from the fact that they hold a mandate from the people, not from their party. The fact that an MP has resigned from the party or been expelled should not therefore lead to their expulsion from parliament. There is no constitutional obligation on MPs to resign if they have political disagreements with their party, even if they are expelled from it (decision IU no. 197/2002).",

Moreover, there are very few countries among the Council of Europe member States which have legislation giving the power to political parties to make members of the elected bodies resign if they change their political affiliation. The mechanisms of control of individual representatives proposed in the Serbian or Ukrainian cases cannot be equalled to \u2018imperative mandate\u2019 which is a practice forbidden in virtually all European countries. These mechanisms come closer to the model of \u2018party administered mandate\u2019 which is or has been characteristic in countries such as India or South Africa with the objective of preventing massive turn round of voters\u2019 decision by means of party switching. Whilst in these countries these practices have [been] considered consistent with their own constitutions, the Venice Commission has consistently argued that losing the condition of representative because of crossing the floor or switching party is contrary to the principle of a free and independent mandate. Even though the aim pursued by this kind of measures (i.e. preventing the \u2018sale\u2019 of mandates to the top payer) can be sympathetically contemplated, the basic constitutional principle which prohibits imperative mandate or any other form of politically depriving representatives of their mandates must prevail as a cornerstone of European democratic constitutionalism.\u201d",

However, having regard to the preparatory work to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and the interpretation of the provision in the context of the Convention as a whole, the Court has established that this provision also implies individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt\u00a0v.\u00a0Belgium, 2 March 1987, \u00a7\u00a7 46-51, Series A no. 113, and \u017ddanoka\u00a0v.\u00a0Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2006-IV).

Nonetheless, these rights are not absolute. There is room for \u201cimplied limitations\u201d, and Contracting States must be given a margin of appreciation in this sphere. The Court reaffirms that the margin in this area is wide (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7 52, and, more recently, Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024833/94, \u00a7 63, ECHR 1999-I; Labita v.

There are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe, which it is for each Contracting State to mould into its own democratic vision (see Hirst v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (no.\u00a02) [GC], no. 74025/01, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2005IX).",

In particular, any conditions imposed must not thwart the free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature \u2013 in other words, they must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see Hirst, cited above, \u00a7 62, and Yumak and Sadak v. Turkey [GC], no. , \u00a7 109, ECHR 2008). The Court is not required to adopt a position on the choice between one electoral system and another. That decision, which is determined by historical and political considerations specific to each country, is in principle one which the State alone has the power to make (see Podkolzina, cited above, \u00a7 34).",

However, those provisions were abrogated by the Constitutional Court of Serbia in 2003 (see paragraphs 22 and 34 above). The Constitutional Court emphasised that MPs held a mandate from the people, not from their party. The Court sees no reason to offer a different interpretation in the present case. In view of the above, it is clear that at the time the applicant was deprived of his parliamentary mandate, the domestic legislation specified that a parliamentary mandate belonged to an MP personally, not to the political party on whose list he or she was elected. Further, and in accordance with the rule established by Article 230 of the Parliamentary Rules of Procedure, an MP, when tendering his or her resignation had to do so in writing and to hand it personally to the President of Parliament. That was, accordingly, the framework of primary and secondary legislation put in place by the State pursuant to its obligation under Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see paragraph 61 above).",

At the same time, the possibility of terminating the office of those MPs who do not agree with the proposed approach (made usually by core members or founders of the party) would prevent open debate on draft laws and parliamentary initiatives within the party. The limitation of democracy within Parliament, as an important democratic institution, weakens the proportional representation system and undermines democracy as a whole. Therefore, to become really independent, or better put, legitimate, candidates for seats in Parliament should be elected by the party members at their conference, and not by a tiny group of influential politicians.",

It seems that the proportional representation system needs to be heavily regulated to avoid all those problems and controversies relating to the status of MPs, in order to guarantee the transparency of the electoral process. Finally, I would like to add that, whatever political platform is used, the fundamental freedoms and democratic values, including transparency in decision-making and effective public debate, should be respected by any political organisation.",

As has been established, the removal of the first applicant (hereinafter \u201cthe applicant\u201d) from his seat was improper, especially because the Serbian Parliament had endorsed his resignation letter of 15 May 2006 in spite of his immediate protests. Notwithstanding the failure to comply with the procedure laid down in Article 230 of the Parliamentary Rules of Procedure, I consider that one cannot forego future rights. In the present case the applicant had been required to renounce, before the results of the 2003 elections, a future and uncertain elected office. This too constitutes an unacceptable interference with the independence of MPs and their right to the free exercise of their political duties.
