When asked by journalists, she had acknowledged that she had been referring to V.P. and D.\u015e and had expressly mentioned that information about the system the two had been using to obtain income had already been reported in the press. During her public speeches on that topic she had explained that it had been a system by which the law practice \u201c[D.]\u015e and Associates\u201d had earned substantial amounts of money from energy companies in a certain constituency at a time when V.P. had been both a senior partner of the law firm and a member of parliament representing the said constituency.

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see, Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2004XI; Makraduli v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 64659/11 and 24133/13, \u00a7 62, 19 July 2018; and Paraskevopoulos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a032).

Based on the material in the case file, the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. As such, his conduct in that capacity was clearly of legitimate concern to the general public. In this connection, the Court has already held that the manner in which a locally elected official carries out his or her official duties and issues touching on his or her personal integrity are matters of general interest to the community (see, mutatis mutandis, Soko\u0142owski v. Poland, no.\u00a075955/01, \u00a7 45, 29 March 2005; Kwiecie\u0144 v.\u00a0Poland, no. 51744/99, \u00a7\u00a051, 9 January 2007; and Paraskevopoulos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036) and that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or debate on matters of public interest (see, among other authorities, S\u00fcrek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a026682/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999IV; and Instytut Ekonomichnykh Reform, TOV v. Ukraine, no. 61561/08, \u00a7 44, 2 June 2016). The Court considers that the aforementioned considerations are just as valid with regard to nationally elected officials, such as D.\u015e.",

The Court notes that the national courts are, in principle, better placed than an international court to assess the intention behind impugned phrases and statements and, in particular, to judge how the general public would interpret and react to them (see, mutatis mutandis, concerning a complaint under Article 8 of the Convention about an alleged breach of the right to reputation, Jalb\u0103 v.

However, the Court notes that the appellate courts did not provide convincing reasons for their conclusion on the nature of the statements at issue. In view of the limited scope of their reasoning in this respect, the Court is not persuaded by their approach and cannot share their conclusion for the following reasons (see, for example and mutatis mutandis, Instytut Ekonomichnykh Reform, TOV, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52-53).",

In addition, the available information suggested that V.P. had been both a member of parliament and an associate of the law practice founded by D.\u015e. at a time when the law practice had signed lucrative legal-assistance contracts with State-owned companies located in the constituency represented in Parliament by V.P.
