Although an applicant\u2019s detention may have initially been justified on these grounds, after a certain amount of time had passed the courts are obliged to give more explicit reasons for the continued detention. In the present case, throughout the seven-year period of the applicant\u2019s detention, they repeatedly relied on the same grounds without giving any particular details and without analysing whether the applicant\u2019s situation had changed, referring to such grounds to justify his continued detention as the need to carry out investigative measures. Moreover, at no point did the courts consider applying any alternative preventive measures. The Court notes, in particular, that seven years\u2019 pre-trial detention could not be justified exclusively by the complexity of the case and, in particular, by the need to question fourteen witnesses and suspects, and to hold ten confrontations and five forensic examinations as suggested by the Government.",
