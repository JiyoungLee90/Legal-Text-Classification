It reasoned that the article of 27 May 2010 had contained negative information about Ms M., both as a private individual and as the holder of a public office. The District Court dismissed the claim in so far as it concerned the phrase \u201cMs\u00a0M.\u2019s unlawful position\u201d, which had served as a subheading, and the phrase \u201cI am persuaded that people like ... and Ms M. should not be vested with judicial powers\u201d, which, in the District Court\u2019s view, had constituted a value judgment. It described the remainder of the impugned extracts from the article as allegations that Ms\u00a0M.\u2019s had behaved unlawfully and engaged in immoral actions \u2013 that is to say as statements of fact. The applicant insisted that the article had contained his personal opinion regarding (i) Ms\u00a0M., which had been supported by an official document confirming that some residents of the block of flats had unlawfully commandeered parts of the communal space in the building by installing partitions and (ii) Mr E., the owner of a flat in the building, who had appeared as a witness before the District Court to testify that Ms\u00a0M. had installed a partition, cutting off other residents\u2019 access to the communal space. The District Court summarily dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that those allegations had constituted value judgments and observed that (i)\u00a0the official document confirming the installation of additional partitions had not named Ms M., and (ii) Mr E. had not been a reliable witness, as he had previously complained about Ms M. It accordingly found that the defendants had not submitted proof of the veracity of the impugned statements, and ordered that those statements be retracted. It furthermore ordered that the applicant and IPT each pay Ms M. 500,000 Russian roubles\u00a0(RUB) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, together with RUB\u00a07,500 as compensation for the fees incurred by the claimant in the course of the defamation proceedings \u2013 that is to say a total of RUB\u00a01,015,000 (approximately 24,360 euros (EUR)). The District Court did not consider the applicant\u2019s financial situation when making the award but did take into account the fact that the claimant had been a judge, which meant that the allegations of her improper conduct had been particularly cynical.",

The applicant, ITP, and the newspaper\u2019s publishing house, Glas (\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0441) were listed as defendants.

It found in the claimant\u2019s favour. Briefly touching upon the issue of whether Mr A. had had standing to lodge a defamation claim in his own name following his mother\u2019s death, the District Court emphasised that although the decision of 29 December 2008 remained res judicata, Mr A. was entitled to protect his right to reputation and dignity, as \u201cdissemination of untruthful defamatory information regarding the deceased person defames to a certain extent [Ms A.\u2019s] son as well.\u201d The District Court furthermore asserted, without providing its reasons for doing so, that the impugned statements in the three articles constituted statements of facts, not value judgments, and that the applicant had submitted no proof of their veracity. The court did not refer to the fact that the applicant was a journalist or to the context in which the articles had been published, but it did emphasise that the impugned statements had suggested that Ms A. had committed unlawful acts. The District Court ordered that the allegations be retracted and ordered that the applicant and IPT each pay Mr A. RUB\u00a0500,000 (approximately EUR 12,500) \u2013 that is to say a total of RUB\u00a01,000,000 (approximately EUR 25,000); it also ordered that the publishing house pay Mr A. RUB 250,000 (approximately EUR\u00a06,250). The District Court did not explain what method it had employed to calculate the award. It noted that it had considered \u201cthe financial situation of each defendant\u201d, but without providing any description of that financial situation. It also referred to Mr A. witnessing his mother\u2019s psychological suffering after the publication of the impugned articles and the negative attention from classmates and their parents that the article must have drawn to him as a pupil at his school.",

In that connection, regard must be had to the special role of the judiciary in society. As the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a State governed by the rule of law, it must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties. It may therefore prove necessary to protect such confidence against gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded, especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying (see, with further references, Morice, cited above, \u00a7 128). Nevertheless (save in the case of gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded), bearing in mind the fact that judges form part of a fundamental institution of the State, they may as such be subject to personal criticism within the permissible limits, and not only in a theoretical and general manner. When acting in their official capacity they may thus be subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than ordinary citizens (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0131).",

Shielding a judge from every critical remark on the part of the press \u2013 irrespective of its well-foundedness, pertinence, or choice of words \u2013 could hardly be seen as constituting a measure promoting the rule of law. Furthermore, the District and Regional Courts did not take account of: the presence or absence of good faith on the applicant\u2019s part (in particular, in view of the documentary and witness testimony produced in the course of the defamation proceedings brought by Ms M.); the aim pursued by the applicant in publishing the articles; the existence of a matter of public interest or general concern in the impugned articles; or the relevance of the information regarding the judges\u2019 allegedly corrupt practices.

Their reasoning appears to have been based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of the honour and dignity of others (in particular of those vested with public powers) prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances.

Furthermore, the Court must be satisfied that the penalty does not amount to a form of censorship intended to discourage the press from expressing criticism. Within the context of a debate on a topic of public interest, such a sanction is likely to deter journalists from contributing to public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community. By the same token, it is liable to hamper the press in performing its task as a purveyor of information and as a public watchdog (see B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7 79).

The monthly minimum wage applicable on the dates of the domestic courts\u2019 judgments under consideration was RUB 4,330 (see paragraph 29 above). It follows that, in the case of Ms M. the applicant, in his capacity both as an individual and as the sole owner of IPT, was held liable to pay the claimant forty-nine times the amount of the monthly minimum wage, and in the case of Mr A. 230 times that amount. The Court thus considers that the amounts awarded to the claimants were very substantial (see, for similar reasoning, the above-cited cases of Sorgu\u00e7, \u00a7\u00a037, and Koprivica, \u00a7\u00a073).",

Even though the Regional Court reduced the award to Ms M. on appeal, it did not assess whether the sum of RUB\u00a0215,000 to be paid to Ms M. by the applicant as a natural person and as the sole owner of IPT was proportionate, in view of the applicant\u2019s financial situation (see paragraph 9 above). As to the award of RUB\u00a0500,000 to be paid by each of the applicant and IPT to Mr A., the domestic courts at two instances focused on the fact that the claimant must have profoundly suffered because of the attack on his deceased mother\u2019s reputation.

In assessing the circumstances submitted for their assessment, the domestic courts did not give due consideration to the principles and criteria as laid down by the Court\u2019s case-law for balancing the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression (see paragraph 45 above). They thus exceeded the margin of appreciation afforded to them and failed to demonstrate that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the two instances of interference in question and the legitimate aim pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s cited above, \u00a7 153; \u00d3lafsson v. Iceland, no. 58493/13, \u00a7 62, 16 March 2017; and GRA Stiftung gegen Rassismus und Antisemitismus v. Switzerland, no.\u00a018597/13, \u00a7 79, 9 January 2018; see also Skudayeva, cited above, \u00a7 39, and Nadtoka v. Russia (no. 2), no. 29097/08, \u00a7 50, 8 October 2019). The Court thus concludes that it has not been shown that the interference was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
