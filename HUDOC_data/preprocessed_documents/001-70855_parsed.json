The statutory provision allows the head doctor of the medical institution concerned, acting within his discretionary powers, to apply to a court, seeking the continuation, termination or modification of the measure. This application by a doctor, in accordance with Article 422 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, must be supported by the opinion of a medical commission made up of qualified psychiatrists (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above).
