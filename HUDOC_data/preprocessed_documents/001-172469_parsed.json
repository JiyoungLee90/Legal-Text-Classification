Namely, even though the first applicant, when lodging the constitutional appeal, had sought compensation in accordance with the applicable law, at that time, and had later on itemized those claims pursuant to the amendments to the Constitutional Court Act of 2011, the Constitutional Court ultimately rejected her claims in respect of the pecuniary damage as belated.
