However, it appears that the first instance court failed to implement these instructions and a subsequent judgment was set aside because of the same procedural defects that had been previously identified (see paragraph 32 above). The resulting delay of more than two years is entirely attributable to the conduct of the domestic authorities (compare Uglanova v. , no.\u00a03852/02, \u00a7\u00a034, 21 September 2006). The Court reiterates in this connection that in principle the involvement of numerous instances does not absolve the judicial authorities from complying with the reasonable time requirement of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (see Litoselitis v. Greece, no\u00a062771/00, \u00a7\u00a032, 5\u00a0February 2004). Moreover, with regard to\u00a0the repeated quashing\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0lower\u00a0courts\u2019 decisions, the Court recalls that since the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower authorities, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a\u00a0deficiency in the operation of the legal system (see, mutatis mutandis, Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7 46, 25\u00a0November 2003).",

The Court observes that the judgment of 17 May 2001 was enforced in full on 17 December 2003. Subsequently, the applicant sued the debtor for compensation in respect of pecuniary damage caused by the delay in enforcement of that judgment. By the judgment of 7 April 2005, the courts granted his claims, acknowledging that the delay in enforcement had violated his rights and ordering the debtor to pay him compensation in respect of pecuniary damage. The applicant did not allege that there had been any delays in the payment of the compensation awarded. Nor did he claim compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The Court is satisfied that the domestic authorities acknowledged the breach of the Convention and paid compensation to the applicant amounting to redress. It therefore concludes that the applicant can no longer claim to be a victim, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, of the belated enforcement of the judgment of 17 May 2001.
