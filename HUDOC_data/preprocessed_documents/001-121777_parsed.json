The Act, which was published in the Official Gazette on 13\u00a0August\u00a02010, introduced inter alia a new tax on certain payments to employees in the public sector whose employment was terminated. Consequently, severance pay and other payments related to the termination of employment exceeding HUF 2 million became subject to a 98% tax. However, income tax and social security contributions already paid could be deducted from the tax. Notwithstanding the limit of HUF 2 million, the statutory provisions on the sum of severance pay \u2013 in some cases amounting to twelve months\u2019 remuneration \u2013 were not modified.

Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 315 (1946) the Supreme Court dealt with the following problem: According to the provisions of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, after 15 November 1943 no salary or compensation was to be paid to certain individuals, who were then government employees, out of any moneys then or thereafter appropriated, except for services as jurors or members of armed forces unless they were prior to that date again appointed to jobs by the President with advice and consent of the Senate. In the background of the statute challenged lay the House of Representatives\u2019 feeling that in the late 1930s many \u2018subversives\u2019 were occupying influential positions in the Government and elsewhere and that their influence must not remained unchallenged. In 1943 the respondents, Lovett, Watson and Dodd, were and had been for several years working for the Government. The Government agencies which had lawfully employed them were fully satisfied with the quality of their work and wished to keep them employed in their jobs. The Supreme Court held that the purpose of the provision challenged was not merely to cut off the petitioners\u2019 compensation through regular disbursing channels, but permanently to bar them from government service and it was designed to force the employing agencies to discharge respondents and to bar their being hired by any other governmental agency. The Supreme Court reiterated that the Constitution barred such legislative acts by providing that \u201cno Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed\u201d. It found that the relevant provision was designed to apply to particular individuals and operated as a legislative decree of perpetual exclusion from a chosen vocation. It ruled that this permanent proscription from any opportunity to serve the Government was punishment of those individuals without a judicial trial and thus carried the usual characteristics of bills of attainder. The Supreme Court found that \u201clegislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial, are \u2018bills of attainder\u2019 prohibited by the Constitution\u201d.",

United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960) was as follows: The petitioners (Armstrong and al.) furnished various materials to Rice for use in construction of boats. Upon Rice\u2019s default, the Government exercised its option as to ten of the boat hulls still under construction and removed these properties to out-of-state naval shipyards for use in the completion of the boats. When the transfer occurred, the petitioners had not been paid for their materials and they were not paid afterwards, either. The petitioners therefore contended that they had liens. The Supreme Court held \u201cthat there was a taking of these liens for which just compensation is due under the Fifth Amendment. It is true that not every destruction or injury to property by governmental action has been held to be a \u2018taking\u2019 in the constitutional sense. This case and many others reveal the difficulty of trying to draw the line between what destructions of property by lawful governmental actions are compensable \u2018takings\u2019 and what destructions are \u2018consequential\u2019 and therefore not compensable... The Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that private property shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. A fair interpretation of this constitutional protection entitles these lienholders to just compensation here.\u201d",

Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998) the Supreme Court held that the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act 1992 amounted to an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property. It held that the economic impact of the Act was substantial as to the petitioner, in that it required Eastern Enterprises to contribute large sums of money to a pension fund for employees employed in the 1950s and 1960s solely because those payments could not be allocated to other coal companies that were currently operating in the coal industry. The retroactive effect of the Act imposed a substantial economic injury on Eastern Enterprises that could not have been anticipated. Moreover, the challenged statute interfered with Eastern Enterprises\u2019 expectations in that in 1987 the company sold off its remaining holdings in coal operations and completely quitted this industry. The statute\u2019s requirement for Eastern Enterprises to undertake the obligation at issue clearly interfered with the expectations of Eastern when it sold off its interest in coal operations. Lastly, the nature of the government action was unusual because it retroactively applied a substantial economic burden on Eastern Enterprises. For the Supreme Court, the character of the government action was substantial and invasive. The balance of the factors resulted in the finding of an unconstitutional taking requiring just compensation.",

The Court will therefore respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment be manifestly without reasonable foundation (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 98). However, the Court emphasises that, in carrying out that scrutiny, consideration shall be given to the nature of the expectation in question. In the case of a civil servant, who comes under a specific legal regime and who willingly accepted limitations on some of his fundamental rights and a remuneration unilaterally dictated by law, as noted by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 16 above), the statutorily stipulated severance represents a long-term expectation on the side of the civil servant and a commitment on the side of the State as employer. For the Court, such long-term expectations, reinforced by many years of unchanged statutory guarantees, cannot be lightly disregarded. The justification for the protection of legitimate expectations originating in a statutory undertaking is that the law should protect the trust that has been reposed in the undertaking made by legislation. For the Court, good government depends upon trust between the governed and the governor (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of statutorily due subsidies, Plalam S.P.A. v. Italy, no.\u00a016021/02, \u00a7\u00a7 35 to 42, 18 May 2010). Unless that trust is sustained and protected, governments will not be believed and civil servants will not order their affairs on that assumption as required by their heightened loyalty.",

The Court further observed that, before inquiring whether the first general rule has been complied with, it must determine whether the last two are applicable (ibid.). The three rules are not, however, \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others, cited above, \u00a7 37).",
