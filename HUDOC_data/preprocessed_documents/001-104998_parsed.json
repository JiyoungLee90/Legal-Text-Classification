The analysis of the provisions of Russian law on the service of court summons suggests that, whichever specific form of the parties\u2019 notification is chosen, the\u00a0domestic courts should be in possession of evidence confirming the\u00a0receipt of such notification by the addressee; otherwise the hearing is to be adjourned. It follows that the Government should have been in possession of such evidence. The Government provided a copy of the notification letter dispatched on 27 April 2005. However, the Government did not present any evidence, such as an acknowledgement of receipt or an envelope bearing postmarks or similar showing that it had reached the applicant in good time.

Nevertheless, the Court considers that in the\u00a0interests of the administration of justice a litigant should be summoned to a\u00a0court hearing in such a way as not only to have knowledge of the date and the\u00a0place of the hearing, but also to have enough time to prepare his case and to attend the court hearing. A formal dispatch of a notification letter without any confidence that it will reach the applicant in good time cannot be considered by the Court as proper notification. Moreover, the Court observes that there is nothing in the text of the appeal judgment to suggest that the appeal court examined the question whether the applicant had been duly summoned, and, if she had not been, whether the examination of the appeal should have been adjourned. It follows that the domestic authorities failed to demonstrate that they had taken a reasonable effort to duly summon the applicant to the hearing (see by contrast Babunidze\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 3040/03, 15 May 2007). In these circumstances the Court accepts the applicant\u2019s allegation that the domestic courts had failed in their duty to inform her of the appeal hearing. The Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the other party took part in the appeal hearing and made oral submissions. The participation in the hearing enabled the other party to submit observations on the applicant\u2019s appeal submissions, observations which were not communicated to the applicant and to which she could not reply orally.",
