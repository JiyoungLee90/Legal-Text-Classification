As clearly indicated in these reports, the injuries to the applicant's feet could not have been caused by rheumatism or the result of his hunger strike. They could only have been sustained by trauma. The Court takes note of the Government's observations that these injuries must have been caused during the incidents which took place in the \u00dcmraniye E-Type Prison in December 2000. In this connection, it refers to the medical report dated 22\u00a0December 2000, which noted several injuries on the applicant's body. The Court does not see any reason why the doctors who examined the applicant on 22 December 2000 would not have reported the injuries to the applicant's feet if they had been sustained on that occasion. It further notes that the Government maintained that the trauma could have been caused by stress fractures or insufficiency fractures; however these submissions are not supported by any convincing evidence. As a result, the Court concludes that the injuries to the applicant's feet must be attributable to a form of ill-treatment for which the authorities at Tekirda\u011f bore responsibility.",

As with an investigation under Article 2, such investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-IV).",

In his petition, the applicant also requested to be examined by a forensic doctor. On 8 March 2001, upon the order of the public prosecutor, the applicant was once again examined by the same prison doctor, who did not report any signs of ill-treatment on the applicant's body. The same day, a short statement was taken from the applicant, who repeated his allegations of ill-treatment. At this point, the Court notes with regret that the public prosecutor omitted to request any further medical examination, to take statements from the accused prison guards or to question witnesses and the prison doctor who had drafted the three medical reports dated 24 February 2001, 3 March 2001 and 8 March 2001, before delivering his decision of non-prosecution. In delivering his decision, the prosecutor limited himself to the three medical reports which merely stated that there was no sign of ill-treatment on the applicant's body. The Court recalls in this connection that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is sufficiently broad in scope (see, Akko\u00e7\u00a0v. , nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7 55 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X). In the instant case, the medical reports dated 3 and 8 March 2001, which were drafted by the prison's own doctor, provided limited medical information and did not include any explanation by the applicant as regards his complaints.",

It is further noted that, although the International Law Department of the Ministry of Justice consulted the Directorate General of Criminal Law Issues as to whether a writ of mandamus should be issued to restart the investigation into the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment, the public prosecutor gave a negative opinion on this proposal, stating that the bone scintigraphy results did not indicate the cause or the timing of these injuries.
