It would appear that only these rights have so far been interpreted as rights of personality by the Croatian courts in the application of section 157 of the former 1978 Obligations Act and section\u00a019 of the current 2006 Obligations Act. The issue whether other rights guaranteed by the Constitution may, at this point, be qualified as rights of personality remains largely disputed.",

In particular, they had initiated the relevant proceedings in  long before the 2006 Obligations Act and the Anti-Discrimination Act had entered into force. In any event, it would have been unreasonable to expect them to resort to remedies the effects of which had never been proved by even a single example in the case-law (there was no evidence on the application of the Anti-Discrimination Act in practice), and whose effectiveness, even theoretically speaking, was difficult to envisage. For example, since the Religious Communities Act did not provide for an obligation for the Government of Croatia to enter into agreements with religious communities, the applicant churches submitted that therefore they could not have relied on section 248 of the Obligations Act.

It also notes that  allows certain religious communities to provide religious education in public schools and nurseries and recognises religious marriages performed by them. The Court reiterates in this connection that the prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 of the Convention applies also to those additional rights, falling within the wider ambit of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see E.B. v. France [GC], no.\u00a043546/02, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2008...). Consequently, the State, which has gone beyond its obligations under Article 9 of the Convention in creating such rights cannot, in the application of those rights, take discriminatory measures within the meaning of Article 14 (see, mutatis mutandis, E.B. v.\u00a0France, cited above, \u00a7 49). It follows that, although Croatia is not obliged under Article 9 of the Convention to allow religious education in public schools and nurseries or to recognise religious marriages, the facts of the instant case nevertheless fall within the wider ambit of that Article (see, for example and mutatis mutandis, Thlimmenos v.

The Government of Croatia nevertheless entered into such an agreement with the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the Croatian Old Catholic Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church (see paragraph 38 above), which jointly had 522 adherents according to the 2001 census (see paragraph 40 above) and thus did not meet the numerical criterion. The Government explained that this was so because the Religious Communities Commission established that those churches had satisfied the alternative criterion of being \u201chistorical religious communities of the European cultural circle\u201d (see paragraphs 19 and 75 above). However, the Government provided no explanation as to why the applicant churches, which are of a Reformist denomination, were not qualified as \u201chistorical religious communities of the European cultural circle\u201d by the Religious Communities Commission. Therefore, it has to be concluded, as also submitted by the applicant churches (see paragraph 82 above), that the criteria set forth in the Government\u2019s Instruction of 23 December 2004 were not applied on an equal basis to all religious communities.",

As already noted above, those sections further provide that this right is to be exercised in a manner regulated by an agreement between a religious community and the founder of a medical or social-welfare institution or, as regards prisons and penitentiaries, with the Government (see paragraph 18 above). It follows that the conclusion of such an agreement is not a necessary condition for the right to be created. Rather, the agreement only regulates the manner in which the right is to be exercised. The Court therefore finds that this complaint does concern a \u201cright specifically granted under national law\u201d and, consequently, that Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 to the Convention is applicable to it.",

The religious communities which are entitled to do so were granted those privileges exclusively on the basis of agreements on issues of common interest concluded with the Government of Croatia. As already noted above (see paragraph 45), section 9(1) of the Religious Communities Act does not bind the State to enter into such agreements, therefore leaving their conclusion at the discretion of the State. Thus, it cannot be argued that the applicant churches\u2019 complaints that they were not granted the same privileges also concern a \u201cright specifically granted to them under national law\u201d.

It reiterates in this connection that the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for an applicant (see, for example, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2000XI; and Amann v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2000II) and that the mere fact that an action has very limited prospects of success is not equivalent to depriving the plaintiff of the right of access to a court (see X v. the United Kingdom, no. 7443/76, Commission decision of 10\u00a0December 1976, DR 8, pp. 216, 217). Consequently, it cannot be said that the applicant churches lacked access to a court or an effective remedy. The fact that the domestic courts have not yet had a chance to deal with Article 41 of the Constitution in the context of an \u201caction against an unlawful act\u201d does not make any difference. Had the applicants brought such an action, the only possible ground for the domestic courts to declare their action inadmissible would be a finding that another judicial avenue of redress was available to them. However, such a finding would only reinforce the Court\u2019s view that the applicant churches had access to a court and had an effective remedy at their disposal.",

This is so because under Rule 55 of the Rules of Court and the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for example, Mooren v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7\u00a7 57-59, ECHR 2009...), a plea of inadmissibility on account of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies is subject to the rule of estoppel, that is to say that such a plea \u201cmust, in so far as its character and the circumstances permit, be raised by the respondent Contracting Party in its written or oral observations on the admissibility of the application\u201d. Since the Government never argued that the applicant churches should have brought an \u201caction against an unlawful act\u201d under sections 67-76 of the Administrative Disputes Act, the Court could not have taken that remedy into account when examining the Government\u2019s objection concerning nonexhaustion of domestic remedies.
