It further noted that the possibility of bringing an action for damages, in those circumstances, could not deprive the applicant of victim status for the purpose of lodging a complaint under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Nor could doing so be regarded as necessary for compliance with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Lastly, the Court considered that any damages that the applicant might have been able to recover against the seller of the flat might only be taken into account for the purposes of assessing the proportionality of the interference and calculation of pecuniary damage, if a violation of Article\u00a01 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 to the Convention was found by the Court, and if just satisfaction was awarded under Article 41 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a062).",

Having examined the specific conditions and procedures under which the State had alienated its assets to private individuals, the Court noted that they were within the State\u2019s exclusive competence and held that any defects in those procedures, resulting in the loss by the State or municipal authorities of their real property, should not have been remedied at the expense of bona fide owners. The Court further reasoned that the restitution of such property to the State or municipality, in the absence of any compensation being paid to the bona fide owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the bona fide owners\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

The Court further notes that there were safeguards in place to ensure that the flat changed hands in accordance with the domestic law. The lawfulness of the transaction and title in respect of the flat were subject to control by the registration authorities. The Government, however, did not proffer any explanation as to why those safeguards had not been effective in detecting the fraud and protecting the town administration\u2019s interests. In particular, neither the domestic judicial authorities nor the Government clarified why it had been possible for the registration authorities to approve the transfer of title to the flat to Chob. at a time when the flat had been municipal property. The Government did not proffer any explanation as to why the State registration authorities had failed to detect the fraud, had accepted the forged judgment as authentic and had approved the transactions concerning the flat. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that it was a faulty registration procedure that led to the town administration\u2019s loss of the title to the flat. The registration authorities failed to detect the fraud and protect municipal interests.",

In this respect, the Court notes that the town administration chose not to sue Chub. to recover its own losses resulting from the fraud. In any event, the Court reiterates that any compensation the applicant might receive from such an action could only be relevant for the evaluation of his losses, for the purposes of Article 41 of the Convention if a violation were found (see paragraph 22 above).",

The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors on the part of the State authorities should serve to the benefit of the persons affected. In other words, the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and any such errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova, cited above, \u00a7 49). It concludes that the forfeiture of the applicant\u2019s title to the flat and the transfer of the ownership of the flat to the town administration, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on the applicant. There has therefore been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention.",

Belgium (Article\u00a050), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case and to the fact that the applicant did not receive any compensation for the loss of his title to the flat in the domestic proceedings, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore the applicant\u2019s title to his share in the flat. Thus, he would be put, as far as possible, back into a situation equivalent to the one in which he would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).
