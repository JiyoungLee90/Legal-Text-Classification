It was not even established that the applicant was F.\u2019s biological father. Paternity could, however, only be determined in separate proceedings and under certain conditions, which the applicant was most probably unable to meet. In any event, even assuming that the applicant was F.\u2019s biological father, he would still not have a right of access and information, for lack of a social and family relationship with F. The case of Keenan v. Ireland, in which the European Court of Human Rights had strengthened the rights of biological fathers who had not yet built up a social and family relationship with their child, was not comparable to the present case. The facts of that case, in which the child\u2019s mother had given up the child for adoption, were not comparable to those of the present case as the interests of all persons concerned had to be weighed in the balance. In the present case, the applicant\u2019s right in his position as biological father could not outweigh the protection of the family, the mother and the child under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 30 below). In this conflict of interests, anything which could upset a child\u2019s trust in his family had to be prevented. It was preferable that F. grew up in his family without learning about the problematic circumstances of his origin.",

He argued that for a biological father to relate closely to his child, so as to have a right of access and information, it was sufficient that the father was willing to take responsibility for the child. Otherwise, the child\u2019s mother would have the right to prevent any contact between father and child. Such contact, and knowledge of his own origins, were in the child\u2019s best interest. The applicant further claimed that the family courts\u2019 refusal to determine whether he was F.\u2019s biological father and their failure to examine, with regard to the circumstances of his case and by taking evidence, whether contact with him would be in F.\u2019s best interest had disproportionately interfered with his right to respect for his family life. Moreover, the domestic courts\u2019 decisions had discriminated against him in his right of access and information compared to fathers of children born in or out of wedlock, mothers, grandparents and siblings.",

In both cases, the reasons why the biological father had not previously established a \u201csocial and family relationship\u201d with the children / child concerned had been irrelevant for the domestic courts\u2019 findings.

Germany (no. 22028/04, \u00a7\u00a7 44 et seq., 3 December 2009, which concerned the general exclusion from judicial review of the attribution of sole custody to the mother of a child born out of wedlock; the domestic courts, applying the relevant provisions of the Civil Code, also considered parental rights of a father prima facie not to be in the child\u2019s best interest, without further examination on the merits). Having regard to the realities of family life in the 21st century, revealed, inter alia, in the context of its own comparative law research (see paragraphs 38-46 above), the Court is not convinced that the best interest of children living with their legal father but having a different biological father can be truly determined by a general legal assumption. Consideration of what lies in the best interest of the child concerned is, however, of paramount importance in every case of this kind (see paragraph 93 above). Having regard to the great variety of family situations possibly concerned, the Court therefore considers that a fair balancing of the rights of all persons involved necessitates an examination of the particular circumstances of the case. It further had regard to the Government\u2019s argument that this approach involved proceedings which placed a burden on the legal family (see paragraph 75 above). The Court notes, however, that proceedings requesting access to children may be and are in practice already currently instituted by biological fathers.",
