Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7\u00a7 118-121, ECHR\u00a02005XIII. Those principles can be summarised as follows. Impartiality denotes the absence of prejudice or bias, and its existence must be determined according to two types of test: a subjective one seeking to determine the personal conviction or interest of a particular judge in a given case, and an objective test ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect. As regards the second test, when applied to a body sitting as a bench, it means determining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of any of the members of that body, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to its impartiality. In this respect even appearances may be of some importance. It follows that when it is being decided whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular body lacks impartiality, the standpoint of those claiming that it is not impartial is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether that fear can be held to be objectively justified.",

The applicant raised the issue of bias on the part of the criminal judges of Stara Zagora Regional Court before two higher authorities, that is to say the Plovdiv Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 28 and 31 above), which were themselves respondents in the framework of the same civil compensation proceedings. The fact is that neither of those higher courts replied to the applicant\u2019s submissions (see paragraphs 30 and 32 above).
