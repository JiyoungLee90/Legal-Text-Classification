The Chamber found that in respect of the risks of ovum donation invoked by the Government, such as the risk of the exploitation of women, particularly those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, or the \u201cselection\u201d of children, the Artificial Procreation Act itself already contained sufficient safeguards.

A prohibition of the combination of these lawful techniques thus required particularly persuasive arguments. Most of the arguments put forward by the Government were, however, not specific to sperm donation for in vitro fertilisation. As regards the Government\u2019s argument that non-in vitro artificial insemination had been in use for some time, that it was easy to handle and its prohibition would therefore have been hard to monitor, the Chamber found that a question of mere efficiency carried less weight than the particularly important interests of the private individuals involved and concluded that the difference in treatment at issue was not justified.

Thus, there was no positive obligation under that provision for Contracting States to make available to infertile couples all existing medical techniques of procreation. The lack of a European consensus on the question of medically assisted procreation conferred a wide margin of appreciation on the Contracting States, allowing them to make their own policy decisions on such a complex matter that had far-reaching scientific, legal, ethical and social implications. In vitro fertilisation, which had a direct effect on human life and the foundations of society, was clearly a highly sensitive matter on which no European consensus had been reached. Medically assisted procreation also involved serious risks. Gamete donation might lead to pressure on women on moderate incomes and encourage trafficking of ova. Scientific studies also showed that there was a link between in vitro fertilisation treatment and premature births. Lastly, to call maternal filiation into question by splitting motherhood would lead to a weakening of the entire structure of society.",

Indeed, according to the information available to the Court, although the technology of medically assisted procreation had been available in Europe for several decades, many of the issues to which it gave rise, particularly with regard to the question of filiation, remained the subject of debate. For example, there was no consensus among the member States of the Council of Europe on the question whether the interests of a child conceived in such a way were best served by preserving the anonymity of the donor of the sperm or whether the child should have the right to know the donor\u2019s identity (ibid.).

However, the matter can also be seen as an interference by the State with the applicants\u2019 rights to respect for their family life as a result of the prohibition under sections 3(1) and 3(2) of the Artificial Procreation Act of certain techniques of artificial procreation that had been developed by medical science but of which they could not avail themselves because of that prohibition. In the present case, the Court will approach the case as one involving an interference with the applicants\u2019 right to avail themselves of techniques of artificial procreation as a result of the operation of sections 3(1) and 3(2) of the Artificial Procreation Act since they were in fact prevented from doing so by the operation of the law that they unsuccessfully sought to challenge before the Austrian courts. In any case, as noted above, the applicable principles regarding justification under Article\u00a08 \u00a7 2 are broadly similar for both analytical approaches adopted (see Evans, cited above, \u00a7 75, and Keegan v.

Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider (see Evans, cited above, \u00a7 77; X, Y and Z v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044; Frett\u00e9\u00a0v.

The State\u2019s margin in principle extends both to its decision to intervene in the area and, once having intervened, to the detailed rules it lays down in order to achieve a balance between the competing public and private interests (see Evans, cited above \u00a7 82). However, this does not mean that the solutions reached by the legislature are beyond the scrutiny of the Court. It falls to the Court to examine carefully the arguments taken into consideration during the legislative process and leading to the choices that have been made by the legislature and to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the competing interests of the State and those directly affected by those legislative choices. In order to do so, the Court finds that the situation of the first and second applicants and that of the third and fourth applicants have to be examined separately.

These measures are intended to prevent potential risks of eugenic selection and their abuse and to prevent the risk of the exploitation of women in vulnerable situations as ovum donors. The Austrian legislature could theoretically devise and enact further measures or safeguards to reduce the risk attached to ovum donation as described by the Government. Having regard to the risk referred to by the Government of creating relationships in which the social circumstances deviated from the biological ones, the Court observes that unusual family relations in a broad sense, which do not follow the typical parent-child relationship based on a direct biological link, are not unknown in the legal orders of the Contracting States. The institution of adoption was created over time in order to provide a satisfactory legal framework for such relations and is known in all the member States. Thus, a legal framework satisfactorily regulating the problems arising from ovum donation could also have been adopted. However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the splitting of motherhood between a genetic mother and the one carrying the child differs significantly from adoptive parent-child relations and has added a new aspect to this issue.",

It found that a prohibition of the combination of two medical techniques which, taken in isolation, were allowed, required particularly persuasive arguments.

However, there remain the basic concerns relied on by the Government, namely, that the prohibition of the donation of gametes involving the intervention of third persons in a highly technical medical process was a controversial issue in Austrian society, raising complex questions of a social and ethical nature on which there was not yet a consensus in society and which had to take into account human dignity, the well-being of children thus conceived and the prevention of negative repercussions or potential misuse. The Court has found above that the prohibition of ovum donation for in vitro fertilisation, which relied on these grounds, is compatible with the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention and, in taking into account the general framework in which the prohibition at issue must be seen, is also of relevance here.",

It shows rather the careful and cautious approach adopted by the Austrian legislature in seeking to reconcile social realities with its approach of principle in this field. In this connection, the Court also observes that there is no prohibition under Austrian law on going abroad to seek treatment of infertility that uses artificial procreation techniques not allowed in Austria and that in the event of a successful treatment the Civil Code contains clear rules on paternity and maternity that respect the wishes of the parents (see, mutatis mutandis, A, B and\u00a0C v.\u00a0Ireland, cited above, \u00a7 239).",

Indeed, since the Grand Chamber judgment in Evans v. the United Kingdom of 10 April 2007 ([GC], no.\u00a06339/05, ECHR 2007I) our Court has accepted that the concept of private life, within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention, covers the right to respect for the decision to have or not to have a child (ibid., \u00a7 71). Moreover, in the Grand Chamber judgment in Dickson v. the United Kingdom of 4 December 2007 ([GC], no.\u00a044362/04, ECHR 2007V), which concerned the possibility of artificial insemination facilities, the Court concluded that Article\u00a08 was applicable on the ground that the procreation technique in question concerned the private and family life of the persons concerned, specifying that that notion incorporated the right to respect for their decision to become genetic parents (ibid., \u00a7 66). In the instant case, the Court states that \u201cthe right of a couple to conceive a child and to make use of medically assisted procreation for that purpose is also protected by Article 8, as such a choice is an expression of private and family life\u201d (see paragraph 82 of the judgment). That acknowledgment is all the more important in that, unlike the Chamber, the Grand Chamber subsequently limits its examination to Article 8 taken alone, considering that the substance of the applicants\u2019 complaints falls within that Article.

In these particular circumstances, we find it artificial for the Court to confine its examination to the situation as it existed when the Constitutional Court gave judgment in 1999 and in the context at the time, thus deliberately depriving a Grand Chamber judgment, delivered at the end of 2011, of any real substance. Admittedly, the judgment takes care to specify that \u201cthe Court is not prevented from having regard to subsequent developments in making its assessment\u201d (see paragraph 84 of the judgment), but that specification remains a dead letter in actual fact.",

Moreover, the judgment clearly acknowledges this point: \u201c[f]rom the material at the Court\u2019s disposal, it appears that since the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision in the present case many developments in medical science have taken place to which a number of Contracting States have responded in their legislation. Such changes might therefore have repercussions on the Court\u2019s assessment of the facts\u201d (see paragraph 84 of the judgment). They did not subsequently have any repercussions, though.",

Ten years have passed, however, and this has still not been followed up in any way.

Accordingly, for example in the Connors v. the United Kingdom judgment (no. 66746/01, 27 May 2004), the Court reiterated that the margin \u201cwill tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual\u2019s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a082), which is clearly the case here.",

Despite that, the Court considers that \u201c[the] emerging consensus is not, however, based on settled and long-standing principles established in the law of the member States but rather reflects a stage of development within a particularly dynamic field of law and does not decisively narrow the margin of appreciation of the State\u201d\u00a0(see paragraph\u00a096 of the judgment). The Court thus takes the unprecedented step of conferring a new dimension on the European consensus and applies a particularly low threshold to it, thus potentially extending the States\u2019 margin of appreciation beyond limits. The current climate is probably conducive to such a backward step. The differences in the Court\u2019s approach to the determinative value of the European consensus and a somewhat lax approach to the objective indicia used to determine consensus are pushed to their limit here, engendering great legal uncertainty.",

In general, one in ten couples experiences primary or secondary infertility\u201d and \u201cit is a central issue in the lives of the individuals who suffer from it.

Today, \u201csociety has to cope with new challenges brought to the forefront by [a] technological revolution [in the field of assisted reproduction] and its social implications\u201d. In this respect, it seems to us important to recall Articles 12 \u00a7 1 and 15 \u00a7 1 (b) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) which recognises the right of everyone to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications, and the right of everyone to enjoy the highest standard of physical and mental health.

This is sometimes described as wide or broad (see paragraph 97 of the judgment), and is sometimes referred to without any qualifying adjective (see paragraphs\u00a0106 and 115 of the judgment), thereby indicating a certain amount of hesitation as to the correct weight to be given to that concept and to the seriousness of the limitation in question. The result is that the Court\u2019s position is unclear and uncertain, or even opaque. While acknowledging that the legislature could have provided acceptable, perhaps more balanced, legal solutions to the difficulties associated with ovum and sperm donation, the Grand Chamber confines itself to examining whether, by adopting the impugned solution, it exceeded its margin of appreciation (see paragraph 106 of the judgment). In our opinion, this is not the issue here. On the one hand, where the States have authorised MAP, the Court has to verify whether the benefit thereof is granted in accordance with their obligations under the Convention and whether they have chosen the means that impinge the least on rights and freedoms. The margin of appreciation goes hand in hand with European supervision. On the other hand, in a case as sensitive as this one, the Court should not use the margin of appreciation as a \u201cpragmatic substitute for a thought-out approach to the problem of proper scope of review\u201d. Ultimately, through the combined effect of the European consensus and the margin of appreciation, the Court has chosen a minimum \u2013 or even minimalist \u2013 approach that is hardly likely to enlighten the national courts.",

Furthermore, by endorsing the Government\u2019s reasoning according to which, in the event that treatment abroad is successful, the paternity and maternity of the child will be governed by the Civil Code in accordance with the parents\u2019 wishes, the Grand Chamber considerably weakens the strength of the arguments based on \u201cthe unease existing among large sections of society as to the role and possibilities of modern reproductive medicine\u201d, particularly concerning the creation of atypical family relations (see paragraph 113 of the judgment). Lastly, if the concerns for the child\u2019s best interests \u2013 allegedly endangered by recourse to prohibited means of reproduction \u2013 disappear as a result of crossing the border, the same is true of the concerns relating to the mother\u2019s health referred to several times by the respondent Government to justify the prohibition.",
