In each of these cases the investigations were formally pending at the time when the applications were lodged with the Court. The criminal proceedings in all the cases were suspended and resumed on several occasions throughout the periods concerned. The applicants maintained reasonable contact with the authorities, cooperated with the investigation, and, where appropriate, took steps to keep themselves informed of the progress in the proceedings and to speed them up, in the hope of a more effective outcome (see paragraphs 18, 24, 29, 113, 118, 156, 184, 187 and 188 above).

Should it be accepted that the authorities were informed about the abduction only in August 2004, the Court notes that the investigators had never asked the applicants about the reasons for a two-year delay in bringing their complaints, although this would have been essential for establishing the whereabouts of their relatives. Furthermore, the applicants provided the authorities with the necessary information regarding their relatives and the circumstances of their abduction, thus expecting important investigative developments in establishing their whereabouts or identifying the perpetrators. From the documents submitted it does not transpire, therefore, that the applicants failed to show the requisite diligence by delaying their complaints or remaining passive in respect of the domestic investigation (contrast Doshuyeva and Yusupov v. Russia (dec.), no. 58055/10, \u00a7\u00a7 41-47, 31 May 2016).",

The applicants informed the authorities immediately after the incident and cooperated with the investigators by giving statements about the circumstances of the abduction (see paragraphs 128 and 130 above). However, there was a discernible lull in the investigation comprising eight years, when the investigation was dormant. Such a long period of inaction on the part of the authorities could have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the pending investigation. The Court notes however that during that period the applicants remained active in trying to establish the whereabouts of their son. They maintained contact with the authorities by lodging complaints with various law-enforcement agencies, complaints which were later forwarded to the investigators, and they received replies stating that operational search activities were under way (see paragraph 134 above). The Court therefore considers that it was reasonable for the applicants, who consistently received such replies from the authorities, to wait for developments that could have resolved crucial factual or legal issues (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no.\u00a039630/09, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2012). Given the overall time frame between the incident and the lodging of the application with the Court, the above lull in the proceedings, therefore, cannot be interpreted as a failure by the applicants to show due diligence and comply with the six-month requirement.",

It observes that in Tovdayevy (no. 41890/11) the applicants immediately reported the abduction to the authorities and provided information to the investigators about their relative\u2019s possible whereabouts (see paragraphs 37 and 41 above). The Court further notes that the applicants in Batalova and Others (no. 13920/12) informed the authorities about the abduction without there being any undue delay. Their inaction from 2001 to 2004 could be explained by the fact that they found themselves in a difficult situation during that period, following the active phase of the counterterrorist operation in Chechnya and owing to the loss of their three other sons in addition to the abduction of their son Mr Musa Tashayev (see paragraphs 76 and 196 above). The documents submitted show that the applicants informed the investigators promptly about important developments in the case and asked them to resume the investigation on several occasions (see paragraphs 87, 91, 92 and 94 above). In the Court\u2019s view, it cannot be concluded therefore that the applicants in Tovdayevy (no. 41890/11) and Batalova and Others (no. 13920/12) failed to show the requisite diligence by unreasonably waiting for the pending investigation to yield results (contrast Utsmiyeva and Others v.
