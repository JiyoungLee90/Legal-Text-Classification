In January 2011 the Troyan district public prosecutor\u2019s office stated that it was not aware of the whereabouts of the evidence (see paragraph 13 above), and that evidence was eventually released by the Sofia district public prosecutor\u2019s office (see paragraph 15 above).

France, no. 33592/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001-V, and O\u2019Sullivan McCarthy Mussel Development Ltd v. Ireland, no. 44460/16, \u00a7\u00a0136, 7 June 2018). While the Court has departed from this rule on previous occasions (see, for example, Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99 and 7 others, \u00a7 87-88, ECHR 2010, and Balakchiev and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), \u00a7 83, no. 65187/10, 18 June 2013), it sees no justification for doing so in the case at hand. Even though, as of about mid-2012, a tort action against the prosecution authorities for unjustified retention of physical evidence appears to have been an available and, in principle, an effective remedy, the present application was submitted on 1 July 2011. This means that the complaints under examination cannot be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

In addition, it had been possible to copy the relevant information and return the server, and the prosecution authorities had not acted with the necessary diligence, despite the applicant petitioning them on numerous occasions (see paragraphs 45-50 above).",

It is also significant that, while the applicant stated on numerous occasions that the server had also hosted his own website, that many of that website\u2019s features had stopped working and could not be restored, and that the site had been relatively popular and its unavailability was causing him financial damage (see paragraphs 8-10 above), the prosecution authorities remained inactive for a lengthy period of time. In particular, the Sofia district public prosecutor\u2019s office where the server was being retained only assessed the necessity of this retention and took a decision to release the server after being instructed to do so by the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (see paragraphs 14-15 and 49 above).",

The Court observes that, while it appears that the applicant did host on his server a website suspected of publishing contents in breach of copyright, at no point did the domestic authorities suggest that he bore any responsibility for the alleged copyright violations. As the interference with the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression was the result of actions taken by the authorities when collecting evidence against third persons, the Court does not see how the fact that no sanctions were imposed on him could be relevant for the proportionality analysis.",

Nevertheless, in the circumstances of the present case, as discussed above, this consideration is insufficient to tip the balance in favour of the Government. The Court points out once again that the retention of the applicant\u2019s server in criminal proceedings proved to be unnecessary for the purposes of the investigation and that for some period of time the prosecution authorities made no effort to remedy the effects of their actions on the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression, despite having been informed of those effects on many occasions.",
