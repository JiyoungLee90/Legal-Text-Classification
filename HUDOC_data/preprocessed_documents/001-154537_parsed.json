In addition, the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer in the proceedings, argued that he had been assured by the receiver that he would be informed of any progress in the proceedings (see paragraph 19 above). The Court sees no reason why the applicant should not have trusted the receiver, in particular bearing in mind the rather low number of creditors in the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, De Geouffre de la Pradelle, cited above, \u00a7\u00a033). Lastly, while the domestic law indeed does not provide for the personal service of summonses and court decisions in bankruptcy proceedings, it does however provide for the possibility of publishing the notification of the hearing on the distribution of the estate also in the mass media (see paragraph 51 above).",
