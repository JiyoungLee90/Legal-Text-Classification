Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy was available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of. Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7 1 cannot be interpreted, however, in a manner which would require an applicant to bring a complaint before the Court before his position in connection with the matter has been finally determined at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 to calculate the six-month time-limit from the date when the applicant first became, or ought to have become, aware of those circumstances (see, among others, Zenin v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a015413/03, 24\u00a0September 2009).",

At the same time, they claimed that during the investigation no information had been obtained proving beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abduction. The mere fact that the abductors had been armed and had worn camouflaged uniforms without distinctions was not enough to presume so.",

Applying the above-mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction of the missing person by servicemen, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Aziyevy v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7626/01, \u00a7 74, 20 March 2008; Utsayeva and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 29133/03, \u00a7 160, 29 May 2008; and Khutsayev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a016622/05, \u00a7 104, 27 May 2010). If the Government failed to rebut this presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17 June 2010; Movsayevy v. Russia, no. 20303/07, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a049379/09, \u00a7\u00a071, 3 May 2012).",

For want of supplementary evidence, the Court and the national authorities must rely on her recollections in order to establish the principal facts of the case. However, the applicant\u2019s statements regarding one of the central aspects of the case - the time of abduction - are at variance by two months.

The information in the Court\u2019s possession thus does not suffice to establish that the presumed perpetrators belonged to the security forces or that a security operation was carried out in respect of Ramzan Saidov (see Zubayrayev v. Russia, no. 67797/01, \u00a7 73, 10 January 2008, and Tovsultanova, cited above, \u00a7 88). Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant has not made a prima facie claim regarding the State\u2019s responsibility for the abduction of Ramzan Saidov. In such circumstances, it is unable to shift the burden of proof to the respondent Government. Accordingly, the Court cannot establish to the requisite standard of proof that Ramzan Saidov has been detained by State agents or that his presumed death is attributable to the respondent State.",
