By its order of 30 July 2009, the Centre had granted custody of the child to the father until the custody proceedings were completed. Since that order had been based on the first applicant\u2019s imprisonment, the prolonged revocation of her custody rights until 2012 (when the custody proceedings had ended) had not been supported by relevant and sufficient reasons. While the Centre had revoked her rights to custody of the child, it had failed to specify her visiting rights, notwithstanding that it had been competent ex officio to make such a decision. In this connection the applicants referred to section 78 of the Family Act (see paragraph 50 above). That the Centre had indeed been vested with the power to specify the visiting rights of its own motion had been confirmed by the orders of 31 May and 21 November 2007, as well as the order of 29 April 2008, in which the Centre had determined the venue and day of the meetings between the father and the child, although no specific proposal in this respect had been made by the father. Accordingly, the applicants argued that nothing had prevented the Centre from specifying of its own motion the first applicant\u2019s visiting rights between 30 July 2009 and 19 February 2010. The fact that the applicants had not seen each other during that time was wholly attributable to the Centre.

As to the State\u2019s obligation to take positive measures, Article\u00a08 includes the right of a parent to the taking of measures with a view to his or her being reunited with his or her child and an obligation on the national authorities to take such action, including in the event of conflict between the two parents. The obligation of the national authorities to take measures to facilitate reunion or contact by a non-custodial parent with children after divorce is not, however, absolute. The nature and extent of those measures will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned are always important ingredients. In addition, when difficulties arise, the appropriate authorities should impose adequate sanctions for any lack of cooperation and, whilst coercive measures are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of manifestly unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the child lives. Lastly, the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation. Proceedings relating to the award of parental responsibility, including the enforcement of a final decision, require urgent handling as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent with whom the child does not live (see Maumousseau and Washington v.\u00a0France, no. 39388/05, \u00a7 83, 6 December 2007).",

After the divorce, the contact rights of the non-custodial parent were determined by the Centre. That was in compliance with the applicable legislation, under which a social welfare centre was competent to decide family-related issues concerning parental rights (sections 76 and 83 of the Family Act \u2014 see paragraphs 49 and 53 above); custody (sections 78 and 87 of the Family Act \u2014 see paragraphs 50 and 54 above); and contact rights, when divorced parents could not agree (section 79 of the Family Act \u2014 see paragraph 51 above). The Centre issued nine orders specifying the contact rights of the non-custodial parent at the time. All those orders were issued on the basis of a request by the non-custodial parent at the time, including the mother (see paragraphs 18, 29, 32 and 40 above). Such a practice was in compliance with section 79(3) of the Family Act. The Court is not persuaded that the Centre had been competent ex officio to specify contact rights of the non-custodial parent, as argued by the applicants (see paragraph 70 above). Such competence neither had a basis in the applicable legislation, nor was it confirmed by any example of domestic practice. The applicants\u2019 arguments on this point concerned the Centre\u2019s competence to regulate custody-related matters of its own motion, as provided for in section 78 of the Family Act. The Centre\u2019s orders specifying the father\u2019s contact rights, to which the applicants referred in their submissions (31 May and 21 November 2007, as well as 29 April 2008), were issued on an application by the father (see paragraphs 9, 12 and 14 above).

This judgment was given after the trial court had heard the father, a representative of the Centre and the first applicant, who unlike in previous proceedings against her remained silent at the trial. On this occasion, the first-instance court sentenced her to three months\u2019 imprisonment. When determining the penalty, the court had regard to her previous criminal record and the fact that the suspended prison term imposed earlier had not proved sufficient to deter her from reoffending (see paragraph 21 above).

In this connection it cannot overlook the fact that this sentence was imposed after the first applicant had already been convicted of the same offence on two occasions and sentenced to a suspended prison term. Those convictions concerned the first applicant\u2019s failure to comply with the Centre\u2019s order of 31 May 2007 specifying the father\u2019s contact rights in respect of the child. Despite those convictions and sentences, the first applicant remained uncooperative and continued to prevent the father from seeing the second applicant. The impugned judgment of 10 July 2008 concerned the first applicant\u2019s failure to enable the father to see the second applicant as specified in the Centre\u2019s orders of 29 April and 28 May 2008 (see paragraph 21 above). It followed after the Centre\u2019s warning that she risked criminal prosecution should she fail to comply with these orders (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above) had proved futile. At this juncture, the Court notes that these orders were given with a view of protecting \u201cthe right of [the child] to have contact with the father\u201d, which the Centre, as the competent body in family-related issues, considered to have been \u201cin the absolute interest of [the child]\u201d (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). Having taken these orders into consideration, it is reasonable that the trial court implicitly accepted and was guided by the best interests of the child as these had been determined and reflected in those orders. In such circumstances, the trial court, being fully aware of all relevant circumstances (see paragraphs 10, 11 and 21 above) and after having consulted a representative of the Centre, imposed the custodial sentence after it had convicted the first applicant for the third time in a year. Whereas such a measure had short-term effects on the applicants\u2019 rights under this head, it had in the long run the child\u2019s best interests, namely to benefit from the company of both parents, as a primary consideration. In those circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the domestic authorities carried out an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts and took a measure which cannot be considered disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. In this connection the Court reiterates that the likelihood of family reunification will be progressively diminished and eventually destroyed if the biological father and the child are not allowed to see each other at all, or only so rarely that no natural bonding between them is likely to occur (see Mitovi v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 53565/13, \u00a7 64, 16 April 2015 and G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc v.\u00a0Germany, no. 74969/01, \u00a7 46, 26 February 2004).",

While those proceedings were pending, on 9 July 2009 the Centre granted the father, under section 87 of the Family Act (see paragraph 54 above), temporary custody (for fifteen days). Given her continuing refusal to allow the father to meet his daughter, the Centre granted the father temporary custody of the child until the custody proceedings launched by the father had been completed.

However, it is an essential part of a prisoner\u2019s right to respect for family life that the authorities enable him, or if need be, assist him, to maintain contact with his close family. This is because a person does not forfeit his or her Convention rights, including the right to respect for family life, on imprisonment (see Khoroshenko v.

For example, it does not appear from the facts that the authorities contemplated the imposition of a temporary custody order under the Family Act (see paragraph 54 of the judgment) before resorting to criminal measures against the first applicant, imposing first a suspended sentence and then depriving her of her liberty. It was only on 9 July 2009, more than two years after the District Court had imposed on the first applicant the first criminal sentence, that the Centre gave custody of the second applicant to the father for fifteen days.",

While contact-related proceedings are also extremely important for the best interests of the child, and the authorities have to react promptly in enforcing contact orders, recourse to criminal law sanctions, especially custodial sentences, without assessing the effectiveness of other instruments, in the light of the child\u2019s best interests, might be counterproductive.",

We would point out that at that time the first applicant still had custody of her daughter, temporary custody only having being given to the father on 30\u00a0July 2009, the date when the first applicant started to serve her sentence. In sum, while aiming to guarantee the contact rights of the father, the national authorities sent the mother to prison and practically separated the child from the parent who had custody of her for a period of 7 months and 19 days, from 30 July 2009 to 19 February 2010 (see paragraphs 26 and 31 of the judgment).",

In our view, this is a clear departure from previously established case-law of the Court to the effect that a margin of appreciation in these types of cases will only be granted if it is clear from the reasoning of decisions taken by the domestic authorities that they made an informed and reasonable assessment of the best interests of the child in proceedings of this nature. It goes without saying that this Court cannot accept that such deference be afforded to national authorities on the basis of the kind of \u201cimplicit acceptance\u201d test endorsed by the majority, as such a test does not comply in our view with the overriding character of the principle of the best interests of children. We consider it clear from the facts that the main concern of the national authorities in imposing a prison sentence on the first applicant was, as the first instance-court stated, to \u201cdeter her from reoffending in the future and [to] [help crime prevention as a whole]\u201d (see paragraph 21 of the judgment in fine). The first two suspended sentences against the first applicant were imposed when the young child was an infant, respectively five months and ten months old. When deciding on the third sentence in July 2008, the first-instance court was, in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, required to assess, clearly and directly, to what extent a prison sentence would affect the psychological well-being of the young child and the emotional ties between her and her mother. A fresh assessment of the family\u2019s situation was needed, and in particular of the best interests of the child, at the time when it was being decided to impose a prison sentence on the first applicant, depriving her of her liberty and thus limiting the paramount right of the young child to be with her mother. A mere reference to the assessment that had been made the previous year was not in conformity with the requirement to consider the best interests of the child for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention. Therefore, we conclude that it has not been demonstrated by the Government that the national authorities duly took into consideration the child\u2019s best interests in the proportionality assessment of the measures taken against the first applicant.",

With all due respect, we note that nowhere do the domestic authorities refer to such arguments or considerations in their assessment of the facts. It is simply inconsistent with the whole notion of the subsidiary nature of the Court\u2019s role for it to step in and assume that considerations of this nature have been taken into account at domestic level when they do not have any basis in the record.",
