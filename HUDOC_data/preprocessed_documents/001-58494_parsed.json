Spain judgment of 19 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VIII, p. 2955, \u00a7 31, and the Edificaciones March Gallego S.A. v.

Further, the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access is one aspect, is not absolute; it is subject to limitations permitted by implication, in particular where the conditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned, since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard. However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired; lastly, such limitations will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued (see, among other authorities, the Edificaciones March Gallego S.A. judgment cited above, p. 290, \u00a7 34).
