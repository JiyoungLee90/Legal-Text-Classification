Yet it observed that the applicant worked and took care of his three older children, did not exercise his parental rights improperly, and had no negative influence on the older children. The applicant was also ready to support the twins financially, visit them and communicate with them when they became older.

According to doctors who examined the twins, during the first years of their lives their development of motor skills was slower than normal, and by the age of three they had specific mixed development disorder (specialus mi\u0161rus raidos sutrikimas), and their language development was delayed. They needed speech therapy, physiotherapy and an undemanding regimen (tausojantis re\u017eimas). On 7 November 2006, at I.N.\u2019s request and on the basis of reports by psychologists and doctors, the twins received learning support at the \u0160iauliai Special Upbringing Centre. At the centre the twins received help from a speech therapist and special educational needs teachers (specialieji pedagogai), and benefited from such procedures as massages, medical exercise therapy and herbal baths. Upon the request of I.N., who stated that she was ill herself and had to take care of her elderly mother, from 7\u00a0November 2006 onwards the twins became weekly boarders (from Mondays to Fridays) at the Special Upbringing Centre. As the doctors later noted during court proceedings, they made no recommendation either in favour of or against the twins boarding there during the week. As I.N. later specified during court hearings, she had not felt it appropriate for the twins to go to a regular kindergarten, because there were twenty-two children in one class (grup\u0117) there, whereas at the \u0160iauliai Special Upbringing Centre there were only eight children in a class. According to the Government, the children stayed at the Special Upbringing Centre until 31 May 2009. It also appears from the documents before the Court that in the event of illnesses and during holidays the children were taken home (for example, in accordance with a doctor\u2019s recommendation that the children stay at I.N.\u2019s home from 23 December 2008 for four months).",

The applicant came to visit them at the centre twice. After his visits the children acted normally, although they were more interested in the presents he brought and did not communicate much.

That being so, the court nevertheless held that the twins had a strong emotional link with I.N. and their emotional link with the applicant was not sufficient, which situation had clearly been influenced by the fact that the twins had lived separately from the applicant since June 2004. The court also observed that because of the dispute over money between the applicant and I.N. which had started in summer 2008, he had had limited opportunities to take part in educating his children and to communicate with them. It was only from July 2011, when the court had issued an interim order providing for the applicant\u2019s contact with the twins in accordance with a fixed schedule, that the applicant had started to have regular contact with the twins. Even so, the applicant had not taken all possible steps to participate in the upbringing of the twins on an equal basis with I.N. Namely, even though the twins had been removed from his care in June 2004, the applicant had never asked for the twins to be returned to live with him until the disagreement with I.N. arose in summer 2008, even though his two other sons were no longer minors as of December 2003 and December 2004 respectively. The court also noted the applicant\u2019s acknowledgement that until 2008 he had not encountered any obstacles to communicating with the twins. Yet, he had communicated with them only \u201cepisodically\u201d, with the result that the emotional connection between the twins and the applicant and his other children was less strong than that existing between the twins and I.N. and her children.

They did not even want to stay at his home during the weekends, this being confirmed by the applicant\u2019s eldest child, \u017d.J.",

Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s argument that the twins could stay at home until he returned from work showed that it would not be possible for him, and he was not ready, to take concrete steps to take care of the two children, who came home from school at noon.

The court held that the best interests of the child were the priority. In the applicant\u2019s case the appellate court had not established the existence of any new circumstances. Nevertheless, this did not automatically mean that the twins had to be returned to the applicant\u2019s home immediately.

If the twins could have contact with their father for a longer period than the current sporadic, twice-a-week arrangement, they would be able to see that their father was there for them and that they could resolve everyday problems with their father\u2019s assistance.",

The court noted that there was no basis for I.N.\u2019s claims that the applicant had harmed the twins or had not taken care of them at all until autumn 2008. On the contrary, the evidence showed that he had been seeking contact with the children. The boy wanted to have contact with the applicant, and the girl would agree to have contact with him if he ceased his dispute with I.N. However, the twins\u2019 contact with the applicant could not be forced. Whilst observing that the child\u2019s best interests were paramount, the first-instance court also relied on the Court\u2019s case-law, noting that in matters of child custody, for example, the reason for considering the \u201cchild\u2019s best interests\u201d may be twofold: firstly, to guarantee that the child develops in a sound environment and that a parent cannot take measures that would harm its health and development; secondly, to maintain its ties with its family, except in cases where the family has proved particularly unfit, since severing those ties means cutting a child off from its roots (the court referred to Maumousseau and Washington v. France, no. 39388/05, \u00a7 67, 6\u00a0December 2007). Lastly, the court rejected all the accusations by I.N. that the applicant had been antagonistic, because a criminal case initiated by her had been dismissed by the authorities (see paragraphs 18 and 44 above). The applicant thus had a right to have contact with the twins and an inherent duty to take part in educating them. He was also able to offer them appropriate living conditions.",

For that reason, the applicant had sometimes tried to have contact with his daughter when she did not want to spend time with him, although his son was prepared to meet him. As for I.N., she had not attempted to restore the twins\u2019 relations with their father and had showed no concern for the fact that the applicant\u2019s and his daughter\u2019s relationship was getting weaker and was close to breaking down. Accordingly, the parties\u2019 failure to take care of the children\u2019s best interests required that those interests be protected by the courts. Moreover, considering that the biggest issue was the communication between the applicant and his daughter, the court saw it appropriate to set, on its own initiative, a further schedule for their communication during the transitional period, so that the girl\u2019s contact with the applicant be re-established. In particular, a psychologist or child care specialist was to assist the applicant and his daughter, during contact sessions which would take place in a neutral setting. Lastly, the court reiterated that the principle of the rights of the child having priority was relevant not only when setting a schedule for the contact between the applicant and the twins, but also when executing the court decision establishing that schedule. The applicant thus should not make use of his right to see the children, including taking them to his apartment, if this would breach the twins\u2019 rights, even though his right to see them had been established in the court\u2019s decision.",

The court has had regard to the current categorical and consistent position of the children towards the opportunity to stay overnight with their father as envisaged in the [lower court\u2019s] parental contact order. The medical certificates included in the case file allow the court to state that the children\u2019s state of health, anxiety, and irritability strengthened, their emotional state and behaviour worsened, hence treatment at home is recommended for them. The medical documents recording the existence [of] weakness of the central nervous system, attention-deficit disorder, [delayed] language development, learning [difficulties], etc. were neither refuted during the examination of the case before the court of the first instance, nor during the examination on appeal. While commenting on the children\u2019s feelings towards their father the psychologist has noted that there is not currently a close relationship between the father and the children, the son [D.J.] states that he only wants to have contact with his father when he [D.J.] so wishes, the daughter [K.J.] is avoiding contact with her father. The twins [D.J.] and [K.J.] were examined in terms of their psychological state, heightened fear of separation from their guardian, and feelings of insecurity. While stating that the major problem is the daughter\u2019s [K.J.\u2019s] communication with her father, the court of first instance correctly emphasised the need [for it] to establish additional conditions for contact between the girl and her father, hence it justly noted that the father\u2019s contact with his daughter was essential to restore a normal relationship with his daughter. A transitional period had to be established given that [it would take] a reasonable period of time for the child to become accustomed to [spending time] her father.",

The panel of judges also considers that contact with the [applicant\u2019s] son [D.J.] contrary to his wishes (involuntarily) would not satisfy the interests of the child. In view of the aim of reinstating the lost connection, forced (involuntary) contact [on the part of] the children with their father would be meaningless because forced contact [sessions] may even result in intense hostility towards their father. Hence, on the basis of the arguments presented the existing order should be changed by removing the possibility for the children to stay at their father\u2019s home overnight. Being active in such category of cases the court draws attention to the existing contact order [which provides for] contact sessions during the working week [for] up to four hours. The panel of judges considers that such frequent contact may unbalance the children\u2019s rest periods and in the present case a transitional period is required for rebuilding of the relationship. Hence the panel of judges decides that voluntary contact between the children and [the applicant] on weekends and on holidays would contribute to a proper balancing of the father\u2019s and the children\u2019s interests. Thus the panel decides that the time for collecting and returning the children on weekends and on holidays, with the exception of the father\u2019s and daughter\u2019s contact sessions in the presence of the appointed specialist once a week, should be changed. The court considers that the children may be taken by their father on Saturdays from 12 p.m. until 7 p.m. because these particular hours are optimal - the children\u2019s rest periods during the week and on Sundays will not be disrupted. Accordingly, the [relevant] part of the [lower court\u2019s] decision on the contact order should be changed. Moreover, the panel considers that in view of the transitional period it has emphasised [will be necessary] for the building of relations with their father, the issue of the children spending their holidays with their father has been decided far too early, hence this part of the [lower court\u2019s] decision is to be quashed. The appeal court notes that the [legal] relations [established by] a contact order concerning a child and [by] raising a child are of a continuing nature, hence when the factual circumstances change the father of the children [the applicant] or the guardian [I.N.] have the right to apply to the court seeking a change to the existing order.",

One of the fundamental principles is that all children have a right to be consulted and heard in proceedings involving or affecting them. The best interests of the children are a primary consideration for the Member States. The Guidelines also provide that children should be treated with care and sensitivity throughout any procedure or case, with special attention for their personal situation, well-being and specific needs, and with full respect for their physical and psychological integrity. This treatment should be given to them, in whichever way they have come into contact with judicial or non-judicial proceedings or other interventions, and regardless of their legal status and capacity in any procedure or case. Judges should respect the right of children to be heard in all matters that affect them or at least to be heard when they are deemed to have a sufficient understanding of the matters in question. Judgments and court rulings affecting children should be duly reasoned. In all proceedings involving children, the urgency principle should be applied to provide a speedy response and protect the best interests of the child, while respecting the rule of law. In family law cases (for example, custody), courts should exercise exceptional diligence to avoid any risk of adverse consequences on the family relations. When necessary, judicial authorities should consider the possibility of taking provisional decisions. Once the judicial proceedings are over, national authorities should take all necessary steps to facilitate the execution of court decisions involving and affecting children without delay. Lastly, after judgments in highly conflictual proceedings, guidance and support should be offered to children and their families by specialised services (see points nos. 44-48, 50-54, 76 and 79).",

In the applicant\u2019s case, while deciding on the application to have the children\u2019s guardianship terminated and a residence order granted, the national courts had ordered a psychological evaluation of the twins (pursuant to a court order of 10\u00a0August 2010 and the report of which was issued on 10\u00a0September 2010).

In the instant case, the twins had been raised by I.N. for a relatively long period of time \u2013 five years \u2013 from infancy until the age of five years, at which point their biological father had decided that he wished to have them returned to his care after financial disputes with I.N. arose. The twins had therefore had an obvious interest in growing up in a safe and healthy environment, and in being loved and cared for by both I.N., whom they referred to as \u201cmum\u201d, and by their biological father. The current existing guardianship of the children was thus consistent with the aim of reuniting the biological family. The twins felt safe living with their current family, but at the same time the applicant\u2019s parental rights had not been terminated and he was able to have contact with his children so that he could develop a closer relationship with both of them. An important factor was that the twins had special needs due to their state of health.

The twins had been taken to live with her at the age of six months, right after the death of their biological mother in December 2003. The national courts had taken this into particular account, especially in view of the fact that from that time until the summer of 2008 the applicant\u2019s contact with the twins had been merely sporadic (referring to the findings of the \u0160iauliai City District Court set out in its decision of 12 September 2011, see paragraph 37 above).

Thus, where the existence of a family tie has been established, the State must in principle act in a manner calculated to enable that tie to be developed and take measures that will enable parent and child to be reunited (see Margareta and Roger Andersson v. Sweden, 25\u00a0February 1992, \u00a7 91, Series A no. 226A; Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2000I; and Gnahor\u00e9 v. France, no. 40031/98, \u00a7\u00a051, ECHR 2000IX). However, neither the right of the parents nor its counterpart, the obligation of the national authorities, is absolute, since the reunion of natural parents with children who have lived for some time in a foster family needs preparation. The nature and extent of such preparation may depend on the circumstances of each case, but it always requires the active and understanding co-operation of all concerned. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to bring about such co-operation, their possibilities of applying coercion in this respect are limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, notably the children\u2019s interests and their rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see Olsson v.

On the contrary, he did not deny before the domestic courts that until 2008 he had been able to see his two children when he so wished (see paragraphs 24 and 44 above). Furthermore, when the disputes between the applicant and I.N. started in 2008, and, in particular after they escalated in 2010, the year when the applicant had applied to the domestic courts for a contact order in respect of the twins, the court acted without delay and made an interim order designed to increase and facilitate contact between the applicant and the twins so that the twins\u2019 relationship with their biological father could be preserved (see paragraphs 32, 34 and 50 above). Indeed, in view of the aim of reinstating the lost connection, the \u0160iauliai City District Court, of its own initiative, ordered that the applicant be able to see his daughter K.J. in the presence of a psychologist, a measure the court deemed to be important so that the applicant\u2019s and his daughter\u2019s relationship could be rebuilt (see paragraphs 53 and 57 above). Given that the applicant did not appeal against the \u0160iauliai City District Court\u2019s and \u0160iauliai Regional Court\u2019s decisions as to his contact rights (see paragraphs 55 and 59 above), it may be assumed that contact of such frequency was to the applicant\u2019s satisfaction. Similarly, on the basis of the documents submitted by the parties, the Court considers that the Service acted sufficiently proactively in monitoring the situation. The Service\u2019s child care specialists paid numerous visits to I.N.\u2019s home, discussed the situation with the children without I.N. being present, and urged the applicant and I.N. to seek psychological help and to put the children\u2019s interests first (see paragraphs 25, 60\u201365 above).",

In this context, of great significance for the Court is the fact that the Lithuanian courts, while acknowledging the applicant\u2019s right to live with his children but temporarily refusing his request, placed the children\u2019s best interests first, as it is required by Article\u00a08 of the Convention (see paragraph 98 above), as well as by the national law and international instruments (see paragraphs 69-73 above). Indeed, the consideration of children\u2019s best interests is ingrained in each and every domestic court\u2019s decision (see paragraphs 23, 34, 36, 39, 48, 52, 53 and 57 above), to which the Court has given its utmost consideration. By the time the applicant instituted the proceedings for custody rights in December\u00a02008, the twins were five-and-a-half years old and had been living with I.N. for nearly all of their lives. Given the children\u2019s frail health and special needs, as attested by experts and doctors, the first-instance and appellate courts held that to remove the children from their familiar environment would jeopardise the children\u2019s physical and psychological welfare (see paragraphs 39, 46, 47, 48, 56 and 57 above). The national courts equally established that the applicant, being the biological father of the twins, had not shown interest in their development and their health during the period in which they had been living apart from him (see paragraph 38 above). Furthermore, according to the \u0160iauliai Regional Court, the applicant was not sufficiently supportive towards his children\u2019s health and special needs (see paragraph 47 above). The considerations in favour of keeping the twins with I.N. thus appear to have been sufficiently sound and weighty (see paragraph 73 above). On this last point, the Court also reiterates that a parent cannot be entitled under Article\u00a08 of the Convention to have such measures taken as would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see Johansen v. Norway, cited above, \u00a7 78; also see Olsson v.\u00a0Sweden (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 90). Accordingly, the Court finds that the Lithuanian courts may not be reproached for having neglected their duties under Article 8 of the Convention.",

It notes that the applicant was present during the hearing when the matter of the twins\u2019 custody was discussed at the Service (see paragraph 10 above). Afterwards, alone or assisted by his lawyer, he had the opportunity to submit evidence, and present his arguments and comment on the submissions of the other party before the courts, both in writing and orally, and he also had the right to appeal (see paragraphs 13, 22, 24, 32, 34, 4044,\u00a051 above). He was also able to put questions to court-appointed experts (see paragraph 33 above), who, as he wished, were from Vilnius where the examination was conducted \u2013 thus guaranteeing their impartiality (see paragraphs 24 and 33 above). That being so, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant was thus placed in a position enabling him to put forward all arguments in favour of his being granted custody of the twins and he also had access to all relevant information which was relied on by the courts. The applicant has not argued that there were omissions which could have prevented the domestic courts from fully establishing the facts. In addition, the children themselves were heard by the judges (see paragraphs\u00a032,\u00a035,\u00a037, 51 and 56 above, and, in contrast, Kutzner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077). Furthermore, as an example of the courts\u2019 ability to react to a changing situation and be proactive in their facilitation role, the Court draws attention to the \u0160iauliai Regional Court\u2019s decision of 20\u00a0November 2012, when, on the basis of the most recent medical evidence to the effect that the twin\u2019s emotional and psychological states and behaviour had become worse, it decided not to allow the applicant to take the twins for overnight visits, because that no longer corresponded to the children\u2019s best interests (see paragraphs 56 and 57 above). Similarly, the domestic courts\u2019 understanding that the urgency principle should be applied in child custody cases, this being in line with the Guidelines on Child Friendly Justice, is perfectly well illustrated by the \u0160iauliai Regional Court\u2019s decision of 21 April 2009 not to suspend the proceedings and the \u0160iauliai City District Court\u2019s decision 28\u00a0February 2012 to promptly set a date for a hearing (see paragraphs 23, 50 and 73 above). In these circumstances, and bearing in mind that as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them (see Sahin and Sommerfeld, cited above, \u00a7 73 and \u00a7 71 respectively), the Court is satisfied that the procedural requirements implicit in Article 8 of the Convention were complied with and that the applicant was involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide him with the requisite protection of his interests.",

                                            },

                                                "content": "105.\u00a0\u00a0In sum, as the Court finds on the facts before it, the hindrance to the applicant\u2019s exercise of his paternal rights, that is to say his inability to have the guardianship of the twins revoked and to have them returned to live with him, may not be attributed to the State authorities\u2019 failure to act with sufficient diligence or, even less so, to the neglect of the State\u2019s positive obligations pertaining to the return of the children to their father. At this juncture the Court takes cognisance of the assessment by the domestic courts and other authorities that I.N. cannot be reproached for having neglected her duties as a guardian (see paragraphs 17, 28 and 38 above), even though she is not able to fully overcome her uncooperative attitude (see paragraphs 53 and 57 above) towards the applicant so that the children could be emotionally prepared for their return to him (see paragraphs\u00a025,\u00a029,\u00a045, 46, 53 and 57 above). For the Court, when two\u00a0persons have lost affection for each other (which, according to the applicant\u2019s description of events, has happened in this case: see paragraphs\u00a09 and 82 above), it cannot realistically be expected from the State to make one of these persons adopt a positive attitude towards the other. Certainly, if the children become hostage of the situation (see paragraph 45 above) and after judgments in highly conflictual proceedings, guidance and support should be offered to children and their families by specialised services (see paragraph 73 in fine). At the date of the Government\u2019s last communication with the Court on this issue, this responsibility on the part of the State authorities appears to have been fulfilled (see paragraphs 60\u201367 above). The mere fact that the children are not yet emotionally prepared to move in with their father is insufficient to conclude that the State has neglected its positive obligations pertaining to the return of the children to the applicant (see paragraph 99 above). Finally, the Court observes that the Lithuanian courts never concluded that the applicant was permanently barred from living with the twins. On the contrary, they consistently emphasised that, should the relationship between the applicant and the twins improve and the children be ready to move in with him, the applicant could exercise his right to live with his children unhindered (see paragraphs 36, 39 and 57 above).",
