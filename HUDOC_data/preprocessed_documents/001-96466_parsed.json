They argued that the overall length of the court proceedings was mainly attributable to the complexity of the case and to the conduct of the applicant and her representative. According to the Government, the proceedings had been complex due to the large number of participants, that is to say four plaintiffs, two defendants and one third party, and the need to conduct two expert examinations. They further asserted that, though the applicant's efforts to ensure the best representation of her interests were understandable, the manner in which she had exercised her procedural rights had undoubtedly contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings. The Government also imputed to the applicant a failure to enquire promptly about developments in the proceedings. In particular, the request by the applicant's representative asking the District Court to set aside their decision of 3 October 2000 to discontinue the proceedings was only submitted on 9 July 2001. Then, only on 19 January 2004 did the applicant's representative request that the proceedings discontinued by the District Court's decision of 20 December 2002 be resumed.",

The Court cannot accept the Government's further argument that the applicant and her representative did not enquire duly about the progress of the proceedings. The Court notes that the national law explicitly provides for an obligation on the part of the domestic courts to inform the parties, in a proper manner, of the dates of hearings (see \u00a7 24 above). In the present case, the District Court twice discontinued the proceedings on the ground of the applicant's repeated failure to appear in court, although this was, in fact, owing to its own failure to notify her of the scheduled hearings (see \u00a7 12 and \u00a7 17 above). In such circumstances, the time that elapsed while she waited in vain for the court summons and the time that elapsed before the discontinued proceedings were resumed cannot be imputable to the applicant.",

With regard to the national authorities' conduct, the Court reiterates that it is incumbent on the respondent State to organise its legal system in such a way as to enable its courts to comply with the requirements of \nArticle 6 \u00a7 1 (see, S\u00fcrmeli, cited above, \u00a7 129). Referring to the above findings, the Court concludes that on several occasions the District Court failed to properly inform the applicant and her representative of the scheduled hearings and that the result was an aggregate delay of at least two years. The Court further notes that the examination of the case was substantially prolonged in consequence of the defendants' failure to attend a number of hearings. It is not critical to establish whether that was caused by their own fault or by the negligent notification by the District Court. The Court is of the opinion that, in any event, the delay is to be imputable to the respondent State, as the domestic authorities either failed to ensure that the participants were duly notified or to take the appropriate procedural measures that are available under the national law.",
