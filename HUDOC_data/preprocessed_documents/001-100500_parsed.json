In addition, the Government submitted that: (a) the value of 37,000 EUR was established arbitrarily, (b) the sum of EUR 9,900 was specified by the applicant in the re-trial only after the main hearing, which is not allowed by the Civil Proceedings Act 1977, and (c) the sum of EUR 11,637 was specified also arbitrarily by the defendant's representative when seeking his expenses and not by the applicant. That being so, the Government concluded that the Supreme Court could not have been bound by any of the above indicated values and therefore there was no violation of the applicant's right.",

When this value is set at an unrealistic level, either too low or too high, the first-instance court shall check the accuracy thereof (see paragraph 17 above). However, the Court considers that, even though the domestic courts have no obligation in that respect, there is no provision in the Civil Proceedings Act that would prohibit the courts from establishing the value when the plaintiff has failed to indicate it in the statement of claim. In the present case the domestic courts established the value of the claim in both the first and second remittal, taking into account the expert's findings as well as the value specified by the parties themselves. Although these values differed, the Court does not consider it necessary to determine which of the two was more accurate as both of them allowed for the appeal on points of law in accordance with Article 382 \u00a7 3 of the Civil Proceedings Act 1977 (see paragraph 19 above). In any event, the applicant should not suffer any detriment on account of the courts' failure to order the applicant to pay the difference between the court fees that had been paid and the fees that corresponded to the established values of the claim. Therefore, the Court finds that there has been a breach of the applicant's right of access to the Supreme Court.",
