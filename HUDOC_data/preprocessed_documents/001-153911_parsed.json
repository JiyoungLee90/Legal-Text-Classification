Furthermore, some mayors in the suburbs of Paris were concerned about possible perverse effects of the DALO Act on the social mix in their municipalities. Municipalities which did not comply with the Solidarity and Urban Renewal Act did not come under pressure from the prefecture to accommodate persons qualifying under the DALO Act, whereas other municipalities like Argenteuil, Drancy and Sarcelles were obliged by the State to accommodate some of the poorest families. The Monitoring Committee recognised that some prefects were encountering difficulties in ensuring a social mix. However, in the Committee\u2019s view, the fault lay not with the DALO Act but with the unequal distribution of social housing in the \u00cele-de-France region.",

This mechanism enabled the courts, as a first step, to accompany the order with a coercive fine and, as a second step, to assess the amount due, as the Administrative Court had done in the present case. Following an application for enforcement of the judgment of 28 December 2010 the Administrative Court, noting on 31 January 2012 that the applicant had still not been rehoused, had assessed the interim amount of the fine to be paid for the period from 1 February 2011 to 31 January 2012 and had accordingly ordered the State to pay the sum of EUR 8,400 into the urban development fund for the \u00cele-de-France region.",

They pointed to the coercive nature of the fine and the fact that the fine imposed on the prefect of \u00cele-de-France had continued to apply even after the judgment of 31 January 2012 assessing the interim amount due for a one-year period. Furthermore, under Article R. 778-8 of the Administrative Courts Code as it resulted from Article 31 of Decree No.\u00a02010-164 of 22 February 2010, the judge who had imposed the fine could, at any time and on his own initiative, request the administrative authorities to demonstrate that the judgment of 28 December 2010 had actually been enforced, and could assess a further interim amount to be paid. The Government also argued that the amount of the fine imposed, which had been calculated by the judge on the basis of the average rent for the type of property deemed by the mediation commission to be suited to the applicant\u2019s needs, had been wholly proportionate and consistent with the aim of enforcing the judgment ordering the applicant, her daughter and brother to be rehoused in the Paris area. Lastly, the Government submitted that the fact that the judgment required the fine to be paid into the urban development fund for the \u00cele-de-France region did not mean that the measure in question was not adequate and sufficient. The urban development fund, governed by Articles R. 302-20 to R. 302-24 of the Code, was designed to assist those municipalities that were eligible, and their public inter-municipal cooperation agencies, in funding their land and property-related activities in the sphere of social housing. Since the entry into force of the new legislation on 29 July 2011, the funding of the appropriate social support and rental management measures in respect of households that had been recognised as priority cases had been taken over by the national housing support fund (FNAVDL), which was financed from the fines paid by the State under the DALO Act. In 2012 the \u00cele-de-France region had accounted for over half of applications to the administrative courts under the DALO Act, and payment of EUR 26.9 million had been ordered in respect of the fines imposed that year throughout the country. Using the revenue from payment of those fines, the FNAVDL allocated funds to the regions each year in order to manage rentals in an appropriate manner for households recognised as priority cases, and thus house those families more effectively. Hence, the aim of the mechanism put in place was to overcome the shortage of social housing and ensure full and effective enforcement of the decisions instructing the prefect to house or rehouse households identified by the mediation commission for the d\u00e9partement as priority cases. Accordingly, it made no difference to whom the fine was payable: the fact that it was not paid to the individual concerned was irrelevant, provided that the cost to the State meant that the latter had an interest in seeing the judicial decision enforced rather than the opposite. The Government referred in that regard to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat\u2019s opinion of 2 July 2010 (see paragraph 21 above).",

Firstly, after noting that the mediation commission had recognised that the applicant should have priority for urgent rehousing, it had instructed the prefect of Paris to take action accordingly, and secondly, it had accompanied that order with a fine. Following the imposition of the fine the judgment had been enforced. In any event, a fine of this nature could not constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as it was simply an option available to the judge and could not therefore give rise to any legitimate expectation. Such fines, when imposed, were coercive rather than compensatory in nature and the person concerned could not claim to be the recipient and hence the beneficiary. With regard to the second aspect of the judgment, the Government acknowledged that in establishing an enforceable right to housing, the legislature had put in place a sufficient basis in domestic law giving rise, on the part of the persons who were eligible, to a legitimate expectation of obtaining housing. Nevertheless, while persons who had secured a positive decision from the mediation commission could be considered to have a legal basis giving rise to a legitimate expectation, they could not be considered to have a claim against the State and thus a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The enforceable right to housing was not a property right in so far as it was not an asset that could be recovered by the person concerned. The right to be offered housing did not equate to a right to have rent or accommodation costs met by the State. As the applicant\u2019s right did not constitute an asset, she could not claim the benefit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-I, and Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999-II).",

Finland (dec.), no. 30517/96, 15 March 2001), and that a right to live in a particular property of which one is not the owner does not as such constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see H.F. v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 54797/00, 9 December 2003; Kovalenok v. Latvia (dec.), no. 54264/00, 15 February 2001; and J.L.S. v. Spain (dec.), no. 41917/98, ECHR 1999-V). However, assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he or she has at least a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right, may also fall within the notion of \u201cpossessions\u201d contained in Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 (see Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.\u00a0Ireland, 29\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 222; Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v.

In particular, the Court has consistently held that a \u201cclaim\u201d \u2013 even one concerning the receipt of a specific welfare benefit \u2013 can constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 if it is sufficiently established to be enforceable (see Burdov v. Russia, no.\u00a059498/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002III, and Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 59, Series A no.\u00a0301B). Hence, the Court has found that, where, under the terms of a final and enforceable judgment, a person has been allocated housing which he or she has the right to possess and make use of and, subject to certain conditions, to purchase, he or she can be said to have a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 (see, among other authorities, Teteriny v. Russia, no.\u00a011931/03, 30 June 2005; Olaru and Others v.\u00a0Moldova, nos. 476/07 and 3\u00a0others, 28 July 2009; and Ilyushkin and Others v.

Under the resulting social housing tenancy, the applicant would have had the right to make use of a flat. She could also, subject to certain conditions, have purchased it.
