It should be underlined that there is increased traffic on that street, particularly during the morning (and in the evenings), which impacts on traffic on Krakowska street. Nadrzeczna Street is used by public transport minibuses and by the school bus. Therefore organising a demonstration on that street between 7 and 10\u00a0a.m. would block the entire length of the street and also limit or even make impossible any journey by car to Krakowska street and in the farther direction of Grojec. In the event of a traffic accident, the intervention of the police, the fire service or the ambulance service would be difficult, if not impossible. Similarly, access to a doctor by the residents of W\u00f3lka Kosowska during the demonstration might be totally impossible. The same applies for any intervention by the fire service or the police.

The board of directors further referred to leaflets distributed by the applicant association, also without their permission, calling for a demonstration and blockage of the premises.

Moreover, it was excessive to conclude that the demonstration would prevent residents from seeking medical help and emergency services from gaining access to residents in an emergency. The applicant association emphasised that the Assemblies Act invoked by the mayor provided for the banning of a demonstration only in extreme circumstances; the authority had failed to show that they existed in the instant case.

Moreover, there were about 400 registered businesses in the village, most of which were located in the zone affected by the planned demonstration.

The Court notes that in its second notice of the demonstration planned for 29 May 2008 the applicant association indicated the existence of alternative roads as solutions to the traffic congestion, assured the mayor that the emergency services would be able to pass, and limited the demonstration to a small part of the road. Moreover, it proposed a shorter duration for the planned demonstration in order to accommodate the concerns of the mayor relating to alleged traffic hazards (see paragraph\u00a014 above). Nevertheless, in her decision of 21 May 2008 banning the second proposed demonstration, the mayor did not give any consideration to those elements and repeated her previous arguments (see paragraph 15 above).",

The demonstration planned for 2\u00a0October 2008 took place because the Mazowiecki Governor promptly overruled the mayor\u2019s decision banning it (see paragraph 21 above). It should be emphasised that the details relating to the planned demonstrations \u2013 their purpose and location \u2013 were the same as for the demonstrations planned for May 2008, which are the subject matter of the instant case. Moreover, all three decisions of the mayor banning the demonstrations planned by the applicant association were based on similar arguments. The main difference was that on this occasion the applicant association informed the mayor of the planned demonstration thirty days in advance \u2013 as early as possible in accordance with the law (see Stowarzyszenie Pozna\u0144ska Masa Krytyczna v.\u00a0Poland, decision cited above, \u00a7\u00a037). Moreover, the Mazowiecki Governor decided on the applicant association\u2019s appeal promptly, before the date on which the demonstration was to take place. The Court subscribes to the reasons and conclusion reached on 18\u00a0September 2008 by the governor, who emphasised the importance of the right of freedom of peaceful assembly and pointed out that any limitations must be construed strictly and must be based on facts and not assumptions (see paragraph 21 above). The Court considers that the facts that the governor quashed the mayor\u2019s ban and that the demonstration planned for 2 October 2008 took place and caused no disturbance, not only do not deprive the applicant association of its victim status but strengthen its argument that the banning on the demonstrations planned in May 2008 should have been reviewed promptly by the governor.",
