The CPT has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when, as is frequently the case, the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions ... Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ...

In that connection, it notes that the applicants\u2019 allegations about the overcrowding of prison vans and court cells have not been sufficiently substantiated. In fact, nothing in the case file or the documents submitted by the parties confirms them either in whole or in part. The applicants neither raised their grievances in this respect before any of the competent domestic authorities, including the prison administration, so as to able to furnish the Court with their answers in this respect (ibid.), nor submitted statements or the names of their fellow inmates who could confirm their allegations (compare Starokadomskiy v. , no. 42239/02, \u00a7\u00a056, 31 July 2008, and Vlasov v. , no. 78146/01, \u00a7 67, 12 June 2008). Thus, the crucial evidence which could have supported their claims is missing. Furthermore, the Court has no reason to doubt the Government\u2019s intentions in so far as they did not furnish it with data concerning the number of detainees transported with the applicants during the relevant period of time. The archived documents containing that information were destroyed due to the expiry of the storage time-limits on 11 August 2005, that is, a few months before 4 November 2005, which is the date on which the case was communicated to the respondent Government. Thus, the Court does not find it necessary to draw any negative inferences from their conduct. It should also be noted that the Government and the relevant prison authority consistently denied all of the applicants\u2019 factual allegations in this respect and seem to have provided the Court with all information that remained available, such as pictures of the inside and outside of prison vans, dimensions of the court cells, dates of journeys and statements of participating officials (see paragraphs 57-60).",
