He said that he had seen the applicant in December 2007 and also in May 2008 and that no serious necrosis had been observed at that time. He further explained that at that stage of the disease the treatment usually prescribed was either palliative or surgical. The applicant was being given palliative treatment with medicines (antioxidants, protective drugs, sedatives). An operation was not recommended because it might make his condition worse. The likelihood of the scar healing was nil. The doctor was gradually removing the necrosed tissue in the right foot. The doctor also confirmed that the applicant\u2019s illness was chronic, progressive and that he needed constant medical treatment. He added that he could not be cured at the prison hospital but that there was a clinic outside the prison that could treat this kind of patient. In answer to a question from the judge, the doctor said that the applicant had been hospitalised twice after his operation and that at the relevant time the necrosis had not reached such an advanced stage. At that time the prison hospital doctors had done all they could to halt the development of the necrosis but without much success.

The applicant in his application form did not complain as such about the inadequacy of the treatment administered to him in prison prior to October 2007. Nor did he allege that he had developed the various medical conditions in prison. The focus of his application was rather the fact that his detention in prison in the absence of adequate medical treatment for the gangrene which he allegedly developed after October 2007 was detrimental to his health. The Court will thus assess the adequacy of the treatment available to the applicant in prison in the period between October 2007 and September 2008.",

The Court, however, does not find it necessary to establish the exact triggering moment of the alleged condition of the applicant for the following reason: in the course of the domestic proceedings both of the doctors treating him confirmed that in December 2007 the applicant had already manifested the first signs of deterioration in his right big toe (see paragraphs 25-26 above). The Court notes that according to the prison hospital doctor \u201cno serious necrosis\u201d had been observed at that time (see paragraph 25 above), while the specialist doctor concluded that \u201cthe gangrene had already affected the big toe of the right foot\u201d (see paragraph 26 above). The Court considers appropriate to attach particular weight to the opinion of a specialist. In any event, it is obvious that already in December 2007 the relevant authorities were aware of the applicant\u2019s possible diagnosis and were under an obligation to subject him to the appropriate medical tests in order to decide on a treatment plan for him (see Yefimova v. Russia, no. 39786/09, \u00a7 236, 19\u00a0February 2013). But the authorities were slow to act, as it was only on 25\u00a0January 2008 that the applicant was transferred to the prison hospital with increasing pain in his toe. This delay of more than a month constituted, in the Court\u2019s view, a serious failure, given that gangrene is a medical condition that is potentially lifethreatening and requires immediate treatment (see paragraphs 21, 24 and 26 above).",

However, the pain persisted, as can be seen from the material in the case file (see paragraph 9 above). On 25 February 2008 the applicant was seen by a specialist, who recommended that he undergo a dopplerography and a Tc PO2 test (see paragraph 9 above). Already at this point the specialist noted that depending on the results of the examination the option of amputating the toe on the right foot of the applicant should be considered. One month later, on 27 March 2008, a prison hospital doctor, without following the specialist advice \u2013 that is to say without arranging for the appropriate examinations of the applicant \u2013 simply concluded that there were no \u201cabsolute indications\u201d that he should undergo surgery (see paragraph 10 above). The applicant was thus discharged from the prison hospital in a so-called \u201cimproved condition\u201d, without any medical evidence for that conclusion.",

While that doctor could not assess the quality of the treatment provided to the applicant in the prison hospital, he emphasised that the applicant was in need of specialist treatment, including the amputation of his toe.

In the nine-month period preceding the applicant\u2019s release from prison, they failed to have his condition diagnosed promptly (see paragraph 43 above). Subsequently, they did not follow the specialist\u2019s recommendations, left the applicant without the required examinations and discharged him from the prison hospital (see paragraph 44 above). As for the following period of a little over two months, in the absence of any evidence, the Court is not prepared to accept that the applicant was being provided with regular medical supervision and treatment (see paragraph 45 above). This apparent failure on the part of the authorities is particularly regretful given that at that stage in the progression of the applicant\u2019s disease there were already consistent signs of a real threat to his leg and life. The combination of the above-mentioned delays and omissions in the medical treatment that the applicant received in prison leads the Court to the finding that there was a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the inadequate medical treatment rendered in prison for the applicant\u2019s gangrene.",
