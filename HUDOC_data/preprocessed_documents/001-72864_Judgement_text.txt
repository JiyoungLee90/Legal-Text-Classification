The case originated in an application (no. 77955/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mrs Emilia Campagnano (“the applicant”), on 6 September 2001.
The applicant was represented before the Court by Mr G. Beatrice, a lawyer practising in . The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I.M. Braguglia, their coAgent, Mr F. Crisafulli, and their deputy co-Agent, Mr N. Lettieri.
The applicant alleged a violation of Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
By a decision of 13 May 2004, the Chamber declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints under Article 8 of the Convention, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, Article 13 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Amorosi ().
In a judgment deposited with the court's registry on 30 June 1997, the Benevento District Court made a winding-up order in respect of the applicant's company, a beverage company, and also declared the applicant personally bankrupt.
On 15 October 1997 the trustee in bankruptcy filed a report.
On 9 April 1998 the bankruptcy judge (“the judge”) checked the statement of liabilities of the bankrupt estate and on 7 June 1999 declared it judicially established (esecutivo).
On 1, 5 and 9 July 1999 respectively the companies C.D.O., C.C.C. and F.C. instituted proceedings contesting the statement of liabilities.
At a hearing held on 14 April 2000, the judge ordered the striking out of the action brought by the company F.C. as being out of time.
On 18 December 2000 the trustee in bankruptcy requested the creditors' committee to give its opinion on the possible sale of two lorries in very poor condition which were listed in the statement of assets.
On 8 January 2001 the trustee in bankruptcy requested the judge to declare the lorries unfit for sale (illiquidabili) so that the proceedings could be terminated.
On 5 February 2001 the trustee in bankruptcy filed the revenue and expenditure account, which the judge approved on 12 March 2001.
By a decision deposited with the registry on 20 March 2001, the judge terminated the bankruptcy proceedings for lack of any further assets to distribute.
The decision was posted in the District Court on 23 March 2001. It became final on 7 April 2001.

According to legal commentators, the institution of bankruptcy has its origins in the Middle Ages (thirteenth century), an era when merchants (in the broad sense, encompassing traders, entrepreneurs and bankers) formed the nucleus of a new social class. In this context, in which the public interest coincided at times with the interests of the merchant class, bankruptcy was designed to impose stringent measures on insolvent merchants. Hence, bankruptcy was subject to criminal penalties (such as banishment, arrest and, in some cases, torture or death) or civil penalties such as the entry of the bankrupt's name in a register, forcing bankrupts to wear distinguishing marks (such as a green beret), loss of citizenship, and other restrictions (see A. Jorio, La crisi d'impresa, il fallimento, Guiffré, 2000, p. 364; S. Bonfatti and P.F. Censoni, Manuale di diritto fallimentare, Cedam, 2004, pp. 1-2 and 72-73; and L. Guglielmucci, Lezioni di diritto fallimentare, G. Giappichelli, Turin, 2004, p. 122).
