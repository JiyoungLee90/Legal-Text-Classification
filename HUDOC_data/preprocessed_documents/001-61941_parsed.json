Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of facts for that of the domestic courts and as a general rule it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them. Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic authorities, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Klaas v. Germany, judgment of 22\u00a0September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 18, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30). Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, \u00a7 32, and Av\u015far v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 283, ECHR 2001VII) even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place.",

Moreover, in view of the different burden of proof in criminal proceedings as well as the different standards applied in assessing criminal responsibility, the fact that such proceedings resulted in the acquittal of the police officers can in no sense be regarded as decisive of the issue which arises under the Convention, namely whether the use of force has been shown to be absolutely necessary.

In the report of the examination carried out by the Criminal Police Laboratory of Istanbul on 14 May 1996, it is stated that of the seventeen empty 9 mm cartridges submitted for examination from the scene of the incident, seven of the bullets had been fired from the Browning gun and ten from the weapons used by the police officers (judgment, \u00a7 25). However, in response to the applicant\u2019s complaint that the empty cartridges kept in the Ey\u00fcp Security Directorate were not the same as those mentioned in the ballistics report, the  in April 1999 ordered that the cartridges be produced. The cartridges were not in fact produced until July 2000, some fifteen months later, the Security Directorate having claimed in September 1999 that the cartridges had been lost during renovations in the police station. On the order of the , a further ballistic examination of the three weapons belonging to the accused police officers was conducted on 7\u00a0August 2000 by the same Criminal Police Laboratory. In its report of 23 October 2000 the Laboratory concluded that only four of the seventeen empty cartridges matched one of the weapons. Of the remaining cartridges, six came from a different weapon and seven from yet another weapon, neither of which weapons had been submitted for ballistic examination (judgment, \u00a7 75). This apparent inconsistency does not appear to have been commented on in the \u2019s judgment. ",

We opened fire at him, we captured the wounded person... we shot the man.\u201d). In the same communication it is also far from clear that the police officers were responding to the opening of fire on them. As is noted in the judgment of the , the police headquarters reported that the TEM team had captured a person \u201cin a mixed 502 situation\u201d, that is in a situation of armed conflict with the police. The  explained this by saying that it was only in the heat of the\nmoment that the police officers had informed the headquarters that such a situation of conflict had occurred.

When for the first time in February\u00a02000 the Assize Court requested information about the identity and addresses of the three individuals, the Security Directorate reported that two of the individuals who were \u201cterrorists\u201d had been killed in an operation conducted on 20 August 1996 in Ey\u00fcp (judgment, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-72).",

There is nothing to suggest that any attempt was at any stage made by the authorities to trace and interview other eye-witnesses of the incident. A.B. gave evidence which contradicted the account of the accused police officers that \u0130rfan had opened fire on them. The Assize Court\u2019s conclusion that she had not in fact witnessed the incident and that her evidence was not sincere was based primarily on the fact that in her statement before the court she had placed the incident some two hours before it had in fact occurred and on the fact that she saw only one bullet wound in \u0130rfan\u2019s body and thus appeared to have assumed that the other bullet found to have struck \u0130rfan must have been fired in the car \u2013 a fact which was disproved by the autopsy report. While accepting that the  was better placed to assess AB\u2019s credibility, I do not find either of the grounds relied on by that court as affording convincing reasons for rejecting her evidence in its entirety. In this regard I note that in her statement to the applicant\u2019s representative made a few months after the event, A.B. had given the time of the incident as \u201caround 7 p.m.\u201d when \u201cit was starting to get dark\u201d, an estimate which was closer to the actual time than that made nearly a year later. I also note that it appears that A.B. was not the only person who initially thought that \u0130rfan had been struck by a single bullet: in his evidence to the Assize Court, A.Y., one of the accused police officers, stated that \u0130rfan had told him that he had been shot in the left arm and that \u201cit did not seem to be a serious wound\u201d.",

But this to my mind is to apply the wrong test and to reverse the burden of proof. As noted above, the test to be applied is not whether there is a sufficient evidence to satisfy the Court that the use of force was more than absolutely necessary; rather, it is whether the evidence is such as to satisfy the Court that the use of force was no more than absolutely necessary in self-defence. On the basis of the material before the Court, I am not so satisfied and consequently do not find that the killing of \u0130rfan was justified in terms of Article 2 of the Convention.",
