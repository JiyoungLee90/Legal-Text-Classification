No evidence was taken or examined. The judge simply prepared the above decision, solely on the basis of the materials prepared by the police, and only in the end broke the silence to threaten the applicant with imminent detention if she did not refrain from further participation in demonstrations.",

On 7 April 2003 the applicant was brought to the police station at 7.30 p.m., while the court hearing took place at about 9.30 p.m. On 9 April 2003 the respective hours were 2.30 p.m. and 5 p.m. During both periods she failed to avail herself of her procedural rights, despite all the efforts of the police officers. The applicant was familiarised with the materials of the cases against her and informed about her right to lodge motions and challenges, which she failed to do. On both occasions the applicant signed the record of an administrative offence voluntarily and, by doing so, she agreed with its content and in essence admitted her guilt. Taking into account that the applicant signed the records, refused to have a lawyer, did not lodge any motions and did not avail herself of other procedural rights, the police officers considered these periods to be sufficient for the preparation of the applicant\u2019s defence. Furthermore, the applicant had the right to request an adjournment of the examination of her cases, which she also failed to do. By failing to request such an adjournment, the applicant admitted that she had had ample time to prepare her defence. Finally, by immediately presenting the cases to the court, the police officers ensured that the trials took place within a reasonable time.",

The police as a rule were looking for their \u201cvictims\u201d not at a demonstration but at a later hour and at a different location. Often the public and close relatives became aware of the conviction only after the court decision had been taken and the convicted person had already been placed in the detention facility. The accused were normally not ill-treated at police stations but were, nevertheless, subjected to various methods of psychological pressure aimed at forcing them to sign documents containing false accusations. In order to conceal the fact that these cases were fabricated, the authorities were not allowing lawyers to participate and were holding hearings at late hours, thus effectively excluding the possibility for them to be public.",

The Court therefore does not see any reasons to reach a different finding in the present case and concludes that in the proceedings of both 7\u00a0and 9 April 2003 the applicant did not have a fair hearing, in particular on account of not being afforded adequate time and facilities for the preparation of her defence.",

Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicant was convicted under the same Article of the CAO as on 7\u00a0April 2003. Therefore the interference was prescribed by law (see paragraph 82 above). The Court further considers that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of \u201cthe prevention of disorder\u201d and \u201cthe protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d.",

It follows that the imposition of a sanction for committing such acts, including violence and obscenities, may be a justified interference. In assessing whether a particular interference was justified, the Court must ascertain that it was prompted by a pressing social need and that the reasons given by the national authorities were relevant and sufficient.",

It is, however, mindful of the striking paucity of the findings of fact made by the domestic court in penalising the applicant. These virtually amounted to the following phrase: \u201c[the applicant], swearing loudly and hitting passers-by, obstructed street traffic and violated public order\u201d. No further details of these allegations were provided, such as the actual obscenities involved, who they were addressed at and in which circumstances, the manner in which the applicant had allegedly used any violence and whether anybody had been injured. No evidence was taken from any victims or witnesses, other than the arresting police officers, and these findings were made following a trial which lasted not more than five minutes. The Court further notes that the materials of the applicant\u2019s administrative case contain no further factual details either. The charge against her simply stated that she had \u201cmade a loud noise with a group of people, and randomly insulted and hit passers-by\u201d and even the police report did not provide any substantial details of the applicant\u2019s allegedly reprehensible behaviour. In spite of this, these materials were relied upon by the domestic court when convicting the applicant, while her submissions made in court in her defence did not find any reflection in the court\u2019s findings. In view of the above, the Court concludes that the domestic court failed to make a thorough and objective assessment of the circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s behaviour at the demonstration of 9 April 2003, including the alleged commission by her of any violent and offensive acts.",

The Court notes that in imposing this penalty the domestic court took into account as an aggravating factor the applicant\u2019s repetition of behaviour at the earlier demonstration of 7 April 2003 which it interpreted as \u201canti-social\u201d. However, there is nothing to indicate that the applicant\u2019s behaviour had involved anything reprehensible within the meaning of Article 11 (see paragraph 93 above).",
