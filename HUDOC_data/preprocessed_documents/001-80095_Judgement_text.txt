The case originated in an application (no. 43362/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Croatian nationals, Mr Nino Terzin-Laub and Mrs Rina Terzin-Laub (“the applicants”), on 15 October 2002.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Mihočević, a lawyer practising in . The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, first Mrs L. Lukina-Karajković and subsequently Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 29 January 2004 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicants were born in 1946 and 1953 respectively and live in Velika Gorica.
In the night between 12 and 13 April 1992 the applicants' house in Slavonski Brod was blown up by unknown perpetrators. Several months later the ruins of the house were set on fire, which resulted in its complete destruction.
On 11 November 1994 the applicants brought a civil action against the State in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) seeking damages. They relied on section 180 of the Civil Obligations Act.
On 3 February 1996 the Amendment to the Civil Obligations Act (“the 1996 Amendment”) entered into force. It provided that all proceedings concerning actions for damages resulting from terrorist acts or acts of violence were to be stayed pending the enactment of new legislation on the subject.
Pursuant to the 2003 Liability Act, the Municipal Court resumed the proceedings.
Meanwhile, on 6 and 19 June 2002, respectively, the applicants lodged constitutional complaints under section 63 of the Constitutional Court Act complaining about the length of the above civil proceedings and the lack of access to a court. On 17 September 2004 the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) gave a single decision accepting their complaints. Relying on the Court's case law (Kutić v. Croatia, no. 48778/99, ECHR 2002II), it found violations of the applicants' constitutional rights to a hearing within a reasonable time and of access to a court. It awarded them each 4,400 Croatian kunas (HRK) in compensation, and ordered the Zagreb Municipal Court to give a decision in the case in the shortest time possible but no later than a year following the publication of the decision in the Official Gazette. The 's decision was published on 30 September 2004.
On 1 July 2004 the Zagreb Municipal Court declared the applicant's action inadmissible finding that it no longer had jurisdiction in the matter. The applicants appealed and on 21 December 2004 the  (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case.
In the resumed proceedings, on 25 July 2005 the Municipal Court gave judgment dismissing the applicants' claim on the merits. The applicants again appealed and the proceedings are currently pending before the Zagreb County Court.
