Negotiations commenced between the parties as to renewal of the lease and a draft lease was drawn up on the basis of an increased ground rent, which the applicant states was agreed at GBP 14,000 per annum. The applicant signed his copy of the draft and meanwhile commenced discussions with various of his tenants concerning increases of rent under their subleases. In August 1991 however, West Dorset notified the applicant that it considered that the option could not be exercised. In the subsequent proceedings, it took three points: that the applicant was in breach of the repairing covenants in the 1969 lease; that the option was not capable of being exercised by the applicant because by granting five subleases for terms greater than the term of the 1969 lease he had assigned his interest in the units under sublease; and that the option was ultra vires Dorchester.",

It was not the option to renew itself but his contractual and property rights under the lease, namely his legal rights to part of the consideration for entering into the lease (which he lost) and the loss of value of his investment in his property (which he has partly lost) which together was his ability to enjoy his business assets as a whole, which were \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

No relevant domestic case-law on the scope of the relevant powers existed until 1991.

This was because the option never conferred rights on the applicant because it was a nullity. They argued that it is necessary and important to impose limits on the legal capacity of local authorities for the benefit of the public as a whole. As a result, they argued that, even if there was an interference or deprivation, it was compatible with Article 1. In their view, this case, which concerns the capacity to contract and not issues of planning permission, was to be distinguished from the case of Pine Valley (cited above), which in any event did not lay down any broad property right based on \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d.

The lease contained an option for renewal for a further 21 years. However, when the applicant gave notice to exercise the option, West Dorset (succeeding Dorchester as local authority) took the view that its predecessor had unknowingly acted ultra vires in granting the option, which was therefore invalid.

Neither party had been aware that there was any legal obstacle to this term forming part of the applicant\u2019s consideration for agreeing to the contract. The applicant proceeded to build on the land, pay ground rent to the local authority and enter into sub-leases with other persons who conducted business in the premises which he constructed. He clearly expected to be able to renew the option and continue to obtain the benefit of rent from the occupation of those premises which he had sub-let. He reached in negotiations with the local authority the stage of preparing a draft renewal lease with an agreed increased ground rent, already signed on his side and had proceeded to enter into agreements with his sub-lessees. The local authority, West Dorset, itself only raised the problem of invalidity at a very late stage (October 1995, according to the first instance judge). ",

In the present case, the local authority entered in a lease and was unaware that its powers to do so did not include the possibility of agreeing to an option for renewal of the lease. It nonetheless obtained the agreed rent for the lease and, on exercise of the renewal of the option, had the possibility of negotiating an increase in ground rent. There is no issue that the local authority acted against the public interest in the way in which it disposed of the property under its control or that any third party interests or the pursuit of any other statutory function would have been prejudiced by giving effect to the renewal option. The subsequent statutory amendments further illustrate that there was nothing per se objectionable or inappropriate in a local authority including such a term in lease agreements (see paragraph\u00a026).",

While the Government also referred to the doctrine of ultra vires being mitigated by the principles of unjust enrichment, it is not suggested that in this case the applicant had any possibility to obtain some kind of compensation for the application of the rule in his case. The applicant not only had the expectation of deriving future return from his investment in the lease but, as was noted in the Court of Appeal, the option to renew had been an important part of the lease for a person undertaking building obligations and who otherwise would have had a limited period in which to recoup his expenditure.

However, even if the applicant entertained a legitimate expectation of being able to exercise the option to renew which was attached to the original lease, this is not the same as a finding that he was deprived of the property right which would have been bestowed by a further 21 years lease. The position under domestic law was that the option was unenforceable and incapable of giving rise to that further lease. The Court would also note that the domestic system could arguably have reconciled the doctrine of incapacity with the individual interests at stake without necessarily enforcing the option in its original form, for example, by providing an alternative benefit or form of compensation or return of his consideration. Indeed, while there is no specific indication in the original lease agreement as to what the consideration was for the option to renew, it would appear to the Court that this may be regarded as the element which would most appropriately reflect the loss suffered by the applicant when he entered into the lease agreement containing an unenforceable option clause. It recalls that the applicant paid GBP 20,020 by way of rent for the lease and though he has not specified his expenses in building on the land, it has not been argued that the applicant was unable to recoup the cost through the rent collected from the sub-tenants during that period or unable to make a significant profit at the same time.",

It finds that the proceedings brought by the applicant against West Dorset to enforce the option may be regarded as incurred to prevent or redress the breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 complained of by the applicant. Noting that items included in the claimed costs do not relate directly to the litigation with West Dorset and that the legal aid disbursements were not made by the applicant, the Court, making an assessment on an equitable basis, awards the applicant EUR 25,000, plus any value-added tax that may be payable.",
