The Court recalls that under certain circumstances an application may indeed be struck out of its list of cases under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of a unilateral declaration by the respondent Government even if the applicant wishes the examination of the case to be continued (see Tahsin Acar v.  [GC], no.\u00a026307/95, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 2004III). The Court notes, however, that this procedure is an exceptional one and is not, as such, intended to circumvent the applicant\u2019s opposition to a friendly settlement. Furthermore, the Court observes that a distinction must be drawn between, on the one hand, declarations made in the context of strictly confidential friendly-settlement proceedings (Article 38 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 62 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court) and, on the other hand, unilateral declarations made by a respondent Government in public and adversarial proceedings before the Court (see Androsov v. , no. 63973/00, \u00a7 45, 6 October 2005). On the facts, the Court observes that the Government failed to submit with the Court any formal statement capable of falling into the latter category and offering a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention does not require the Court to continue its examination of the case (see, by contrast, Akman v. Turkey (striking out), no. 37453/97, \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 24, ECHR 2001-VI).",
