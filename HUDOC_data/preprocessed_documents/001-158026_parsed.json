In particular, on 9 December 1996 the prosecutor ordered the detailed questioning of the participants in the altercation, with a view to establishing their position, actions and observations during the incident. The prosecutor also instructed the investigating authorities to identify the owner of the knife discovered in the proximity of the victim\u2019s body and which knife had been apparently used by the victim to stab O.V.

It acquitted him and disallowed the applicants\u2019 civil claim, noting, in particular, that it had not been established that when he had attacked Angel Georgiev, O.V. had been in possession of the knife which had allegedly been seen earlier. It was also significant that the knife used to stab Angel Georgiev had never been found. In addition, none of the eyewitnesses to O.V.\u2019s struggle with Angel Georgiev had seen him stab the victim. As O.V. had himself been stabbed by Angel, the struggle between the two of them had been brief. O.V. had then left the scene and had been taken to hospital. It was thus possible that the applicants\u2019 son had been stabbed by someone else after O.V.\u2019s departure, or even before that, as the post-mortem and other medical reports showed that after having been fatally stabbed, Angel had still been capable of moving and participating in the fight. The victim\u2019s blood had also been discovered on K.S.\u2019s clothes, and it might have been discovered on the clothes of other participants in the fight, had they been seized and inspected during the initial investigation.

It pointed out that it had not been shown that during the struggle with Angel, O.V. had had a knife, as none of the eyewitnesses had seen him brandish, pick up or use one. If he had had a knife at that time, it was unclear what had happened to it after the stabbing. As to the blood on O.V.\u2019s clothes, it could be explained by the fact that B.G. had already hit Angel in the face with a wooden plank, which had provoked bleeding. One of the other participants in the fight could have stabbed the applicants\u2019 son. It was significant in that regard that when K.S. and his friends arrived at the scene, the fight was still going on. Lastly, the Court of Appeal noted that the prosecution had also faced difficulties in establishing who had stabbed the applicants\u2019 son, and had thus indicted two persons, O.V. and K.S., leaving to the courts the \u201cchoice\u201d as to which of the two was guilty.",

The Court of Appeal noted that the victim had apparently already been bleeding when he had exchanged blows with O.V., because B.G. had already hit him with a plank, which could explain why O.V.\u2019s clothes were smeared with the victim\u2019s blood. In addition, none of the witnesses had seen O.V. stab the victim and the knife used for the murder had never been found; moreover, B.G.\u2019s statement that he had seen O.V. holding a knife was not convincing, as it contradicted his other statements. It was thus possible that someone else had stabbed the applicants\u2019 son; no definite conclusion could be drawn in that regard, since during the preliminary investigation it had not been established whether anyone else had had a knife, the clothes of the other people involved in the fight had not been examined, and the investigating authorities had not carried out a more extensive search of the area where the fight had taken place in order to locate the knife which had caused the lethal wound. Lastly, it appeared that even at the stage of the preliminary investigation it had been difficult to establish who had dealt the fatal blow to Angel Georgiev; that is why the prosecution had indicted two persons, even though it had been clear that the young man had died as a result of a single stab in the back.",

Further, as noted subsequently by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 25 and 32 above) the investigating authorities failed to seize and inspect for traces of blood the clothes of all the participants in the events of 25-26 December 1993, failed to establish whether any of them had had a knife, and failed to carry out an extensive search for the knife used to kill the applicants\u2019 son.

While the Court will not discuss here the duration of the judicial proceedings, as the applicants\u2019 complaint in that regard has been examined separately and declared inadmissible (see Mulini (dec.), cited above), it cannot but note at this stage that fourteen years after Angel Georgiev\u2019s murder the perpetrator of the crime had still not been discovered. Significant delays appear to have accumulated at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings, which lasted for more than five years, from 1993 to an unspecified date in 1999 (see paragraphs 13-20 above). Some delay was inevitable as the case was complex and numerous witnesses needed to be examined and further evidence collected; however, delays which cannot be considered justified were also caused by the numerous attempts of the investigator in charge of the case to have the proceedings stayed or the case referred to the prosecution with a proposal to indict K.S. and O.V., even though the investigation had not been duly completed (see paragraph 19 above). That state of affairs apparently led to the investigator dealing with the case being replaced by the prosecutor in 1996 (ibid.).",
