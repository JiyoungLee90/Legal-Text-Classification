Moreover, the proceedings instituted by the applicant for compensation were pending before the domestic authorities. Finally, the construction work had been completed before the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 27 June 2006 had become final on 11 January 2008. There had therefore been no fault on the part of the authorities under Article 526 of the CC.",

They also found in her favour as to the merits of the case; on 27 June 2006 the Court of Appeal confirmed the first-instance judgment ordering that the construction work on her property be terminated, the high-voltage line be removed and the site be restored to its previous state (see paragraph 11 above).
