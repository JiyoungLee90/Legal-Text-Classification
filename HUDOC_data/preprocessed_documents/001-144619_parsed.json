The Supreme Court found in 2002 that the City of Vilnius and the Region of Vilnius had taken decisions, in 1994 and 1995, that were unlawful under domestic law. As a result, the Supreme Court ordered that the plot of land be returned by the second applicant to the State, that the first applicant return to the second applicant the sum he had received from the latter (LTL 6,000), and that the State reimburse the first applicant for part (LTL 422) of the sum it had received from him (LTL 422, plus 423 \u201csingle-use investment vouchers\u201d). The first applicant was not compensated for the 423 vouchers he had transferred to the State. Nor was he compensated for the loss of the profit that he had made in 1997, when he managed to sell the land to the second applicant at a much higher price than that at which he himself had bought it from the State.",

I see no need to make a factual assessment of this nature.

In my opinion, it would have been sufficient simply to note that, because of the unlawful acts committed by the local and regional authorities (in 1994 and 1995), the first applicant had to return a sum of LTL 6,000 to the second applicant, while being reimbursed by the State only up to LTL 422. The compensation thus received for the consequences of mistakes committed by the public authorities was not in a reasonable relationship of proportionality with the loss suffered by the first applicant. Even if the applicant could legitimately be required to make a sacrifice \u201cin the public interest\u201d, the individual burden actually placed on him was, as the Court finds, excessive (see paragraph 75). The interference was therefore not proportionate to the aim pursued.",
