In so far as the domestic courts appear to have drawn adverse inferences from the fact that the applicant had not confessed, the Court considers that their reasoning showed a manifest disregard of the principle of the presumption of innocence and cannot, in any circumstances, be relied on as a legitimate ground for deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty (see G\u00f3rski v. Poland, no. 28904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4 October 2005; Leszczak v.\u00a0Poland, no. 36576/03, \u00a7 48, 7 March 2006). Secondly, the judicial authorities considered that there had been a risk that the applicant might interfere with the course of the proceedings by exerting pressure on witnesses. The Court observes that it was legitimate for the authorities to consider that factor as capable of justifying the applicant\u2019s detention at the initial stages of the proceedings. However, the Court considers that that ground gradually lost its force and relevance as the proceedings progressed and it cannot accept it as a justification for holding the applicant in custody for the entire period.",
