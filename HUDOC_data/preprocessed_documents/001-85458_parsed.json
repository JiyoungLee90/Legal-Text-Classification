The court held that the challenged provisions did not conflict with the Constitution, because such interference with the constitutional rights of unjustly convicted persons granted under Articles 30 (right to rehabilitation and compensation in criminal proceedings) and 33 (right to own and inherit property) of the Constitution was indispensable for the protection of the rights of other rightful claimants under the Denationalisation Act, who were similarly entitled to reparation for the wrongs perpetrated in the aftermath of the Second World War (a joined decision no.

The applicant could therefore only have availed himself of the legal remedies available before the 2006 Act became operational. The present application is thus similar to the cases of Belinger and Lukenda (see Belinger v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 42320/98, 2\u00a0October 2001, and Lukenda v. Slovenia, no. 23032/02, 6\u00a0October\u00a02005, see also Grzin\u010di\u010d v. Slovenia, no. 26867/02, judgment, 3 May 2007). In those cases the Court dismissed the Government\u2019s objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies because it found that the legal remedies at the applicant\u2019s disposal at that time were ineffective. The Court recalls its findings in the Lukenda judgment that the violation of the right to a trial within a reasonable time was a systemic problem resulting from inadequate legislation and inefficiency in the administration of justice.",

The court concluded that the property could therefore not be returned in natura and instead awarded compensation to the applicant. As follows from the court\u2019s decision, as well as from the decisions of other domestic courts upholding this decision, the applicant did not have a right under domestic legislation to the restitution of the property in natura.
