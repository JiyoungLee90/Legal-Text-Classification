At the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital, the duty paediatrician, Ms T.\u00d6., was annoyed that the transfer had been carried out without any prior checks that there was indeed a place available at the hospital. She paid no attention to the baby. She was busy with the administrative side of things and asked for documents proving that there were in fact no places in the other hospitals. She first called the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre, then the Giresun public hospital, to check. She told us that there were indeed places at the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre, but that the duty doctor had simply not wished to be disturbed. She advised us to request an official signed document stating that there were no places available in the hospital. She added that if the doctors at the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre were confronted with such a request, they would certainly change their attitude, find a place and agree to admit the child. When we went to the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre, doctor K.B. told us that there were no places available and that they could not take the child into their care. Instead of looking after the child, who needed urgent medical assistance, he preferred to spend time drawing up a document stating that there were no places in the hospital. 45 minutes were lost in this way. After numerous back-and-forth trips between hospitals, the child ended up having a heart attack. Treatment by the emergency doctor was not enough to save him. Nobody wanted to take charge of the child. No emergency doctor examined him. They all refused to admit him and tried at any cost to transfer him to another hospital. This indifference towards a child who required emergency medical killed him.\u201d",

That is what we did. Ms\u00a0T.\u00d6., without even examining the child, told us that there were no places in the hospital and that he should be transferred to the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre. We went there immediately. Doctor K.B. did not examine the child. He simply told us that there were no places in the hospital. We insisted for about half an hour that he take the child in for treatment. He refused. We then set off again for the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital. Doctor T.\u00d6. again refused to admit the child and insisted that he be transferred to the Giresun public hospital. The child\u2019s father and I protested strongly against this decision. Doctor T.\u00d6. then asked us to provide her with an official document stating that there were no places at the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre. As no one had thought to give us such a document, we were unable to give it to her. She then asked us to return once more to the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre. Faced with her categorical refusal, we set off once again for the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre. Once there, the doctors again refused to admit the child. The child died in the ambulance at about 3.30 a.m.\u201d",

The G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane public hospital did not contact us to find out whether or not there were free beds. The child was transferred directly to our hospital. I immediately addressed myself to his care. Other than the presence of meconium on his body, the child was fine. His vital functions were normal. I tested his oxygen saturation level, and it was between 95 and 100%. As there was a risk that the child would inhale meconium, I preferred to keep him [at the hospital] in order to ensure closer monitoring. However, I discovered that there were no beds in the department. The child\u2019s father told me that doctor K.M. had stated that there were places available in the hospital. I then called doctor K.M., who was in the adult emergency department. He told me that he had thought that there were still places in the neonatal unit, but that he had not thought it necessary to call and check. I then expressed my displeasure to him. The child\u2019s father, who was accompanied by a friend, protested strongly against my decision to refuse to admit [the child] for lack of a bed. But I had only followed the procedure. The head of department had expressly asked us not to accept patients if there were no places available and to organise for their immediate transfer. That is what I attempted to do. Someone from the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre told me on the telephone that there was one place available. After completing the administrative formalities, I ordered an ambulance journey. However, the ambulance came back to our hospital about two hours later, since the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre had refused to admit him. As there was no official document to that effect, I again transferred the patient to the same hospital. As it was impossible to take the child into our care, I did not go ahead with his administrative registration or open a treatment file.\u201d",

I did not want to take the child out of the incubator, since there is a risk of hypothermia with premature babies. I called doctor M.K. to ask for his advice, since the child needed to be put on a respirator, but there were no available places in the department. I called the other hospitals to try to find a place, but without success. I then told them to return to the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital. Around one hour later, they came back asking for an official document stating that there were no available places in our hospital. I did not give them a document of this sort, but I told them they could visit the department if they didn\u2019t believe me. While I was in the middle of explaining all this, I was suddenly informed that the child had had a heart attack. I immediately went into the ambulance to carry out resuscitation, but in spite of all my efforts I was unable to save the child. I do not think that I was negligent. If we had admitted the child, we would have had to care for him in an ordinary bed. We would have been unable to control his temperature and guarantee artificial ventilation in those conditions, which in fact would probably have caused an even quicker death.\u201d",

The Court finds it difficult to see how the applicant could reasonably have hoped to win her case before the civil or administrative courts, since in either of these proceedings she would have been required at least to prove the existence of a fault (see paragraphs 26, 27 and 46 above).

The authorities knew or ought to have known, that the life of the child was put at risk by the acts and omissions of the health care personnel involved. In the specific circumstances of the case, the acts and omissions go beyond mere error of judgment on the part of a health professional or negligent co-ordination among health professionals in the treatment of a particular patient (see, inter alia, Powell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 45305/99, ECHR 2000V, and Eugenia Laz\u0103r v. Romania, no. 32146/05, \u00a7 68, 16 February 2010). The Court should, in our view, have limited its finding of a violation of Article 2 of the Convention to this aspect alone.",

In general, Article 2 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as requiring a certain standard, level or quality of treatment and equipment in public hospitals. The capacity to provide treatment as well as the level of treatment and the quality of equipment is an area where States have to make difficult decisions taking into account a number of factors, including prioritisation of needs as well as the reality of limited financial resources.",

The applicants lodged a criminal complaint against individuals alleging that they were responsible for the death of their child. As a consequence, a criminal as well as an administrative investigation was performed. On the basis of the domestic investigation the Court has been able to assess the facts of the case finding a violation of the substantive limb of Article 2 of the Convention. In our view, there is not sufficient basis for finding that the investigation was incomplete and insufficient, as it did not assessed the functioning of relevant rules on reception of patients or coordination between hospitals or the reasons for shortage of equipment or number of incubators (see paragraphs 84-87). These elements fall outside the scope and the purpose of the domestic investigation.",
