On 4 July 1995 it decided to re-examine the application as regards the complaints concerning the monitoring of Mr Domenichini's private correspondence and the absence of any effective remedies in respect of that measure. On the same day it declared those complaints inadmissible. In its report of 6 September 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8), that the complaint relating to the rights of the defence raised no separate issue under Article 6 para. 3 (art. 6-3) and that there had been a breach of Article 13 (art. 13).

In removing such a sensitive area from the competence of the administrative authorities, the Italian legislature's purpose had been to provide the safeguards of independence and impartiality. The Commission's unduly formal approach to the subject of the effectiveness of the right guaranteed by Article 13 (art. 13), which did not require the \"national authority\" to belong to the judiciary, misunderstood the import of the Law in question. If that argument was not accepted, the censorship measure had to be classified as an \"administrative decision taken by\" the judge responsible for the execution of sentences \"in performance of duties inherent in the supervision of prisons\". By interpreting the case-law of the Court of Cassation, which ruled out any appeal on points of law or to a criminal judicial authority other than the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, the Government maintained that it was possible to have recourse to the regional administrative courts to challenge the measures in question.",

The allegedly judicial nature of the disputed decisions, stemming from the nature of the authority empowered to take them, does not stand up to scrutiny either. On 24 October 1988 the Turin Sentence Execution Court declared inadmissible an appeal by Mr Domenichini, who was challenging the decision taken by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences at Cuneo on 16 September 1988, on the ground that the relevant Italian Law did not provide any remedy in respect of such decisions in view of their administrative nature (see paragraph 12 above). The appeals on points of law lodged by the applicant on 9 November 1988 and by his counsel on 17 April 1989 were no more successful (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). As to the third submission, two points must be noted. Firstly, the Court of Cassation has held that Italian law does not provide any remedies in respect of decisions whereby prisoners' correspondence is ordered to be monitored (see paragraph 21 above). Secondly, no regional administrative court would appear hitherto to have delivered a judgment on the subject. The Court accordingly dismisses the Government's preliminary objection and holds that there has been a breach of Article 13 (art. 13).",
