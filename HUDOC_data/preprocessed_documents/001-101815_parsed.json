The domestic caselaw also showed that that such a claim could be successful only if it touched upon the technical aspects of a reconstruction in a neighbouring property. Moreover, such a claim protected directly the integrity of a property, not the private lives or homes of those living in it.

If the courts allow a claim under section 109(1), they can enjoin the perpetrator of the nuisance to remove the reconstruction and/or stop or abate any activities which unduly interfere with the owner\u2019s rights (see paragraphs 5762 above). It thus seems, contrary to what the applicants suggest, that such a claim would not have been necessarily premised upon the settingaside, in previous proceedings, of any building permits issued to the applicants\u2019 neighbours, and would have been capable of addressing the gist of the applicants\u2019 grievance and providing them with effective redress.",

The applicants fought a protracted battle in and out of the courts to obtain its enforcement (see paragraphs 2736 above). Their complaints to the police and to the municipal authorities also seemed capable of providing swift and effective redress in respect of the nuisances coming from the computer club, the electronic games club and the office. The applicable regulations empowered those authorities to intervene, stop the nuisances and sanction their perpetrators (see paragraphs 6569 above).

For years they had to endure day and night the noise generated by the computer club\u2019s clientele, which could number up to three hundred people. The seriousness of the situation could be seen from the affidavits submitted by them. From August 2003 the Milevi sisters had in addition to endure the nuisances coming from the electronic games club, whose creation had entailed extensive works in the flat below theirs, with the pulling down of walls and the installation of highvoltage electrical cabling and new windows. The resulting disturbances could be seen from a number of photographs submitted by the applicants and the affidavit drawn up by Mr Hristo Evtimov. While the disturbances coming from the flat converted into an office were obviously not as intense as the rest, they nonetheless aggravated the overall situation. The Evtimovi family, as a result of the location of their flat, had been disturbed only by the computer club. At first the main annoyance had been the noise generated by the club\u2019s clients at night. After the club had moved to the other flat, which was closer to theirs, they had to endure the same interferences as the Milevi sisters. The fact that Ms Kalina Hristova had a young child made that all the more unbearable.",

Two applications raising the point in connection with aircraft noise were declared admissible but later settled (see Arrondelle v. the United Kingdom, no. 7889/77, Commission decision of 15 July 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 19, p. 186, and Commission\u2019s report of 13 May 1982, unreported, and Baggs v. the United Kingdom, no. 9310/81, Commission decision of 16 October 1985, DR 44, p. 13, and Commission\u2019s report of 8\u00a0July 1987, unreported). In another case also concerning aircraft noise the Commission found, on the facts, that the noise level amounted to an interference (see Rayner v. the United Kingdom, no. 9310/81, Commission decision of 16 July 1986, DR 47, p. 5). In a case concerning noise from a military shooting range the Commission found, again on the facts, that the level and frequency of the nuisance were not sufficient to engage Article 8 (see Vearncombe and Others v. the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany, no. 12816/87, Commission decision of 18 January 1989, DR 59, p. 186). In a case concerning noise from ferries, the Commission left the point open, as it found justification for the interference (see G.A. v. Sweden, no. 12671/87, Commission decision of 13 March 1989, unreported). In a case concerning noise and other nuisances from a nearby nuclear power station, the Commission was satisfied, based on findings made by the domestic courts, that Article 8 was engaged (see S. v. France, no. 13728/88, Commission decision of 17 May 1990, DR 65, p. 250). In a case concerning noise from road works, the Commission found, based on findings made in domestic proceedings, that the noise level was not higher than what was usually inherent to life in a modern city (see Trouche v.\u00a0France, no. 19867/92, Commission decision of 1 September 1993, unreported).",

Later, in Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no.\u00a036022/97, \u00a7\u00a7 11618, ECHR 2003VIII), and Ashworth and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 39561/98, 20 January 2004), both concerning aircraft noise, the Court was satisfied, based on official data about the noise levels, that Article 8 was engaged, even though in the former case the applicants had not submitted evidence showing the degree of discomfort suffered by each of them personally. Similarly, in Moreno G\u00f3mez (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 59 and 60), the Court accepted that Article 8 was engaged, for two reasons. First, the authorities had designated the area in which the applicant lived as an \u201cacoustically saturated zone\u201d, which, under Spanish law, was an area where local residents were exposed to high noise levels causing them serious disturbance. Secondly, the fact that the maximum permitted noise levels had been exceeded had been confirmed on a number of occasions by the authorities. In Ruano Morcuende (cited above), concerning vibrations from an electric transformer installed in a room adjoining the applicant\u2019s flat, the Court was likewise satisfied that Article 8 was engaged. By contrast, in F\u00e4gerski\u00f6ld v. Sweden ((dec.), no.\u00a037664/04, 26 February 2008), which concerned noise from a wind turbine, the Court found, on the basis of unequivocal data from tests carried out by the authorities, that the noise levels in the applicant\u2019s house were not as high as to engage Article 8. It reached the same conclusion in Furlepa (cited above), which concerned noise from a carrepair garage, on the basis of the applicant\u2019s failure to put forward sufficient evidence. In Borysiewicz v.\u00a0Poland (no. 71146/01, \u00a7\u00a7 5255, 1 July 2008), which concerned noise from a tailoring workshop, the Court likewise found that the applicant had failed to submit enough evidence to show that the level of noise in her home had exceeded the norms set by domestic law or by the relevant international standards, or had gone beyond what was inherent to life in a modern town. It came to the same conclusion in Leon and Agnieszka Kania v. Poland (no.\u00a012605/03, \u00a7\u00a7 10103, 21 July 2009), which concerned noise from a lorry maintenance and metalcutting and grinding workshop, and in Galev and Others (cited above), which concerned noise from a dentist\u2019s surgery. More recently, in Olui\u0107 (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 5262), which concerned noise from a bar operating in the house where the applicant lived, the Court was satisfied, on the basis of a number of tests carried out over a period of eight years, that the level of noise there exceeded the maximum permitted under Croatian law and under the relevant international standards.",

It cannot be overlooked that those activities, which may be seen as an natural corollary of the club\u2019s operations, were taking place in and around a building which had an essentially residential character (see, mutatis mutandis, Olui\u0107, cited above \u00a7 61 in limine).

It should also be pointed out that, in view of the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities in that domain, it is not in the Court\u2019s remit to determine what exactly should have been done to stop or reduce the disturbance. However, the Court can assess whether the authorities approached the matter with due diligence and gave consideration to all competing interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Fadeyeva, cited above, \u00a7 128). In carrying out that assessment, it will have regard to, among other things, whether the national authorities acted in conformity with domestic law (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 9698).",

On the contrary, on 26\u00a0June 2002 the municipality approved a plan for the conversion of the flat in which the club was located into commercial premises, without trying to establish whether the domesticlaw rules intended to reconcile the existence of commercial outfits in residential buildings with the wellbeing of the persons living in such buildings had been complied with (see paragraphs 21, 50 and 51 above). It is true that the municipality subsequently subjected the club\u2019s operating permit to the condition that its clients enter through the back door and not through the passageway used by the building\u2019s residents (see paragraph 23 above). However, that condition was imposed at the end of November 2003, some two and a half years after the club had started operating, and there is no indication that the authorities took any steps to ensure that it was being complied with. According to the applicants, the condition could not be met owing to the building\u2019s layout (ibid.), and the authorities later found that it was being completely disregarded by the club (see paragraph 37 above). Rules intended to safeguard guaranteed rights serve little purpose if they are not properly enforced (see Moreno G\u00f3mez, cited above, \u00a7 61).",

They presented an expert\u2019s report which concluded that the flat\u2019s fair market value at the time of the sale was 1.6 times higher than the price at which the applicants had sold it. The applicants claimed the difference, which amounted to EUR 36,600.

They said that if they had not been forced to sell their original flat in March 2004 with urgency, they could have sold it later for a much higher price, which had been only partly offset by the concomitant increase in the market value of their new flat.

Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2009...). In L\u00f3pez Ostra the Court accepted that the depreciation of a property as a result of severe environmental degradation and the need to move house on account of that degradation had a sufficient causal connection with the violation of Article 8 (see L\u00f3pez Ostra, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065). However, unlike that case, the nuisance in the instant case was not of such a nature or intensity as to bring about a clear reduction in the market value of the applicants\u2019 flat (see S. v. France, p. 262, and Hatton and Others, \u00a7 127, and contrast Baggs, p. 15, all cited above). There is nothing to indicate that the factors which caused the Milevi sisters to wish to move out of the flat would necessarily diminish its value in the eyes of a prospective buyer intending to put it to nonresidential use. Indeed, it cannot be overlooked that the flat was purchased by a company (see paragraph 9 above). Nor is it apparent that the applicants were forced to sell the flat in such urgency as to be unable to obtain a fair market price for it. The actual price agreed between them and the buyer could be the result of a multitude of factors about which the Court is unable to speculate. The Court is therefore not satisfied that the alleged undervalue at which the Milevi sisters sold their flat and the ensuing loss of profit had a sufficient causal link with the violation of Article 8, and makes no award under this head.",

Moreover, the hourly rate charged by the lawyer for the Strasbourg proceedings is roughly double the rates charged in recent cases against Bulgaria of similar or greater complexity (see Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 268 and 274; Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy) and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 412/03 and 35677/04, \u00a7 183, 22 January 2009; Bulves AD v. Bulgaria, no. 3991/03, \u00a7 85, 22 January 2009; Kolevi v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 1108/02, \u00a7 221, 5 November 2009; and Mutishev and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 18967/03, \u00a7 160, 3 December 2009). It cannot therefore be regarded as reasonable as to quantum.",
