III of 1989 on the Right of Assembly, according to which \u201cthe exercise of the right of assembly may not constitute an offence, or instigation thereto, or violate the rights and freedoms of others\u201d.

It is not the function of the Court to substitute its own assessment for that of the national courts; indeed, it cannot question that assessment, unless it is manifestly unreasonable or there is clear evidence of arbitrariness (see Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 60654/00, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR 2007I). In the present circumstances, the Court is satisfied that there was no appearance of arbitrariness.",

Federal Republic of Germany, no.\u00a013079/87, Commission decision of 6 March 1989, Decisions and Reports 60, p. 256). Compared to his intention to express, by way of a demonstration, a political concern, the conduct which the applicant availed himself of was out of proportion and caused significant inconvenience to road-users. The fact that this conduct was assessed by the domestic authorities as a breach of criminal law does not reveal an unjustified interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 11 of the Convention, all the more so, since he was convicted not for the participation in, or organisation of, the demonstration but for the obstruction of traffic (see Barraco, cited above, \u00a7 46).",
