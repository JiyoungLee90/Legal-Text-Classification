His phrase had not accused him of any offence; it had been a conclusion at which an ordinary citizen would have arrived upon reviewing the findings of Moscow courts on the claims lodged by Mayor Luzhkov. The phrase had been his personal opinion which was not actionable in defamation. He had sought to attract public attention to the existing case-law and to the way in which the courts functioned in Moscow. The amount of award had been grossly disproportionate in relation to both the nature of the statement and the existing case-law, as well as in relation to his financial situation as a father of two minor children, and his political status as one of the leaders of the opposition movement. An excessively large award had the stifling effect on the criticism of public authorities in Russia and on the activities of the opposition movement.",

The interference had a lawful basis, notably Article 152 of the Civil Code, which allowed an aggrieved party to seek the judicial protection of his reputation and claim compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damages.

The Court reiterates that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance. The requirements of the protection of a politician\u2019s reputation have to be weighed against the interests of open discussion of political issues (see Oberschlick v.

Such forms of expression allow for a greater degree of exaggeration and cannot be held to the same standard of accuracy as written assertions (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v.\u00a0Spain\u00a0[GC], nos. 28955/06 and 3 others, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2011). The statement conveyed the applicant\u2019s indignation at what he perceived as yet another rejection of lawful demands against the Moscow government. It reflected his own experience of unsuccessful attempts to vindicate the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in Moscow, but also on the experience of others who had lost judicial proceedings involving the Moscow mayor. The Court considers that those elements, taken together with the Government\u2019s factual information showing that the courts had not found against the Moscow mayor in any of the defamation claims (see paragraph 16 above), were sufficient to lend a certain factual basis to the applicant\u2019s strong reaction. The Court accordingly finds that the applicant was entitled to state his opinion in a public forum on a matter of public interest. The District and City Courts in Moscow did not carry out a balancing exercise or take into account the Moscow mayor\u2019s position as a professional politician. Those failings call for the conclusion that the standrds according to which the national authorities examined the defamation claim against the applicant were not in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10.",

It reiterates that unpredictably large awards in defamation cases are considered capable of having a chilling effect on the freedom of expression and therefore require the most careful scrutiny (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7 64, ECHR 1999III, and Kasabova v. Bulgaria, no. 22385/03, \u00a7 71, 19 April 2011). An award of damages must be \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in the sense that it must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered. It falls to the Court to assess whether the compensatory response to a defamation claim was a proportionate one by finding where the appropriate balance lies between the conflicting Convention rights involved. Accordingly, the essential question to be answered is whether, having regard to the size of the award, there were adequate and effective domestic safeguards, at first instance and on appeal, against disproportionate awards which assured a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the award and the injury to reputation (see Independent News and Media and Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited v.\u00a0Ireland, no. 55120/00, \u00a7\u00a7 110-113, ECHR 2005V (extracts), and Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13 July 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 48-51, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0316B).",

The Court reiterates that awards of that magnitude will trigger a heightened scrutiny of their proportionality (see Pakdemirli v. Turkey, no.\u00a035839/97, \u00a7 59, 22 February 2005, and Gouveia Gomes Fernandes and Freitas e Costa v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 1529/08, \u00a7 54, 29\u00a0March 2011). That award was unusually high in absolute terms but also much higher in relation to awards in comparable defamation cases that have come before the Court (see, for example, Grinberg v. Russia, no. 23472/03, \u00a7 12, 21 July 2005 \u2013 RUB\u00a02,500 to the Governor of the Ulyanovsk Region out of the RUB\u00a0500,000 he had claimed; Fedchenko v.

The Government were able to identify only five cases over a ten-year period in which comparable or higher awards had been made. By contrast, in the three-year period from 2007 to 2010, the Moscow mayor was granted the full amount he had claimed in at least two other cases (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above).",
