Thus, the effectiveness of a remedy which has to be used for the purposes of Article 35 may depend on whether it has a significant effect on the length of the proceedings as a whole (see, mutatis mutandis, Holzinger v.

Again, the proceedings continued before the Administrative Court until 19 June and 23\u00a0October 2009, respectively, when the Administrative Court granted the applicants\u2019 actions for judicial review and remitted the cases for further consideration before the Ministry (see paragraph 26 above). In the third set of administrative proceedings the Ministry annulled the Administrative Unit\u2019s decisions of 16 August 1999 (see paragraph 28 above), and the proceedings are pending to date before that administrative authority (see paragraph 31 above). All these different sets of proceedings essentially constitute different stages of one and the same dispute concerning the allotment of plots of land in the land consolidation process, hence the Court considers that for the purposes of assessing the reasonableness of their duration they must be examined as a whole. Thus, after Slovenia\u2019s ratification of the Convention, the proceedings have altogether been pending before different administrative and judicial authorities for over twenty-one years.",

Indeed the present cases are of some complexity; however, this cannot justify the excessive length of the proceedings, which have been pending since 1989. For example, the administrative proceedings at the first instance came to a standstill for a period of more than eight years between 1991 and 1999. Later, the administrative appeal proceedings before the Ministry came to a standstill for a period of four years between 2003 and 2007 and for a period of almost four years between 2009 and 2013.",
