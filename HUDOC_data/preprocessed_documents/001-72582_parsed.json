This difference, in the Court\u2019s opinion, does not change the general situation, since the enforcement of judgments against a State authority, as it appears from the case file, can only be carried out if the State foresees and makes provision for the appropriate expenditures in the State Budget of Ukraine by taking the appropriate legislative measures. In the Ukrainian legal system, the Supreme Court of Ukraine does not have power to overrule the law, therefore, even if the formal suspension of the enforcement proceedings could be lifted, the enforcement proceedings would anyway depend on statutory restraints outside the courts\u2019 competence.",
