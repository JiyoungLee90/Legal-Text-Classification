According to the principles laid down in its case-law (see Zander v. Sweden, judgment of 25 November 1993, Series A no. 279B, p. 38, \u00a7\u00a022, and Acquaviva v.

The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the existence of a right but also to its scope and manner of its exercise; and, finally, the outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question (see Baraona v.

This decision also resulted in the company\u2019s wounding-up and its striking-out of the register of legal entities. However, the applicant argued before the domestic courts that the company\u2019s receiver had incorrectly assessed the company\u2019s assets and established its creditors, and that the decision of 22 March 1999 could not have been taken because the company still had assets to re-distribute among its shareholders. Bearing these circumstances in mind, the Court considers that the applicant could maintain, on arguable grounds, that the company should still continue to operate and should have still been able to repay her the value of her share, so that there was a genuine and serious dispute over the existence of that right (see, mutatis mutandis, Pudas v.

The defendants, referring to the decision of 22 March 1999, argued that the company had no longer existed and no claims could have been lodged against it.\u00a0\u00a0It appears that in November 2003 the applicant withdrew her claim for reimbursement of a share precisely because her claim had no prospect of success while the decision of 22 March 1999 remained in force.",

Having regard to the fact that the decision of 22\u00a0March 1999 excluded claims against the company, its quashing would have enabled the applicant to resubmit her claim for reimbursement of the share which she considered to have been wrongly paid. That means that the applicant\u2019s personal financial situation was affected by the decision of 22\u00a0March 1999. Having regard to the close connection between the proceedings for annulment of the decision of 22\u00a0March 1999 and the consequences that their outcome might have had for the applicant\u2019s pecuniary right, the Court is of the opinion that Article 6 \u00a7 1 also applied to the period of the proceedings from November 2003 to 25\u00a0January 2005.",
