Loss of liberty imposed as punishment for an offence belongs in general to the criminal sphere, unless by its nature, duration or manner of execution it is not appreciably detrimental (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a039665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-130, ECHR 2003X).

The administrative proceedings against the applicant resulted in a threeday period of detention which he served in the detention unit of the police station.

It further transpires from the District Court\u2019s judgment that the applicant had insulted and threatened police officers with violence during the time when the administrative report concerning his disorderly acts was being prepared. He had been verbally abusive after his arrival at the police station and in the car on the way to it. It follows that the offences at issue were separate and subsequent in time (cf. Asci v. Austria (dec.), no.\u00a04483/02, 19 October 2006).

The Court observes that the offence of \u201cminor disorderly acts\u201d as defined in Article 158 of the Code of Administrative Offence and that of \u201cdisorderly acts\u201d under Article 213 of the Criminal Code had the same essential elements, namely disturbance of the public order (see, by contrast, Ponsetti and Chesnel v.\u00a0France (dec.), nos. 36855/97 and 41731/98, 14 September 1999, ECHR-1999-VI, Oliveira\u00a0v.

Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 finds application even where the individual has merely been prosecuted in proceedings that have not resulted in a conviction (see Zigarella, cited above). The Court has emphasised that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 contains three distinct guarantees and provides that no one shall be (i) liable to be tried, or (ii) tried, or (iii) punished for the same offence (see Nikitin v.\u00a0, no.\u00a050178/99, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2004...).",

Until 1 February 2002 that charge remained the only charge against him. It was not subsequently dismissed; instead, the prosecution continued for a further ten months until the trial court delivered its judgment on 2 December 2002.

Its object and purpose imply that, in the absence of any damage proved by the applicant, only new proceedings brought in the knowledge that the defendant has already been tried in the previous proceedings would violate this provision (see Zigarella, cited above).
