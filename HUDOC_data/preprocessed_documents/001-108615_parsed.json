Given the instantaneous nature of a political demonstration \u2013 the impact of which may rapidly diminish with the lapse of time from the triggering event \u2013 a judicial procedure, which included several remittals and decisions maintaining the ban and which produced at last a decision to the contrary only after more than four years, can hardly be regarded as effective or adequate and must be attributed a chilling effect on the freedom in question (see, a fortiori, B\u0105czkowski and Others v.

For the Court, the applicant\u2019s omission to pursue this legal avenue in addition to the one utilised cannot be held against him, all the more so, since there appears to be no obstacle to the authorities\u2019 assessing proportionality also in those proceedings, of which the applicant availed himself.
