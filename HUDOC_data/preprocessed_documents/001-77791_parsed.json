Since, from 1991 onwards, there had been a legal obligation, confirmed by the Constitutional Court in its case-law, on the Civil Guard, as a \u201cState security force\u201d not an \u201carmed force\u201d, to have its own disciplinary regime distinct from that of the armed forces and governed by its own basic law, the reservation cannot extend to a law whose purpose is to partition the subject matter of the reservation. The view that it does so extend is contrary to the Convention and the Court cannot accept it.",

From the start of the appeal process, he had argued that, in the absence of a reservation, there had been no basis for his deprivation of liberty and had in addition consistently contended that his detention was unlawful by any standard as it had been decided by a body that was neither competent nor independent and which combined the roles of investigator and judge. He had thus been tried without any of the necessary safeguards, assistance from a lawyer or right of challenge. The applicant submitted in conclusion that he had been deprived of his liberty in circumstances not contemplated by Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, by a court without jurisdiction and under a procedure that did not comply with that laid down by the Constitution for deprivations of liberty.",

The appeal against that penalty did not, therefore, have any suspensive effect (contrast Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 68, Series A no. 22). In such proceedings, the hierarchical superior exercises his authority within the hierarchy of the Civil Guard and reports to other higher authorities and so is not independent of them. Since the disciplinary proceedings take place before the hierarchical superior, they do not provide the judicial guarantees required by Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (a).
