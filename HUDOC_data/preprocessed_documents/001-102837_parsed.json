That provision, accepted in 1992 by the majority of the population and of the Swiss Cantons (in the form of Article 24novies (a) of the Constitution), falls in particular within a policy of protection of human dignity, according to the conception thereof that is generally shared in this country (FF 1996 III 278; see also the response of the Federal Council to a question from R.

However, numerous members have apparently been investigated by the police on account of their sexual practices. According to a judgment delivered on 28 November 1997 by the District Court of La Sarine, concerning a right of reply requested by the Mouvement ra\u00eblien suisse, the remarks made by Ra\u00ebl in his works could lead certain adults to commit acts of sexual abuse against children. The judgment quotes extracts from works by Ra\u00ebl that can be downloaded from the website of the [applicant] association, according to which the sexual education of children should not only be theoretical but should consist of a sensual education aimed at showing them how to derive pleasure from it. That judgment further indicates that, notwithstanding the denial subsequently issued on this point, certain articles published in the quarterly newsletter Apocalypse described the child as a \u2018privileged sexual object\u2019. Lastly, it is stated that a friend and a member of the Raelian Movement were convicted by the  and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl. The judgment was upheld on 13 February 1998 by the . An ordinary appeal and a public-law appeal by the Mouvement ra\u00eblien were dismissed on 24 August 1998 by the Federal Court, having regard in particular to the equivocal writings of the movement\u2019s founder or members (judgments 5P.172/1998 and 5C.104/1998).",

The movement\u2019s leaders are thus said to have advocated \u2018a broad sexual freedom strongly encouraging commission of the act\u2019; they had thus corrupted young teenagers by supposedly philosophical discourse, by increasingly specific sexual fondling and by inciting them more and more forcefully, in order to satisfy \u2018their sexual needs and fantasies with young girls who had just turned fifteen, and who were changing partners very quickly\u2019.",

The Administrative Court, for its part, found that the poster should be prohibited even without the reference to the website, but this seems questionable; there is no doubt, however, that the removal of the address in question would deprive the poster campaign of its object, which, as has been shown, is essentially to advertise the website itself.

In addition, certain passages in the books proposed on the movement\u2019s website might lead adults to commit acts of abuse against minors. In support of their allegations, the authorities had referred in particular to a judgment delivered on 28 November 1997 by the District Court of La Sarine, upheld by the Cantonal Court of the Canton of Fribourg and by the Federal Court, and to various documents concerning criminal proceedings against members of the association for sexual assault, including a judgment of the Lyon Court of Appeal of 24 January 2002 (see judgment of the Federal Court, point 5.5.3).

Accordingly, it must in particular assess, in deciding whether the measure was in conformity with Article 10, not only the poster but also the more general context surrounding it, especially the ideas expressed in the books and the content of the websites of the association and of Clonaid. As those websites were per se accessible to everyone, including minors, the impact of the posters on the general public would have been multiplied and the State\u2019s interest in prohibiting the poster advertising campaign was thus all the greater (see, to the same effect, Stoll, cited above, \u00a7 104).",

It can be distinguished from Appleby and Others because it does not concern a private space, such as the privately-owned shopping centre in that case, but a public space (see Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44306/98, ECHR 2003VI). Above all, in the present case the issue is not one of positive obligations, in which the extent of the State\u2019s responsibilities must not be interpreted as imposing on the authorities an unbearable or excessive burden (see \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem v. Turkey, no. 23144/93, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000III); whilst it is true that, in both hypotheses \u2013 positive and negative obligations \u2013 the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation, the Court has found that this margin of appreciation is narrower as regards the negative obligations under the Convention (see Women On Waves and Others v. Portugal, no. 31276/05, \u00a7\u00a040, 3 February 2009).",

Portugal, where the prohibiting of a vessel from entering Portuguese territorial waters had prevented the applicants from imparting information and holding the scheduled meeting and events that were supposed to have taken place on board. In that case the Court criticised the use of radical measures against the applicants and observed that the Portuguese authorities had, at least with regard to a particular point, other means that would have been less harmful to the applicants\u2019 rights than the total prohibition of the vessel from entering their waters (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 42-43).",

Portugal, where it found that the margin of appreciation was narrower as regards the negative obligations under the Convention (contrast paragraph 52 in fine of the judgment); and since, under these circumstances, the margin of appreciation is a narrow one in the present case, the following elements should be taken into account in assessing whether or not there has been a violation:",

Rather, it was the telephone number and the address of the applicant\u2019s website at the bottom of the poster that gave rise to the decision in question. Nor is it in dispute that the applicant association is not prohibited as such and that it has existed in  since 1977. It is, in our view, undeniable that an association is a legal entity, which, when it operates lawfully in society, usually has the capacity to propagate freely its ideas and opinions, and attain its aims, without hindrance, through the means that society offers to all its members. The legal system of a State may, of course, refuse the establishment of an association which is regarded as violating moral, political or other values of the society that it represents. However, once it has accepted the association\u2019s initial aims, it must presumably allow it to freely mingle with society and to propagate the key ideas that stem from those aims. The dichotomy applied by the Swiss authorities in legalising, on the one hand, the association in question, but, on the other, prohibiting it from advertising, in a neutral manner, activities that had already been stated in the goals of the association without having been found to violate the ordre public of Swiss society, seems to us to be very problematic.",

Nowadays, considering the importance of and role played by means of direct communication such as mobile telephones and the Internet, it seems difficult to understand how a lawful association with its website, that is not prohibited, cannot use public space to promote the same ideas through posters that are not unlawful and do not offend the general public. Nor does the argument to the effect that, by accepting a poster advertising campaign, the municipal authorities might suggest that they are endorsing the opinions in question (see paragraph 52) seem to correspond to the realities of the contemporary role of such authorities, which act in this context as private managers of public space. It is, therefore, neither realistic nor necessary in a democratic society to limit such access by restrictions of this kind.",
