It noted that the applicant had given two different reasons for which the Head of Security Forces had allegedly threated him with imprisonment. Furthermore, although he initially claimed that the Security forces and the authorities were falsely accusing him of participating in the Qamishli events, he then stated that he had actually participated but was not able to give accurate information concerning these events. Furthermore, the events complained of had happened in 2004 whereas he had left Syria legally in 2008 and he did not allege that during this period he was persecuted by the authorities because of his alleged participation. He was also able to leave Syria legally. The Reviewing Authority further stressed that his claims concerning ill-treatment were incoherent and that the applicant had not been able to describe in any detail the treatment he had been allegedly subjected to. Lastly, in reply to the applicant\u2019s claims before it that he had been subjected to persecution because of his Kurdish origin, the Reviewing Authority observed that the applicant had not applied for asylum on this basis. In any event, it stressed that there was no indication that he had been subjected to any kind of discrimination on the ground of his origin.",

About 150 Kurds from Syria, including the applicants, remained in the area around the clock, having set up about eighty tents on the pavement. According to the Government, the encampment conditions were unsanitary and protesters were obstructing road and pedestrian traffic. The encampment had become a hazard to public health and created a public nuisance. The protesters performed their daily chores on the pavement, including cooking and washing in unsanitary conditions. The sewage pits had overflown, causing a nuisance and offensive odours. The public lavatories were dirty and the rubbish bins of the Government buildings were being used and, as a result, were continuously overflowing. Furthermore, the protesters were unlawfully obtaining electricity from the Printing Office. Members of the public who lived or worked in the area had complained to the authorities. The Government submitted that efforts had been made by the authorities to persuade the protesters to leave, but to no avail. As a result, the authorities had decided to take action to remove the protesters from the area.",

He was detained in a cell measuring 1.6 square meters and he was subjected to torture and ill-treatment. In particular, he was beaten on various parts of his body with wooden sticks. During his detention he was interrogated in relation to his affiliation to political parties. Subsequently he was transferred to Al-Hasakah Central Prison where he was detained for about a month and eight days. After that he was brought before a court in Qamishli without having been informed of the charges brought against him. He was questioned as to his affiliation to political parties. He was then taken back to Al-Hasakah Central Prison. He was subsequently transferred to the Devik Central Prison in his hometown where he was detained for a night and the next day he was taken to court again. He was released after his family bribed officials and he immediately went into hiding. He hid in friends\u2019 and relatives houses and subsequently in a bakery in Damascus, until he could find a way to leave from Syria again. While in Damascus, his cousin informed him that he had received a letter requesting the applicant to present himself at the Aleppo Police. He was told by members of his family that he was still wanted from the military and civil police. After a failed attempt to leave Syria he managed to leave through Northern Iraq. He returned to Cyprus after travelling from Turkey and was in the process of submitting a new asylum application. The applicant stated that he was still wanted by the military police in Syria and that his family was still trying to find out the reason why he was a wanted person.",

The source mentioned that the computer system employed at border controls to screen persons upon their entry into Syria works well. Border guards check whether the name of someone who enters Syria can be found on one of the wanted persons lists of the security services. These lists contain information from the various security services\u2019 offices from all parts of the country, including from Qamishli. Immigration authorities are thus able to see whether a returnee has a file with the security services somewhere, and can subsequently inquire about the file\u2019s details with the authorities from these cities or municipalities. It was added that there is no single list of wanted persons but that every security agency maintains its own list. If one of the security services has a file concerning a returnee, he or she would be transferred from the immigration services\u2019 detention facilities to the security agency\u2019s detention centre.",

They were not entitled to the same education or health care as Syrian citizens, and their lack of the standard Syrian identity card meant that they could not receive state benefits, travel internally or stay in a hotel.",

There is no indication that the Syrian authorities could have known who all the protesters were or that they were in a position to identify them. No evidence has been submitted establishing that there was a real risk of identification of any of the applicants from this demonstration or, indeed, any other protest or activity they may have participated in.

The applicants had been \u201cprohibited immigrants\u201d within the meaning of section 6(1)(k) of the Aliens and Immigration Law as they had stayed in the Republic unlawfully after the rejection of their asylum applications.

This provision does not require that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing; in this respect Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) (see Chahal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 112-113 and \u010conka v.
