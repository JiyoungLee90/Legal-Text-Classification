In sum, the experts held that the plaintiff\u2019s book was a popular health book, that it was not a word-for-word translation or citation from Dr Spock\u2019s book, that in the first edition of his book the plaintiff referred at the end of his book to Dr Spock and J.H.

As regards this last point the experts considered that these parts did not concern scientific information but anonymous information known to all paediatricians, and that following these paragraphs the plaintiff had referred to national- specific matters. They further considered that certain conditions required for scientific books, such as citation of sources, were not required for books published at that time, and that an acknowledgement only in the form of thanks sufficed.",

In this connection, the applicant emphasised what he described as the inappropriate way in which the domestic courts had praised the plaintiff in their decisions. In his view these flaws in the proceedings demonstrated that the domestic courts lacked the requisite impartiality vis-\u00e0-vis the plaintiff, and that they had been unduly influenced by his status.

In addition, he submitted that the book contained outdated information on baby sleeping positions (Dr Spock had updated this part in his 1998 edition but the plaintiff had not) which demonstrated that plagiarism, apart from being unethical, also constituted a public threat. The applicant asserted the truthfulness of his accusation regarding plagiarism and considered that he had not been given the opportunity to prove it because of the biased expert reports.

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see, for example, Pedersen and Baadsgaard v.

The Court observes that this report found that various parts of the book were translated parts of Dr\u00a0Spock\u2019s book.

It underlines, in this respect, that it is not the Court\u2019s task to rule on the issue of the veracity of the applicant\u2019s allegations of plagiarism. Rather, its examination of the issue is essentially from the standpoint of the relevance and sufficiency of the reasons given by the domestic courts in the proceedings in question and whether the standards applied, including procedural guarantees, were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10. For the Court, there is a lack of clarity in the decision of the Plenary Session of the Court of Cassation as to what is considered as plagiarism under domestic law and practice and the standard of proof the domestic courts require under Turkish law to prove such allegations before the domestic courts.",

Just over seven months later, on 19\u00a0October 2004, the Fourth Division of the Court of Cassation gave judgment a second time and, again, quashed the judgment of the first-instance court, in the applicant\u2019s favour. Just over a year later, on 8\u00a0November 2005, the first-instance court decided to disregard the judgment of the Fourth Division of the Court of Cassation and ordered the applicant to pay compensation.",

Naturally, the applicant appealed a third time to the Court of Cassation, his appeal, according to domestic law, coming before the Plenary Session of the Court of Cassation. The Plenary Session gave judgment against the applicant on 10 May 2006, just over a year and a half after the first-instance court had disregarded the judgment of the Fourth Division. However, it is of some significance in this respect that the date of the applicant\u2019s appeal to the Plenary Session is unspecified in the documents provided to the Court, nor is there any information on whether and when observations were submitted by the parties before the Plenary Session.",

Just over two months later, on 16 November 2007, the Plenary Session decided, however, to reduce the amount of compensation. Lastly, four months later, on 14\u00a0March 2007, the Plenary Session rejected a request from both parties to rectify its judgment.",

However, the applicable test under the Court\u2019s case law requires an examination on whether delays that may be attributed to the State were the predominant cause or whether other factors were at play. In my view, it is clear that taking into account the complexity of the factual and legal questions at stake, the need to obtain experts\u2019 reports and the objections made by the applicant in that regard, the difficulty of the issue of plagiarism in the Turkish legal system and its ramifications within the academic environment, and, lastly, the issues involved for both parties, the Government have adequately demonstrated that the length of the proceedings was, taken in its entirety and in context, justified.",
