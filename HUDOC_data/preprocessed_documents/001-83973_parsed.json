Further to its assessement of the 2006\u00a0Act, the Court was satisfied that the aggregate of remedies provided by the new legislation in cases of excessively long proceedings pending at first and second instance were effective in the sense that the remedies were in principle capable of both preventing the continuation of the alleged violation of the right to a hearing without undue delay and of providing adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred (see Grzin\u010di\u010d, cited above, \u00a7 98). The Court therefore concluded that the applicants should have exhausted the new remedies in order to comply with Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

In addition, the hearing held on 9 April 1997 was adjourned so as to give the parties sixty days to negotiate a settlement, but the applicant informed the court that the settlement had not been reached only in October 1997 (paragraph 8). Likewise, the applicant requested the adjournment of the hearing held on 15 October 2001, during the re-examination proceedings (paragraph 15 above). The Court agrees with the Government (paragraph 49 above) that some of these adjournments and the resulting delays could have been avoided had the applicant acted more diligently. It must, however, add that the decision to adjourn the hearing sine die was taken by a judge whose responsibility it was to schedule a new hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Lesar\u00a0v.
