The case originated in an application (no. 1679/03) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr Ralf Glüsen (“the applicant”), on 6 January 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mr J. Walczak, a lawyer practising in . The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel,
On 15 September 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Hamelin.
In 1986 the applicant started to study food chemistry at the . He obtained a certificate in mathematics in a
On 11 October 1989 the applicant was attacked and robbed by two masked and armed men. He subsequently underwent psychological treatment for post-traumatic disorders.
On 19 December 1989 the applicant applied for compensation under the Victims Compensation Act (Opferentschädigungsgesetz, see “Relevant domestic law” below). On 8 August 1990 the Braunschweig Pension Office (Versorgungsamt) found that the applicant was suffering from “psychological reactive disturbances” (psychoreaktive Störungen) and that his earning capacity was reduced by 20% (Minderung der Erwerbsfähigkeit). It established that he did not qualify for a pension because the Victims Compensation Act only provided for a pension in cases where the earning capacity was reduced by at least 25%.
In September 1990, following his failure to pass a re-examination at the , the applicant broke off his studies.
On 11 April 1992 the applicant requested the withdrawal of the decision of 8 August 1990 and the recognition that his earning capacity was reduced by more than 20%. A medical report was issued by Dr S. on 1 July 1992.
On 21 November 1992 the applicant asked for the proceedings to be suspended until he started to work again. On 6 May 1993 the applicant’s representative requested a review of the decision of 8 August 1990.
On 4 February 1994 the Pension Office Medical Service submitted a medical opinion.
On 15 July 1994 the Hildesheim Pension Office rejected the applicant’s request.
On 25 July 1994 the applicant lodged an administrative appeal against the decision. On 9 May 1995 the applicant was informed that, in the light of a fresh report, the Pension Office intended to set aside the decision of 8 August 1990. On 26 June 1995 the applicant’s representative asked for the percentage as regards the reduction of earning capacity to be increased.
On 18 September 1995 the Hildesheim Pension Office quashed the order of 8 August 1990.
On 26 February 1996 the Lower Saxony Regional Pension Office (Landesversorgungsamt) rejected the applicant’s administrative appeal.
On 6 March 1996 the applicant filed an action with the  against the order of the Regional Pension Office and the order of the Hildesheim Pension Office dated 18 September 1995.
Upon request by the  two further medical statements were rendered by Dr H. and a Dr K. on 7 June 1996 and 22 August 1996 respectively. On 26 September 1996 the  appointed another expert, Dr M., to provide a new medical report.
Between April and December 1997 three further neurological statements were delivered by Dr B. on behalf of the .
In his written submissions of 4 April 1997 the applicant suggested that a new medical report should be prepared. On 18 December 1997
Following further written pleadings by the applicant submitted to the court on 18 June and 12 August 1998 respectively and a further neurological statement rendered on September 1998 by Dr B. upon the defendant’s request, the Regional Pension Office acknowledged (Teilanerkenntnis) on 22 November 1998 that the applicant’s earning capacity had been reduced by 40% between October 1989 and March 1990 and by 30% between April 1990 and March 1991. This acknowledgement did not, however, fully satisfy the applicant’s claims and he did not withdraw his action as to the remainder.
Between January 1999 and October 1999 the parties submitted further written pleadings. Another neurological statement by Dr B. was submitted on 11 March 1999.
On 28 October 1999 the  rejected the remainder of the applicant’s action. It found that on the basis of the extensive medical documentation a finding of a higher percentage as regards the reduction of earning capacity was not justified.
On 20 December 1999 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Lower Saxony Social Court of Appeal.
With regard to the partial acknowledgment of 22 November 1998
Following several written pleadings both issued by the applicant and the defendant in 2000, Dr H. issued another medical statement at the court’s request on 23 January 2001, received by the court on 27 March 2001.
On 25 January 2002 the applicant’s lawyer requested the court to expedite the proceedings.

On 20 September 2002 Dr M.W. submitted the expert report.
On 24 October 2003 the Social Court of Appeal appointed Dr P.-W. to draw up a further report opinion, which the court received on 27 May 2004. The expert found that the applicant was suffering not only from psychological reactive disturbances but also from a panic syndrome with agoraphobia and depressions and from chronic lumbago.
A hearing scheduled for 29 June 2004 was subsequently postponed; the reason for this is disputed between the parties.
On 27 August 2004 the  acknowledged the impairments to the applicant’s health as found by Dr P.-W. and assessed that his earning capacity was reduced overall by 40 % and by an additional 10 % as from 1 October 1989. The applicant accepted the acknowledgment on 6 October 2004 but upheld his claim as to the remainder.
Between November 2004 and May 2005 the applicant’s counsel and the defendant submitted several sets of pleadings to the court.
With regard to the partial acknowledgment of 27 August 2004 the competent authority issued on 8 July 2005 an implementing order to retrospectively pay the applicant pension and related benefits plus interest amounting to some 46,000 EUR and a monthly pension of 218 EUR as from August 2005.
On 28 July 2005 the Social Court of Appeal appointed Dr W. as expert. His report of 30 December 2005 was received by the court on 24 January 2006.
On 25 January 2006 the Social Court of Appeal asked the applicant whether he wished to pursue his claim. By letter of 8 March 2006 the court was informed by the applicant’s counsel that he no longer acted for the applicant.
In his written submissions of 16 March and 4 April 2006 respectively, consisting of approx. fifty pages, the applicant challenged

On 24 March 1996 the applicant lodged an administrative appeal.
According to the Government the proceedings were apparently subsequently suspended to await the outcome of the proceedings under the Victims Compensation Act. The applicant agreed, and added that he had been informed by the Pension Office that the proceedings had been suspended for that reason. In a letter addressed to the Social Court of Appeal as regards the compensation proceedings, the applicant’s counsel informed the court on 26 June 2000 inter alia that the applicant was interested in a speedy decision on his appeal in the degree of disability proceedings.

The relevant part of Section 1 § 1 of the Victims Compensation Act reads as follows:
 “(1) A person who, in the territory in which this Act is applicable ... has sustained personal injury attributable to a wilful and unlawful attack upon himself or another person or the lawful prevention thereof shall, on application, be granted benefits in accordance with the Federal Act on the Social Benefits for Victims of War in respect of resulting health impairments and financial loss. “
Section 88 of the Social Courts Act provides:
“(1) Where no decision has been made regarding an application for the performance of an administrative act within a reasonable time and without sufficient grounds, a court action shall be admissible six months after an application for the performance of the administrative act has been submitted. (...)
(2) The same applies where no decision on an administrative appeal was made, providing that a three-month time-limit shall apply as a reasonable time limit.”
Section 109 of the Social Courts Act reads as follows:
“(1) On application by the insured person, the disabled person, the person entitled to benefits or his surviving dependants, a physician to be determined shall be heard as an expert. The hearing in respect of this expert opinion may be made dependant on whether the applicant advances the costs and, unless the court decides otherwise, 
the applicant in the end bears the costs.
(2) The court may reject an application where its admission would delay the settlement of the legal dispute and the court is convinced that the application was submitted in attempt to delay proceedings or the application was not submitted earlier due to gross negligence.”
In view of the requirements of § 2 of this provision, national courts in practice rarely reject such a request.
Section 69 § 2 of the Social Code IX provides:
“(2) No assessment of the degree of disability shall be made where it has already been established that the applicant is disabled and the degree of the reduction of the earning capacity based on the disability has already been established in a pension payment order, a corresponding decision by an administrative authority or by a court, or preliminary documentary proof has been issued by a competent public authority unless the disabled person can substantiate an interest in a re-assessment in accordance with para. (1). An assessment in accordance with sentence 1 shall thereby also serve to determine the degree of disability.”
