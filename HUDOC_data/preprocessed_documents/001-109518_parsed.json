The decision referred in particular to statements by the investigator in charge of the applicant\u2019s criminal case, who had indicated that on 6 July 2001 he had questioned the applicant as an accused and the applicant had read and signed a transcript of the interview. An arrest warrant had been served on the applicant and he had been sent to a temporary isolation ward where he had undergone a medical examination which had established that he had had a haematoma on the back of his head. Regarding the haematoma, the applicant had explained that he had sustained that injury in a fall some time before the arrest and that he had no complaints against the police officers. The investigator in charge had also stated that during the interview he had not seen any visible injuries on the applicant, and that in the course of the preliminary investigation neither the applicant nor his lawyer had lodged any complaints regarding the use of any illegal methods by any officers of the law-enforcement agencies. The decision further referred to statements of three police officers who had effected the applicant\u2019s arrest. The statements were similar to those of the investigator in charge. The officers had confirmed that they had forced the applicant to lie on the ground and handcuffed him, stating that it had been rendered necessary by the applicant\u2019s conduct as he had made a sudden move when he was told he was under arrest. However, they had denied that they had used any unlawful violence on the applicant and had indicated that they had not known how the applicant had sustained an injury to the back of his head, which had been established during an examination upon his arrival to the temporary isolation ward.

Also, when he had been admitted to the temporary isolation ward the applicant was examined by a paramedic, who had identified abrasions on his back and the back of his head; however, the applicant had not made any complaints concerning his health.

He explained in particular that whilst he had been arrested on 5 July 2001, the arrest warrant indicated that it had been served on him a day earlier, on 4 July 2001. The applicant was also unsure whether the signature attesting that the document had been served on him, was his own.

The court observed that the applicant had been arrested on 5 July 2001, as could be seen from the relevant report; however, procedural documents, such as the investigator\u2019s decision by which the applicant was accused of the criminal offences, had been served on him on 6 July 2001 and it was on this latter date that the applicant had signed them. The court further relied on the applicant\u2019s statements that he had not signed any documents before his arrest on 5 July 2001 and that on 6 July 2001 he had signed a number of documents during his interview. In this connection the court noted that it could not be excluded that the applicant had signed the warrant himself, having mistakenly put the date of 4 July 2001. The court concluded that the arrest warrant of 7 September 2000 had been lawful, as it had been duly issued by the investigator in charge and approved by a prosecutor on 12\u00a0September 2000, and that therefore the applicant\u2019s complaints should not be allowed.",

Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused. Otherwise, torture or ill-treatment may be presumed in favour of the claimant and an issue may arise under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v. , 27 August 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 108-11, Series A no. 241-A, and Selmouni v.

The Government insisted that the applicant and his counsel had been made aware of the date in question, given that the interlocutory decision of 21 January 2005 by which the hearing in question had been scheduled for 8 February 2005 indicated that a letter informing the applicant of that decision had been sent to the applicant\u2019s detention centre and that his lawyer had been apprised of it in person (see paragraph 28 above).

The question arises whether the decision of 21\u00a0January 2005 could serve as a reliable piece of evidence proving that the applicant and his lawyer were duly notified of the appeal hearing, as the decision contained no information as to whether the applicant had received the letter. Similarly, the decision bears no signature of the applicant\u2019s lawyer or any other marks to confirm that the lawyer was, indeed, duly notified of the date of the hearing.

In the absence of any information to the contrary, this means that by the time the applicant lodged his complaint against the arrest order of 7\u00a0September 2000, his detention on remand had presumably been extended on several occasions by other orders. Consequently, that order no longer formed the basis for the applicant\u2019s detention, and therefore the judicial review of the lawfulness of that order was devoid of any useful purpose, being incapable of leading to the applicant\u2019s release (see, in a somewhat similar context, Starokadomskiy v. , no. 42239/02, \u00a7 86, 31\u00a0July 2008).",
