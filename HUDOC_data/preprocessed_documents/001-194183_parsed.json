The court found that the applicant had had no right to the land underneath as it had not been granted to her according to the procedures set forth in land legislation. The 1983 decision (see paragraph 7 above) had not been a decision giving her the right to use land but merely provided a temporary permission for the construction of a garage on it. In fact, no decision granting her right to land had been taken.\u00a0In addition, the court held that, under domestic law as it had stood at the time the applicant had registered her garage, the applicant had not possessed documents which could have allowed her lawfully to register her garage as her property. Referring to the article of the Land Code concerning unauthorised occupation of land (see paragraph 38 below), the court ordered the applicant to vacate the land. As to the applicant\u2019s counterclaim, the District Court decided that there was no indication of any illegality in the documents authorising the development project.",
