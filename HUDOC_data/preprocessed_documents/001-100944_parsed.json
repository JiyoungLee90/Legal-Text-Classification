Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. It follows that the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary (see Iatridis v.

The domestic courts were silent on this issue despite the fact that the applicant raised it in each set of the domestic proceedings. Reference by the courts to the Instruction is not helpful since, by virtue of Article 23 of the Income Tax Decree, the Instruction could deal only with issues of the application of the Income Tax Decree and could not establish any rules conflicting with that legal act.",

However, none of the paragraphs of Article 7 of the Income Tax Decree had been set aside. The question remained therefore how those legal acts correlated with each other. In this regard the Court notes that the Income Tax Decree had a legal force of the law of Parliament and provided special rules for the taxation of specific types of citizens' income. It is remarkable that, in contrast to the rates fixed in the Presidential Decree, the tax authorities continued to apply, for example, the special rule of Article 7 \u00a7 2 of the Income Tax Decree (see paragraph 40 above). In these circumstances it is unclear why the Presidential Decree had to be understood as prevailing over Article 7 \u00a7 3 of the Income Tax Decree.",
