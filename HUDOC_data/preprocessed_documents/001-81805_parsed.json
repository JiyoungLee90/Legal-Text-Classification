It has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Sadak and Others (no. 2) v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a025144/94 et al., \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR 2002IV).",

The number of situations provided for in the Constitutions and electoral legislation of many member States of the Council of Europe shows the diversity of possible choice on the subject. None of these criteria should, however, be considered more valid than any other provided that it guarantees the expression of the will of the people through free, fair and regular elections (see Podkolzina v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a046726/99, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002II, and Gitonas and Others v.\u00a0Greece, judgment of 1\u00a0July 1997, Reports 1997IV, pp. 1233-34, \u00a7\u00a039).",

That applies all the more to the national parliament, which is vested with legislative power and plays a primordial role in a democratic State (see Podkolzina, cited above, \u00a7 33). The Court considers that the requirement to submit information on the candidate's employment and party membership serves to enable voters to make an informed choice with regard to the candidate's professional and political background. The introduction of such a requirement does not appear arbitrary or unreasonable. It is also incontestably legitimate to ask the candidates that the information so submitted be accurate to the best of their knowledge, lest the voters be misled by false representations. Accordingly, the Court concludes that requiring a candidate for election to the national parliament to submit truthful information on their employment and party affiliation is a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.",

[GC], no.\u00a044774/98, \u00a7\u00a0117, ECHR 2005...). As the Court has found above, the legitimate aim was to avoid the situation where voters would have been misled by false representations by candidates. However, it has never been claimed that the second applicant was not a member of the Communist Party. In these circumstances, the Court cannot accept that the decision on Mr Skuratov's ineligibility, in so far as it was founded solely on the allegedly defective form of the membership certificate, which however was genuine in substance, was indeed taken with the aim of preventing voters from forming a misconception of the second applicant's political leaning. It follows that a reasonable relationship of proportionality between that measure and the legitimate aim was lacking.",

It was therefore disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The Court's finding is applicable both to Mr Skuratov's disqualification in the single-mandate constituency and to his exclusion from the party-roll election because the grounds relied upon in the second set of proceedings repeated those given in the first set.",
