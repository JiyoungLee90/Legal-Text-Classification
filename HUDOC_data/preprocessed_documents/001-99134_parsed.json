Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, mutatis mutandis, Merger and Cros v.\u00a0France (dec.), no. 68864/01, 11 March 2004; Aksoy v.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Jasar v. the  (dec.), no. 69908/01, 19\u00a0January and 11 April 2006).",

Given the fact that he received a favourable decision at first level, he could have legitimately expected not to have an interest in appealing the unfavourable part, namely, in respect of the municipality. Furthermore, as specified under section 334 of the Civil Proceedings Act, the applicant had a time-limit of fifteen days in which to lodge an appeal, which, in his case, expired before 13 January 2005, the date when the State's appeal was communicated to him. If submitted, his observations in reply to the State's appeal would have concerned the State's arguments as to its capacity to be sued. No domestic jurisprudence was presented to prove the Government's arguments that such observations would have prompted ex lege examination of a decision which was not challenged by way of an appeal, being the municipality's capacity to stand in the present case. Lastly, the Court has already stated that a request for the protection of legality under the then applicable rules of civil proceedings cannot be regarded as an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Dimitrovska v. the  (dec.), no. 21466/03, 30\u00a0September\u00a02008). It sees no reason to depart from that finding in the present case. Consequently, the Government's arguments that the applicant failed to exhaust this remedy in time are without force.",
