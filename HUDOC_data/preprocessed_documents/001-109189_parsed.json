The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a \u201crestriction\u201d is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Perna v.

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see, for example, Pedersen and Baadsgaard v.

There is no doubt that these are very important matters in a democratic society which the public has a legitimate interest in being informed about and which fall within the scope of political debate. The Court reiterates in this connection that the press fulfils an essential function in a democratic society. Although it must not overstep certain bounds, particularly in respect of the reputation and rights of others, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest.

In this connection, the first-instance court considered that the article taken as whole had alleged that Mr Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was mentally ill. It considered that such remarks belittled the Prime Minister in the public and the political arena and that such allegations were not the kind to be made about a Prime Minister.",

In this connection, the Court considers that, even assuming as did the firstinstance courts in the present case that the language and expressions used in the two articles in question, particularly those highlighted in the first-instance court\u2019s decisions, were provocative and inelegant and certain expressions could legitimately be classed as offensive, they were, however, mostly value judgments based on particular facts, events or incidents which were already known to the general public, as some of the quotations compiled by the applicant for the purposes of the domestic proceedings demonstrate. They therefore had sufficient factual basis. In so far as it concerns statements of fact contained in the impugned articles, the Court finds that the domestic courts did not attempt to distinguish them from value judgments nor do they appear to have examined whether the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention were observed on the part of the applicant or the publishing company. In particular, for the Court, the domestic courts\u2019 decisions failed to assess whether the articles were published in good faith.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that Article 10 is applicable not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7 57). The Court would add that offensive language may fall outside the protection of freedom of expression if it amounts to wanton denigration, for example where the sole intent of the offensive statement is to insult (see Ska\u0142ka v. , no. 43425/98, \u00a7 34, 27 May 2003); but the use of vulgar phrases in itself is not decisive in the assessment of an offensive expression as it may well serve merely stylistic purposes. For the Court, style constitutes part of communication as a form of expression and is as such protected together with the content of the expression. However, in the instant case, the domestic courts, in their examination of the case, omitted to set the impugned remarks within the context and the form in which they were expressed.",

The Court therefore considers that in taking their decisions the domestic courts overstepped their margin of appreciation and that the judgments against the applicant were disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The fact that the proceedings were civil rather than criminal in nature \u2013 as pointed out by the Government \u2013 does not affect the Court\u2019s considerations above. In any event, the Court would point out that the amount of compensation which the applicant was ordered to pay, together with the publishing company, was significant and that such sums could deter others from criticising public officials and limit the free flow of information and ideas (see Cihan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v.
