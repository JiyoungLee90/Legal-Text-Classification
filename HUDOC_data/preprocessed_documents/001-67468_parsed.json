As regarded the applicant's complaints raised about the procedures under Article 6, he found that the system of imposition of penalties for fraudulent or negligent delivery of incorrect returns or statements was \u201ccriminal\u201d for the purposes of the Convention. He noted that the system was plainly punitive and deterrent, and the potential fine was very substantial and dependent on the culpability of the taxpayer, rather than being an administrative matter. The amount of the fine imposed also depended on the degree of culpability as mitigation, essentially a criminal matter, was more where the taxpayer was less culpable. The judge agreed with the applicant that the proceedings began in 1987 when the Hansard warning was given and considered whether the length of the proceedings was unreasonable. The judge noted that the applicant made no complaint of delay up to the 1991 decision and that some of the subsequent delay had been caused by or contributed to by the applicant, inter alia, in the way in which 16 hearing days were spread over nearly a year and due to problems arising from his illness. However, he observed that nothing happened for a two year period when the case was referred to the Special Commissioners, notwithstanding reminders from the Inland Revenue. In conclusion the judge said:",

Mr\u00a0King waited some 5 weeks before asking for a case stated (appeal by way of cases stated was the procedure then). There was then an 8 month delay before that was produced (delay not of Mr King's making). The appeal was launched on 17 August 1992. Judgment was given on 14 January 1994. The Revenue delayed making a penalty determination until 17 October 1994. Whilst it is understandable, and at least not unreasonable, for the Revenue to wait until the hearing of the first appeal, it makes no sense for them to have waited some 9 months thereafter. The possibility of a determination was simply left hanging. Meanwhile the parties' attention was focused on other things, namely Mr King's further appeal to the Court of Appeal and, more significantly so far as Mr King's contribution to delay was concerned, the Revenue's discovery of the purchase in 1983 by Mr King of the substantial property, Roundwood Lodge. This led to further assessments and appeals therefrom which, it was decided fairly early on, should be heard with the interest and penalty appeals. ...",

It is not possible to be precise as to how much delay was caused by the introduction of this factor into the case, but it is far from insignificant. Naturally it prolonged the hearing itself, but on top of that I think a fair estimate of its effect is that it delayed the penalty and interest appeals for about three years.",

Is that too much? Marginally, but only just, I think not. He was not thereby prejudiced. ... He merely had to pay the penalty later. But for the complication of Roundwood Lodge, however, I think the time to determination of the penalty appeals would have been inconsistent with Article 6 (1). In future cases it is highly desirable that such appeals (and penalty determinations) are put on a fast track. So far as I can see they were treated in the same way as other determinations and appeals, but it should be appreciated that more is at stake in the case of penalties. Serious consideration should be given to penalty determination being made earlier - in appropriate cases along with the assessments giving rise to the penalties. ... I see no reason why the 1991 Commissioners could not have dealt with a penalty determination appeal if such a determination had been made at the same time as the 1989 determinations or shortly thereafter.\u201d",

The applicant also claimed GBP 41,920 for costs incurred in the domestic proceedings in disputing the penalties.

This was also in issue in his application to the Court of Appeal. For the High Court, he claimed his own costs of GBP 16,220, plus GBP 20,000 costs which he was ordered to pay the Inland Revenue; for the Court of Appeal, he claimed GBP 5,700.",

They considered that no more than GBP 5,200 was appropriate. As regarded domestic costs, they saw no justification for his recouping the order of costs paid to the Inland Revenue as it had not been shown that the penalties were wrongly imposed and they argued that the proceedings also concerned the complex factual situation and matters of domestic tax law, pointing out that of the 106 paragraphs of the High Court judgment only 42 referred to Convention issues. Similarly, only one in six of the grounds of appeal concerned Article 6. They also submitted that counsels' fees were excessively high and unspecific as to the hours worked and that the solicitors' fees were based on an unduly high hourly rate and undetailed invoices. They submitted that only GBP 3,284 was appropriate for the High Court and GBP 570 for the Court of Appeal.",

It finds the sums claimed by the applicant for the proceedings in  excessively high, given the lack of complexity of the procedure and the limited number of issues. As regards the domestic procedures, these were not concerned exclusively with seeking redress for the alleged violation of the Convention. Nor does it consider that the requirement to pay the Inland Revenue's costs wholly flowed from the applicant's efforts to vindicate his Article 6 rights; the order for costs was largely a consequence of the court's findings as to his liability to pay the penalties in question, although some of the costs may be regarded as also concerning the Convention part of the case.",
