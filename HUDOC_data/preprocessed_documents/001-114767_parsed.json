The Commission did not draw any conclusion as to the lawfulness of the surveillance as such but limited the scope of its inspection to the conduct of the involved police officers.

The bill was enacted on 15 December 2008 and came into force on 27 December 2008. Along with a host of other changes, the amendment created a National Bureau for Control over Special Surveillance Means, an independent body whose task was to oversee the services authorised to use such means. On 22 October 2009 Parliament adopted further amendments to the Act, abolishing the Bureau and replacing it with a special parliamentary commission vested with similar competence. Its powers included inspecting the premises where the information or documents connected with covert surveillance were kept or disposed of, requesting information from the bodies using surveillance measures, reporting to the Parliament, and making recommendations on the work of the competent bodies. It could also inform individuals, under certain conditions, that unlawful surveillance measures had been applied in respect of them.",

It reiterates that, in view of the risk of abuse intrinsic to any system of secret surveillance, such surveillance measures must be based on a law that is particularly precise. It is essential to have clear, detailed rules on the subject (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, \u00a7 75, with further references). Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any discretion conferred on the authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Amann v.

In the instant case, however, the Court observes that the procedure for authorising the surveillance measures against the first applicant was surrounded by uncertainty. It notes, for example, that the surveillance was planned and carried out by two of the first applicant\u2019s inferiors, Mr S.B. and Mr I.I. It is common ground between the parties that those officers were not heads of services listed in the SSMA as vested with the power to request and deploy covert surveillance (see paragraphs 32, 50 and 51 above). In the present case, however, the national authorities left it unclear whether, in the absence of prescribed competence, the decision of these officers to act had been compliant with the requirements of the national law. They also failed to examine whether in these circumstances it had been open to the  to issue the requested warrants. While the domestic law clearly limited the grounds on which a permission for secret surveillance could be granted, the material made available to the Court reveals little information about the facts giving rise to those officers\u2019 suspicions against the first applicant and their justification. The Government failed to clarify this issue. It is also to be noted that Mr S.B. and Mr I.I. requested the Minister\u2019s authorisation eleven days after the deployment of the monitoring and not \u201cimmediately\u201d, as the statutory procedure required (see paragraphs 9, 22 and 33 above). Although the lawfulness of the surveillance under the national law was not fully examined by the domestic courts, the lack of clarity which emerges from the present case as to the circumstances in which the use of surveillance measures may be requested and granted, the persons who have the authority to request such measures, and their powers and obligations, sits ill, in the Court\u2019s opinion, with the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8 and the Court\u2019s case-law, according to which the relevant law must lay down with reasonable clarity the essential elements of the authorities\u2019 powers in the domain of secret surveillance (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, \u00a7 79, Series A no. 82).",

In the present case, it notes that although criminal proceedings were instituted against the responsible officers, the court dealing with that case had a limited power of review in that it had to determine whether the officers had committed a criminal offence and not whether the requirements of the covert surveillance legislation had been strictly complied with (see paragraph 54 above). The Court has already intimated that the domestic courts did not deal with the first applicant\u2019s allegations of unlawfulness in so far as they were not relevant to the charges against the two officers (see paragraph 59 above). The , which examined the lawfulness of the two officers\u2019 dismissal, apparently limited its assessment to their compliance with the rules of discipline (see paragraph\u00a011 above).

The Court, seeing that the amendment was introduced some eleven years after the covert surveillance in respect of the first applicant, observes that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case.
