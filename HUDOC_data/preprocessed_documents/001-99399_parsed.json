The Court reiterates in this connection that it decided to strike a number of applications out of its list of cases where, in deportation and extradition contexts, the applicants were granted residence permits for the purpose of asylum or pending their resettlement in a third country (see, for example, Carmen Emilia Rojas Arenas v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 1989/07, 6 September 2007, and N.M. v. Turkey, (dec.), no.\u00a042175/05, 17 March 2008). The Court considered in those cases that at the relevant time there was no imminent risk of the applicants being deported and the alleged risk of treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 materialising, since the applicants were not subject to deportation. In the present case, however, the residence permits were not granted following or pending an examination of the applicant's claims regarding the alleged risks that she would face in , and were valid for a short period of time. Besides, the Government did not submit that these residence permits were renewable. Finally, the applicant's request for the renewal of her residence permit is being examined by the authorities. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant is still at risk of being removed to Iran despite the fact that she was legally resident in Turkey until 7 April 2010. Therefore, the Court must examine whether the applicant would be exposed to a risk of treatment in breach of Article 3 if she were now to be deported to Iran, her country of origin.",

Even assuming that the decision to reject the applicant's petition was given in line with the UNHCR's first decision also to reject her asylum request, the Court observes that the UNHCR reopened the applicant's file and re-interviewed the applicant about the background to her asylum request, whereas the national authorities planned the applicant's deportation to Iran while the case which she had lodged for the annulment of the deportation decision was pending before the Ankara Administrative Court. Therefore, the Court is not persuaded by the Government's argument that the national authorities conducted a meaningful assessment of the applicant's claim.",
