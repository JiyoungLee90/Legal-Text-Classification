The case originated in an application (no. 7097/11) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Hungarian nationals, Mr Róbert Kis and Ms Laura Boza (“the applicants”), on 25 January 2011.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 7 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1959 and live in Budapest.
On 27 October 2003 the applicants started labour-law litigation concerning their resignation and its legal and pecuniary consequences. On 21 May 2009 the Budapest Labour Court gave judgment, partly finding for the plaintiffs. On appeal, on 9 June 2010 the Budapest Regional Court reversed part of the decision. On 18 January 2012 the Kúria upheld the second-instance decision.
