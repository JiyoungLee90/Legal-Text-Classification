While the fact that those applicants had established their home in the dormitory building without legal grounds was relevant for the assessment of the proportionality of their eviction, as was the availability of alternative accommodation, the Court considers that the domestic courts did not give sufficient weight to those applicants\u2019 particular circumstances. Their eviction was sought, whereas their husbands and minor children were allowed to stay in the disputed accommodation. In particular, the case material indicated that each family occupied a room, and that in the event of the adult female applicants being evicted, their husbands and children would continue to occupy the same space per family. The Treasury did not claim before the domestic courts that those rooms would be allocated to someone else, or that third parties could be moved into the space created by the eviction of the adult female applicants. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the national courts failed to balance the competing rights and therefore to determine the proportionality of the interference with the adult female applicants\u2019 right to respect for their home.",

The Convention does not allow, in my view, any other form (Articles 37 and 39 imply that the \u201cdispute\u201d has disappeared) of judicial settlement of disputes. The use of the C\u00e2mpeanu solution quite simply leaves one or more complaints without any judicial examination on the pretext that one of the questions, classified by the Court in its discretion as the \u201cmain\u201d one, has already been addressed. With all due respect, I am of the view that this is tantamount to a denial of justice, especially as this reasoning is incompatible with our case-law when it comes to national courts. Our Court does oblige them, by contrast, to examine \u201cwith particular rigour and care\u201d the submissions before them concerning Convention rights and freedoms (see Henry Kismoun v.
