It further submitted that the people depicted in the advertisements could not be unambiguously considered as resembling religious figures, but even if they were, that depiction was aesthetically pleasant and not disrespectful, unlike various kitschy and low-quality religious items typically sold in markets. It further contended that, in the absence of a State religion in Lithuania, the interests of one \ngroup\u00a0\u2013\u00a0practising Catholics\u00a0\u2013\u00a0could not be equated to those of the entire society.

The Supreme Administrative Court considered that the panel which had adopted the decision of 25\u00a0April\u00a02014 had taken into account the fact that Catholicism was the religion of a very big part of the Lithuanian population and that the use of its most important symbols in the advertisements, which distorted their meaning, offended the feelings of religious people.",

The Government acknowledged that Article 4 \u00a7 2 (1) did not prohibit the use of religious symbols or motifs in advertising per se, as that would be contrary to the principles of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness. However, they argued that morals could be based on religious views, especially taking into account the historic importance of Christianity in Lithuania and the number of Christians among the population (see paragraph 56 below). The Government thus argued that it should have been sufficiently clear to the applicant company that advertisements which insulted the feelings of religious people were contrary to Article 4 \u00a7 2 (1) of the Law on Advertising. The Government also submitted that the subsequent amendment of that provision, establishing an explicit prohibition of expressing contempt for religious symbols in advertising (see paragraph\u00a035 above), had been initiated by the Lithuanian Bishops Conference and had been necessary to make the Law stricter and to serve \u201ca preventive function\u201d.",

The applicant company submitted that approximately a hundred individuals who had complained about the advertisements (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 17 above) could not be considered representative of the approximately 77% of the Lithuanian population who considered themselves Catholic; furthermore, the public reaction to the advertisements had not been uniform \u2013 several public figures and scholars had expressed their support to the advertisements and disappointment with the domestic court decisions. The applicant company thus argued that the small number of complaints had not been indicative of the overall sentiment of the population, and thus the interference with its right to freedom of expression could not be justified by the need to protect public morals.

It appears that the applicant company\u2019s case was the first in which the domestic courts applied the concept of public morals to the use of religious symbols in advertising \u2013 the courts examining the case did not refer to any previous domestic case-law and nor did the parties provide any examples of such case-law to the Court (compare and contrast M\u00fcller and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a029). The Court acknowledges that the very fact that the applicant company\u2019s case was the first of its kind does not, as such, make the interpretation of the law unforeseeable, as there must come a day when a given legal norm is applied for the first time (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0114-15, and Perin\u00e7ek, \u00a7\u00a0138, both cited above).

The Court cannot stay blind to the fact that, while the applicant company\u2019s case was still ongoing, the national authorities felt the need to amend the Law on Advertising in order to establish an explicit prohibition on advertising which expressed \u201ccontempt for religious symbols\u201d (see paragraph\u00a035 above). It takes note of the applicant company\u2019s argument that such an amendment would not have been necessary had the prohibition of inappropriate use or contempt for religious symbols been established in Article\u00a04\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02\u00a0(1) with sufficient foreseeability (see paragraph\u00a059 above).",

It has consistently held that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on matters of public interest (see Baka v.

Ireland, no. 44179/98, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2003IX (extracts)). Similarly, States have a broad margin of appreciation in the regulation of speech in commercial matters or advertising (see markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v.\u00a0Germany, 20 November 1989, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0165; Hertel, cited above, \u00a7 47; and Mouvement ra\u00eblien Suisse, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061).",

In the Court\u2019s view, such statements were declarative and vague, and did not sufficiently explain why the reference to religious symbols in the advertisements was offensive, other than for the very fact that it had been done for non-religious purposes (see, mutatis mutandis, Giniewski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52-53, and Terentyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a025147/09, \u00a7\u00a022, 26\u00a0January 2017; compare and contrast Balsyt\u0117Lideikien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080). It also observes that none of the authorities addressed the applicant company\u2019s argument that the names of Jesus and Mary in the advertisements had been used not as religious references but as emotional interjections common in spoken Lithuanian, thereby creating a comic effect (see paragraphs 14, 17, 20 and 24 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Vereinigung Bildender K\u00fcnstler v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a068354/01, \u00a7\u00a033, 25\u00a0January\u00a02007), although it appears that those emotional interjections must have been known to them.",

The Court observes that even though all the domestic decisions referred to \u201creligious people\u201d, the only religious group which had been consulted in the domestic proceedings had been the Roman Catholic Church (see paragraph 16 above), despite the presence of various other Christian and non-Christian religious communities in Lithuania (see paragraphs 38, 39 and 56 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the Constitutional Court of Lithuania has held that \u201cno views or ideology may be declared mandatory and thrust on an individual\u201d and that the State \u201cdoes not have any right to establish a mandatory system of views\u201d (see paragraph 45 above). It also draws attention to the position of the United Nations Human Rights Committee that limitations of rights for the purpose of protecting morals must be based on principles not deriving exclusively from a single tradition (see paragraph 48 above).",

However, the Court reiterates that freedom of expression also extends to ideas which offend, shock or disturb (see the references provided in paragraph 70 above). It also reiterates that in a pluralist democratic society those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion cannot reasonably expect to be exempt from all criticism. They must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith (see OttoPreminger-Institut, \u00a7 47, and \u0130.A. v.\u00a0Turkey, \u00a7 28, both cited above; see also the position of the Venice Commission in paragraph 49 above). In the Court\u2019s view, even though the advertisements had a commercial purpose and cannot be said to constitute \u201ccriticism\u201d of religious ideas (see paragraph\u00a076 above), the applicable principles are nonetheless similar (in this connection see in particular the findings of the domestic authorities that the advertisements \u201cencourage[d] a frivolous attitude towards the ethical values of the Christian faith\u201d in paragraph\u00a018 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, it cannot be assumed that everyone who has indicated that he or she belongs to the Christian faith would necessarily consider the advertisements offensive, and the Government have not provided any evidence to the contrary. Nonetheless, even assuming that the majority of the Lithuanian population were indeed to find the advertisements offensive, the Court reiterates that it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority.

It should be clear from paragraphs 79 to 83 of the judgment that the problem in this case was the insufficiency of the reasons provided by the domestic courts in their considerations upholding the SCRPA\u2019s decision. This judgment does not give carte blanche to the use of religious symbols, whatever the medium, context or message intended or tending to be conveyed, whether directly or otherwise. As was stated in \u00a7\u00a026 of \u0130.A. v. Turkey (no. 42571/98, \u00a7 26, ECHR 2005-VIII), a \u201cState may ... legitimately consider it necessary to take measures aimed at repressing certain form of conduct, including the imparting of information and ideas, judged incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of others...\u201d. In the instant case, however, there was nothing in the three adverts in question (which, incidentally, can still be viewed online) which could, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered as either offensive, much less as amounting to any form of vilification of religion or religious symbols, and which could be construed as justifying an interference \u201cfor the protection of ... the rights of others\u201d. The fact that the head of the male figure bore some resemblance to the way in which the image of Christ is depicted in classical art, and the use of the words \u201cJesus\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d (see paragraphs 7-9 of the judgment) cannot conceivably, by or of themselves, or in combination, be regarded as violating \u201cpublic morals\u201d. Moreover, the very fact that both the male and the female figure in the adverts displayed tattoos should have been indicative that those figures could not be considered as representations of the historical Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary \u2013 see Leviticus 19:28. This point does not appear to have been given appropriate weight by anyone.",

What is even more surprising is that the \u201cwarning\u201d, as it were, by the President of the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph\u00a026) was dismissed for reasons which appear to be totally detached from reality (see paragraphs 28 and 29).",
