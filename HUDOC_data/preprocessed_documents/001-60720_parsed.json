They said in particular that the applicant and his accomplices had not directly menaced them and that they had only been frightened as the applicant and his co-accused clearly asked for money and announced that they would return. Although the witnesses now tried to describe the incidents at issue as favourably to the accused as possible and although their statements were insufficient for a conviction, they had disproved the defence of the applicant who had claimed that he had only come to the respective restaurants to distribute posters without ever having requested donations.

However, in its reasoning, the trial court makes clear reference to a number of circumstances  duly supported by the evidence in the case file \u2013 which meant that the suspicion attaching to the applicant had not been entirely dispelled.

The Court finds that this is an artificial interpretation of the Sekanina judgment, which would moreover not be in line with the general aim of the presumption of innocence which is to protect the accused against any judicial decision or other statements by State officials amounting to an assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt without him having previously been proved guilty according to law (see the Allenet de Ribemont v. France judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, \u00a7 35, with further references). The Court cannot but affirm the general rule stated in the Sekanina judgment that, following a final acquittal, even the voicing of suspicions regarding an accused\u2019s innocence is no longer admissible. The Court, thus, considers that once an acquittal has become final \u2013 be it an acquittal giving the accused the benefit of the doubt in accordance with Article 6 \u00a7 2 \u2013 the voicing of any suspicions of guilt, including those expressed in the reasons for the acquittal, is incompatible with the presumption of innocence.\u201d",
