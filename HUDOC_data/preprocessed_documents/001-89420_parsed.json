The focus of concern was the potential danger that these groups could pose to adolescents\u2019 personal development and social relations, which could lead not only to their dropping out of school and vocational training, radical changes in personality, various forms of dependence, lack of initiative and difficulties in communication, often aggravated by the group structure characteristic of certain communities, but also to material loss and psychological harm.",

However, they maintained that the dispute in question did not concern the determination of the applicant associations\u2019 civil rights within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that, under its case-law, the concept of \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d cannot be interpreted solely by reference to the domestic law of the respondent State. On several occasions, the Court has affirmed the principle that these concepts are \u201cautonomous\u201d, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, K\u00f6nig v. Germany, judgment of 28 June 1978, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a027, \u00a7\u00a7 88-89, and Maaouia v. France (dec.), no.\u00a039652/98, ECHR 1999II). Accordingly, whether or not a right is to be regarded as \u201ccivil\u201d must be determined in an autonomous way by reference to the substantive content and effects of the right \u2013 and not only its legal classification \u2013 under the domestic law of the State concerned (see K\u00f6nig, cited above, \u00a7\u00a089).",

Italy, judgment of 26 February 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0257E, \u00a7\u00a019, and Wo\u015b v.

In this context, the Court draws attention to its established case-law as to the \u201ccivil\u201d character of the right to enjoy a good reputation (see Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no.\u00a0212A, p.\u00a014, \u00a7\u00a027, and Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 July 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0316B, \u00a7\u00a058). Furthermore, the Court has recently held that the right to use state-owned premises for religious ceremonies had to be considered as directly decisive for the respective applicant\u2019s \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d, thus leading to the applicability of Article 6 (see Tserkva Sela Sosulivka v. Ukraine, no.\u00a037878/02, \u00a7\u00a042, 28 February 2008).",

Article 9 lists a number of forms which manifestation of one\u2019s religion or belief may take, namely, worship, teaching, practice and observance. Furthermore, it includes in principle the right to try to convince one\u2019s neighbour, for example through \u201cteaching\u201d, failing which, moreover, \u201cfreedom to change [one\u2019s] religion or belief\u201d, enshrined in Article 9, would be likely to remain a dead letter (see, amongst many authorities, Kokkinakis v.

Nor does the mere fact that such a provision is capable of more than one construction mean that it fails to meet the requirement of \u201cforeseeability\u201d for the purposes of the Convention. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice (see Gorzelik, cited above, \u00a7 65, and Kafkaris v.

The contested statements and the other material before the Court show that the German Government, by providing people in good time with explanations it considered useful at that time, was aiming to settle a burning public issue and attempting to warn citizens against phenomena it viewed as disturbing, for example, the appearance of numerous new religious movements and their attraction for young people. The public authorities wished to enable people, if necessary, to take care of themselves and not to land themselves or others in difficulties solely on account of lack of knowledge.",

The remaining terms, notably the naming of the applicant associations\u2019 groups as \u201csects\u201d , \u201cyouth sects\u201d or \u201cpsycho-sects\u201d, even if they had a pejorative note, were used at the material time quite indiscriminately for any kind of non-mainstream religion. The Court further notes that the Government undisputedly refrained from further using the term \u201csect\u201d in their information campaign following the recommendation contained in the expert report on \u201cso-called sects and psycho-cults\u201d issued in 1998 (see paragraph 32, above). Under these circumstances, the Court considers that the Government\u2019s statements as delimited by the Federal Constitutional Court, at least at the time they were made, did not entail overstepping the bounds of what a democratic State may regard as the public interest.",

The Respondent Government failed to demonstrate that the \u201cneed to secure religious pluralism\u201d had been taken into consideration at any time before or during the impugned information campaign.

In my opinion the observation that \u201cby providing people with explanations it considered useful at the time... the German Government ... was aiming to settle a burning public issue and attempting to warn citizens against phenomena it viewed as disturbing\u201d (paragraph 94) does not suffice to conclude that the interference was in pursuit of or proportional to any of the legitimate aims under Article 9\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention.",

A State duty to impart information on subjects of public concern may be reasonably interpreted as relevant in the event of urgent and objective risks such as imminent calamities and the like, which beliefs as such may hardly be considered to constitute. Furthermore, formulating such a duty in general terms provides no clarity or foreseeability as regards \u201cthe field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed\u201d (see, among many other authorities, Hasan and Chaush v.
