There, the Court observed that a constitutional complaint could be recognised as an effective domestic remedy, within the meaning of the Convention, only where the following requirements were jointly met: 1) the individual decision, which allegedly violated the Convention, had been adopted in direct application of an unconstitutional provision of national legislation; and 2) procedural regulations applicable to the revision of that type of individual decisions provided for the reopening of the case or the quashing of the final decision in consequence of the judgment of the Constitutional Court in which a finding of unconstitutionality had been made (see also Pachla v.
