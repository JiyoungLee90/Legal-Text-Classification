This placed the applicant at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis her opponent, thus impairing the very essence of her right of access to court in breach of the fair trial guarantee embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 1.

The findings reached above (paragraphs 41-45) do not mean that the public prosecutor\u2019s office should refrain from resuming criminal proceedings where an action for damages stemming from a previous termination of proceedings has been lodged. Nor do they mean that a decision to terminate criminal proceedings cannot be reversed. However, the principles of legal certainty enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention require such decisions to be based on well-established criteria, accompanied by terms and safeguards to prevent\u00a0potential abuse of process in relation to the resumption of criminal proceedings. As already noted (see paragraph 44 above) despite legislative attempts to amend the impugned provisions (see paragraph 28 above), Bulgarian law does not provide for such safeguards. That fact distinguishes the present case from the situation which obtained in Withey, cited above, where the Court observed that any application to resurrect the proceedings was made to a court which considered the application from the standpoint of certain criteria including the fairness of the re-opening. Nevertheless, in the case at hand the Court cannot share the applicant\u2019s misgivings about the reasons for the resumption of the criminal proceedings against her. In particular, it is not for the Court to determine whether there were genuine shortcomings in the initial investigation which justified the resumption of the criminal proceedings. Nor, as noted earlier, can it speculate as to whether the criminal proceedings were resumed in \u201cretaliation\u201d for the applicant\u2019s action for damages or in order to stifle it.",

However, I do not agree that no pertinent reasons were given for reopening the lower prosecutor\u2019s decision. The Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office found that the decision of the lower prosecutor was incorrect. That decision was based on an incomplete pre-trial investigation and the conclusions reached did not correspond to the evidence. It was pointed out that the key witness had not been questioned. The criticism of the regional prosecutor\u2019s decision was justified and confirmed by the national courts since the applicant was ultimately convicted. In my opinion the higher prosecutor\u2019s decision to resume the proceedings was based on appropriate reasons. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the decision to resume the proceedings was taken nine months after the decision to terminate them. The applicant was not left in a state of uncertainty for an unacceptable length of time.",
