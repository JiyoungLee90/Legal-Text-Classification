Her detention in Braunschweig Police Station, with little possibility to move, had already led to her joints having stiffened.

She was further allowed to go out for a walk for less than one hour on 8 November 2008 and for thirteen minutes on 9 November 2008 in the outdoor area of the Braunschweig Police Station.

In the present case, the police shackled the applicant in order to prevent her from absconding, given that she was an excellent climber and had previously failed to comply with the police\u2019s orders (see paragraphs 8\u00a0and 20 above), including orders to descend from the arch of a railway bridge and from her cell\u2019s cupboard. In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the authorities could reasonably consider it necessary to shackle the applicant as the Braunschweig Police Station did not dispose of a closed courtyard. Moreover, it has not been demonstrated that the applicant, when taken for a walk on the premises of the police station while being shackled, was subject to any unnecessary public exposure.",
