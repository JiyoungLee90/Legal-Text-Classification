They noted H's strong fear and suspicions in respect of the applicant and his intentions. H seemed to fear that the meetings between the applicant and his daughter would cause physical or psychological harm to the child or her new family. In the explosive situation at hand it would be difficult to organise the visits in an atmosphere which could be beneficial to the child.

The officials had intended to request investigations by the Family Advice Clinic (perheneuvola, familjer\u00e5dgivningen) but H had already contacted a private child psychiatrist (Dr V), on whose preliminary opinion she had relied early on, refusing to comply with the interim access arrangements. She had categorically refused to accept any such access, even when it had been proposed to organise the meetings at the Family Advice Centre in the presence of a police officer. She had feared for her own and the child's safety and had considered that access would not be in the child's best interests. She had not wanted any information about the child to be given to the applicant. She had referred to his criminal record, the 1990 opinion on his mental health and the threats he had addressed to her family. The social welfare official had concluded that the parents' relationship was negative and filled with hatred. The applicant had been contacted by telephone and letter as he had found it unnecessary to attend a meeting with the social welfare officials. Occasionally, he had been very aggressive and threatening towards the officials. The Family Advice Centre's summary concluded that in the light of the information available at the time the Helsinki Social Welfare Board had been unable to formulate any clear proposal to the Kuopio District Court in respect of access rights.",

The fact that the child had never met the applicant could therefore be seen as a weighty reason for ordering the child to be brought. On the other hand, such a measure could not be the right way for the child to get to know the applicant. Instead the child was to be given a possibility to get to know him gradually in conditions where she would feel that this would happen on a voluntary basis. The District Court therefore concluded that there were no weighty reasons militating in favour of escorting the child to meetings and ordered that a professional supervisor as well as H and/or another person close to the child should attend the child's meetings with the applicant for six months. The applicant had agreed to those changes. The District Court ordered H to comply with the modified arrangements on pain of a further administrative fine, this time automatically staggered in view of the special reasons at hand. The amount of the fine was FIM 10,000 at the outset, to be increased by FIM 2,000 for each of the three forthcoming meetings between I and the applicant with which H would refuse to comply (in May, July and September 1998).",

Although H failed to produce samples emanating from herself and I, the court adjourned its hearing for a further period of four months, having imposed a further fine should she persist in her refusal to cooperate. Having obtained the necessary samples by the time of its hearing in September 1994, the City Court adjourned the case for three months pending the receipt of the opinions of the Kuopio and Helsinki social authorities on the question of access. In December 1994 the City Court confirmed the paternity of the child but adjourned consideration of the custody and access issues for six months in view of the Helsinki Social Welfare Board's request for an extension of the time allowed for its opinion.

In so far as the non-enforcement had been due to H's non-compliance with the court orders, the Government could not be answerable for her behaviour. The Government accepted that her refusal to bring I to the meeting with the conciliators at the beginning of 1997, despite her own suggestion that the child should be heard, had contributed to the unsuccessful outcome of the conciliation and the entire proceedings. However, the applicant had also hampered the enforcement attempts by failing to cooperate with the authorities in order to find a solution which would have been \u201cworking and positive from the child's point of view\u201d and based on an investigation which would have been \u201cas reliable and impartial as possible\u201d.

In October 1991 the applicant had again threatened H and her parents. The Government considered the applicant to suffer from serious psychological problems, including a mixed personality disorder, as shown, for instance, by his aggressiveness and difficulties in controlling his behaviour towards the conciliators. While preparing their pleadings to the Commission the Government had obtained more detailed information proving that the applicant's threatening and aggressive behaviour towards H and her resultant fears had constituted reasoned grounds for the non-enforcement of the access arrangements. According to this information, the applicant's mental health problems had again become acute in 1996, when he had been prescribed medication against his depression and insomnia but had refused to accept psychiatric treatment. The Government alluded to conciliator R.C.'s observations to the Helsinki District Court of 9 March 1998 in which she observed that the applicant had been giving incorrect information about his mental health and development. In the Government's view the applicant had thereby contributed to the fact that the access arrangements had not been subjected to stricter conditions at the outset. Such further restrictions could have diminished H's fears and suspicions, which were understandable and partly justified. Once it had been established that the courts had not had correct information at their disposal when ordering and upholding the initial access arrangements in 1995, the Helsinki District Court, on 7 April 1997, tried to increase H's willingness to comply with the court orders by placing the meetings under supervision by a professionally trained person and authorising H or a person of her choosing to attend them. By imposing automatically staggered fines the court also sought to have H cooperate, bearing in mind her strongly negative attitude towards conciliation and enforcement. The revocation of the access rights in April 1998 was based on the consistent opinions of the Helsinki Social Welfare Authority and Drs\u00a0O.H. and V as well as on the oral statements of H before the District Court. At any rate, the enforcement possibilities had always been limited because otherwise the applicant's daughter would have been subjected to situations which would have been \u201cunreasonable\u201d for her.

While prepared to make certain allowances for the frustration which the applicant must have experienced after several unsuccessful enforcement attempts, the Commission noted that he had repeatedly behaved in an inappropriate and even aggressive manner towards social welfare officials and conciliators. However, the Government's allusion to the applicant's criminal past and his mental health which could have endangered the child's development had already been examined in the initial custody and access proceedings resulting in very limited access. Moreover, in April 1997 the District Court had found that the fresh evidence regarding the applicant's mental state did not show that enforcement of the access arrangements would be contrary to the child's interests, bearing in mind the limited access and the meeting premises. The Commission concluded, however, that in the continuous reassessment of the child's best interests the District Court could reasonably consider it justified to revoke the access rights in April 1998.

Moreover, in its decision of 7\u00a0April 1997 the Helsinki District Court found that the fresh evidence regarding the applicant's mental state did not show that enforcement of the access arrangements would be contrary to the child's interests, bearing in mind the limited access and the meeting premises. The Court considers, however, that in the continuous reassessment of the child's best interests the social authorities in Helsinki could, notably in the light of the applicant's more recent unwillingness to cooperate, reasonably formulate a recommendation that the access rights should be revoked until the child had reached a more mature age. Likewise the Helsinki District Court's decision to revoke the access rights in April 1998 cannot be considered unreasonable.",

Needless to say, finality of judgment without its enforcement remains mere suggestion. In its judgment in Hornsby v. Greece (judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, pp. 510-11, \u00a7 40) this Court indeed reiterated that the \u201cright to a court\u201d embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention does not only include the right to institute civil proceedings. That right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed for a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see the Hornsby judgment cited above).",

In property law, the uncertainty of the situation, during which the legally questionable possession nevertheless continues, may last for years. Once, however, the rei vindicatio is finally resolved, the object of dispute is physically returned to the rightful owner.

However, she was eventually relieved of paying the first fine and the last-mentioned fine was waived following the revocation of the child's access rights in April 1998. The District Court, again sitting in a different composition, had by then become convinced that the mother's fear of the applicant was genuine, thus explaining why she had consistently refused to let the child meet him even under supervision.",

It may also be true that he repeatedly behaved in an inappropriate and even aggressive manner towards the social welfare officials and the conciliators investigating the matter. We are nonetheless prepared to make certain allowances for the frustration which he must undoubtedly have experienced after the unsuccessful enforcement attempts which, around that time, had lasted some three years. It is important to recall that in early 1997 the applicant had consented to various modifications of the access arrangements requested by the mother, only to see her persist in her defiance of the court orders. Moreover, even though it was the mother who was clearly at fault for refusing to bring the child to the meetings, the Helsinki Social Welfare Authority began to question whether it was still in the child's best interests to meet her biological father. Reference was made, in particular, to his aggressiveness towards social welfare officials and to his refusal to attend meetings with them. At no stage during the social authorities' and the conciliators' investigations in 1997 was the child interviewed alone with a view to ascertaining her genuine attitude towards the applicant. When questioning the applicant's abilities to relate to his child the social authorities and experts relied in part on the fact that no meeting had ever taken place between the two. ",

Moreover, in its decision of 7\u00a0April 1997 the Helsinki District Court found that the fresh evidence regarding the applicant's mental state did not show that enforcement of the access arrangements would be contrary to the best interests of the child, bearing in mind the limited access and the way it was to be implemented. This finding was concordant with the Helsinki Social Welfare Authority's opinion of 29 May 1995, which stressed that the child would eventually benefit from getting to know the applicant's good and bad features.",

In the 1996 Act the legislator placed particular weight on the best interests of the child. The conciliator or a representative of the social welfare authority must therefore be present during that procedure, which can only be ordered for one meeting at a time. The conciliator must request the presence of a person close to the child and, if necessary, that of a physician or another expert. All measures must be carried out to minimise the shock to the child.

It is true that any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, given the need to take into account the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8. Nonetheless, the possibility of employing coercive measures cannot be wholly excluded when the child's interests are deemed to coincide with those of the parent who, without enjoying custody, wishes to create a relationship with the child (see Ignaccolo-Zenide cited above, \u00a7 106).",

What is more, the ongoing reassessment of the child's best interests took place in both civil and enforcement proceedings pending simultaneously before different compositions of the same tribunal but essentially bearing on identical and in part already examined evidence. The applicant was thus required to have constant recourse to a succession of time-consuming and ultimately ineffectual remedies to enforce the access rights granted to his daughter (see the Hokkanen v. Finland judgment, p. 23, \u00a7 61). Such a state of affairs effectively set in motion a process which proved to be irreversible: maintaining and enforcing the child's right to meet with the applicant was no longer deemed to be in her best interests, given the lack of any physical interaction between the two (see, mutatis mutandis, the Keegan v.

In the end, moreover, the State's postulating of legal criteria in substantive family law, such as the best interests of the child, means little, unless, procedurally, judicial decisions applying them are consistently respected. Apart from not even attempting to fetch the child, the question remains open whether the Finnish State has done everything possible to protect not only the father's parental rights but first and foremost his daughter's right to meet with him, different court compositions having found this to be in her best interests. We recall that in Ignaccolo-Zenide one of the elements leading this very Court to find a violation of Article 8 was the authorities' failure to take coercive measures against the parent at fault (see paragraph 105 of the judgment cited above). The present case leads us to query whether a parent's refusal to participate in ensuring his or her child's access rights in respect of the other parent should not be regarded as a criminal offence or at least as contempt of court.
