Furthermore, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s arguments that the applicant should be held responsible for amending his claims, requesting an expert opinion and lodging appeals. It has been the Court\u2019s constant approach that an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by the national law in the defence of his interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v.

In any event, the fact that the domestic courts heard the case several times did not absolve them from complying with the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Litoselitis v. , no.\u00a062771/00, \u00a7 32, 5 February 2004).",
