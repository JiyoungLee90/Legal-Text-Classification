The applicant was represented by Mr\u00a0Z.\u00a0Kaday\u0131f\u00e7\u0131, a lawyer practising in Hatay. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent. On 30 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).",

On 20\u00a0May 2005 the Tekirda\u011f Court of First Instance delivered two separate judgments and annulled 83,36 square meters and 71,02 square meters of the respective plots on the ground that they were situated on the coastline which could not be subject to private ownership. The court further ordered the demolition of any constructions thereon. The Court of Cassation upheld the judgments on 5 May 2006 and 24 May 2006 respectively. The applicant\u2019s requests for rectification were rejected on 13 November 2006.",

It further notes the absence of sample domestic judgments where compensation has been awarded in similar situations. Accordingly the Court holds that the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is admissible, there being no grounds upon which to decide otherwise. The Court further finds no reason to depart from the conclusions on the merits of the cases cited above. Accordingly, it concludes that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the succinct reasoning given by the Court of Cassation was sufficient in the circumstances to comply with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (Helle v. Finland, 19 December 1997, \u00a7 56, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII).\u00a0It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 and 4 of the Convention.",

Turkey (just satisfaction), no.\u00a026338/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a023-24, 31 May 2005). It therefore deems it appropriate to fix a lump sum (see, for example, Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0254-259, ECHR 2006-..., Stornaiuolo v. Italy, no.\u00a052980/99, \u00a7\u00a7 82-91, 8\u00a0August 2006, and Do\u011frus\u00f6z and Aslan v. Turkey, no.\u00a01262/02, \u00a7 38, 30\u00a0May 2006, \u00a7\u00a036). Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant EUR\u00a0120,000 for pecuniary damage. As regards the applicant\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damages, the Court finds that, in the circumstances of the present case, the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction (see Do\u011frus\u00f6z and Aslan, cited above, and Adil \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 36531/02, \u00a7 42, 10\u00a0May 2007). Additionally, on the basis of the documents in its possession, the Court awards the applicant EUR 2,000 in respect of costs and expenses. The Court further considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.",
