On the other hand, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the execution of the judgment called for clarification and amendment of the original text. The Court considers that the delays that resulted from those actions are attributable to the domestic judicial authorities. Furthermore, the fact that the enforcement proceedings at the material time were so complex does not relieve the State of its obligation to act in accordance with the principles cited above. In particular, once the authorities were in possession of the writ of execution, it was open to them to adopt a more practical approach and to forward the document to the responsible body.
