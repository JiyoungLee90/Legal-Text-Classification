It was only the subsequent amendment in 1998 of Article 67d of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 1a (3) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraph 23 above), which abolished that maximum duration with immediate effect and thus allowed also a first order of preventive detention to be executed for an indefinite period.",
