Other factors, especially those relating to his or her character, morals, home, occupation, assets, family ties and all kinds of links with the country in which he or she is being prosecuted may either confirm the existence of a risk of absconding, or make it appear so small that it cannot justify detention pending trial. However, the risk of absconding necessarily decreases as the time spent in detention passes by, because the likelihood that the period spent in custody will be deducted from the prison sentence which the detainee may expect if convicted is likely to make the prospect of prison less daunting and reduce his temptation to flee (see Neumeister v.\u00a0Austria, 27 June 1968, \u00a7 10, Series A no. 8).",
