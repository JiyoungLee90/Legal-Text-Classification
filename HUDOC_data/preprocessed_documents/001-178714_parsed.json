It is defined by the type of expression at issue and, in this respect, it is reiterated that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debates on questions of public interest. The margin is also narrowed by the strong interest of a democratic society in the press exercising its vital role as a public watchdog: freedom of the press and other news media affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion on the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. It is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on subjects of public interest, and the public also has a right to receive them (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a048876/08, \u00a7\u00a0102, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).",

The burden of proof in this respect was impossible to discharge. Furthermore, the impugned expression, although sarcastic, remained within the acceptable degree of stylistic exaggeration employed to express the journalist\u2019s value judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, OOO\u00a0Izdatelskiy Tsentr Kvartirnyy Ryad v.

The Court would also note that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the right to freedom of expression (see Jersild, cited above, \u00a7 35). In this connection, the Court notes that notwithstanding the minor nature of the sanctions imposed on the applicant company, they were capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debates over matters of legitimate public concern. In view of the above, the Court considers that the domestic courts overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation afforded to them in relation to restrictions on debates of public interest.
