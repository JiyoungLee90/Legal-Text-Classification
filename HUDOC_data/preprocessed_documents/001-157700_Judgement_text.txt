The case originated in an application (no. 25749/10) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Attila Csák (“the applicant”), on 29 April 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr F. Karsay, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 8 January 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Budapest.
On 14 March 1997 the applicant was interrogated as suspect of breach of duty and other offences.
In the ensuing criminal proceedings, after a remittal, the Budapest Regional Court acquitted the applicant on 5 November 2008.
On appeal, the Budapest Regional Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal on 26 November 2009.
The applicant lodged a petition for review; but the Supreme Court rejected the motion on 13 December 2010.
