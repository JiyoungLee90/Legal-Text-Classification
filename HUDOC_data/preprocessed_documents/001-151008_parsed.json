T.E.P. and M.M.K. could not be heard as witnesses by the court.

Having regard to the conflicting witness and co-defendant statements, the court decided to rely on those testimonies which had been confirmed by the other evidence available in the file. Consequently, it considered that the testimonies given by the witnesses and the co-defendant at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings were accurate as they had been made closer to the date of the unlawful acts and had also been corroborated by the remaining available evidence.

Moreover, he contended that some witnesses, including A.P., G.C., O.P., had not been heard directly by the first-instance court and that the court had not provided reasons for its failure to hear them. Also, the address on the summons intended for I.I.C. had been incomplete. The summons had been sent to a town in the county of Neam\u021b, even though the Neam\u0163 Population Records Office had stated that the witness was not registered there. The courts had failed to hear other witnesses as well, including C.Z., and to take measures to bring those witnesses before them. Consequently, he asked the court to quash the judgments of the lower courts and to order a review of all the evidence in the file.",

It held that the lower courts had correctly established the facts of the case and the applicant\u2019s guilt on the basis of the evidence administered at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings and re-confirmed at the trial. The fact that the girls forced by him into prostitution had been summoned during the trial not as victims but as witnesses was not an argument the applicant could rely on as long as his personal interest had not been affected. As for the evidence establishing the facts of the case, the court reiterated the reasoning of the second-instance court. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s arguments that the court had failed to administer and examine directly all the evidence raised during the pre-trial stage of the proceedings, that his rights of defence had been breached and that the debate had not been adversarial were unsubstantiated. A court could rely either on the testimonies given at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings or on the ones given before the court if it was convinced that only some of them reflected the truth and were corroborated by the evidence in the file. A court could rely on the testimonies given at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings if it was impossible to hear the witness directly. A judgment could not be quashed on the grounds that a witness had not been heard directly by the court, unless a party had been prejudiced. In the present case, the lower courts had allowed the applicant\u2019s requests to hear the witnesses who had testified at the pretrial stage of the proceedings and had taken measures to secure their attendance at the trial. The judgments of the lower courts could not be quashed because they had provided reasons for their inability to hear some of the witnesses, namely that they had left the country, and the testimonies had been read out at a public hearing. Consequently, the lower courts had followed the correct procedure in establishing the applicant\u2019s guilt by using evidence collected both at the pre-trial and the trial stages of the proceedings.",

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Gabrielyan v.

Secondly, where the evidence of an absent witness was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction, sufficient counterbalancing factors were required, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, which permitted a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 147).",

This is because as a general rule witnesses should give evidence during the trial and all reasonable efforts should be made to secure their attendance.

Croatia, no. 5699/11, \u00a7 79, 27 February 2014), which means that they should actively search for the witnesses (see Rachdad v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a071846/01, \u00a7 24, 13 November 2003). The Court must therefore satisfy itself that the domestic authorities did everything reasonable to secure the presence of the witness.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that any waiver of the exercise of a right guaranteed by the Convention \u2013 in so far as such waiver is permitted in domestic law \u2013 must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Colozza v.
