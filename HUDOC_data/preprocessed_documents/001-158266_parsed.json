He later tried to contest that statement, claiming that he had not instructed the defence lawyer, M.R., that he had told the police officers that he wanted G.M. as his lawyer, that at the time he had been taken to the police station he had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and so on. However, this defence is not acceptable. The written record of arrest shows that Ivan Dvorski was arrested on 14 March 2007 at 9.50 a.m. at the Rijeka Police Station, and [M.]R., in favour of whom Ivan Dvorski signed the power of attorney, came to the police station on 14\u00a0March 2007 at 7.45 p.m. The written record of the questioning of the then suspect Ivan Dvorski shows that M.R. was informed at 6.15 p.m. and that the questioning started at 8.10 p.m. Besides the officers of the Rijeka Police, a typist and the defence lawyer of the then suspect Ivan Dvorski, the County State Attorney was also present during the questioning. The introductory part of the written record [indicates] that the then suspect Ivan Dvorski clearly stated that he had chosen and authorised M.R. to act as his defence lawyer and had consulted with him, after which he decided to give his statement. The written record is properly signed by the persons present. The first accused Ivan Dvorski had read the written record before signing it. Thus, the above shows without doubt that the contentions of Ivan Dvorski that he had not retained M.R. as his lawyer are unfounded. During the trial, at the request of Ivan Dvorski\u2019s defence, a handwriting expert gave her opinion regarding the signature of Ivan Dvorski on the written record of his questioning by the police. The expert opinion proved beyond any doubt that the contested signature was that of Ivan Dvorski. The panel accepts such findings in their entirety; the findings were further explained at a hearing by the expert Lj.Z. Her findings were given in an objective, impartial and professional manner. Therefore, the questioning of Ivan Dvorski by the police was carried out in compliance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

G.M.\u00a0therefore lodged an action in the Rijeka Municipal Court in respect of an unlawful act, as well as a request for the removal of the Rijeka County State Attorney and all his deputies. In that request he alleged that the first accused had not been given any food by the police from 13 March 2007 at 1 p.m., when he had been brought to the Rijeka Police Station, until he had agreed to be represented by M.R. on 14 March at about 7 p.m. so as to give a self-incriminating statement, which was in violation of Article 225 \u00a7 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Thus, Article 6 \u2013 especially paragraph 3 thereof \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is liable to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions. As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention is one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 36-37, Series A no.\u00a0275, and Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2008).",

The Court has also recognised that an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, and in most cases this can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer, whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure that the right of an accused not to incriminate himself is respected (ibid., \u00a7\u00a054; see also Pavlenko v. Russia, no. 42371/02, \u00a7 101, 1 April 2010).",

Estonia, no. 35985/09, \u00a7\u00a7 90 and 93, 30 May 2013). This follows from the very wording of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c), which guarantees that \u201c[e]veryone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ... to defend himself ... through legal assistance of his own choosing ...\u201d, and is generally recognised in international human rights standards as a mechanism for securing an effective defence to the accused. The Court emphasises that the fairness of proceedings requires that an accused should be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance (see Dayanan v. Turkey, no. 7377/03, \u00a7 32, 13 October 2009, and paragraph 108 below).",

It is necessarily subject to certain limitations where free legal aid is concerned and also where it is for the courts to decide whether the interests of justice require that the accused be defended by counsel appointed by them (see Croissant v. Germany, 25 September 1992, \u00a7\u00a029, Series A no.\u00a0237-B). The Court has consistently held that the national authorities must have regard to the defendant\u2019s wishes as to his or her choice of legal representation, but may override those wishes when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (ibid., \u00a7 29; see also Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96 and 2 others, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002VII; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, \u00a7 66, 20 January 2005; Klimentyev v.

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055-57; see also Panovits v.

In contrast to the cases involving denial of access, the more lenient requirement of \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons has been applied in situations raising the less serious issue of \u201cdenial of choice\u201d.

Against the above background, the Court considers that the first step should be to assess whether it has been demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for overriding or obstructing the defendant\u2019s wish as to his or her choice of legal representation. Where no such reasons exist, the Court should proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings. In making its assessment, the Court may have regard to a variety of factors, including the nature of the proceedings and the application of certain professional requirements (see Meftah and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-48, and Martin, cited above, \u00a7 90); the circumstances surrounding the designation of counsel and the existence of opportunities for challenging this (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-97); the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance (see Croissant, cited above \u00a7 31, and Vitan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-64); whether the accused\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination has been respected (see Martin, cited above, \u00a7 90); the accused\u2019s age (ibid., \u00a7 92); and the trial court\u2019s use of any statements given by the accused at the material time (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, \u00a7 31; Klimentyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 117-18; and Martin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 94-95). It is further mindful that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, among many other authorities, Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 32; Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 38; Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 76; and Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 55) and that in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond appearances and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, inter alia, Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 11; De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, 22 May 1984, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 77; Pavlenko, cited above, \u00a7 112; and Erkapi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 51198/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08082, 25 April 2013). In cases where the accused had no legal representation, the Court also takes into consideration the opportunity given to the accused to challenge the authenticity of evidence and to oppose its use (see Panovits, cited above, \u00a7 82), whether the accused is in custody (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060); whether such statements constituted a significant element on which the conviction was based and the strength of the other evidence in the case (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 57, and Panovits, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 82).",

There is no indication of the exact time the applicant and M.R. actually commenced the consultation, nor is there any explanation of why that information was not provided in the record of the questioning. The Court notes also that the statement from D.H., the Rijeka County State Attorney, indicates that M.R. talked to the applicant in private for about ten minutes (see paragraph 26 above). The judgment of the Rijeka County Court indicates that M.R. came to the police station at 7.45 p.m. and that the questioning started at 8.10 p.m. (see paragraph 51 above). This was confirmed in the judgment of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 55 above). In the Court\u2019s view, without speculating as to the effectiveness of the legal assistance provided by M.R., this period appears to have been relatively short, bearing in mind the scope and seriousness of the accusations, involving three counts of aggravated murder and further counts of armed robbery and arson.

The fairness of proceedings requires that an accused should be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance. In this regard, counsel has to be able to secure without restriction the fundamental aspects of that person\u2019s defence: discussion of the case, organisation of the defence, collection of evidence favourable to the accused, preparation for questioning, support for an accused in distress and checking of the conditions of detention (see Dayanan, cited above, \u00a7 32).",

In the abstract, if a suspect receives the assistance of a qualified lawyer, who is bound by professional ethics, rather than another lawyer whom he or she might have preferred to appoint, this is not in itself sufficient to show that the whole trial was unfair \u2013 subject to the proviso that there is no evidence of manifest incompetence or bias (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 37). In the instant case, it can be presumed that the consequence of the police\u2019s conduct was that in his very first statement to the police, instead of remaining silent, as he could have done, the applicant made a confession, which was subsequently admitted in evidence against him. It is also significant that during the investigation and ensuing trial the applicant did not subsequently rely on his confession, save by way of mitigation in relation to the sentence, but took the first opportunity, before the investigating judge, to contest the manner in which the confession had been obtained from him by the police (see paragraphs 23-24, 31, 48, 52 and 54 above). Although there was other evidence against him, the significant likely impact of his initial confession on the further development of the criminal proceedings against him cannot be ignored by the Court. In sum, in the Court\u2019s view, the objective consequence of the police\u2019s conduct in preventing the lawyer chosen by the applicant\u2019s family from having access to him was such as to undermine the fairness of the subsequent criminal proceedings in so far as the applicant\u2019s incriminating initial statement was admitted in evidence.",

Firstly, whether the right of access to a lawyer entails in itself a right to have recourse to legal assistance of one\u2019s own choosing from the initial stages of the proceedings. Secondly, what is the content of the right to choose a lawyer. Thirdly, whether the right to a lawyer of one\u2019s choosing should be subject to a lesser standard of protection than the right to have access to a lawyer. Fourthly, whether the Court should evaluate the fairness of the trial as a whole and apply the balancing test (harmless-error analysis) in a situation in which an applicant has been denied the right to choose a lawyer during a police investigation in the course of which he or she has made self-incriminatory statements.

Even in cases where a suspect has remained silent and has not been questioned in detention, a restriction of his or her right to legal assistance from the time of the arrest may fall short of the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention. The reason for this is that it is not for the Court to speculate on the impact which the applicant\u2019s access to a lawyer while in police custody would have had on the ensuing proceedings. However, the Salduz judgment left open the question whether and to what extent in such circumstances the right of access to a lawyer might involve the right to a lawyer of one\u2019s own choosing. Since Salduz, the right to a lawyer of one\u2019s choosing during pre-trial proceedings has been discussed, but never as a central issue. We welcome the finding by the majority (in paragraphs 78 and 108 of the present judgment) expressly recognising the right to a lawyer of one\u2019s own choosing from the initial stages of the proceedings and thereby interpreting the text of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) in accordance with international legal standards.

Since the \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d has been established for the protection of the privilege against self-incrimination, the use of evidence collected in breach of this basic privilege will always render a trial unfair, irrespective of any other circumstances of the case. Thus, the Court found in Salduz that any conviction based on an admission or statement given in violation of the right of access to a lawyer constituted a violation of the general right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In other words, Salduz introduced an automatic exclusionary rule for self-incriminatory statements obtained without a lawyer being present during questioning when there were no compelling reasons for denying access to a lawyer (that is, in situations of unjustified denial of access to a lawyer).",

Like the harmless-error assessment, the assessment of the overall fairness of proceedings can produce very nefarious results when, for example, highly persuasive evidence, such as a confession made by a defendant without independent legal assistance, finds its way into the criminal case file and ultimately into the trial. To think otherwise would be either pure ignorance of the unique role that the lawyer plays in criminal procedure as the \u201cwatchdog of procedural regularity\u201d or purposeful denial of a rule-of-law based State.

Turkey), and (b) \u201cdenial of choice\u201d of lawyer, requiring that there should be \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons and that the overall fairness of the proceedings should not be undermined (see Croissant v. Germany). In paragraph 81 of the present judgment the Court states that denial of choice is \u201cthe less serious issue\u201d and considers that the case under scrutiny is to be classified in such terms. To my mind, in supporting that view the majority are missing an essential characteristic of this case, which is that the police apparently sought to orchestrate the defence during the initial stage of the proceedings, contrary to the provisions of domestic law, as well as the Convention. In my view the combination of the police hindering the access of a retained lawyer to the applicant and simultaneously interfering with the applicant\u2019s free choice of a lawyer by withholding relevant information is not at all \u201cthe less serious issue\u201d in comparison to transparent denial of access to a lawyer.",

Before the beginning of the police questioning, the applicant\u2019s parent(s) instructed a lawyer (G.M.) who was prepared to defend the applicant, a possibility which is accorded legal status in Croatian law. The thus instructed lawyer immediately reported to the police station to meet his client. However, he was refused access to the applicant by the police, allegedly because he had not submitted a written power of attorney. The applicant was not informed either of the presence of the lawyer at the police station or of the action that his parent(s) had undertaken. The applicant confessed to having committed the crimes during the initial police questioning in the presence of another lawyer, who happened to be a former chief of police of the district in which the applicant was being held in custody. The Government argued that the applicant had picked this lawyer from a list presented to him by the police, which would mean that he had a lawyer of his own choosing. According to the domestic courts, the applicant confessed in the presence of a lawyer of his own choosing. The initial confession was used as evidence.",

Paragraph 6 of Article 62 states that the defence lawyer must present his power of attorney to the authorities conducting the proceedings. The defendant may also grant a power of attorney to a lawyer orally before the authority conducting the proceedings, in which case this must be entered in the record. Article 177 \u00a7 5 provides that, at the request of the suspect, the police authorities must allow him to instruct a lawyer and for that purpose they must stop interviewing the suspect until the lawyer appears or at the latest three hours from the moment the suspect asked to appoint the lawyer. If the circumstances indicate that the chosen lawyer will not be able to appear within this period of time, the police authorities must allow the suspect to appoint a lawyer from the list of lawyers on duty provided to the competent police authority by the county branches of the Croatian Bar Association.",

Martin is not about the reasoning underlying such decisions but about the failure to respect the applicant\u2019s defence rights and privilege against self-incrimination in view of the course of events. This issue was analysed by our Court mainly along the lines set out in Salduz. In Martin the Court concluded that the applicant\u2019s defence rights had been adversely affected despite the domestic courts\u2019 acknowledgment of a violation of his right to have a lawyer of his own choosing, and despite the formal exclusion of his confession. The lack of domestic scrutiny in ensuring the removal of any adverse consequences for the outcome of the proceedings, following the acknowledgment of the violation of the applicant\u2019s defence rights, was the essential point for the Court in finding a violation. The Court\u2019s analysis in Martin should not be reduced to a simple application of the test whether the outcome of the proceedings was adversely affected as a result of the denial of the applicant\u2019s choice of lawyer. Such a reductionist characterisation unjustifiably ignores the important aspect of the domestic courts\u2019 recognition of the failure to respect the rights of the defence.",

He never complained in the subsequent criminal proceedings that M.R. had failed to provide him with adequate substantive legal advice. Neither he nor his new lawyer ever submitted any complaint against M.R. by instituting disciplinary proceedings before the relevant bodies of the Croatian Bar Association, an option they were perfectly entitled to pursue. Neither the applicant nor his lawyers took any action in that respect. I wonder how he can then dispute the professional attitude of M.R. in his case?",

For these reasons the Court missed a chance to draw a clear line between two distinctive periods of the proceedings \u2013 one with M.R. and the other with G.M. as the lawyer of the applicant\u2019s choosing in respect of his complaint. In the absence of any ill-treatment or of any other relevant factors that might have rendered the proceedings as a whole unfair, the applicant\u2019s complaint is without solid foundations.",
