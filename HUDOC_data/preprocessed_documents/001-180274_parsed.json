Turkey, nos. 48173/99 and 48319/99, \u00a7\u00a048, 28 October 2004). However, it was not in dispute between the parties that the broadcast referred to by the applicant did not only contain narration by a TV presenter, but it also displayed the video recording of the meeting and dialogue between the applicant and R.A. on the day of the applicant\u2019s arrest, as well as the video recording of the applicant\u2019s arrest by the agents of the MNS when he was taking money from R.A. In these particular circumstances, in the absence of any explanation from the Government as to the circumstances in which a private television channel managed to obtain the above-mentioned video recordings filmed by the law-enforcement authorities, which apparently never objected to their broadcast, the Court considers that the video contents of the broadcast are attributable to the respondent State because the private television channel in question could have obtained them only from the law-enforcement authorities.",
