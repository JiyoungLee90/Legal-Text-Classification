Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2006XII). The Court finds no reason of public policy to prevent accused persons from waiving their right to additional time for the preparation of their defence. This is because the question of time depends primarily on the assessment of the persons concerned; different counsel need different amounts of time to prepare for a case. In the instant case, instead of seeking an adjournment, as possible (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above), the applicant explicitly stated that his new counsel was familiar with his case and that he agreed to be defended by her (see paragraph 12 above). There is no indication that this declaration was tainted by constraint. Thus, it was the applicant\u2019s choice to proceed with the case, and the  cannot be criticised for not giving his counsel more time to prepare. While the authorities responsible for appointing counsel have to ensure that they are capable of effectively defending the accused (see Mills v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 35685/97, 5 December 2000), national judges must also strike a balance between the need to ensure that the accused have enough time to prepare and the need to ensure that a trial progresses in a reasonably expeditious way (see Naviede v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 38072/97, 7 September 1999). In this connection, it cannot be overlooked that in her closing speech the applicant\u2019s counsel was able to raise a number of arguments in his defence (see paragraph 13 above), which serves to confirm the applicant\u2019s statement that she was familiar with his case.",

First, counsel had been appointed for him in the proceedings before the lower court (see paragraph 12 above), in all probability under the new point 7 of Article 70 \u00a7 1 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, because at that juncture, in the absence of an appeal by his coaccused (see paragraph 11 above), none of the other hypotheses where counsel was mandatory were present (see paragraph 20 above). Second, the applicant expressly asserted that he could not afford to retain counsel (see paragraph 15 above), whereas in rejecting his request the Supreme Court of Cassation did not address this assertion, confining its reasoning to the general statement that the prerequisites of the abovementioned Article 70 were not met (see paragraph 16 above and contrast Caresana v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31541/96, 29 August 2000). In the light of these facts and in view of the absence of clear indications to the contrary, the Court is satisfied that the applicant lacked sufficient means to pay for his legal representation in the cassation proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Twalib, cited above, \u00a7 51).",

Given that where deprivation of liberty is at stake, those interests in principle call for such assistance (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 61, Reports 1996III, and, more recently, Shabelnik v. Ukraine, no. 16404/03, \u00a7 58, 19 February 2009), there can be little doubt that they required that it be granted to the applicant for the purposes of his appeal on points of law. An additional factor was the complexity of the cassation procedure (see Pham Hoang, \u00a7 40 in fine, and Twalib, \u00a7 53, both cited above); indeed, at present Article 94 \u00a7 1 (7) of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure requires the participation of counsel in the proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cassation in all cases (see paragraph 21 above). Lastly, it cannot be overlooked that a qualified lawyer would have been able to clarify the grounds adduced by the applicant in his appeal and effectively counter the pleadings of the public prosecutor at the hearing (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 34 in fine, Series A no. 37, and Pakelli v. Germany, 25 April 1983, \u00a7\u00a7 3739, Series A no. 64), thus ensuring respect for the principle of equality of arms.",
