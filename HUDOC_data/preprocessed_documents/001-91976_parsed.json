The Court notes that although the scope of Law no. 5271 is wider than that of Law no. 466, in that the latter only entails an action for damages against the State in respect of detention undergone by persons who had been unlawfully detained or acquitted, the underlying idea remains the same, which is to provide a remedy against shortcomings in relation to the detention procedure by way of compensation. However, the Court has clearly established in the past that the right to be tried within a reasonable time or released during the proceedings is not the same as the right to receive compensation for detention; Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention covers the former and Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a05 the latter (see Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n, cited above, \u00a7 44). In other words, a claim for compensation as indicated by the Government would not make it possible to end detention of excessive length within the meaning of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Tepe v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a031247/96, 22\u00a0January 2002, and Sincar and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a046281/99, 24\u00a0March 2005) and therefore may not be considered an effective remedy in these circumstances.",
