In establishing that the treatment by the police officers fell under Article 243 of the Criminal Code, the Plenary Court of Cassation further found that they had inflicted this treatment intentionally in order to extract confessions (see paragraph 14 above). The Court further notes that the applicants\u2019 allegations included the administration of electric shocks and beatings. These allegations are partly corroborated by the medical reports, as confirmed by the domestic court judgment. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the injuries observed on the applicants must be attributable to a form of ill-treatment for which the authorities bore responsibility.",

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering.",
