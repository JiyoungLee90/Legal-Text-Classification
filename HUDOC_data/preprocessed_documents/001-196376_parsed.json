The Court has previously held that an extension of detention under Article 165-2 may be justified in certain circumstances where the court requires time to establish the person\u2019s identity and collect other information crucial for taking a decision on his or her pre-trial detention. At the same time, the Court has noted that the reasons not to release the person should be compelling (see Barilo v. Ukraine, no.\u00a09607/06, \u00a7 93, 16 May 2013). In the present case, the reasons for extending the applicant\u2019s detention were the need to verify whether her state of health warranted her medical treatment, as suggested by her, and to obtain more evidence on her involvement into the crime (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a08\u00a0above). The Court notes that the reasons given do not substantiate the existence of any risks or circumstances justifying the need to keep her in detention in the meantime. In fact, the court\u2019s decision did not contain any assessment of the applicant\u2019s individual circumstances or the risks justifying her detention. It does not appear from the documents submitted by the parties that there were any compelling reasons for the applicant\u2019s continued detention (see and compare Barilo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-98; Gal v.

In fact, the burden of proof was wrongly shifted onto the applicant (compare Khayredinov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a038717/04, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 41, 14 October 2010, and Makarenko v.
