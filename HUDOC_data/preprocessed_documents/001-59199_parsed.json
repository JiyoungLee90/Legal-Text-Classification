The senior officials had been under the authority of the provincial governor, who had at the same time been liable, from a legal standpoint, for the acts committed by the security forces personnel implicated in the case.

The \u015e\u0131rnak provincial governor, Mustafa Malay, told the Commission delegates that \u0130smail Ertak had followed up the matter and had come back to see him in his office five or six times with the same allegations. On 2 October 1992 \u0130smail Ertak lodged a complaint with the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor, alleging that his son had been arrested on 20 August 1992 while undergoing an identity check on his way home from work, and gave the names of eyewitnesses who said that they had seen his son while he was in police custody. However, his allegation was not given serious consideration. It is clear from the file on the investigation launched in response to the \u015e\u0131rnak provincial governor's written request of 4 November 1992 to the national police headquarters that no appropriate steps were taken to find witnesses who had said that they had seen Mehmet Ertak while in custody \u2013 or, indeed, to interview the complainant \u2013 and that the investigating officer was not in possession of the file on the investigation opened by the public prosecutor following the complaint lodged by \u0130smail Ertak. In the absence of an effective investigation by the authorities into the alleged disappearance and in the light of their repeated denial that Mehmet Ertak had been arrested, the Court finds that there was no basis for any meaningful recourse by the applicant to the civil and administrative remedies referred to by the Government; it considers that the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him (see, among other authorities, the Kurt judgment cited above, pp. 1175-77, \u00a7\u00a7 79-83, and \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 77-80).",

It is not disputed that there were clashes in \u015e\u0131rnak between 18 and 20 August 1992 and that, according to the evidence given by members of the security forces, more than a hundred people were arrested, identity checks were carried out at the entrance to the town and persons suspected of terrorist activities were taken directly to the police headquarters by members of the \u201crapid intervention force\u201d. As the Commission pointed out, very strong inferences may be drawn from the evidence given to the delegates by S\u00fcleyman Ertak (concerning Mehmet Ertak's arrest), Mustafa Malay, the \u015e\u0131rnak provincial governor (who acknowledged that he had met people in his office who said that they had seen Mehmet Ertak while they were in police custody) and Abdurrahim Demir (who maintained that he had spoken to Mehmet Ertak while in custody and that he had seen him \u201cdead\u201d at the police headquarters following the use of torture by police officers). The Court finds on that basis that there is sufficient evidence to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that, after being arrested and taken into custody, Mehmet Ertak was subjected to severe and unacknowledged ill-treatment and died while in the custody of the security forces. This case must therefore be distinguished from the Kurt case (judgment cited above, p. 1182, \u00a7\u00a7 107-08), in which the Court examined the applicant's complaints about the disappearance of her son under Article 5. In the Kurt case, although the applicant's son had been taken into custody, there was no other evidence of the treatment to which he had been subjected thereafter or his subsequent fate.",

The obligation imposed is not exclusively concerned with intentional killing resulting from the use of force by agents of the State but also extends, in the first sentence of Article 2 \u00a7 1, to a positive obligation on States to protect by law the right to life. This requires by implication that there should be some form of adequate and effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, among other authorities, the Ya\u015fa v. Turkey judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2438, \u00a7 98). The procedural protection of the right to life inherent in Article 2 of the Convention entails an obligation for agents of the State to account for their use of lethal force by subjecting their actions to some form of independent and public scrutiny capable of determining whether the force used was or was not justified in a particular set of circumstances (see the Kaya judgment cited above, p. 324, \u00a7 87).",

In the instant case, the Court has held that there has been a substantive and a procedural violation of Article 2. Noting the awards made in previous cases involving the application of the same provision in south-eastern Turkey (see the Kaya judgment cited above, p. 333, \u00a7 122; the G\u00fcle\u00e7 judgment cited above, p. 1734, \u00a7 88; the Ergi v.

Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7 98, ECHR\u00a01999-III) and having regard to the circumstances of this case, the Court awards the sum of GBP 20,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be held by the applicant on behalf of his son's widow and four children. As regards the applicant himself, the Court considers that he undoubtedly suffered damage as a result of the violations found and, ruling on an equitable basis, awards him GBP 2,500. ",
