On the same day, the criminal investigation under Article 119 of the Criminal Code had been opened. In response to internal instructions from the Ministry of the Interior, the local police had informed the Kurgan RUBOP about all criminal investigations involving ethnic Chechens. On the same day, officers from the Kurgan RUBOP arrived at the ROVD. They were accompanied by six members of the special police force, in order to ensure the safety and security of the search procedures. They had travelled together to Prosekovo, where the investigator issued two search orders, the first for the Antayevs\u2019 family house in Verkhnesuyerskoye. During both searches, the members of the special police force had run into the house first. Mr\u00a0N.P. had served the search order on the first applicant, who had signed and dated it. The first applicant\u2019s wife and three sons had also been at home at the time. They were invited to surrender weapons and illegal objects, but they denied having any such items. Then the search had started, and the members of the family had tried to interfere. They shouted and prevented the police officers from entering the rooms. Because of this, the officers from the special police force had escorted the first and second applicants\u2019 three sons \u2013 the third to fifth applicants \u2013 into the courtyard. No one had hit the applicants. The search ended with the finding of one cartridge for an automatic rifle, literature in a foreign language, and a number of videotapes. Mr\u00a0N.P. had remained in the house the whole time and had thus not witnessed the events in the courtyard. The first and third applicants had then been taken by one of the police officers to meet the investigator at the village administration\u2019s offices, while the rest of the group went to the Vashayevs\u2019 family house. There Mr\u00a0N.P. had shown the search order to the seventh applicant and invited her to surrender illegally stored items, such as weapons. When the applicants denied having any such things, the police had started the search. The proceedings were conducted in a correct and polite manner, and no one had been beaten or otherwise injured. The search resulted in the finding and seizure of a smoothbore rifle and cartridges for it, a handgun of foreign manufacture, home-made knives and knives with long blades, and fourteen pirated VHS tapes. During the search the witness had not seen the events in the courtyard, but when he walked out, no one had been using violence on the applicants. He also noted that during the searches both families had behaved emotionally, and had shouted and vowed to lodge complaints.",

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a plausible and convincing explanation of how those injuries were caused (see Salman v.

The eighth applicant, in addition, had been subjected to attempted strangulation which had resulted in a loss of consciousness (see paragraph 40 above). Although no injuries were recorded in respect of the ninth applicant, a number of concordant witness statements pointed to the fact that he had been hit several times on his head and torso.

The Government did not argue that recourse to physical force by the police in the present case had been proportionate and necessary in view of the circumstances of the case, such as the need to overcome resistance to lawful orders issued by the police (compare, for example, with Davitidze v.

However, the Court notes that the investigation did not establish that any physical force was applied to restrain them; and in any event, these testimonies fail to explain the injuries received by other applicants. On the contrary, it is clear that the group carrying out the searches was in full control of the situation and that the applicants did not mount any physical resistance to them. In such circumstances, the Court finds that the ill-treatment was inflicted upon the applicants with the aim to intimidate, humiliate and debase them. The Court considers that this treatment of the first to sixth and ninth applicants should be classified as inhuman and degrading. As to the eighth applicant, who had a rope tightened around his neck until he lost consciousness (see paragraph 40 above), such treatment, combined with the feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority which the impugned treatment produced in him, must have caused him suffering of sufficient severity to be categorised as torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.

Thus, the prosecution authority merely accepted the officers\u2019 explanations that they had not ill-treated the applicants, without offering any other version of the events. Such acceptance stands in sharp contrast to the duty of vigilance expected from law-enforcement authorities when facing allegations of crimes that encroach on the core values of a democratic society, such as the rights guaranteed under Article 3. The Court considers that in the present case, where the domestic investigating authorities have established the responsibility for the impugned acts of a known group of State agents, the failure to identify the individuals responsible can only be attributable to the reluctance of the prosecuting authorities to pursue the investigation (see Velkhiyev and Others v. Russia, no. 34085/06, \u00a7 114, 5 July 2011). In this respect, failing to follow an obvious line of inquiry undermines the investigation\u2019s ability to establish the circumstances of the case and those responsible. Finally, where the circumstances are such that the authorities are obliged to deploy masked officers to effect an arrest, the Court considers that the latter should be required to visibly display some anonymous means of identification - for example a number or letter, thus allowing for their identification and questioning in the event of challenges to the manner in which the operation was conducted (see Hristovi v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a042697/05, \u00a7 92, 11 October 2011).",

The Court deplored not only the existence of internal rules for administrative bodies and the police based on those persons\u2019 ethnicity (Timishev) but also the racist verbal abuse by the police who had been responsible for the applicants\u2019 ill-treatment, as well as the failure of the investigating authorities to examine the potential racist implications of the incident (Makhashevy). The Court reiterates its previously stated position that racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its dangerous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. No difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on a person\u2019s ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society built on the principles of pluralism and respect for different cultures (see Timishev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056 and 58).

The applicants raised this complaint with the domestic courts, which referred them back to the prosecutor\u2019s office (see paragraphs 77-79 above).

Furthermore, the Court notes the recurrent reference to internal police instructions to treat suspects of Chechen ethnic origin in a particular manner (see paragraphs 34 and 54 above). As is evident from the documents and witness statements, by way of implementing this practice, the local police had called the Regional Department for Combating Organised Crime (RUBOP) and a group of armed special police officers to assist them in carrying out searches at the homes of the two applicant families in connection with what would otherwise appear to have been the investigation of a minor offence (see paragraph 81 above) because the suspects were of Chechen origin. In the absence of any other explanations, the Court finds it established that in the present case the applicants\u2019 ethnic origin was the sole, or at least the decisive, reason for the involvement of RUBOP and the special police service in the searches at their homes (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Turkey, no. 24626/09, \u00a7 57, 9 October 2012). The Court does not wish to question the general mode of operation of law-enforcement authorities when combatting crime, or to intervene in operational choices that represent a reaction to the specific and fast-changing realities on the ground. Nevertheless, the Court cannot accept that such a difference in treatment between suspects could be based solely, or to a decisive extent, on their actual or perceived ethnicity. Finally, the Court has already found that the ill-treatment was inflicted on the applicants intentionally and without any apparent reason (see paragraphs 96 and 97 above).",

France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, ECHR 1999III, and Timishev, cited above, \u00a7 57). Taking the above elements above into account, the Court is satisfied that a prima facie case of racially based ill-treatment has been made. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the burden of proof lies on the Government (see Stoica\u00a0v.\u00a0Romania, no. 42722/02, \u00a7 131, 4 March 2008; Sampanis and Others v. Greece, no. 32526/05, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 5 June 2008; and Makhashevy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 178-79). Since neither the domestic criminal investigation nor the Government could explain the incidents in any other way or, to that end, put forward any arguments showing that the incidents were racially neutral, the Court finds that this treatment constituted discrimination based on ethnicity, which is a form of racial discrimination (see paragraphs 82-84 above).",

The situation of their complaint under Article 14 is no different from the complaint brought by them under Article 3 of the Convention. For the same reasons as indicated above in paragraphs 99 and 113, the Court concludes that there has been no violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 3 in respect of these two applicants.",
