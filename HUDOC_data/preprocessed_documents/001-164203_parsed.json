The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions it made in the Tahirov judgment also apply to the present case. In particular, the Court noted the existence of serious concerns regarding the impartiality of the electoral commissions, a lack of transparency in their actions, and various shortcomings in their procedures (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 60-61); a lack of clear and sufficient information about the professional qualifications and the criteria for the appointment of working-group experts charged with the task of examining signature sheets (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64); failure by the electoral commissions and courts to take any further investigative steps to confirm the experts\u2019 opinions on the authenticity or otherwise of signatures (ibid., \u00a7\u00a065); systematic failure by the electoral commissions to abide by a number of statutory safeguards designed to protect nominated candidates from arbitrary decisions (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 66-68 and 69); failure by the electoral commissions and courts to take into account the relevant and substantial evidence submitted by the candidate in an attempt to challenge the findings of the workinggroup experts on the authenticity or otherwise of signatures (ibid., \u00a7 69); and the failure by the domestic courts to deal with appeals in an appropriate manner (ibid., \u00a7 70). Having regard to the above, the Court found that, in practice, the applicant in the Tahirov judgment had not been afforded sufficient safeguards to prevent an arbitrary decision to refuse his registration as a candidate.",
