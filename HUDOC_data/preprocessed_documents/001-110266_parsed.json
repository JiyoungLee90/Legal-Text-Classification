While reading out that letter, the presiding judge noticed that the police had visited the wrong address as far as witness V.Z. was concerned. The prosecutor then requested that their statements be read out. Lawyer H.I. submitted that the witnesses in question had made defamatory statements against the applicant during the investigation which lacked credibility and it was therefore necessary to bring them to court with the help of the police. The applicant joined his lawyer\u2019s request and asked that the witnesses in question appear in court and also present their identity documents. The Court of Appeal decided that, since a wrong address had been indicated in the decision ordering V.Z.\u2019s appearance in court, it was necessary to inform the police of the correct address. As regards witnesses O.V. and S.K., the former was in , while the latter was out of town. This was also confirmed by the telephone calls made by the presiding judge. The Court of Appeal found that, in such circumstances, there were no reasons to doubt the veracity of the police information and announced that it would read out and examine the pre-trial statements of those witnesses. The statements would then be analysed in the deliberation room and an assessment would be made as to their credibility, since the evidence examined in court was sufficient to allow such an assessment. The Court of Appeal then proceeded to read out the statements in question. The applicant submitted that their statements did not concern him since there had been many tall, grey-haired men at the marketplace. The investigating authority had never arranged his identification by those witnesses and their statements were therefore false.",

He submitted that the lawyer had not taken any steps to defend his interests and to prove his innocence. The lawyer had never come to visit him in detention despite the requests he had made to the administration of the detention facility. Furthermore the lawyer, without his knowledge, had filed a motion on 7\u00a0May 2004 seeking his release, in which the lawyer stated that he had pleaded guilty despite the fact that he had never pleaded fully guilty, thereby acting to his detriment and assisting the prosecution in substantiating the charge against him. The applicant claimed that he had found out about this motion only during the appeal proceedings. He further claimed in his motion that he had pleaded guilty to distributing leaflets because he was not aware that such act did not constitute an offence. He realised this only following his release from detention because no copy of the Criminal Code had been provided to him by either the investigator or his lawyer while in detention, despite his numerous requests. The applicant lastly claimed that the case against him had been fabricated. He submitted that, while sitting behind a glass wall at the police station, he was shown to some people who later became witnesses and made false statements against him. Some of them he was not able to examine and only two of them appeared in court. One of those two retracted his pre-trial statement, while the second one, because of giving a false statement, was even ashamed to look him in the eyes and was only able to mumble a confirmation of his pretrial statement.",

In doing so, the Court of Appeal referred to the statements of witnesses N.S., M.M., O.V. and S.K. and of police officers G.D. and G.A. As regards the statement of witness V.Z., the Court of Appeal found that it should not have formed a basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction because that witness had failed to appear in court despite a court order. The Court of Appeal further rejected the applicant\u2019s claim that he had only distributed leaflets but not made any calls for a violent overthrow of the government. In doing so, the Court of Appeal stated that five witnesses had testified that the applicant had made such calls. Furthermore, the police officers had arrested him while he was handing out the leaflets. In the light of the overall sufficiency of evidence, the fact that witnesses O.V. and S.K. had failed to appear in court could not put into doubt the applicant\u2019s involvement in the act and his guilt. The criminal element in his actions lay in the making of calls inciting violent seizure of power and change of the constitutional order. Those calls were public and aimed at a big group of people. Since he made such calls at a marketplace during the daytime, they were audible to the public. The fact that they were perceived as calls inciting to a violent overthrow of the government was confirmed by the witness statements.",

France, no. 29731/96, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2001-II). While Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) confers on everyone charged with a criminal offence the right to \u201cdefend himself in person or through legal assistance ...\u201d, it does not specify the manner of exercising this right. It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court\u2019s task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial (see Sakhnovskiy v.  [GC], no. 21272/03, \u00a7 95, 2 November 2010).",

Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7\u00a024, Series A no. 32). The Court observes that Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention speaks of \u201cassistance\u201d and not of \u201cnomination\u201d. The mere nomination of a lawyer does not ensure effective assistance since the lawyer appointed for legal aid purposes may die, fall seriously ill, be prevented for a protracted period from acting or shirk his duties. If they are notified of the situation, the authorities must either replace him or cause him to fulfil his obligations (see Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no.\u00a037, \u00a7\u00a033).",

It appears that the lawyer was present during all the subsequent investigative measures involving the applicant, such as interviews (see paragraphs 20 and 27 above), presentation of the charge (see paragraphs 21-22 above) and confrontations (see paragraphs 2426 above). However, the mere presence of a lawyer is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c). The Court notes with concern that, while being present at the above investigative measures, the lawyer, nevertheless, appears to have shown absolute passivity. He does not appear to have had any involvement whatsoever in the applicant\u2019s interviews other than signing the relevant records and failed to pose any questions to the witnesses against the applicant during the confrontations. Furthermore, nothing suggests that the lawyer ever met with the applicant to discuss his case and to provide legal advice. The Court lastly cannot ignore the lawyer\u2019s final speech made before the District Court which was devoid of any factual or legal arguments (see paragraph 40 above), as well as the fact that the lawyer appears not to have had any involvement in the drafting of the applicant\u2019s appeal against the judgment of the District Court (see paragraph 43 above).",

Not only did the applicant explicitly give his consent to be represented by lawyer H.I. in all the above-mentioned instances (see paragraphs 18, 22, 31 and 44 above), but he never showed any signs of dissatisfaction with his lawyer until the final hearing before the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 49 above). The applicant\u2019s appeal against his conviction by the District Court was also absolutely silent on this point (see paragraph 43 above). He did finally raise this issue, as mentioned above, at the last hearing before the Court of Appeal and in his appeal to the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs\u00a049 and 53 above). However, as admitted by the applicant himself, this was mostly motivated by his allegedly belated discovery of the lawyer\u2019s motion of 7 May 2004, which, according to the applicant, contained submissions detrimental to his case (see paragraph 26 above), and not by any other failures or omissions committed by the lawyer. Thus, such protracted silence on the applicant\u2019s part and the main reason for his belated complaint may cast doubt on the credibility of some of his allegations. In any event, even assuming that the entirety of the applicant\u2019s allegations are true, it was still incumbent on him to bring the lawyer\u2019s failures to the attention of the authorities, who cannot be blamed for such failures if they were not informed of them in a timely and proper manner.",

The Court does not share the applicant\u2019s view that the lawyer deliberately acted to his detriment by stating in that motion that the applicant had pleaded guilty, since it is clear that the lawyer\u2019s intention was to secure the applicant\u2019s release from detention. Moreover, the lawyer did pose questions to some of the witnesses during the proceedings before the District Court and it can be construed from the answers received that the questions were pertinent, competent and of help to the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above). He also insisted on several occasions before the Court of Appeal that measures be taken to ensure the attendance of the witnesses who had failed to appear, alleging that their statements were defamatory and lacked credibility (see paragraphs and 46-48 above).",

It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at the international level should have been aired before those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and timelimits laid down in domestic law (see, among other authorities, Azinas v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2004III).",

In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, the argument of violation of the Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used. If the complaint presented before the Court has not been put, either explicitly or in substance, to the national courts when it could have been raised in the exercise of a remedy available to the applicant, the national legal order has been denied the opportunity to address the Convention issue which the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is intended to give it. It is not sufficient that the applicant may have, unsuccessfully, exercised another remedy which could have overturned the impugned measure on other grounds not connected with the complaint of violation of a Convention right. It is the Convention complaint which must have been aired at national level for there to have been exhaustion of \u201ceffective remedies\u201d.
