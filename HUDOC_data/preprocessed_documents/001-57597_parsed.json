Thus, an application may be made for the provisional detention of a \"mentally ill person\" either in his own interests or in the interests of public order; there must be a medical declaration to the effect that the person concerned \"is in a state of mental illness and that it is necessary or desirable to treat him in a psychiatric hospital\" (sections 12 and 16 of the Act; paragraph 13 above). The District Court makes a provisional detention order if it finds this to be adequately established (section 17 of the Act; paragraph 14 above). Similarly, the application for a detention order, on which the  decides, must be accompanied by a reasoned declaration by the doctor responsible that it is necessary or desirable for the patient to undergo further treatment in a psychiatric hospital (sections 22 and 23 of the Act; paragraphs 16 and 17 above). In addition, it appears from the evidence that, according to the general practice currently followed, the Netherlands courts authorise the confinement of a \"mentally ill person\" only if his mental disorder is of such a kind or of such gravity as to make him an actual danger to himself or to others; the Bill presently pending before Parliament speaks of \"a danger for [the individual concerned], for others or for the general safety of persons and goods\" (see paragraphs 11 and 22 above).",

In the present context it suffices to add the following: in deciding whether an individual should be detained as a \"person of unsound mind\", the national authorities are to be recognised as having a certain discretion since it is in the first place for the national authorities to evaluate the evidence adduced before them in a particular case; the Court\u2019s task is to review under the Convention the decisions of those authorities (see notably, mutatis mutandis, the Handyside judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, pp. 22 and 23, paras. 48 and 50, the above-mentioned Klass and others judgment, p. 23, para. 49, and the above-mentioned Sunday Times judgment, p. 36, para. 59).",

While some hesitation may be felt as to the need for such confinement to continue for as long as six weeks, the period is not so excessive as to render the detention \"unlawful\". Despite the applicant\u2019s criticisms, the Court has no reason whatsoever to doubt the objectivity and reliability of the medical evidence on the basis of which the  courts, from June 1968 onwards, have authorised his detention as a person of unsound mind.
