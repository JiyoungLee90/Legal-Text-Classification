In accordance with those rules, the restraint of detainees during transportation was automatic and no assessment of the circumstances of each detainee was allowed before deciding whether the measure should be applied. As the proportionality of the measure in question could not be examined under the domestic legislation, it is for the Court to examine the treatment complained of by the applicant. Consequently, it has to assess the circumstances which lead to the application of that measure and the consequences it had on the applicant.",

At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before the appellate court. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, if the detention is authorised by a court, it must be considered to be lawful and not arbitrary, even where an appeal is available. Subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention (see\u00a0TjinaKwi and Van Den Heuvel v. the Netherlands, no. 17297/90, Commission decision of 31 March 1993). Therefore, the Court would be less concerned with the speediness of the proceedings before the appellate court if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and gave to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (see, mutatis mutandis, Vodeni\u010darov v.
