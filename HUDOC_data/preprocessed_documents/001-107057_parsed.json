As far as the applicant\u2019s conduct is concerned, the Court notes that more than eleven months of the total length of the proceedings before the national courts are attributable to him. In particular, the Court observes a delay regarding the lodging of an appeal on points of law with the Plenary of the State Audit Council challenging judgment no.\u00a0 1502/2004 of the State Audit Council. However, the Court does not find that it was the applicant\u2019s conduct alone which contributed to the prolonged length of the proceedings. On the contrary, the Court is of the opinion that the actual length of the proceedings - which was approximately six years - without taking into account the applicant\u2019s delay regarding the lodging of an appeal on points of law, remains excessive. In particular, it is noted that the duration of the proceedings when the case was pending before the State Audit Council - which lasted for more than three years and three months - and before the Plenary of State Audit Council - which lasted more than two years and eight months - was attributable to the national courts. Their handling of the case did not facilitate its timely completion. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the length of the proceedings can only be explained by the failure of the domestic courts to deal with the case diligently (see G\u00fcm\u00fc\u00fften v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 47116/99, \u00a7\u00a7 24-26, 30\u00a0November 2004).",

In particular, it is not the Court\u2019s function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see,\u00a0among many others, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR\u00a01999I). Further, the Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, while Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires courts to give reasons for their decisions, this is not to be understood as requiring a detailed reply to every argument (see Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands, 19 April 1994, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 288). The extent of this obligation may vary depending on the nature of the decision and must be analysed in the light of the circumstances of each case (Higgins and Others v. France, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I).",

Moreover, having regard to the judgments of the domestic courts, which deal clearly and unambiguously with the various points that were submitted by the applicant, it does not appear that the domestic courts failed in their obligation to give reasons. As the plenary of the State Audit Council observed, the first instance court in its judgment clearly explained that the applicant had been acting unlawfully in the performance of his duties and had been responsible for the creation of the budget deficit in question. It was also admitted that the applicant had previously been questioned by the inspector in charge, put forward his views on the matter and had also been invited to restore the abovementioned deficit. Moreover, the Court observes that appeal and cassation hearings took place before the State Audit Council - on 6 May 2003, 20 April 2004 and 7 November 2007 respectively - where the applicant had the possibility to raise his allegations. Thus, there is no indication of any arbitrariness.",

They further noted that, in any event, even the expenses incurred before the State Audit Council (sum of EUR 940.78) were not causally linked with the protracted length of the proceedings and that this claim should be dismissed. With regard to the amount of costs and expenses allegedly incurred before the Court, the Government submitted that the amount claimed was not reasonable.

The Court notes, however, that, even concerning the bills of costs submitted as regards the proceedings before the State Audit Council, the costs in this case were not caused by the length of proceedings but were costs normally incurred in the context of the proceedings. Thus, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim.",
