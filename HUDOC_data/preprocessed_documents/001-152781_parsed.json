Nevertheless, the investigation was completed within the period of one year and some two months (see paragraphs\u00a07, 11 and\u00a031 above). The trial court started the trial without substantial delay, taking into account the fact that it had to decide whether to sever the charges against some accused to separate proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a011 and\u00a014 above).
