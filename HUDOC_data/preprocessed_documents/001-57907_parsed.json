In particular, they argued that the obligation to pay contributions derived not from any agreement but from law, as did the amount thereof; this obligation was incumbent not only on the potential beneficiary but on a third party (the employer) as well; the obligation was unconnected with the entitlement to benefits, so that even if the employer did not pay the relevant contributions, the employee remained entitled to the benefits; and the rules governing the deduction and payment of contributions had been brought into line with those concerning the deduction of tax from wages.",

The decisive consideration for holding Article 6 (art. 6) to be applicable to disputes relating to benefits under social-security schemes was that such disputes had a direct bearing on the beneficiary\u2019s means of subsistence; disputes relating to an employer\u2019s obligation under these schemes, however, concerned an incidental financial obligation and did not bear directly on his means of subsistence.",
