Moreover, he argued that the redevelopment work requested was such as should already have been conducted in any case, in line with the requirements of section 1bis of Law no. 3194 on urban planning (see paragraph\u00a023 above). Furthermore, he considered that the authorities\u2019 offer of an assistant illustrated their ignorance of his personal situation and the implications of that situation. He added that it would be degrading for him to be placed in a situation of dependence on a third person because of his disability, citing the example of how the constant presence and assistance of a third person would invade his privacy.

As regards the adaptation of that existing building, the court noted that the authorities had informed the applicant that architectural measures would be adopted in accordance with the available budget (see paragraph 16 of the judgment). In short, the court held that in omitting to carry out the redevelopment work on the building in question before the beginning of the 2007-2008 academic year, the university had not failed to honour its obligations.",

I consider that we have insufficient information at our disposal to reach such a conclusion. The existence and scope of a positive obligation in any given situation depend on the requisite fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual in question and of society as a whole (see paragraph 72 of the judgment, which, strangely enough, mentions a principle which applies in the context of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1, and not under Article 14 of the Convention). In the instant case, the competent authorities had undertaken to carry out the necessary work in accordance with the available budget, and the law required them to do so within a very specific time-limit. That being the case, how can it be claimed that a few months after the applicant\u2019s request, those authorities were in a situation of flouting the latter\u2019s rights?",

The administration was more specific, proposing the help of a support person (see paragraph 10 of the judgment). The applicant did not react well to that proposal, and later explained that it pointed to a lack of understanding of his personal situation, that accepting it would have placed him in a situation of dependency on a third person, and that the implementation of such a proposal would have led to a risk of his falling in the staircases (memorial in reply before the administrative\u00a0court; see paragraph\u00a013 of the judgment).",

It is therefore understandable that the defence pleadings submitted by the administration accused the applicant of acting in bad faith: at that time the administration still considered that the provision of a support person was an appropriate proposal (see paragraph 12 of the judgment). The fact that it was still of that opinion shows that the applicant had not re-contacted it to explain that its offer was not sufficient, or even that it was unacceptable. Only in his memorial in reply did the applicant state why he had not accepted the proposal (see paragraph\u00a013 of the judgment).",

The possibility of specific alterations for the applicant (\u201creasonable\u00a0accommodation\u201d, within the meaning of the Disability Convention) was there, but the applicant seems to have presented the university authorities with a fait accompli by breaking off discussions with them and bringing legal proceedings.
