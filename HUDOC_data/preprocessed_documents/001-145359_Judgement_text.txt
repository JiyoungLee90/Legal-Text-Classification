The case originated in eight applications (nos. 3925/10, 3955/10, 3974/10, 4009/10, 4054, 4128/10, 4132/10 and 4133/10) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eight Croatian nationals, (“the applicants”), on the dates listed in Annex I to this judgment.
The applicants were represented by Ms D. Košta, a lawyer practising in Split. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažik.
.  The applicants alleged, in particular, that their right to respect for their home was violated, contrary to Article 8 of the Convention.
On 4 March 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants’ personal details are listed in Annex I to this judgment.
On various unspecified dates during the 1970-ties the applicants moved into flats in Mlini, Dubrovnik, as employees of the publicly-owned enterprise Mlini Hotels.
.  On 3 June 1991 Parliament enacted the Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo), which regulated the sale of publicly-owned flats previously let under protected tenancies, giving the right to holders of such tenancies of publicly-owned flats to purchase them from the provider of the flat under favourable conditions.
.  Sometime after 1991 the Mlini Hotels were privatised.
.  On various unspecified dates during the 1990-ies the applicants sought to purchase their flats from Mlini Hotels. Their requests were refused.
.  On various dates during the 2000-ies Mlini Hotels brought separate civil actions in the Dubrovnik Municipal Court against each of the applicants, seeking their eviction on the ground that they had no legal basis to occupy the flats.
.  The applicants lodged their counterclaims, seeking recognition of their protected tenancy on the flats they occupied as well as judgments in lieu of the contracts of sale. They argued that they had been occupying the flats at issue for lengthy periods and paid the rent and all utility bills and had the right to permanently occupy those flats.
.  On various dates the Dubrovnik Municipal Court reached decisions in the applicants’ cases. It accepted the plaintiff’s claims and dismissed the applicants’ counterclaims on the ground that the premises in dispute were not flats within the meaning of section 6 § 1(1) of the Housing Act because they did not concern a single construction unit. Furthermore, it held that the premises in question were situated in the plaintiff’s personal building designed for temporary accommodation for the plaintiff’s employees on which the applicants could not acquire protected tenancies.
.  The applicants lodged their appeals arguing that they had been living in the flats at issue for lengthy periods, that they had no other place to live and that the flats had been allocated to them for permanent occupation. The first-instance judgments were all upheld by the Dubrovnik County Court.
.  The applicants all lodged their constitutional complaints whereby they challenged the lower courts’ judgments ordering their eviction.
.  The applicants were all forcefully evicted from the flats owned by the Mlini Hotels on 19 November 2010.

.  The Protected Tenancies ( to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo, Official Gazette no. 27/1991 with further amendments - “the Act”) regulates the conditions of sale of flats let under protected tenancies.
