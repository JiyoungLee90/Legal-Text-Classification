During that period the applicant\u2019s prison term was governed by decision no. 394, and it is not disputed by the Government that the term thus determined expired prior to the applicant\u2019s release on 8\u00a0December 2005. In so far as the Government claim that decision no. 394 was erroneous, the Court considers it noteworthy that the prosecution authorities had the opportunity to lodge an appeal against it but did not do so. In the absence of such an appeal the impugned decision became final and enforceable. It is true that the prosecution authorities requested the reopening of the proceedings and that in those proceedings the domestic court agreed with the prosecution authorities\u2019 finding that the applicant\u2019s prison term had indeed been miscalculated (see paragraph 19 above). However, such post factum validation of the mistake with respect to the applicant\u2019s detention during the period in question does not alter the fact that, under Article 5 \u00a7 1, detention should be justified throughout its duration. The Court considers that prior to the judgment of 10 October 2006, the assessment by the prosecution and the prison authorities of the Kardzhali District Court\u2019s decision did not suffice to justify the applicant\u2019s detention during the period under examination.",

It is only in exceptional circumstances that the Court may decide not to make an award in respect of non-pecuniary damage if, in its opinion, various relevant factual circumstances preclude such an award. In any event, the Court must fully address the question of reparation for damage or, failing that, appropriate compensation, including assessment of non-pecuniary damage. In this case, while a violation was found, there were reasons, as presented in paragraph 53, that militated in favour of no award of damages.
