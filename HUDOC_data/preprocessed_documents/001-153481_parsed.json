May 10, 2005; and Gasyak and Others v. Turkey, no. 27872/03, 13 October 2009). The scope of the fresh obligation to investigate will vary according to the nature of the purported new evidence or information. It may be restricted to verifying the reliability of the new evidence. The authorities can legitimately take into account the prospects of launching a new prosecution at such a late stage. Due to the lapse of time, the level of urgency may have diminished; the immediacy of required investigative steps in the aftermath of an incident is likely to be absent (see Brecknell, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79-81). The standard of expedition in such historical cases is very different from the standard applicable in recent incidents where time is often of the essence in preserving vital evidence at a scene and questioning witnesses when their memories are fresh and detailed (see Pali\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 4704/04, \u00a7 70, 15 February 2011 concerning complex post-conflict situations; Emin and Others v Cyprus, no.\u00a059623/08 et al, (dec.) 3 April 2012; and G\u00fcrtekin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a021).",

Naturally, given the lapse of more than twenty years since the events, some of the potential suspects have died in the meantime. It should also be noted that, of those named as being implicated in the events who have been found and questioned by the authorities, all have denied participation in any unlawful acts (see paragraphs 18, 19, 29 and 33 above).",

The Court notes that pursuant to these letters the Croatian authorities took various investigative steps, including asking the Serbian authorities to assist them in investigation by interviewing the available suspects and checking addresses of other suspects (see paragraphs 32 and 36 above), however, they could not corroborate the information provided in the letters with any other evidence. It is questionable whether information provided in the letters could in itself serve as a basis for issuing arrest warrants. The Court notes further that the majority of the persons named as perpetrators are living in Serbia. Those who have become Serbian citizens cannot be extradited (see paragraph 44 above), but Croatia cannot be held liable for that. The Court also considers that it is not necessary to examine whether there was an obligation under the Convention for Croatia to request Serbia to take proceedings in this case, given that the applicants could have reported this case themselves to Serbia\u2019s War Crimes Prosecutor, who has jurisdiction over serious violations of international humanitarian law committed anywhere in the former Yugoslavia (see paragraph 44 above). Moreover, it is open to the applicants to lodge an application against Serbia if they consider that they are the victim of a breach by Serbia of their Convention rights (compare to Pali\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 65).",

The Court can understand that it must be frustrating for the applicants that potential suspects have been named but no further steps have been taken. However, Article 2 cannot be interpreted so as to impose a requirement on the authorities to launch a prosecution irrespective of the evidence which is available. In this connection the Court notes that the only two witnesses who directly witnessed the killing of the applicants\u2019 relatives are living in Canada and have refused to give statements, considering that the two letters they had sent to the second applicant, their close relative, and the authorities should suffice (see paragraphs 16 and 22 above). It is not apparent that there is any evidence, beyond the two letters, which can be relied upon as identifying any persons still alive as having been involved in acts leading to the deaths of the applicants\u2019 relatives. As the Court has held on numerous occasions, the procedural obligation under Article 2 is not an obligation of result, but of means. What is relevant is that the domestic authorities have done all that could be reasonably expected of them in the circumstances of this particular case (see paragraph 68 above).",

The Court accepts that obstacles in the investigation into the killings during the war and post-war recovery were attributable to the overall situation in Croatia, a newly independent and post-war State which needed time to organise its apparatus and for its officials to gain experience (compare Pali\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 70).",
