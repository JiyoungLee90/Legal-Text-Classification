Municipalities were obliged to provide a person exposed to material hardship with a municipal apartment at a\u00a0regulated rent.

Where the alleged violation constitutes a\u00a0continuing situation in respect of which no domestic remedy is available, such as the application of the rent-control scheme in the present case, the six-month period starts to run from the end of the situation concerned (see Bitt\u00f3 and Others (merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a075). The Court held in the previous rent-control cases that the situation complained of ended for the applicants at the moment when the rent control had ceased to apply to their property or the applicants had transferred the property to another person (see Me\u010diar and Others v. Slovakia, no. 62864/09, \u00a7\u00a7 15-16, 10 January 2017). Applying these principles, the Court considers that the transformation of the ownership structure of the relevant apartment buildings had constituted the end of the situation complained of in respect of the flats which the applicants had ceased to own at that moment. It further observes that nothing had prevented the applicants to lodge their application with the Court within six months after the transformation of the ownership structure. The Court therefore rejects the part of the application no. 48691/17 concerning flats nos. 1, 15 and 17 at 102 \u0160ancov\u00e1 St. (Mr Badal) and flats nos. 2 and 3 at 21\u00a0Gr\u00f6sslingov\u00e1 St. (Ms\u00a0Stracov\u00e1), both located in Bratislava, as introduced out of time.",
