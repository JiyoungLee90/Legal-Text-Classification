They considered, firstly, that it was doubtful whether the group of Frisians qualified as a national minority. Under the declaration submitted by the German Government when signing the Framework Convention, only the Danes of German citizenship and members of the Sorbian people with German citizenship were recognised as national minorities in the Federal Republic of Germany. Conversely, the declaration merely stated that the Framework Convention also applied to the ethnic group of Frisians with German citizenship. It was thus clear from the wording of the declaration that the Frisians did not qualify as a national minority. \u00a0Even assuming that the ethnic group of Frisians had the status of a national minority, this did not necessarily entail the obligation to exempt the applicant party from obtaining the minimum threshold of 5% of the votes. There was no such obligation under the Basic Law or under the constitution of the Land of Lower Saxony or under the Framework Convention. Neither could such an obligation be derived from section 6 \u00a7 6 of the Federal Electoral Law (Bundeswahlgesetz), as the L\u00e4nder were competent to pass their own electoral laws without being bound by the Federal Law. The privileges enjoyed by the Danish Minority Party in the Land of Schleswig-Holstein did not allow any further conclusions, as the protection and promotion of the Danish minority was prescribed by the constitution of the respective Land. Finally, and again assuming the minority status of the ethnic group of Frisians, it was questionable whether the applicant party would qualify as the party of the Frisian national minority. The assessment of this question did not only depend on the party\u2019s vision of itself, but on an overall assessment of all factual and legal circumstances.",

The Constitutional Court observed, at the outset, that the relevant provisions did not allow for an exemption from the minimum threshold for national minorities. The Constitutional Court further considered that the minimum threshold interfered with the principle of equality of the vote. This interference was justified because it pursued the legitimate aim of safeguarding the functioning of the elected parliament. Parliamentary work within a democracy necessitated that the parliaments remain able to take decisions and that they were not inhibited in their work by the participation of splinter parties. The Constitutional Court further referred to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court regarding the 5% minimum threshold. There was no obligation under the Basic Law to exempt parties of national minorities from the 5% threshold. It was true that certain electoral laws provided for such exemptions. This was, in particular, the case with the Federal Electoral Law, which provided an exemption for parties of national minorities, and with the Electoral Laws of the L\u00e4nder of Brandenburg and Schleswig-Holstein, providing for exemptions for the parties of the Sorbian and the Danish minorities, respectively. However, both L\u00e4nder provided special rights for national minorities in their respective constitutions. No such provisions could be found in the Constitution of the Land of Lower Saxony. The Federal Constitutional Court had declared the respective provision in the Federal Electoral Law constitutional, even though the Basic Law did not contain special rights for national minorities. However, the Federal Constitutional Court had also emphasised that the legislator enjoyed a margin of appreciation in this respect. The Lower Saxony Constitutional Court finally considered that the alleged right could be derived neither from the European Convention on Human Rights nor from the Framework Convention. The European Convention on Human Rights did not contain any special rights for national minorities. Relying on the wording of Article\u00a015 of the Framework Convention, the court considered that this provision did not contain any obligation to exempt national minorities from the minimum threshold, but left the question undecided as to how to create the conditions necessary for the effective participation of persons belonging to national minorities in public affairs. It followed that the contracting parties enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in this respect. In Germany, participation of national minorities in public life was already guaranteed by the constitutional system. By including the 5% threshold in the Constitution of the Land of Lower Saxony without providing for an exemption, the Constitutional Assembly had given precedence to the functioning of the parliament over granting privileges to national minorities. Accordingly, the Lower Saxony Constitutional Court did not find it necessary to determine whether the Frisians qualified as a national minority and whether the applicant party qualified as the political party of this national minority.",

Regarding participation in elections of the L\u00e4nder, the Court notes that the Lower Saxony Constitutional Court found in the instant case (see paragraph \u00a014 above) that there was no obligation under constitutional law applicable in Lower Saxony to exempt parties of national minorities from electoral thresholds regarding elections in the Land. In the German Federal system the L\u00e4nder have sovereignty to regulate certain matters which they make use of in different ways. The decision of L\u00e4nder legislatures to include exemptions for national minority parties in their electoral law therefore does not have any implications for national minority parties outside their jurisdiction. It follows that the applicant party\u2019s situation is not analogous to that of the parties of the Danes and the Sorbs because the latter stand for elections in other L\u00e4nder and not in Lower Saxony.",

Greece, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044), would possibly call for different treatment. The Court accepts the applicant party\u2019s main argument that the number of Frisians in Lower Saxony is not high enough to reach the electoral threshold even if all Frisian voters were to cast their vote for the applicant party. However, the Court observes that the situation of the applicant party in this respect is basically similar to the situation of other parties which concentrate on the representation of numerical small interest groups defined by criteria such as age, religious belief and profession. The disadvantages in the electoral process is therefore based on the chosen concept of only representing the interests of a small part of the population, for which a Contracting State in general cannot be held responsible.",

The Court further observes that the Framework Convention, while acknowledging the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State in electoral matters, puts an emphasis on the participation of national minorities in public affairs (see Article 15 of the Framework Convention, paragraph 20 above). However, the possibility of exemption from the minimum threshold is merely presented as one of many options in this context. The Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention expressed the opinion that the potentially negative impact of minimum thresholds on the participation of national minorities in the electoral process needed to be duly taken into account. It considered that exemptions from threshold requirements had proved useful for enhancing national minority participation in elected bodies (see the commentary adopted by the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention on 27 February 2008, \u00a7 82, Council of Europe documents, paragraph 22 above). The position of the Venice Commission is likewise that electoral thresholds should not affect the chances of national minorities to be represented (see Council of Europe documents, paragraph \u00a023 above). However, as the Lower Saxony Constitutional Court observed in the instant case (see paragraph 14 above), no clear and binding obligation derives from the Framework Convention to exempt national minority parties from electoral thresholds. The States party to the Framework Convention enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in how to approach the Framework Convention\u2019s aim of promoting the effective participation of persons belonging to national minorities in public affairs as stipulated in Article 15. Consequently, the Court takes the view that, even interpreted in the light of the Framework Convention, the Convention does not call for a different treatment in favour of minority parties in this context.",
