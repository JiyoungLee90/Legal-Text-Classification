The lawyer insisted that the first of three prosecution witnesses, a neighbour, had seen a woman of Roma origin approaching and speaking with the victim, but that she was not in a position to recognize the individual. In addition, during the identity parades and in the courtroom, the second witness, another neighbour, had stated that she was not sure whether the applicant was the woman who had defrauded the victim. As for the third of these witnesses, the counsel for the applicant noted that she was the granddaughter of the victim and invited the court not to grant credit to her statements. The lawyer admitted that the applicant had previously been sentenced for theft. However, her last conviction was more than twenty years old.",

The reasons for the judgment were issued to the applicant in June 2006 and bore the signature of the professional judge who had presided over the District Court\u2019s trial. At the beginning of these reasons, among other personal information used to identify the applicant, such as her place and date of birth, her home address and her unique identification number, her Roma origin was also listed. In the fact-finding portion of the reasoning, the court found that the accused had entered the victim\u2019s home fraudulently, suggesting to her that her family had been struck by black magic which she could dispel. Taking advantage of G.S.\u2019s credulity, she took the money and jewellery that she then kept in her home. The court based these findings on the statements of the prosecution witnesses which it found to be consistent with the other evidence gathered. It did not retain the statements of the defence witness who had explained that the applicant had visited relatives in Zlatitsa in July 2005 and that she had consulted a doctor there. The court refused to take into account the medical certificate presented by the applicant: even if it was dated 12 July 2005, there was no date after its reference number, as is normally the case. Similarly, the doctor had affixed his stamp on the document, but it lacked the stamp of the hospital. The court found that the sentence should be three years\u2019 imprisonment because of the balance between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in this case. Among the aggravating circumstances, it mentioned the negative data on the applicant\u2019s personality, previous convictions, the absence of a stable job, the gravity of the alleged acts, the high amount of money taken by the applicant, and the operating mode thereof. The court held as a mitigating circumstance the advanced age of the applicant.",

It argued that the file contained no information which could lead to the conclusion that there was negative information on the applicant\u2019s personality. The applicant had received a pardon after her prior convictions, which obligated the courts to no longer consider her criminal record as an aggravating circumstance. Given the unemployment rate in the country and the age of the applicant, the lack of a stable job could not be considered as such a circumstance. As for the gravity of the events, this was part of the very characteristics of the penal infraction for which the conviction had been made, which prevented the courts from taking up the same argument for also arguing it as an aggravating circumstance. Moreover, according to the consistent legal precedents of the domestic courts, the amount of the money appropriated was not significant. The decision of the courts not to suspend the execution of the applicant\u2019s sentence was motivated by her membership with a minority ethnic group. The applicant\u2019s counsel argued that this same motivation demonstrated the bias of the court that had sentenced her client.",

This last rule obligates the applicants to gather only the pleas normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal order to allow reparations for the alleged violations to be obtained (Kiiskinen v. Finland (dec.), no. 26323/95, ECHR 1999V (extracts)). Thus, Article 35 \u00a7 1 does not require the exhaustion of extraordinary or discretionary remedies and the decision taken as the result of such an appeal is not normally regarded as the \u2018final domestic decision\u2019 for the calculation of the six-month period (see, inter alia, Berdzenichvili v. Russia (dec.), no. 31697/03, ECHR 2004II (extracts)).

The Court is of the view that this assertion, taken together with the applicant\u2019s ethnic affiliation, was likely to inspire the public, as well as the applicant, with the sentiment that the court was seeking to impose, in this case, an exemplary sentence for the Roma community, by condemning to an effective sentence a person belonging to the same minority group.",

The Court, for its part, does not perceive any circumstances of an objective nature capable of justifying this situation. It wishes to stress in this respect the seriousness of the situation contested by the applicant, since, in contemporary European multicultural society, the eradication of racism has become a priority objective for all contracting States (see Sander v. United Kingdom, no. 34129/96, \u00a7 23, ECHR 2000 V). It further observes that the principle of equality of all citizens before the law is enshrined in the Bulgarian Constitution and that the Code of Criminal Procedure requires the courts to apply the criminal law uniformly vis-\u00e0-vis all citizens (see paragraph 16 above).
