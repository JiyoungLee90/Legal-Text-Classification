The article in question contained the author\u2019s opinions on developments as regards the Kurdish issue in Turkey and in the international arena up until 2004. In particular, the author stated his views on the role of Abdullah \u00d6calan and a number of organisations associated with the PKK in regional and international politics and political developments in Turkey. The Court has examined the passage cited in the indictment, the article in its entirety, and the photograph published in the newspaper. It considers that neither the article nor the photograph can be construed as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising, or as being capable of incitement to violence by instilling a deep-seated and irrational hatred against identifiable persons, which are essential elements to be taken into account. The Istanbul Assize Court, however, does not appear to have given consideration to any of the above. In sum, the Court considers that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression was not justified by \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons for the purposes of Article 10 of the Convention.",
