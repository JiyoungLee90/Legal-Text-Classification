In particular, instructions had been adopted aimed at ensuring that police staff strictly observe the relevant legislation and regulations when dealing with persons in custody. Efforts had also been made to step up professional training in order to improve the attitude of police officers towards detained persons. Nevertheless, the information gathered during the visit suggests that continued determined action is needed to combat ill-treatment by the police. The CPT recommends that a clear message of \u201czero tolerance\u201d of ill-treatment (whether of a physical or verbal nature) be delivered, from the highest level and through ongoing training activities, to all police officers. Police staff should also be reminded that no more force than is strictly necessary should be used when bringing persons presenting violent and/or agitated behaviour under control, be it at the time of apprehension or in a detention facility; once such persons have been brought under control, there can never be any justification for their being struck.",

This implies the existence of a clear reporting line, including the adoption of effective safeguards for protecting whistle-blowers. Police officers interviewed on this matter during the 2007 visit generally indicated that if they had reason to believe that colleagues had ill-treated a detained person, they would inform the head of the police station where the possible ill-treatment had occurred, despite the existence of special investigation teams whose task was to inquire into such cases. The CPT recommends that the Croatian authorities establish, within the police, a clear reporting line for information indicative of ill-treatment (which implies the obligation for staff to immediately forward such information to the competent authorities and services).",

At best, the head of the police station where the person making the allegation had been detained would be asked to provide information concerning the alleged ill-treatment. The CPT recommends that whenever a detained person brought before a judge alleges ill-treatment by police officers, these allegations be recorded in writing, a forensic medical examination be immediately ordered, and the necessary steps be taken to ensure that the allegations are properly investigated. Such a procedure should be followed whether or not the person concerned bears visible external injuries. Moreover, even in the absence of an express allegation of ill-treatment, judges and prosecutors should adopt a proactive attitude; for instance, whenever there are other grounds to believe that a person could have been the victim of ill-treatment, a forensic medical examination should be requested. If necessary, the law should be amended to reflect these principles.\u201d",

Russia (dec.), no. 1721/07, 31 May 2011). In particular, the Court has considered it indispensable that persons who wish to bring a complaint about the ineffectiveness or lack of an investigation before the Court do not delay unduly in lodging their application. However, so long as there is some meaningful contact with the authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay by the applicants will not generally arise (see Mocanu and Others, cited above, \u00a7 269).",

In this regard, it is of importance for instance whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or abscond, cause injury or damage or suppress evidence (see Raninen v.
