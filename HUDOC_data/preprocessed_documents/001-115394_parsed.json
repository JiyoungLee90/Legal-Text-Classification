I.E. was delivered a land certificate for 938\u00a0m\u00b2 of land. In 1993, in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure in force at the material time, the Lankaran Prosecutor\u2019s Office intervened in the applicant\u2019s favour and lodged a court action against Lankaran Inventory Office and I.E., asking the court to annul the erroneous records of the Lankaran Inventory Office and the land certificate delivered to I.E. The applicant participated in the proceedings as a co-plaintiff. On 21 January 1999 the Masalli District Court upheld the request. The court ordered that the Commission\u2019s decision of 23\u00a0September 1992 and the subsequent registrations by the Lankaran Inventory Office be annulled. Pursuant to the domestic law in force at the material time, the judgment became enforceable ten days after its delivery.

According to the applicant, owing to the domestic authorities failure to ensure the enforcement of the judgment in question, a part of her land plot had been used by her neighbour during that time. She could not prevent her neighbour from doing so, as the official document determining the size of her land plot was erroneous and in spite of the courts\u2019 judgment, the domestic authorities failed to correct the mentioned errors in official records.",

However, that right would be illusory if a \u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see\u00a0Hornsby v. , 19\u00a0March\u00a01997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II).",

The Court further notes that a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances.
