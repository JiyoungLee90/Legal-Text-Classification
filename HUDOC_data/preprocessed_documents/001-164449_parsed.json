Owing to the richness of legal culture in Europe, which is precious and should be safeguarded, there is no single model which applies to all countries. While respecting this variety of legal systems, the Venice Commission recommends that states which have not yet done so consider the establishment of an independent judicial council or similar body. In all cases the council should have a pluralistic composition with a substantial part, if not the majority, of members being judges. With the exception of ex-officio members these judges should be elected or appointed by their peers.",

While in that opinion it was recommended that a majority of the HJPC members should be elected by the judiciary, the Venice Commission has never been in favor of systems where all members of the body were elected by the judges. Given that now the CDF [Council for Determination of Facts] has obtained very important powers in the sphere of the judges\u2019 discipline, it is recommended that a significant proportion of its members are appointed by democratically elected bodies, most preferably by the Parliament with a qualified majority of votes.

In the opinion of the Venice Commission, it is very important that the composition of the appellate judicial body be predetermined by law. Normally the disciplinary decisions should be reviewed by a judicial impartial body (Supreme Court of Cassation, Supreme Administrative Court, United Civil Panels of the Court of Cassation etc.), which decides with all the guarantees of the judicial proceeding. Hence, entrusting the power to a permanent court of law (instead of an ad hoc body) would probably be a preferable solution in this case.",

It is appropriate to note that with respect to disciplinary proceedings against judges, the need for substantial representation of judges on the relevant disciplinary body has been recognised by the European Charter on the statute for judges (see paragraph 42 above) and by the opinions of the Venice Commission (see paragraph 43 above). The Court notes that Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)12 of the Committee of Ministers to member States, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 17 November 2010, recommends that the authority taking decisions on the selection and career of judges should be independent of the executive and legislative powers. With a view to guaranteeing its independence, at least half of the members of the authority should be judges chosen by their peers (see paragraph 48 above). In addition, Recommendation no. 6 of the evaluation report on Portugal by the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), adopted on 4 December 2015, recommends providing in law that not less than half the members of the High Council of the Judiciary should be judges chosen by their peers (see paragraph 50 above). The Consultative Council of European Judges, at its 11th plenary meeting (17-19 November 2010), adopted a Magna Carta of Judges which provides, inter alia, that the Council should be composed either of judges exclusively or of a substantial majority of judges elected by their peers (see paragraph 49 above).",

The decision of 30 September 2014 was taken by twelve of the seventeen members of the HCJ, of whom seven, including the President, were judges and five were non-judicial members.

Furthermore, with regard to the extent of the powers of the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Government maintained that it was not for the highest court to encroach on the discretionary powers of the administrative authorities (see paragraph 40 above). The Court notes that the appeal body reviews, from the perspective of lawfulness in the broad sense, compliance with Article 266 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution, which states that the administrative authorities must exercise their powers in accordance with, among other principles, the prohibition on acting in excess of those powers (see paragraph 40 above). The Court concludes from this that the Supreme Court of Justice adopts a restrictive approach to the scope of its own jurisdiction to review the disciplinary activities of the High Council of the Judiciary.",

Sweden, no. 28394/95, \u00a7 37, 12\u00a0November 2002; Pursiheimo\u00a0v. Finland (dec.), no. 57795/00, 25\u00a0November 2003; and \u015eahin Karako\u00e7 v.

Accordingly, even where a court has jurisdiction to review the case both as to facts and as to law, the Court cannot find that Article 6 always requires a right to a public hearing irrespective of the nature of the issues to be decided. There are other considerations, including the right to trial within a reasonable time and the related need for expeditious handling of the courts\u2019 caseload, which must be taken into account in determining the need for a public hearing (see Varela Assalino v. Portugal (dec.), no.\u00a064336/01, 25 April 2002). The Court has already found that proceedings devoted exclusively to legal or highly technical questions may comply with the requirements of Article 6 even if there was no public hearing (see Jurisic and Collegium Mehrerau v.

As regards the protection of the applicant\u2019s dignity, the Court stresses that she herself asked that a hearing be held in public (see Oluji\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 74). The Court also observes that, according to the available international-law materials, the interest of the public in being properly informed about the developments of the disciplinary proceedings in many cases should outweigh the private interest of the judge in keeping certain details confidential (see paragraph 47 above). The Supreme Court of Justice justified its refusal to call a witness whom the applicant wished to have questioned by stating that the request for evidence to be taken from the witness was aimed at establishing the content of the draft decision in the applicant\u2019s disciplinary case, which ran counter to the confidentiality of the proceedings, and that the documents submitted by the applicant exceeded the scope of the disciplinary proceedings (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above). However, although it is not its task to express a view on the relevance of that evidence or whether the allegations against the applicant were well-founded, the Court considers that the witness evidence in question was relevant in the present case in so far as it would in all likelihood have supported the applicant\u2019s defence. Furthermore, the reasons given by the Supreme Court of Justice were insufficient to justify the refusal to hear evidence from the witness whose attendance the applicant sought to obtain, which led ultimately to a limitation of the applicant\u2019s ability to defend her case, in breach of the guarantees of a fair trial (compare Oluji\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83-85). The Court further considers that the Supreme Court of Justice, in refusing to hear evidence in public from the witness called by the applicant in the present case, did not ensure the transparency which that procedural act would have lent to the disciplinary proceedings against her and which is among the aims pursued by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Mehmet Emin \u015eim\u015fek, cited above, \u00a7 28). Lastly, the Court notes that in the instant case the Supreme Court of Justice did not remedy the refusal to hold a hearing in public (see, mutatis mutandis, Oluji\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a076).",

In the Court\u2019s view, a public hearing, open and accessible to the applicant, as she had requested, was necessary in the present case.

I assume that this phrase was not included merely incidentally. It reflects the requirement, which goes without saying in all cases, that the Court, when not awarding compensation for pecuniary damage, has to pay heed to all the actual circumstances of that particular case, and not mechanically copy the outcome of an earlier case, the factual and legal circumstances of which may be different.

Moreover, that \u201cone\u201d violation, in fact and in law, encompassed three aspects (see paragraphs 80, 89 and 99 of the judgment). As a result of enforcement of that decision, which infringed the Convention in three respects, the applicant was not paid her salary for the period in question. Had that decision not been adopted or had it been (for some hypothetical reason) not enforced, she would have been paid her salary, due to the fact that there was no other reason for withholding it.
