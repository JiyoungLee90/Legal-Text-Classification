Secondly, the Court notes that the relevant decisions did not contain any argument capable of showing that these fears were wellfounded. Such a generally formulated risk flowing from the nature of the offences with which the applicant was charged may possibly be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings.
