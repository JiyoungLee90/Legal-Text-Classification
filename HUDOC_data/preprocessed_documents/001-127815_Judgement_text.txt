The case originated in an application (no. 36261/08) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Stanislav Zavodnik (“the applicant”), on 25 July 2008.
The applicant was represented by Ms A. Grad Pečnik, a lawyer practising in Celje. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 16 December 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Ravne Na Koroškem.
On 21 December 1992 the applicant instituted proceedings before the Ljubljana Court of Associated Labour (Sodišče združenega dela v Ljubljani) concerning his disability allowances.
Between 17 March 1993 and 28 June 1994 when the Convention came into force in respect of Slovenia, the court held three main hearings.
7 Between 21 February 1994 and 16 May 1996 the court sent to the applicant’s employer ten requests to provide information on the calculation of the allowances that the applicant had been receiving.
On 12 November 1996 the court held a main hearing and requested the defendant’s auditor to establish, on the basis of documentation, the information that the applicant’s employer had failed to submit.
At the hearing on 17 October 1997 the court established that the defendant’s auditor failed to fulfill the task delegated by the court and decided to appoint an expert on finance.
On 13 May 1998 the expert on finance submitted his opinion to the court.
On 10 October 1998 the (renamed) Ljubljana Labour and Social Court (Delovno in socialno sodišče v Ljubljani) held a hearing and issued its decision, dismissing the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed.
On 11 November 1999 the Higher Labour and Social Court granted the applicant’s appeal and remitted the case back to the first instance court.
After three hearings had been held between 22 March 2001 and 3 September 2002 the Ljubljana Labour and Social Court issued its decision, dismissing the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed.
On 22 August 2005 and 22 September 2005 the applicant urged the Higher Labour and Social Court to issue a decision.
On 24 November 2005 the Higher Labour and Social Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law.
On 2 October 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal.
