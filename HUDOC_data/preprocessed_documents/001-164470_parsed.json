The Swiss authorities must assume jurisdiction even in cases where the connection with our country is very tenuous, where it is impossible to bring proceedings or to lodge an appeal abroad. It is for the claimant or the appellant to demonstrate this impossibility. Where this evidence has been adduced, jurisdiction reverts to the authority of the locality with which the case has a sufficient connection. Where there are several competing fora in Switzerland, it is the first authority before which an action is brought that has jurisdiction. Clearly, the impossibility of bringing and pursuing proceedings abroad can only be examined in the light of the tangible circumstances and of the possible consequences for the individual concerned in the particular case; it will ultimately be for the court to recognise, or not, its jurisdiction\u201d ....",

In addition, the failure of a State party to execute judgements providing reparative measures for a victim of torture, handed down by national, international or regional courts, constitutes a significant impediment to the right to redress.

The Committee also notes the complainant\u2019s assertion that article 14 applies irrespective of the places of the acts of torture; and that, because the Australian courts have not declined jurisdiction on the ground of forum non conveniens, the State party is required to afford an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation.

They refer to the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment in the Ferrini case (6\u00a0November 2003, 11\u00a0March 2004), which concerned Germany\u2019s responsibility for the claimant\u2019s arrest in Italy and his deportation to Germany during the Second World War, and also to a series of subsequent judgments against Germany delivered by the Italian courts during the period from 2004 to 2008. One of those judgments authorised enforcement in Italy of a judgment by a Greek court ordering Germany to compensate the victims of the Distomo (Greece) massacre of 10 June 1944. These Italian judgments were at the origin of the ICJ\u2019s decision of 3\u00a0February 2012 in the case Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy, Greece (intervening)), Reports ICJ, 2012, p.\u00a099), which found that Italy had violated the customary international law guaranteeing jurisdictional immunity to States.

Saudi Arabia ([2006] UKHL 26), the House of Lords held that Article 14 of the Convention against Torture did not provide for universal civil jurisdiction, and that there was no evidence that States had recognised an international-law obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction over claims arising from alleged breaches of peremptory norms of international law. Equally, there was no consensus of judicial and learned opinion that they should. The House of Lords distinguished the Jones case from another case previously examined by it, namely Pinochet (no. 3), concerning the former Chilean dictator, on the ground, specifically, that the Pinochet case concerned criminal proceedings which fell squarely within the universal jurisdiction mandated by the Convention against Torture (see \u00a7\u00a7 25-32 of the judgment). The House of Lords thus found no reason to set aside the applicability of the rule laying down absolute State immunity for acts committed by their representatives acting in their official capacity. That case subsequently came before this Court, which held that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see Jones and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a034356/06 and 40525/06, 14\u00a0January 2014).",

However, this jurisdiction is subject to the condition that the victim is a Canadian citizen or is a permanent resident of Canada, or that the civil action has a \u201creal and substantial connection to Canada\u201d. In contrast, universal jurisdiction does not apply to actions in respect of damage sustained as a result of other violations of international law, including torture (except where it is shown that it took place in the context of acts of terrorism). In the case of Bouzari v. Islamic Republic of Iran ([2004] OJ No. 2800 Docket No. 38295), the Ontario Court of Appeal held that Article\u00a014 of the Convention against Torture did not create an obligation on Canada to ensure civil-law remedies for acts of torture committed outside its territory. In that case, the plaintiff, a Canadian of Iranian origin, brought a claim for compensation before the Canadian courts on the grounds that he had been tortured by representatives of the Iranian State. The Appeal Court endorsed the lower court\u2019s finding that there was no real and substantial connection between the Province of Ontario and the contested proceedings. It concluded that a sufficiently widespread international practice did not exist among the States to justify recognising the civil jurisdiction of the Canadian courts in the situation before it.",

It has also been applied in Canada in recent years, but subject to strict conditions (see paragraph 60 above). In the States which apply this concept, it is, as in Switzerland, subject to strict conditions, which have to be met cumulatively, namely the inability to bring the dispute before the courts of another State and the existence of a certain connection between the facts of the dispute and the requested forum State (see paragraph\u00a065 above).

Referring to that decision, the Committee took a stand again in the case of Z. v. Australia (2014), cited in paragraph\u00a043 of the judgment. In that case, the complainant criticised the Australian courts for having dismissed her tort claim against the Chinese authorities for acts of torture committed in China, on the grounds that foreign government officials enjoyed immunity from civil liability. The Committee dismissed the communication without examining the issue of immunity, considering that \u201cin the specific circumstances of this case, the State party is unable to establish jurisdiction over officials of another State for alleged acts committed outside the State party\u2019s territory\u201d (\u00a7 6.3).",

In my opinion, these concluding observations concern the fact that the Canadian courts do not have jurisdiction for claims in respect of acts of torture committed abroad, even if these acts are committed by Canadian perpetrators or against victims who are Canadian. Nothing is said about the Canadian courts\u2019 jurisdiction (or lack of jurisdiction) in respect of acts of torture committed abroad by foreign perpetrators who are not resident in Canada against non-Canadian victims who were not resident in Canada at the material time.",

In this sense, the present judgment represents a significant regression, even compared to the above-cited Al-Adsani judgment (in which, inter alia, no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was found). It is regrettable that this judgment is akin to a tacit encouragement, by the highest human-rights court in Europe, of the denial of justice.",
