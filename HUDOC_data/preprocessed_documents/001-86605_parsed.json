On 9 July 2004 the applicant's victim status in the criminal proceedings related to the kidnapping of her husband was withdrawn. She was informed at that stage that her husband had been detained by military servicemen and he had been subsequently released. The detention had been carried out in accordance with the Federal Law on the Suppression of Terrorism and the Federal Law on the Federal Security Service. According to the Government, on 2 June 2002 military servicemen, acting in accordance with section\u00a013 of the Suppression of Terrorism Act, had detained Said-Magomed Imakayev on suspicion of involvement in one of the bandit groups active in the district. However, his involvement had not been established, and he had been transferred to the head of the Shali administration (who had subsequently died) with a view to being returned home. Thus, no abduction had been committed and the actions of the servicemen who had detained Mr Imakayev had not constituted any offence. Mr Imakayev's further absence from his place of residence was not connected to his detention by military servicemen, so the applicant had suffered no pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage. The Government did not submit any documents of substance from the investigation file concerning Said-Magomed Imakayev's abduction.",

Turkey (dec.), nos. 62566/00 et seq., 10 January 2002). Special considerations may apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period may be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of those circumstances (see Bulut and Yavuz v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 73065/01, 28 May 2002).",

A civil court is unable to pursue any independent investigation and is incapable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings regarding the identity of the perpetrators of fatal assaults or disappearances, still less of establishing their responsibility (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-121, 24 February 2005, and Estamirov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).

The circumstances in which a deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27\u00a0September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, \u00a7\u00a7 146-147). In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivation of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances (see, among other authorities, Av\u015far, cited above, \u00a7 391).",

Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",
