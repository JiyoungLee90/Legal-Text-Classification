He submitted a vast number of documents, claiming that the historical background of the measures taken under the Soviet occupation command had to be evaluated anew. In particular, the 1946 and 1947 provisions on which the measures against his father had been taken could now be qualified as criminal prosecution. New research had shown that their objective was to punish individual Germans for alleged wrongdoing. The applicant requested, inter alia, that the 1946 decisions to find his father guilty of being a Nazi and the subsequent decisions to expropriate him and confiscate his personal property and the property belonging to his company be declared contrary to the rule of law and hence void. According to the applicant, the value of his restitution claims amounted to about ninety million euros.",

Making use of its margin of appreciation, the Regional Court refrained from holding a hearing since, contrary to its prior opinion, there was no longer any additional benefit to be gained for dealing with the case. In fact, the scheduling of the hearing had been used to create the impression in a press release, also published on the internet, that by calling a hearing the Regional Court had indicated that it was abandoning its settled case-law. Furthermore, the press release had announced that the applicant would use the hearing to \u201creveal an important part of contemporary history\u201d.

The aim of the applicant\u2019s request to the Dresden Regional Court was essentially to rehabilitate his father\u2019s reputation and have annulled the decisions to expropriate and confiscate his father\u2019s property according to section\u00a01 and section\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Criminal Rehabilitation Act (see paragraph 13 above). The Court has frequently held that the right to enjoy a good reputation is a \u201ccivil right\u201d in the meaning of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 (see, among other authorities, Werner v. \u00a0Poland, no.\u00a026760/95, \u00a7\u00a033, 15\u00a0November 2001). Likewise, proceedings with the aim of reversing an expropriation by the State are considered a \u201cdetermination of civil rights\u201d (see Aldo and Jean-Baptiste Zanatta v. \u00a0France, no.\u00a038042/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02425, 28\u00a0March 2000 with reference to Guillemin v. France, 21\u00a0February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I). The Court is thus satisfied that the rights in question were \u201ccivil\u201d in character, in the autonomous sense of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. This provision is therefore applicable to the proceedings in issue and this has not been disputed before the Court. On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s contention that it has been violated was contested by the Government.",

The possibility of refraining from hearing the concerned party in person was not limited to rare, exceptional cases (with reference to Fexler v.

In his application to the Regional Court the applicant had not raised any question of fact or law which could not be dealt with adequately on the basis of the file. The documents handed in were not sufficient proof to alter the case-law of the Regional Court as to the general assessment of the case, particularly as regards the character of the expropriation proceedings and the issue of whether the applicant\u2019s father had been subject to an arrest warrant.",

Moreover, it was foreseeable that the applicant\u2019s lawyers would not allow themselves to be stopped by the court limiting their right to speak. Likewise, it was obvious that an audience, comprised of persons who had also been affected by expropriation, would be irritated should it become aware that the court considered the statements already announced by the applicant\u2019s lawyers to be irrelevant.
