If an examination was considered invasive, oral consent was not sufficient. In any case, the procedure could always be stopped.

The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no.\u00a023380/09, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2015). Any interference with human dignity strikes at the very essence of the Convention. For that reason any conduct by law-enforcement officers vis-\u00e0-vis an individual which diminishes human dignity constitutes a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. That applies in particular to their use of physical force against an individual where it is not made strictly necessary by his conduct, whatever the impact on the person in question (ibid, \u00a7\u00a7 100-101).",

The pursuit of remedies which do not satisfy the requirements of Article 35 \u00a7 1 will not be considered by the Court for the purposes of establishing the date of the \u201cfinal decision\u201d or calculating the starting point for the running of the six-month rule. It follows that if an applicant has recourse to a remedy which is doomed to failure from the outset, the decision on that appeal cannot be taken into account for the calculation of the six-month period (see Jeronovi\u010ds v.

Hungary, no. 64602/12, \u00a7\u00a7 60-65, 12\u00a0April 2016, and Borb\u00e1la Kiss v. Hungary, no. 59214/11, \u00a7\u00a7 25-27, 26\u00a0June 2012). Furthermore, in the present case, the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the presumed perpetrators and a further complaint against the discontinuation order obtained at first instance. Those proceedings were capable of leading to the identification and, if appropriate, punishment of those responsible. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant was not required to also pursue the matter by way of an appeal in the course of a substitute\u00a0private prosecution concerning the same event, which would have had the same objective as his criminal complaint (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis,\u00a0Borb\u00e1la Kiss, cited above, \u00a7 26, 26 June 2012, and\u00a0Matko v.\u00a0Slovenia, no.\u00a043393/98, \u00a7 95, 2 November 2006).

It is true that the authorities were prepared to treat the applicant\u2019s allegations seriously and not dismiss them outright. During the investigations, the applicant was questioned as to his version of the events which had occurred in the police station. The investigating authorities interviewed the persons involved, including the police officers, the driver on duty and the medical staff, assembled the relevant evidence, including the medical reports, and took other steps in order to establish the circumstances of the incident. Thus, it cannot be said that the authorities did not make a genuine attempt to eliminate the discrepancies between the applicant\u2019s specific statements and the police officers\u2019 statements, but rather that, following the examination, they decided to give preference to the police officers\u2019 account of the events.",

The Court also has doubts as to whether the applicant, being in the hands of the authorities and in their complete control, had any option in practice but to undergo the impugned procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, Y.F. v. Turkey, no.\u00a024209/94, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2003IX). The Court reiterates that with the exception of certain situations not applicable in the present case, the domestic law requires informed consent as a prerequisite of any medical intervention (see paragraph\u00a028 above). It also observes that although the domestic authorities accepted that the applicant had given his consent to the catheterisation, they had no regard to the question whether taking a person\u2019s shouting \u201cdo the catheterisation\u201d as agreement to a medical intervention while that person was under the influence of alcohol was compatible with the requirement of informed consent laid down in domestic law.",

In this respect, the Court also notes that, from a medical point of view, there was a possibility to interrupt the catheterisation once it had started (see paragraph 22 above).",

The Court accepts that the police officers deemed it necessary to determine the blood alcohol level of the applicant and to find out whether he was under the influence of drugs, as he was a road user. However, for the Court the recourse to a catheterisation was unnecessary in the light of the fact that the police officers also proceeded with the taking of a blood sample for the same purposes. Moreover, catheterisation was not a generally accepted and applied measure in the context of domestic practice and in comparison to blood tests, there was no clear stance as to the utility of the measure in obtaining evidence of drug-related offences (see paragraphs\u00a018 and 22 above).",

The manner in which the impugned measure was carried out was liable to arouse in the applicant feelings of insecurity, anguish and stress that were capable of humiliating and debasing him. Furthermore, there is no material that would allow the Court to conclude that the officers paid any consideration to the risk the procedure could have entailed for the applicant. Although it cannot be established that this was the intention, the measure was implemented in a way which caused the applicant both physical pain and mental suffering. He has therefore been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3.",
