The applicants were represented by Mr A. Alizade (applications nos. 20411/11 and 20443/11), Mr F. Agayev (application no. 24070/11), Mr H. Hasanov (applications nos. 29604/11, 29615/11, 31944/11, 36070/11, 36209/11, 36227/11, 36230/11 and 37554/11) and Mr R. Mustafayev (application no. 39042/11), lawyers practising in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Asgarov.
On 30 August 2013 (application no. 20411/11), 15 October 2013 (applications nos. 20443/11, 24070/11, 29604/11, 29615/11, 31944/11, 36070/11, 36209/11, 36227/11 and 36230/11), 18 November 2013 (application no. 37554/11) and 9 December 2013 (application no. 39042/11) the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants’ years of birth and places of residence are listed in the Appendix.
The circumstances of the case are similar to those in Gahramanli and Others v. Azerbaijan (no. 36503/11, §§ 6-32, 8 October 2015).
The applicants were independent or opposition candidates in the parliamentary elections of 7 November 2010 (see Appendix). All the applicants lost the elections in their respective constituencies.
After election day, the applicants lodged complaints with the Central Electoral Commission (“the CEC”) concerning a number of irregularities in their respective constituencies that had allegedly taken place during and/or before election day. Some of them also lodged identical complaints with the respective Constituency Electoral Commissions (“the ConEC”). They complained about various types of irregularities, including, inter alia, interference by public officials, illegal campaigning, obstruction and intimidation of election observers, ballot-box stuffing, repeated voting by the same individuals, irregularities in applying election ink, incorrect votecounting procedures, inconsistencies in precinct election results records indicating a falsely inflated voter turnout, and so on. In support of their allegations, the applicants submitted various types of evidence documenting specific instances of the irregularities complained of, including statements made by election observers, video recordings and photographs.
The applicants who lodged a complaint with the relevant ConEC did not receive any reply from those bodies (except in applications nos. 37554/11 and 39042/11). All of the applicants’ complaints were examined by the CEC, which, on various dates (see Appendix), issued decisions rejecting the applicants’ claims, providing reasoning similar to that in the CEC decision in Gahramanli and Others (cited above, §§ 21-26).
The applicants lodged further complaints with the Baku Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which, on various dates (see Appendix), dismissed the applicants’ appeals providing reasoning similar to that in their respective decisions in Gahramanli and Others (cited above, §§ 27-32).
In the meantime, before the Supreme Court delivered its final decision on each complaint, on 29 November 2010 the Constitutional Court had confirmed the countrywide election results, including the election results in the applicants’ constituencies, as final (ibid., § 30).
The relevant domestic law and international documents concerning, inter alia, the system of electoral commissions and procedures for examination of electoral disputes, as well as observations made during the 2010 parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan, are summarised in Gahramanli and Others (cited above, §§ 33-50).
