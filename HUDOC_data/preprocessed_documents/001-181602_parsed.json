The first-instance court, relying on section 133 of the Labour Act, held that the applicant and his employer had concluded a fixed-term contract lasting until 31 May 2009 and that the applicant must have known that his contract would end on that day. He had not concluded a new contract of employment with his employer and he had therefore been obliged to lodge an application for the protection of his rights with his employer within the fifteen-day time-limit, starting from 1\u00a0June\u00a02009. However, he had failed to do so and consequently his claim had been lodged out of time. Rejecting the applicant\u2019s argument, the firstinstance court also held that the defendant company had not been obliged to adopt a formal decision on terminating his employment or to send him any other kind of notification, given that he must have known that his contract would come to an end on 31 May 2009.",

In that case the court, in accordance with the instructions and opinion given in Supreme Court decision no.

The Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case, the applicant, having put forward the issue in substance in his constitutional complaint, did thus raise the complaint which he has submitted to the Court before the domestic courts (see Ja\u0107imovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 22688/09, \u00a7 40, 31 October 2013).

However, that finding contradicts the established case-law of the Supreme Court developed in the application of that provision. The Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence shows that when an employee asks a court to recognise that he or she has concluded an openended contract of employment, such a claim is of a declaratory nature within the meaning of section 187 of the Civil Procedure Act and, as such, is not subject to deadlines. Namely, the procedural requirement for lodging a declaratory claim is the existence of a legal interest in bringing such a claim before a court and not an obligation to lodge an application with the employer for the protection of the right that has allegedly been violated (see\u00a0paragraphs 20 and 21 above).",

In that connection, the Court first reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in cases where it finds that an applicant has not had the kind of fair hearing required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention would, as a rule, be to reopen the proceedings in due course and reexamine the case in keeping with all the requirements of a fair hearing (see, for example, Lungoci v. Romania, no. 62710/00, \u00a7 56, 26\u00a0January\u00a02006; Yanakiev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 40476/98, \u00a7 90, 10 August 2006; Lesjak v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a025904/06, \u00a7 54, 18 February 2010; and Kardo\u0161 v. Croatia, no.\u00a025782/11, \u00a7\u00a067, 26 April 2016). In that connection, the Court notes that under section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 17 above), the applicant can now lodge an application to reopen the proceedings which were brought before the Ivani\u0107 Grad Municipal Court and in respect of which the Court has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.
