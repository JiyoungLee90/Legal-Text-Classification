The latter category concerns criminal offences of a lesser nature.\u00a0The Serbian legal system also envisages the injured party acting as a subsidiary prosecutor. In respect of criminal offences for which the prosecution is to be undertaken by the public prosecutor, where the said official declines to prosecute on whatever ground, the injured party may take over the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor. In contrast, a private prosecution is undertaken from the beginning by a private prosecutor (see paragraphs 30-33 above). In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that in the present case domestic law afforded the applicant adequate protection.",

On 2\u00a0March 1998 the \u0160abac Public Prosecutor indicted P.V. on suspicion of having committed the crime of severe bodily injury. At the hearing of 11\u00a0January 2000 a medical expert stated that the available documentation indicated that on 2 September 1997 the applicant had sustained a concussion as well as a contusion. She had also continued receiving medical treatment for another two months. On 15 June 2000 the Municipal Court convicted P.V. as charged and sentenced him to four months imprisonment, suspended for a period of one year. On 20 June 2001 the \u0160abac District Court quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. Between 3 March 2004, that being the date of entry into force of the Convention in respect of Serbia, and 11\u00a0July 2007 the Municipal Court appears to have held or adjourned a total of six hearings, the latter for reasons which cannot be imputed to the applicant\u2019s conduct (see paragraphs 19-23 above). Ultimately, having in the meantime obtained an additional medical opinion to the effect that the attack had caused the applicant severe bodily injuries (i.e. a concussion and a contusion of the zygomatic bone), on 5 September 2007 the Municipal Court terminated the proceedings against P.V. as time-barred (see paragraphs 21 and 24 above).",

In view of this finding, as well as the fact that the applicant personally had not contributed to the delay at issue, some three and half years after ratification, the Court considers that the impugned practices in the specific circumstances of the present case did not provide adequate protection to the applicant against an attack on her physical integrity and showed that the manner in which the criminal law mechanisms were implemented were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention.",
