He also requested the appellate court to hear T.Y. and N.S., claiming that the first-instance court had ignored their witness statements without any reason. The applicant further complained about the conflicting explanations given by the investigator and the Nasimi District Court as to the impossibility of obtaining video recordings from the NDPO\u2019s security cameras. Whereas the investigator had explained that those cameras were simply for surveillance purposes and did not record, the first-instance court had indicated in its decision that the impossibility was due to the absence of memory cards in the security cameras, which led to automatic deletion of the video recordings one month later.",

The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government.

The forensic report, established following a medical examination of the applicant on 6\u00a0April 2011, concluded that the injury had been inflicted by a hard blunt object at a time corresponding to 2 April 2011 (see paragraph 15 above).

In these circumstances, the Court considers that the respondent Government have failed to discharge their burden of proof and to submit a plausible explanation refuting the applicant\u2019s account of events and the medical evidence submitted. The statements provided by the different police officers questioned by the investigator were all drafted in an identical manner, despite the officers having been questioned separately, and no face-to-face confrontation was organised between the applicant and those officers (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above and paragraph\u00a052 below). Therefore, the Court has no reason to doubt the applicant\u2019s account of events and finds that the injury found on his body was sustained in police custody as a result of the use of force by the police on 2\u00a0April\u00a02011.",
