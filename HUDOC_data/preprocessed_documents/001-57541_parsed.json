Nonetheless, in 1969, the number of applications for leave to appeal had risen to approximately 9,700 and by March 1970 applications were being made at the rate of over 1,000 a month. As a matter of practice, it was almost unknown for a single judge to give directions for loss of time. On 17 March 1970, the Lord Chief Justice (Lord Parker C.J.) issued a Practice Direction drawing attention to the fact that the sheer volume of applications was leading to unacceptable delays which could not be tolerated in respect of applications which had merit (1970 1 All England Law Reports 119). He therefore announced that because facilities for advice on appeals were available to appellants, almost without exception, under the legal aid scheme, the single judge should have no reason to refrain from directing that time should be lost if he thought it right so to exercise his discretion in all the circumstances of the case. The stated aim of the exercise of the Court\u2019s power in this manner was \"to enable prompt attention to be given to meritorious cases by deterring the unmeritorious applications which stand in their way\". Within a fortnight the number of applications fell by 50 per cent to approximately 500 cases per month.",

Whilst the loss of time ordered by the Court of Appeal is not treated under domestic law as part of the applicants\u2019 sentences as such, it does form part of the period of detention which results from the overall sentencing procedure that follows conviction. As a matter of English law, a sentence of imprisonment passed by a Crown Court is to be served subject to any order which the Court of Appeal may, in the event of an unsuccessful application for leave to appeal, make as to loss of time. Section 29(1) of the 1968 Act is couched in rather wide and flexible terms. However, the power of the Court of Appeal to order loss of time, as it is actually exercised, is a component of the machinery existing under English law to ensure that criminal appeals are considered within a reasonable time and, in particular, to reduce the time spent in custody by those with meritorious grounds waiting for their appeal to be heard; this is made patently clear in the 1965 report of the Interdepartmental Committee on the Court of Criminal Appeal and in the two Practice Directions issued by the Lord Chief Justice (see paragraphs 29, 30 and 31 above). In sum, it is a power exercised to discourage abuse of the Court\u2019s own procedures.

It was pointed out in argument that under the law of many of the Convention countries detention pending a criminal appeal is treated as detention on remand and a convicted person does not start to serve his or her sentence until the conviction has become final. In such systems, the appellate court itself determines the sentence and, in some of them, exercises a discretion in deciding whether or to what extent detention pending appeal shall be deducted from the sentence (see, for example, as far as the Federal Republic of Germany is concerned, the Wemhoff judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 7, p. 12, \u00a7 15, and Series B no. 5, pp. 232 and 268).
