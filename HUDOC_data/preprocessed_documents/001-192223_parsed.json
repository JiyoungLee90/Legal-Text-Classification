However, that fact alone is not sufficient to support a finding that he was ill-treated during that period (see and compare with Savchenko v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 1574/06, \u00a7\u00a099, 22\u00a0September 2016).",

There is therefore no explanation as to why the applicant and his lawyer failed to request a medical examination and to report the injuries if there were any (see Yuriy Volkov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a045872/06, \u00a7 51, 19 December 2013). Furthermore, the wording used by the applicant\u2019s lawyer in his cassation appeal suggests for the Court that in fact he had had no account of the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment to be conveyed on his client\u2019s behalf. Thus, the lawyer alleged in broad terms that the applicant had confessed to the aggravated murder under duress, relying only on the fact that the latter had made his \u201cstatement of surrender to the police\u201d on the premises of the Dnipropetrovsk Region criminal investigation department (see paragraph 34 above).",

In particular, when the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3\u00a0sq. m of floor surface in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises (\u00a7 137). In cases where a prison cell \u2013 measuring in the range of 3 to 4 sq. m of personal space per inmate \u2013 is at issue, the space factor remains a weighty factor in the Court\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of conditions of detention. In such instances a violation of Article 3 will be found if the space factor is coupled with other aspects of inappropriate physical conditions of detention (\u00a7 139). Where a detainee had at his or her disposal more than 4 sq. m of personal space in multi-occupancy accommodation in prison and where therefore no issue with regard to the question of personal space arises, other aspects of physical conditions of detention remain relevant for the Court\u2019s assessment of adequacy of an applicant\u2019s conditions of detention under Article 3 of the Convention (\u00a7 140).",

Thus, shortly before the applicant\u2019s confession, the police had conducted a search at his home and had seized several items of his clothing with a view to their \u201cbeing adduced to the investigation material\u201d (see paragraph 19 above).
