He had been admitted to the hospital as a voluntary inpatient on 2 April 2000 because he had attempted to commit suicide. She alleged that he had made another attempt over the Easter weekend when he was at home with her. The fact that her son had been able to leave the hospital grounds on 27\u00a0April 2000 had led the applicant to conclude that the hospital staff had acted negligently in the performance of their duties. Because of his suicide attempts and mental condition, her son should have been under medical supervision and the hospital staff should have prevented him from leaving the hospital grounds. She maintained that her son\u2019s suicide had been caused by the poor organisation of the hospital services. The poor organisation was reflected in three aspects: a) the lack of fencing around the boundaries of the hospital, which allowed inpatients to leave the hospital easily without any supervision, b) the lack of a mechanism for checking the presence of inpatients which would allow the hospital staff to notice an absence immediately, and c) the lack of an emergency procedure capable of detecting an inpatient\u2019s absence, which would allow the hospital staff to adopt the effective measures required to ensure that the inpatient was returned safely without endangering the lives of others or his own life. The applicant relied on the specific background leading to A.J.\u2019s hospitalisation since the beginning of April as well as details from his clinical record, notably his repeated excessive consumption of alcohol, his mental illness, and his earlier suicide attempt. She maintained that on account of all those circumstances, the monitoring measures should have been enhanced in order to prevent him from leaving.",

In these circumstances inpatients would be forbidden from leaving the pavilion and would remain in their pyjamas. Dr E.R.

In this regard, the court pointed out that over the years the applicant\u2019s son had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and major depression. However, it was only after his death and as a consequence of an expert opinion requested from the Medical Association during the proceedings (see paragraph 33 above) that a probable diagnosis of borderline personality disorder had been made. The court established that A.J. had last been admitted as an inpatient after a suicide attempt. However, it considered that despite the possibility that inpatients diagnosed with mental diseases such as those of the applicant\u2019s son might commit suicide, during the last days before his death he had not shown any behaviour or mood which could have led the hospital staff to suspect that 27 April 2000 would be different to the preceding days.",

It was not possible to affirm that his suicide had been predictable, nor was there anything in the case file that could have justified the adoption of the involuntary treatment procedure in the days preceding the tragedy, since it was not foreseeable that he would commit suicide.

On the basis of information before the Court it appears that different types of patients were hospitalised in these different buildings depending on their gender and the type and extent of their illness. The grounds of the HSC were not bordered by security fences or walls of any other kind. The buildings were surrounded by green areas with trees and other vegetation, and the different buildings were accessed by means of roadways and paths, which were also surrounded by trees and other vegetation. The main entrance to the HSC had a barrier and a security guard. One of the possible exits from the hospital grounds led to a shortcut towards a railway station platform. This shortcut was accessed by taking the road behind building no. 9. The station platform was around a fifteen to twenty-minute walk from that part of the HSC\u2019s grounds.",

Inpatients under the restrictive regime were generally dressed in pyjamas and a dressing gown, while inpatients under the general regime seem to have had a free choice as to what they wore. It appeared that inpatients were often kept on the restrictive regime at the beginning of a hospital stay, even if they were admitted on a voluntary basis. There was an isolation room for inpatients who were very agitated and aggressive and this room could also be used for voluntary inpatients.",

States parties must offer to institutionalized persons programmes of treatment and rehabilitation that serve the purposes that are asserted to justify the detention. Deprivation of liberty must be re-evaluated at appropriate intervals with regard to its continuing necessity.

In addition, the risk had been exacerbated by the open and unrestricted access to the railway platform. The hospital staff might have been expected to adopt more safeguards to ensure that A.J. did not leave the grounds.

The care team, made up of doctors and nurses, had met every day to discuss each patient. Following his admission on 2\u00a0April 2000, and for approximately one week, A.J. had been confined to the pavilion, dressed in pyjamas and a dressing gown. Since an improvement in his condition had been noted, a less restrictive regime had been applied and during the second and third weeks of April 2000 he had been allowed to leave the pavilion after having informed the duty nurse.

This approach was neither in conformity with current thinking in psychiatry, nor did it reflect relevant international legal norms on the matter. The best approach, according to the Government, was to accompany each patient personally with the least restrictive approach to hospitalisation, if possible providing treatment in the community; if not, within an open regime where the patient retained the right to move about freely.

The latter indicated that mental-health care should be provided in the least restrictive environment possible. These general principles mirrored the therapeutic desire to create an open regime where the patient retained the right to move about freely. This approach is in line with the international standards which have been developed in recent years on treating psychiatric patients (see the International Law section above and see also Hiller, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054). The Court further notes that the domestic legislation, the Mental Health Act of 24\u00a0July 1998\u00a0(see paragraph\u00a058 above) provides for the possibility of involuntary hospitalisation where this may be justified by the specific needs of the patient.

Quality of law under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see J.N. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a037289/12, \u00a7\u00a077, 19\u00a0May 2016 and the references therein). The purpose of the regulatory framework requirement under Article 2 being different, namely providing the necessary tools for the protection of a patient\u2019s life, the lack of a written policy on the use of restraint measures is not determinative of its efficiency and does not in itself warrant a finding that Article 2\u00a0was breached. Moreover, it cannot be forgotten that A.J. was admitted as a voluntary inpatient and the applicant\u2019s complaint does not relate to the particular period during which her son was under a restrictive regime.

A more restrictive surveillance procedure was also available, applied at the beginning of a patient\u2019s stay and at other times when considered necessary by the treating doctor (see paragraph\u00a054 above).

The Court considers that a psychiatric patient is particularly vulnerable even when treated on a voluntary basis. Due to the patient\u2019s mental disorder, his or her capacity to take a rational decision to end his or her life may to some degree be impaired. Further, any hospitalisation of a psychiatric patient, whether involuntary or voluntary, inevitably involves a certain level of restraint as a result of the patient\u2019s medical condition and the ensuing treatment by medical professionals. In the process of treatment, recourse to further kinds of restraint is often an option. Such restraint may take different forms, including limitation of personal liberty and privacy rights. Taking all of these factors into account, and given the nature and development of the case-law referred to in paragraphs 108-115 above, the Court considers that the authorities do have a general operational duty with respect to a voluntary psychiatric patient to take reasonable measures to protect him or her from a real and immediate risk of suicide. The specific measures required will depend on the particular circumstances of the case, and those specific circumstances will often differ depending on whether the patient is voluntarily or involuntarily hospitalised. Therefore, this duty, namely to take reasonable measures to prevent a person from selfharm, exists with respect to both categories of patient. However, the Court considers that in the case of patients who are hospitalised following a judicial order, and therefore involuntarily, the Court, in its own assessment, may apply a stricter standard of scrutiny.",

These stays generally followed crises or alcoholic intoxication, while only the last stay followed an attempted suicide. The domestic courts established that A.J. had suffered from several mental illnesses caused by a pathological addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs. It was also accepted that he sometimes suffered from depression. Following his death, the courtappointed psychiatrist (see paragraph 33 above) considered it possible that A.J had also suffered from a borderline personality disorder. Secondly, as to the gravity of A.J\u2019s mental health problems, it is clear, that A.J. had suffered from serious mental health problems over a long period (see Renolde, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0109).",

Five hearings were held during which the domestic court heard numerous witnesses and subjected the collected evidence to a comprehensive review. The Court accepts therefore that A.J. had not displayed signs of suicidal thoughts throughout his stay at the HSC from 2 April 2000 onwards (see Hiller, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052). The applicant argued in the domestic proceedings that A.J. had attempted to commit suicide again on 25 April 2000 by an excessive consumption of alcohol. This assertion was rejected by the domestic courts, which found that his behaviour leading to his being taken to the emergency department of the Coimbra University Hospital on 26 April 2000 had been \u201creckless\u201d but not suicidal (see paragraph 40 above). The domestic courts reached this conclusion on the basis of comprehensive, relevant and persuasive analysis of the evidence which it had considered carefully. The Court accepts the domestic court\u2019s finding in respect of this episode, taking into account the fact that A.J. was a chronic alcoholic and that the drinking had occurred in the afternoon and mainly at a caf\u00e9. It accepts therefore the finding that A.J. attempted to commit suicide once - on 1\u00a0April 2000 - over three weeks before his death.",

However, the Court also observes that while A.J. was vulnerable, he was in an environment which he had come to know well, interacting with staff whom he knew and who knew him. When the HSC considered that the risk he might pose to himself had diminished he was given the freedom to move around the HSC buildings and grounds and to return home for weekends to spend time with his family. There is no evidence to suggest that the family objected to A.J.\u2019s weekends at home. When the risk was considered high, he was confined to the pavilion, in his pyjamas, and subject to a more restrictive regime. This had been the case after he was admitted to the HSC on 2\u00a0April 2000, when he spent the first week of his stay under the more restrictive regime (see paragraph\u00a018 above) and on previous occasions in the past when he was hospitalised. However, the restrictive regime was always lifted when it was considered that A.J.\u2019s symptoms were improving. This was in line with the HSC\u2019s general philosophy of giving patients a considerable degree of freedom of movement in order to increase their responsibility and optimise their return to their family environment and society itself. The Court has no reason to question the assessment of his treating psychiatric doctor, Dr.\u00a0A.A., accepted by the domestic courts, that A.J.\u2019s treatment, which consisted of taking his prescribed medication, receiving the treatment voluntarily, and establishing a relationship of trust (see paragraph 35 above) was appropriate and proportionate in the circumstances.",

In the present case, the HSC sought to adapt to the risk posed by A.J.\u2019s changing mental state by increasing or decreasing the monitoring regime in place. This was a decision which was taken by the team responsible for him (see paragraph 35 above). The Court refers to the factors enumerated in paragraphs 127-129 above. In addition, it takes into account the fact that according to the expert evidence, complete prevention of suicide in patients such as A.J. was an impossible task (see paragraph 33 above) and that the Coimbra Administrative Court found that A.J.\u2019s suicide was not foreseeable (see paragraph 40 above). Moreover, the Court approaches the question of risk with a view to assessing whether it is both real and immediate and notes that the positive obligation incumbent on the State must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. In the light of these elements, the Court concludes that it has not been established that the authorities knew or ought to have known that there was an immediate risk to A.J.\u2019s life in the days preceding 27 April 2000.",

The expert appointed had to wait over eight months for the court to send him the necessary elements for the establishment of his report. On 9 November 2007 the court set the hearing down for 8 October 2008. The procedural delay meant that the witnesses were questioned five years after the applicant brought the claim, and eight years after the facts took place. The applicant referred to further delays, namely, the time which elapsed between the proceedings being transferred to the Supreme Administrative Court on 11 October 2011 and the report of the Deputy Attorney General on 26\u00a0September 2012, as well as the delivery of the judgment by the Supreme Administrative Court on 29 May 2014.",

The right to life prevails over the right to liberty, especially when the psychopathological condition of the individual limits his or her capacity for self-determination. It is nothing but pure hypocrisy to argue that the State should leave vulnerable suicidal inpatients in State-run psychiatric hospitals free to put an end to their lives merely in order to respect their right to freedom. At the end of the day, what really drives the majority is not the concern for more or less freedom of psychiatric inpatients interned in public hospitals, but the strict financial interest in safeguarding the hospital authorities from legal challenges to \u201cexcessively restrictive measures\u201d, while \u201cbearing in mind the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources in providing public healthcare and certain other public services\u201d. Ultimately, this reflects a hidden social-welfare disengagement policy, which aims at the maximum commodification of health-care services and above all at the protection of health professionals in an untouchable legal bubble, shirking State responsibility for health-system and hospital-related death or serious injury under the Convention and consequently limiting the Court\u2019s jurisdiction in this area.

IT surveillance helps to detect and deter poor care and monitor care standards. It creates a welcoming environment where people can be confident they will receive decent care. IT surveillance can be applied only to the common parts of the facilities and, if necessary, to bedrooms and service users\u2019 private premises.

Worse still, the majority\u2019s onesided approach to international health law and practice is patent, since they consider the trend that favours the liberty of freedom of psychiatric inpatients, but forget to ponder the counter-voices to that trend which warrant an increased State commitment to suicide prevention, especially regarding people under State supervision, and even more regarding institutionalised psychiatric patients.",
