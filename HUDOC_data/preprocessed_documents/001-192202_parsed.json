Nonetheless, as explained above (see notably paragraphs 111 and 117-120), Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 does not exclude the conduct of dual proceedings, even to their term, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. In particular, for the Court to be satisfied that there is no duplication of trial or punishment (bis) as proscribed by Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, the respondent State must demonstrate convincingly that the dual proceedings in question have been \u201csufficiently closely connected in substance and in time\u201d. In other words, it must be shown that they have been combined in an integrated manner so as to form a coherent whole. This implies not only that the purposes pursued and the means used to achieve them should in essence be complementary and linked in time, but also that the possible consequences of organising the legal treatment of the conduct concerned in such a manner should be proportionate and foreseeable for the persons affected.\u201d",

The applicant\u2019s conduct and his liability under the different provisions of tax and criminal law were thus examined by different authorities and courts in proceedings that were largely independent of each other.",

Moreover, the applicant was indicted on 17 December 2012, seven months after the final decision was taken by the Directorate of Internal Revenue and about four months after it acquired legal force. The criminal proceedings then continued on their own for one year and five months: the District Court convicted the applicant on 28 June 2013, more than a year after the decision of the Internal Revenue, and the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment was not pronounced until almost one year later.",

It does not alter this conclusion that the Directorate of Tax Investigation accepted in November 2010 the applicant\u2019s request to postpone its decision on possible criminal proceedings until the Directorate of Internal Revenue had issued its notification letter on the reassessment of the applicant\u2019s taxes.
