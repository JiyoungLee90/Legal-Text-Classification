Moreover, the judge held that the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the poor quality of the food and drinking water and the lack of food and personal hygiene facilities were unfounded, as: (i) the food at the prison was prepared and stored on the basis of guidelines set by the Ministry of Justice; (ii) the quality of the drinking water had been found to comply with legal requirements according to an expert report of the Apa Nova water testing laboratory; (iii) the applicant had access to the prison facilities necessary to ensure his personal hygiene; and (iv) he was under an obligation to clean and air his room in accordance with the daily schedule for detainees. The judge also held that there was no evidence that the general living conditions for detainees as provided for in Law No. 275/2006 had not been met in the applicant\u2019s case. Finally, the judge held that the applicant was being provided with adequate medical care. He was kept under medical surveillance, was prescribed the medical treatment that the doctors considered appropriate for his medical condition and, in addition, his request to be treated at A.D.\u2019s natural private clinic at his own expense had been examined according to the relevant legal provisions. The judge also rejected the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation, finding that the applicant could not bring a claim for compensation on the basis of the procedure provided for by Law No. 275/2006 and that he therefore had to bring separate proceedings seeking compensation.

Moreover, the fact that the applicant might have raised these issues before domestic courts did not imply that he wished to raise a similar complaint before the Court. In his application before the Court the applicant had failed to provide details about the conditions of detention he had been faced with personally and had been content to refer to the conditions of detention described by a different applicant in a separate case.
