The case originated in an application (no. 9566/10) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Jarosław Dombrowski (“the applicant”), on 22 January 2010.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant complained, in particular, that he had been deprived of access to the Supreme Court.
On 7 July 2010 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court decided that the case should be examined by a Chamber.
The applicant was born in 1970.
On 25 September 2008 the Łódź  convicted the applicant of attempted murder and sentenced him to 9 years’ imprisonment. On 11 December 2008 the Łódź Court of Appeal quashed the firstinstance judgment and remitted the case. On 3 March 2009 the Łódź  found the applicant guilty of causing grievous bodily harm and sentenced him to 5 years’ imprisonment. The applicant’s lawyer appealed. By a judgment of 4 June 2009 the Łódź Court of Appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment.
Throughout the judicial proceeding the applicant was represented by a legalaid lawyer.
By a letter of 3 August 2009 the lawyer informed the court that he had not found any grounds on which to prepare a cassation appeal.
By a letter of 7 August 2009 the court forwarded the lawyer’s statement to the applicant. The letter read as follows:
 “The Registry of the Łódź Court of Appeal forwards [...] a copy of a statement of your legal-aid lawyer, advocate Mr P.K., submitted in accordance with Article 84 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for your information.”
The letter as well as the opinion were served on the applicant on 12 August 2009.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the procedure for lodging cassation appeals with the Supreme Court against judgments of the appellate courts are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Kulikowski v. Poland, no. 18353/03, §§ 19-27, ECHR 2009... (extracts) and Antonicelli v. Poland, no. 2815/05, §§ 14-22, 19 May 2009).
In particular, on 26 February 2002 the Supreme Court examined a situation where a legal-aid lawyer had refused to represent a convicted person for the purposes of cassation proceedings, finding that a cassation appeal would offer no prospects of success. It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the timelimit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer’s refusal and not on the earlier date when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself. It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with a legal-aid lawyer’s refusal had the right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for effective lodging of a cassation appeal (III KZ 87/01). The Supreme Court reiterated its position in a decision of 6 May 2008 (II KZ 16/08) and in a number of similar decisions given in 2008.
In its decision of 25 March 1998 the Supreme Court stated that the refusal of a legalaid lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal did not constitute a valid ground for granting retrospective leave to lodge such an appeal by another lawyer out of time (V KZ 12/98). It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could only assign a new legal-aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success. If this were not the case, a court was not obliged to assign a new legalaid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal (III KZ 139/99). The Supreme Court reiterated its position in a number of other decisions (e.g. II KZ 11/02, II KZ 36/02).
