Under the domestic law, supervision was a regime for providing assistance to adults who were not incapable of acting, but merely needed advice or supervision in the conduct of their civil affairs. The regime was intended to preserve the pecuniary interests of protected adults who were under a general incapacity. Supervision orders were made when persons acted in a manner that exposed them to a risk of \u201cbecoming needy or unable to fulfil their family obligations\u201d. Unlike persons subject to a guardianship order, protected adults under supervision were not considered as being in need of constant representation but as people whose situation meant that they required advice, and even supervision, in the conduct of certain civil affairs (Article 508 of the Civil Code \u2013 see \u201cRelevant Domestic Law and Practice\u201d above). Thus, with regard to property, persons subject to a supervision order were empowered to take protective measures, to perform administrative acts and to perform certain acts disposing of property of limited value. As regards other spheres, they were entitled, inter alia, to be registered on the electoral register and vote. They were also at liberty to change their address (the reference to the need for the applicant's representation in court proceedings appeared only in the reasoning of the judgment of 29 March 1995 and not in the operative provisions, which indicated that the judge had not intended representation within the meaning of Article 492 of the Civil Code, otherwise he would have made a guardianship order in respect of the applicant).",

That signified that the inability of persons under supervision to take part in court proceedings was restricted to civil proceedings and did not affect their rights and obligations or the procedure in the criminal courts. Thus, the situation of an adult subject to a supervision order could not be equated with that of a person lacking in discernment and incapable of performing, understanding or complying with his or her obligations under the criminal law. It was for that reason that the law made no provision for supervisors (who, moreover, were not parties to the proceedings) to be informed and supervisors had no power to represent the persons under their supervision at the hearing. The same rule applied when, as in the instant case, in which the applicant had been ordered to pay damages to the minors concerned, a civil claim was joined to criminal proceedings. Furthermore, it was a general principle of domestic law that civil provisions such as Article 510 were not applicable to proceedings in the criminal courts.",

At stake in those proceedings was the right to liberty, a right whose importance in a democratic society has been consistently emphasised by the Court (see, among other authorities, Winterwerp, cited above, pp. 16-17, \u00a7 37).
