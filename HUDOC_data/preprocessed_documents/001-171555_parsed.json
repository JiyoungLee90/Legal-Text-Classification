He also submitted that he had not even lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers. It was on the basis of the above statements, the witness evidence which confirmed the fact that the police officers had used force against A.V. when he had resisted arrest, the statements of the accused, and the lack of injuries on A.V.\u2019s body, that the firstinstance court concluded that the force used by the police officers during the arrest had not been disproportionate in the circumstances.",

The Court considers that those who have responsibility for deciding on the guilt or innocence of an accused ought, in principle, to be able to hear the victims, the accused and the witnesses in person and assess their trustworthiness (see, a contrario, Kashlev v. Estonia, no. 22574/08, \u00a7\u00a7 48-50, 26 April 2016). The assessment of trustworthiness is a complex task which cannot usually be achieved merely by reading a record of their words, even more so when only some of the words are taken into consideration. Of course, there are cases where it is impossible to hear someone in person at the trial because, for example, he or she has died, or in order to protect the right of a witness not to incriminate himself or herself (see Craxi v. Italy (no. 1), no.\u00a034896/97, \u00a7 86, 5 December 2002, and Dan v. Moldova, no. 8999/07, \u00a7\u00a033, 5 July 2011). However, that was not the case here.",
