A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify his or her continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a023393/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030 and 32, 13\u00a0March 2007; McKay\u00a0v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a0543/03, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2006-X; Jab\u0142o\u0144ski\u00a0v.

The Court reiterates that previous convictions could give a ground for a reasonable fear that the accused might commit a new offence. A judge may take into account the seriousness of the consequences of criminal offences when there is a question of taking into account the danger of seeing such offences being repeated, in order to decide if the person concerned can be released (see Matznetter v. Austria, 10\u00a0November 1969, \u00a7 9, Series A no. 10). In the present case the Russian courts took care to point in their decisions to the seriousness and repeated nature of the criminal offences in question, and the Court agrees with their decision to attach particular importance thereto given extreme difficulties experienced by the national authorities in Europe, while targeting, tracking, arresting and bringing drugs criminals to court (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramanauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a074420/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049 and 53, ECHR 2008 and Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR 2006IX). The Court is therefore prepared to accept that the Russian courts thoroughly evaluated the risk of the applicant reoffending. That fact created a strong presumption against the application of alternative measures of restraint in his case.",

The Court does not lose sight that arguments for and against release must not be general and abstract (see Clooth v. Belgium, 12 December 1991, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 225). It reiterates that the Russian courts did not cite any particular instance when the applicant had tried to contact, outside the established legal venues, a witness in the course of the criminal proceedings. There was also no evidence that he had ever made an attempt to flee justice. At the same time, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant had the criminal history of being involved in drug trafficking and was again charged with another count of that offence. The Court notes the domestic courts\u2019 emphasis on the short period which had passed between the previous conviction of the applicant for the drug trafficking and his new arrest. It also does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant\u2019s charges were later amended to include several counts of drug sale committed within an organised group (see paragraph\u00a013 above). In these circumstances the Court is prepared to accept that the Russian courts could have validly presumed that a risk existed that, if released, the applicant might abscond or interfere with the proceedings, given the nature of his alleged criminal activities (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k v. Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7 62, 16 January 2007).",

In this regard, the Court observes that the investigation was of certain complexity, regard being had in particular to the general difficulty of collecting evidence in drug-related offence (see Ramanauskas, cited above, \u00a7 49). An important element in the Court\u2019s assessment of the case is also the fact that after nearly twelve months of applying detention on remand the domestic courts held that the measure was no longer necessary, given the stage that the criminal proceedings had reached and the fact that the risks initially taken into account by the domestic courts were no longer relevant to authorise further detention. The Court notes that the applicant was released from detention on an alternative preventive measure, an undertaking not to leave his town, as soon as the investigation was completed, the case was remitted for trial and the risk of the applicant interfering with the proceedings in his case was brought to a minimum (see Vladimir Solovyev v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 115, 24 May 2007, and Mamedova v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 79, 1 June 2006).

The Court has on many occasions examined the effectiveness of the domestic remedies suggested by the Government in cases of applicants complaining of ongoing inadequate medical treatment, such as in the present case. It found, in particular, that in deciding on a complaint concerning breaches of domestic regulations governing the provision of medical care to detainees, the prison authorities would not have a sufficiently independent standpoint to satisfy the requirements of Article 35 of the Convention (see Koryak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079, and Dirdizov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075). The Court also stressed that even though review by a supervising prosecutor plays an important part in securing appropriate medical care in detention, a complaint to the supervising prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy because of procedural shortcomings that have been previously identified in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Koryak, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, cited above). Having assessed a civil claim for compensation under the tort provisions of the Civil Code, the Court considered that such a claim could not offer an applicant any redress other than a purely compensatory award and could not put an end to a situation where there is an ongoing violation, such as inadequate medical care (see Reshetnyak v. Russia, no. 56027/10, \u00a7\u00a7 65-73, 8 January 2013). Moreover, the Court found that such a remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities, which was extremely improbable in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed the application of a certain measure, for instance, certain conditions of detention or the level of medical treatment (see A.B. v. Russia, no. 1439/06, \u00a7\u00a096, 14\u00a0October 2010).",
