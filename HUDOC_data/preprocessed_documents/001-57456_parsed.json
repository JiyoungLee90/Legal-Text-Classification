Before the Board met, he had been visited by its chairman and warned that it would proceed in his absence; the records state that he understood this warning and the charges against him. It appears that he did not expressly seek either an adjournment of the Board\u2019s hearing or a consultation with a solicitor beforehand; under the then practice, a request of the latter kind would also have been unsuccessful (ibid.).",

As regards the latter allegations, which were disputed by the Government, the applicant had been certified by the medical officer, before both hearings, to be fit for punishment. The Commission concluded that it was not established that Mr. Campbell was prevented from attending rather than that he had decided, for his own reasons, not to attend; it proceeded on the assumption that his absence from the Board\u2019s hearing was a matter within his own responsibility.",

Albany Prison Board of Visitors, ex parte Tarrant ([1984] 1 All England Law Reports 799), the Divisional Court held that although there is no absolute entitlement to such representation, a Board does have a discretion to allow it. Furthermore, the prisoner has a right to require that that discretion be exercised and that his request for representation be properly considered on its merits; if the Board fails to exercise its discretion properly, its decision must be quashed.

In determining the nature of proceedings, account also had to be taken of their context and overall objective. Although an offence under the Rules might coincide with a crime under the general law and lead to a measure corresponding to a penalty or punishment, this did not transform the Board\u2019s adjudication into a criminal cause or matter. It was essentially a domestic disciplinary proceeding, which did not purport to deal with misconduct in its relation to the public law or the public interest and was designed and pursued with the limited objective of maintaining order within the confines of a prison. It would also be illogical and anomalous to regard as a criminal cause or matter proceedings arising from an offence under the Rules which did not amount to a criminal offence under the general law.",

Although prison disciplinary offences were offences against a private code, they were also \"penal\"; in principle, the relevant Rules should be construed no more harshly against a prisoner than would be appropriate were the offences criminal.

There was no binding authority as to whether certiorari would lie against disciplinary decisions of a Board of Visitors and the question had to be decided in the light of public policy. A Board\u2019s disciplinary functions were separate and independent from its other functions. When hearing disciplinary charges it was not imposing summary discipline as part of the day to day administration of the prison but was instead an independent body which could only punish a prisoner after a formalised inquiry and/or hearing. In doing so it was exercising a judicial function and its decisions were therefore subject to control by the courts by certiorari in appropriate cases. However, the remedy was discretionary and relief would be granted only where there had been a failure to act fairly, having regard to all the circumstances and such unfairness had given rise to a substantial, as distinct from a trivial or merely technical, injustice.",

It was only in their observations on the merits (13 December 1978) that the Government requested the Commission to reject, under Articles 26 and 29 (art. 26, art. 29) of the Convention, the complaints concerning those proceedings, on the ground that no application for certiorari had been made. The Commission, which had already, on 6 May 1978, declared these complaints admissible, found, on 14 and 19 March 1981, that there was no basis for the application of Article 29 (art. 29), that provision requiring unanimity.",

The Court notes that on 6 December 1977 it had been held by the Divisional Court in the St. Germain case that certiorari did not lie in respect of Board of Visitors\u2019 proceedings (see paragraph 39 (b) above). It would therefore have been difficult for the Government, a fortnight later, to plead before the Commission - contrary to the argument put to the Divisional Court by counsel for the Hull Prison Board of Visitors, who was instructed by the Treasury Solicitor - that this remedy was available. In contrast to the view expressed by the Commission\u2019s Delegate, the Court also considers that since the authorities had just succeeded in the domestic action, the Government could scarcely have maintained that this was an uncertain or unresolved issue in English law and that Mr. Campbell should therefore test the matter in the courts.",

It was clearly the 1978 judgment that prompted the Government to supplement their initial arguments and, in the particular circumstances, the Court does not consider that they could reasonably have been expected to raise the plea of non-exhaustion at an earlier stage (see the above-mentioned Artico judgment, ibid., p. 13, para. 27, third sub-paragraph).

It is true that leave may be granted to apply out of time and, indeed, the Government submitted that if Mr. Campbell had applied for leave soon after the Divisional Court\u2019s second judgment in the St. Germain case (15 June 1979), this would not have been refused; however, they conceded that it was predictable that he would not now obtain leave because his delay would be regarded as inordinate and inexcusable (see paragraphs 15, 40 and 41 above).

Confirmation that domestic law regards Board of Visitors\u2019 adjudications as falling outside the criminal sphere is to be found in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in the St. Germain case that they are not a \"criminal cause or matter\" (see paragraph 37 above). Lord Justice Shaw there expressed the view that such an adjudication was essentially a domestic disciplinary proceeding, which did not purport to deal with misconduct in its relation to the public law or the public interest and was designed and pursued with the limited objective of maintaining order within the confines of the prison. Indeed, the Court notes that it is for this precise purpose, amongst others, that the Home Secretary is empowered by section 47 (1) of the Prison Act 1952 to make rules (see paragraph 26 above). Nevertheless, the Court also notes that certain parallels between Board of Visitors\u2019 proceedings and criminal proceedings were drawn in the McConkey and the Tarrant cases (see paragraph 37 in fine above).",

Secondly, the illegality of some acts may not turn on the fact that they were committed in prison: certain conduct which constitutes an offence under the Rules may also amount to an offence under the criminal law. Thus, doing gross personal violence to a prison officer may correspond to the crime of \"assault occasioning actual bodily harm\" and, although mutiny and incitement to mutiny are not as such offences under the general criminal law, the underlying facts may found a criminal charge of conspiracy (see paragraph 30 above).

Lord Reid quoted deprivation \u2018of rights or privileges\u2019 as being of equal importance, and I respectfully agree with him. Whether remission is a right or a privilege is in my opinion immaterial. It is only necessary to consider the case of [X], who was ordered to forfeit 720 days.

However, the Court is of the opinion that the forfeiture of remission which Mr. Campbell risked incurring and the forfeiture actually awarded involved such serious consequences as regards the length of his detention that these penalties have to be regarded, for Convention purposes, as \"criminal\". By causing detention to continue for substantially longer than would otherwise have been the case, the sanction came close to, even if it did not technically constitute, deprivation of liberty and the object and purpose of the Convention require that the imposition of a measure of such gravity should be accompanied by the guarantees of Article 6 (art. 6).

The impression which prisoners may have that Boards are closely associated with the executive and the prison administration is a factor of greater weight, particularly bearing in mind the importance in the context of Article 6 (art. 6) of the maxim \"justice must not only be done: it must also be seen to be done\". However, the existence of such sentiments on the part of inmates, which is probably unavoidable in a custodial setting, is not sufficient to establish a lack of \"independence\". This requirement of Article 6 (art. 6) would not be satisfied if prisoners were reasonably entitled, on account of the frequent contacts between a Board and the authorities, to think that the former was dependent on the latter (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Piersack judgment, Series A no. 53, p. 15, para. 30 in fine); however, the Court does not consider that the mere fact of these contacts, which exist also with the prisoners themselves, could justify such an impression.",

Such a course would undoubtedly occasion difficulties of greater magnitude than those that arise in ordinary criminal proceedings. A Board\u2019s adjudications are, as befits the character of disciplinary proceedings of this kind, habitually held within the prison precincts and the difficulties over admitting the public to those precincts are obvious. If they were held outside, similar problems would arise as regards the prisoner\u2019s transportation to and attendance at the hearing.

For us, the sit-down in which the applicant took part was just such a typical violation of prison discipline. It is, of course, possible to stage such incidents outside prisons but in a prison setting they take on a special and grave character. Forceful resistance to orders to move from certain premises is also an act that, although it can happen in many places, has its own characteristics when it occurs in prisons. It seems to us, therefore, that in this case the incident that led to the proceedings against the applicant was a typical example of a prison disturbance that is and should as a rule be met with disciplinary measures.",

The sanctions can be divided into two groups. In the first group are sanctions that consist of excluding prisoners from associated work, of stopping their earnings and of sending them into cellular confinement, in each case for a period not exceeding 56 days. Of these, we find only the last to raise any problem. Cellular confinement can have a serious impact on the person who is subject to it. However, it should be taken into account in this connection that this sanction is one of the traditional methods of prison discipline and that prisoners have already been deprived of their liberty. For these reasons we do not find it possible to interpret the words of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention in such a way that they oblige States not to use this sanction as a non-criminal, disciplinary measure in prisons. The second group of sanctions risked by Mr. Campbell consisted of forfeiture of certain privileges and of forfeiture of remission of his sentence. According to the relevant rules these forfeitures were not limited in time except that they could not exceed the original sentence. These rules are set out in more detail in paragraphs 28 and 29 of the judgment of the Court to which we refer. It is clear that \"forfeiture of certain privileges\" does not bring a case automatically from the disciplinary into the criminal sphere. We have more doubts concerning the forfeiture of remission of sentence. Obviously, the applicant had been sentenced to a specific period of imprisonment and this had been decided by the court which sentenced him. On the other hand, it is the general practice in England that, upon starting to serve a prison sentence, the prisoner is given an estimated date for release which is calculated by taking one-third of the sentence off the time stated in the sentence itself. In fact, the rules on remission are applied in such a way that a prisoner is released after serving two-thirds of his sentence unless a forfeiture has been awarded in disciplinary proceedings. Prisoners can thus expect to receive the benefit of the system of remission if they are of good behaviour: the rules governing the time involved are well-established and it is also rather clear what can change the prospects of being given remission. Thus, disciplinary proceedings can result in a considerable prolongation of the time actually served in prison. In spite of that, we have come to the conclusion that this cannot deprive the proceedings against the applicant of their disciplinary character. This is because the time spent in prison could not exceed the period fixed by the original sentence and because remission is an integral part of a system that is upheld by disciplinary measures.",

The applicant has argued that Article 6 (art. 6) is applicable under the latter head. We find that this issue has to be examined only in connection with a possible right to remission of sentence. Even if it were assumed that remission is a right rather than a privilege, we do not think it possible to call it a \"civil right\" in the context of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. Remission and forfeiture of remission are typical disciplinary matters. Consequently, we find that we are here on the disciplinary side of the line between disciplinary proceedings and proceedings concerning civil rights and obligations.",

In its judgment of 8 June 1976 in the case of Engel and Others, the Court recognised that the Convention allows the Contracting States to make a distinction between disciplinary proceedings and criminal proceedings and to draw the dividing line, provided that \"the disciplinary does not improperly encroach on the criminal\" and \"lead to results incompatible with the purpose and object of the Convention\" (Series A no. 22, pp. 33-34, paras. 80-81).",

Nevertheless, applying the criteria stated in its Engel and Others judgment and in its judgment of 21 February 1984 in the Ozt\u00fcrk case (Series A no. 73, pp. 17-18, paras. 48-50), the Court has reached the conclusion that Article 6 (art. 6) was applicable to the disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Campbell. Even applying these criteria, the Court is wrong, in my opinion, in characterizing as \"criminal\" for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6) charges which, as regards both the offences and the sanctions concerned, were essentially of a disciplinary nature. As a result, the Court has extended the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) to proceedings to which I do not consider they were intended to be applicable.",

There might be conduct which, although theoretically it could constitute both criminal and disciplinary offences, should properly be dealt with as criminal, as for example the murder of a prison officer. But the acts of which Mr. Campbell was accused, consisting of collective insubordination and defiance of prison authorities albeit with the use of violence on his part, were, though serious, clearly of a disciplinary character and appropriately charged as such.",

In particular, remission of part of a sentence of imprisonment is granted to a prisoner under section 25 (1) of the Prison Act 1952 on the ground of industry and good conduct. Forfeiture of remission has a correspondingly disciplinary function. Like the other awards which may be made under the Prison Rules 1964 for disciplinary offences, it is not a sanction of a kind which belongs to the \"criminal\" sphere. The loss of remission awarded by the Board of Visitors in Mr. Campbell\u2019s case was severe, but it did not and could not cause his term of imprisonment to exceed that to which he had been sentenced and thus it remained within the disciplinary sphere.",
