To control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers; there were numerous clashes between the two sides. At 5.30 p.m. the police ordered the meeting to finish early and began to disperse the participants. It took them about two hours to clear the square.",

He passed the metal detectors and joined other protestors in front of the stage, where a rock group was performing. Sometime after 6 p.m. he walked towards Malyy Kamenyy Bridge but discovered that movement in that direction had been blocked by a police cordon. The applicant walked back, staying in the general area; at around 7.30 p.m. groups of police officers started pushing into the crowd, forcing it apart by using their truncheons. Protestors were surrounded and squeezed together. At some point the applicant realised that he was facing the police line and that the police were using excessive force to arrest protestors. The applicant was both angered and scared by the actions of the police and actively resisted. He was eventually seized by four police officers and escorted to a police car, which took him to a police station.",

In addition, the court relied on information obtained from undercover sources that the applicant had connections with football fans and groups of anarchists.

He has therefore complied with the six-month rule. Nonetheless, the applicant has not specified whether he was held in a glass cabin or a metal cage during the appeal hearing. Likewise he did not describe, even in a summary manner, the arrangements in it, such as the dimensions of the cabin or cage, the amount of space afforded to each defendant in it, or whether there was any ventilation or possibility to consult counsel. In those circumstances, the Court is not in a position to rule on the applicant\u2019s complaint about alleged ill-treatment on account of the courtroom arrangements during the appeal hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Topal v. the Republic of Moldova (dec.), no. 37509/05, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 18 March 2014).

The Court reiterates that while Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for detention within criminal proceedings, Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention deals with the possible justification for such detention. Moreover, according to the Court\u2019s established case-law under the latter provision, the persistence of a reasonable suspicion is a sine qua non for the validity of continued detention (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2016 (extracts)).

In addition, the courts did not refer to any concrete facts underlying the fear of him absconding or perverting the course of justice, and those risks were assessed in an abstract and hypothetical way.

In describing his participation in the mass disorder, they merely referred to his use of violence against a police officer, also classified as a separate criminal offence (see, by contrast, Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, \u00a7 178, where chanting anti-government slogans by the applicant constituted participation in acts of mass disorder).",

Just as in Yaroslav Belousov (cited above, \u00a7 179), there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the applicant was among those responsible for the onset of clashes between the protesters and the police. As far as can be discerned from the indictment, he hit the police officer at the height of the clashes, when the police were already arresting protesters, an act which, according to him, was in response to the indiscriminate and unnecessary use of force by the police. The domestic courts did not establish the particular circumstances in which that behaviour occurred and dismissed the applicant\u2019s arguments about excessive use of force by the police as unfounded while leaving his allegations unrebutted. The Court concludes that the applicant was not regarded as one of the individuals responsible for the disruption of the assembly or prompting the use of force by the police. The applicant\u2019s conduct therefore, although involving violence, was sporadic in nature and, in the light of the domestic courts\u2019 findings, did not attain the degree of aggression which the Court has found in other cases to amount to violence calling for resolute measures, in particular the subsequent sentencing of people to lengthy prison terms (see, by contrast, Primov and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a017391/06, \u00a7\u00a7 156-63, 12 June 2014, and Osmani and Others v. the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001).",

While the Court does not endorse the applicant\u2019s violent behaviour and reiterates that the State authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation in sanctioning such actions (see G\u00fclc\u00fc, cited above, \u00a7 116, and Taranenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a081-97), it considers that the reasons advanced by the Government could not justify a three-year prison sentence for participation in mass disorder under Article 212 of the Criminal Code.

Russia, no. 71386/10, \u00a7 252, ECHR 2013 (extracts).

Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, \u00a7\u00a0150, ECHR 2015). This principle is based on the very important condition that demonstrators should not engage in acts of violence. The very fact of violence, regardless of the consequences, contradicts the spirit of peaceful assembly.",

The majority, although recognising that the applicant\u2019s behaviour was violent, based their conclusion on the disproportionate nature of the criminal sanction, taking into account the incidental involvement of the applicant in the clashes and the absence of serious consequences for the health and life of the police officers. I personally agree that the sanction was disproportionate; however, the severity of the sanction relates mainly to the criminal policy of the State, and not to the freedom of peaceful assembly. The applicant was convicted for the violence and participation in the mass disorder, and not for participation in the demonstration itself. Although the applicant was not regarded as one of the individuals responsible for the disruption of the gathering or prompting the use of force by the police, the applicant later joined in and contributed to the mass disorder.",

                        "content": "The proportionality of the sanction does matter if ideas are expressed without violence or force, albeit involving some degree of disturbance of public order. Recently the issue was examined by the Grand Chamber in the case of Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, cited above. In the case of Taranenko v.\u00a0Russia (no. 19554/05, \u00a7\u00a7 82-91, 15\u00a0May 2014) the Court produced an analysis of its case-law and formulated the principle that participants in a demonstration which results in damage or other disorder, but who do not themselves commit any violent or otherwise reprehensible acts, cannot be prosecuted solely on the ground of their participation in the demonstration. In that case the applicant had joined a group who intruded into the reception area of the President\u2019s Administration building in Moscow and occupied one of the offices in order to distribute political leaflets through the windows to passers-by. The occupation of the administration\u2019s premises was therefore an integral part of the expression of ideas in the form of a direct action. The participants pushed aside the guard who attempted to stop them. Similarly, in one of the \u201cBolotnaya\u201d cases (see Yaroslav Belousov v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a02653/13 and 60980/14, 4 October 2016) the applicant threw an unidentified yellow object during clashes with the police, but causing no lasting harm to the health of a police officer. The Court did not characterise either action as violent and evaluated the proportionality of the sanction accordingly. Indeed, in the absence of violence the sanction imposed should not dissuade the person concerned from imparting information or ideas. However, the present case is completely different.",
