The Government stated that although the applicant had promptly retracted her statements to the police, her retraction had not been convincing and consistent as, in their opinion, the medical reports issued in respect of her had been more important than her allegations. Moreover, there had been no element indicating that the applicant had not validly waived her right to legal assistance. To support that contention, the Government referred to Yolda\u015f v.

The lawyer\u2019s presence and active assistance during questioning by police is an important procedural safeguard aimed at, among other things, preventing the collection of evidence through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the suspect and protecting the freedom of a suspected person to choose whether to speak or to remain silent when questioned by the police (see Soytemiz v.

That also applies to the right to legal assistance. However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, such a waiver must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance. Such a waiver need not be explicit, but it must be voluntary and constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be. Moreover, the waiver must not run counter to any important public interest (see Simeonovi, cited above, \u00a7 115). It follows that a waiver of the right to a lawyer, a fundamental right among those listed in Article 6 \u00a7 3 which constitute the notion of a fair trial, must be strictly compliant with the above requirements (see, mutatis mutandis, Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a036658/05, \u00a7 118, 18 December 2018).",

Firstly, it is important to reiterate that in Yolda\u015f the Court did not adjudicate the validity of the applicant\u2019s waiver on the basis of a single isolated element, namely the applicant\u2019s signature on the statement form explaining the rights of arrested persons, including the right to remain silent and the right to legal assistance. In fact, it was a combination of facts such as the applicant\u2019s undisputed signature on the statement form and on the form concerning the rights of suspects and accused (\u015f\u00fcpheli san\u0131k haklar\u0131 formu), his handwritten note on another record that he would not wish to see his family while in custody, and more importantly the trial court\u2019s scrupulous examination of the applicant\u2019s police statements and its subsequent refusal to convict the applicant in respect of six offences that were based solely on his police statements. In the light of those factors, the Court, after carrying out a holistic assessment of the circumstances of that case, with an emphasis on the trial court\u2019s scrutiny of the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had been denied legal assistance when giving statements to the police, and after having observed that there had been nothing in the proceedings to suggest that the applicant\u2019s waiver of legal assistance while in police custody had not been free and unequivocal, concluded that the waiver had been valid and that there had been no violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention.",

Russia, no.\u00a075330/01, \u00a7\u00a0104, 10 June 2010). Secondly, the applicant in Yolda\u015f retracted his police statements only during the course of the trial, whereas in the instant case the applicant immediately retracted her police statements as soon as she had access to a lawyer both before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, and maintained that position before the trial court (see Dvorski v.\u00a0Croatia [GC], no. 25703/11, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2015). Furthermore, as will be examined below, the trial court does not appear to have subjected the applicant\u2019s police statements to scrutiny when using those statements to convict her. As a result, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s argument based on Yolda\u015f.",

In that case, the Court held, inter alia, that the Government were not able to show the validity of the applicant\u2019s waiver of his right to a lawyer on the basis of the documents he had signed while in police custody, given that the applicant had contested the content of his police statements first of all during his appearance before the public prosecutor and subsequently throughout the entire proceedings (see Knox v. Italy, no. 76577/13, \u00a7 126, 24 January 2019). The Court is mindful of the probative value of documents signed while in police custody. However, as with many other guarantees under Article 6 of the Convention, those signatures are not an end in themselves and they must be examined by the Court in the light of all the circumstances of the case (see Ru\u015fen Bayar v.\u00a0Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 121). In addition, the use of a printed waiver formula may represent a challenge as to ascertaining whether the text actually expresses an accused\u2019s free and informed decision to waive his or her right to be assisted by a lawyer.",

This remains so despite the fact that the Court has already declared inadmissible the applicant\u2019s complaint that she was subjected to duress while in police custody as being manifestly ill-founded, because the absence of any element suggesting that the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment or was otherwise coerced into making incriminating statements is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that the waiver in a given case is valid for the purposes of a fair trial under Article\u00a06 of the Convention (see Bozkaya v.

With that in mind, the Court also observes that the applicant made very detailed self-incriminatory statements to the police and confessed to her crimes. According to the documents in the Court\u2019s possession, that was the only occasion on which the applicant made self-incriminatory statements. The applicant promptly retracted those statements as soon as she was represented by her lawyer on 17 November 2003 and retracted her police statements before the public prosecutor, the investigating judge and the trial court (see Ru\u015fen Bayar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0129, and Pishchalnikov v. Russia, no. 7025/04, \u00a7 88, 24 September 2009).",

In the absence of any such assessment, the Court is unable to conclude that the applicant had the opportunity to meaningfully challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use despite the fact that she was represented by a lawyer throughout the trial (compare Sitnevskiy and Chaykovskiy v.\u00a0Ukraine, nos. 48016/06 and 7817/07, \u00a7 131, 10 November 2016). Hence, the Court is not satisfied that the applicant\u2019s complaint received an appropriate response from the national courts and considers that fair procedures for making an assessment of the issue of legal assistance proved non-existent in the present case (see Rodionov v. Russia, no. 9106/09, \u00a7\u00a0167 in fine, 11 December 2018).",

Equally, as the judgment rightly points it out in paragraph 50, it remains unclear whether the applicant was given any explanation, during her police interview, as to the consequences of her waiver, including whether any statement given could subsequently be admitted in evidence in the proceedings against her.",

We believe that a printed text of any statement by an accused does not in itself undermine its validity or credibility, as long as it is accompanied by sufficient indications that it indeed reflects the accused\u2019s free and informed will (e.g. a signature). Where a suspect or an accused person subsequently casts doubt upon the circumstances in which such a statement has been taken, the competent authorities are under an obligation to thoroughly examine the claim. Therefore, in our opinion, the present judgment should not be interpreted to mean that any statement by an accused which is printed (and not, for example, handwritten or audio-recorded) would necessarily in itself be questionable as to its authenticity.",
