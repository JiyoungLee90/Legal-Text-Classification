These charges had been based on the statements of N. and were only partly supported by D.\u2019s submissions who, in turn, relied on what he had heard from N.

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7\u00a035, Series A no. 308, and Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7\u00a037, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a062). The Court has emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of an offence (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2000X). Furthermore, the principle of presumption of innocence may be infringed not only by a judge or court but also by other public authorities, including prosecutors (see Allenet de Ribemont, \u00a7 36, and Daktaras, \u00a7 42, both cited above, and, more recently, Konstas v. Greece, no.\u00a053466/07, \u00a7 32, 24 May 2011). The question whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7 43), taking into account that the statements of judges are subject to closer scrutiny than those made by the investigative authorities such as the police or the prosecutor\u2019s office (see Pandy v. Belgium, no. 13583/02, \u00a7 43, 21\u00a0September 2006, and Kampanellis v. Greece, no. 9029/05, \u00a7 27, 21 June 2007).",

Russia, no. 25404/09, \u00a7\u00a7 212-13, 21 October 2010). This interpretation is supported by the fact that the press release originated from the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office which in substance can be understood to have informed the public that it had in its possession sufficient material to charge the applicant and which disclosed information about certain factual elements it considered to have been established. The Court notes that it was not explicitly indicated in the press release that it was based on the bill of indictment. Nevertheless, it must have been clear that the press release issued by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office commencing with the words \u201c[t]he state prosecutor [V.] has sent a criminal case to court in which [the applicant] ... is charged with having demanded a large bribe\u201d represented the position of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in the criminal proceedings, subject to judicial scrutiny. Thus, although the wording used in the press release of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office could have been more careful, given the importance of the principle of presumption of innocence, the Court is unable to conclude that the press release, read as a whole, gave the impression that the applicant was regarded as guilty before being so proved according to law.",

Thus, in the articles and interviews published in April 2006, reference was made to the suspicion that the applicant had accepted a bribe, the fact that the criminal case had been initiated on the basis of information received from the person from whom the applicant had demanded a bribe (as alleged by that person), the fact that a simulation of the offence had been carried out, that most of the evidence deemed necessary by the prosecution had been gathered and that there had been no provocation on the part of the security police. The prosecutor\u2019s alleged assertion to Eesti Ekspress of 20\u00a0April 2006 that the applicant himself had been demanding the money can be understood as referring to the element of the suspicion of \u201cdemanding\u201d a bribe. Moreover, that statement was not presented as a direct quote in the newspaper (see paragraphs 20 to 24 above). In the article in Postimees of 20 November 2006, reference was made in substance to the information already disclosed in the press release of 6 October 2006 or in the underlying bill of indictment and the prosecutor further expressed her opinion that there had been no provocation (see paragraph 32 above). The Court finds nothing in the content of the prosecutor\u2019s statements or in her choice of words that would amount to a breach of the applicant\u2019s presumption of innocence. As concerns the article in Eesti Ekspress of 23\u00a0November 2006, the Court notes that although it was based on information received from the prosecutor, it contained no judgment by the prosecutor in respect of the applicant\u2019s guilt (see paragraph\u00a034 above). Lastly, in an interview shown on Eesti Televisioon on 23 November 2006, the prosecutor first quoted the charges against the applicant and then, apparently in reply to a journalist\u2019s question, indicated the name of the person from whom the bribe had been demanded and the sum of money in question. It can be understood from the context that even the latter elements were disclosed on the basis of the charges as set out in the bill of indictment (see paragraph 35 above).",

Belgium, no. 8403/78, Commission decision of 15 October 1980, Decisions and Reports 22, p.\u00a0100). This is so with regard to the impartiality of the court under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 as well as with regard to the presumption of innocence embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 2 (see Ninn-Hansen v. Denmark (dec.), no.\u00a028972/95, ECHR\u00a01999V, and Anguelov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 45963/99, 14\u00a0December 2004). However, it does not seem that the media coverage of the present case amounted to a virulent press campaign aimed at hampering the fairness of the trial, nor is there any indication that the interest of the media in the matter was sparked by the prosecutor. In the Court\u2019s opinion the media coverage of the present case did not extend beyond what can be considered informing the public about serious charges against a judge and the state of the criminal proceedings.",
