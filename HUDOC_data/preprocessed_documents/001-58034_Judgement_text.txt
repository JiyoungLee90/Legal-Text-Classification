The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") on 19 April 1996, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application (no. 19263/92) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Turkish national, Mrs Sariye Akkus, on 26 August 1991.
The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Turkey recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P11).
In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30). The lawyer was given leave by the President to use the Turkish language (Rule 27 para. 3). On 6 August 1996 the President granted the applicant legal aid (Rule 4 of the Addendum to Rules of Court A).
The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr F. Gölcüklü, the elected judge of Turkish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 8 February 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr J. Makarczyk and Mr P. Kuris (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr B. Repik, substitute judge, replaced Mr Martens, who had resigned (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Turkish Government ("the Government"), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 29 November 1996 and the applicant’s memorial on 2 December 1996. The Delegate of the Commission did not submit any observations.
In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 17 February 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.
There appeared before the Court:
(a) for the Government
(b) for the Commission
(c) for the applicant
The Court heard addresses by Mr Geus, Mr Berzeg, Mr Gündüz and Mr Özmen and also their replies to its questions.
At the hearing counsel for the applicant lodged documents relating to the application of Article 50 (art. 50). The Government chose not to reply thereto.
In September-October 1987, the National Water Board (Devlet Su isleri), a State body responsible for dam construction, expropriated land belonging to Mrs Akkus and her husband, who died in 1992, in order to build the Altinkaya hydro-electric dam in the Kizilirmak Valley. The land, which was located in the village of Gökdogan (Sinop) had been used for growing rice. It now lies under water.
More than 3,000 families (17,000 people in all) were affected by the expropriations resulting from the dam construction scheme.
According to the applicant, a scientific study commissioned by the National Water Board and carried out by the Aegean Faculty of Agronomy found the land to be worth between 3,200 and 3,500 Turkish liras (TRL) per square metre whereas the amount paid in 1987 was between TRL 800 and 850.
A committee of experts of the National Water Board assessed the value of the applicant’s land at TRL 122,000. That amount was paid to her when the expropriation took place.
On 12 October 1987 the applicant lodged an application with the Duragan Court of First Instance for increased compensation and requested that the rate of inflation be taken into account when determining the additional loss. On 22 June 1989 the court awarded her additional compensation of TRL 271,039 and simple default interest at the rate of 30% per annum from 4 September 1987, the date of the expropriation. The total compensation thus came to TRL 393,039. She was also awarded TRL 61,123 for legal costs.
The Board appealed to the Court of Cassation on points of law. Mrs Akkus filed a cross-appeal based on Article 105 of the Code of Obligations (see paragraph 14 below), in which she sought a ruling that the basis for calculating the additional loss should be the rate of inflation and not the rate of statutory interest for delay. On 17 September 1990 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment at first instance.
The additional compensation was paid in February 1992, that is to say six months after the application was lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights and approximately seventeen months after the Court of Cassation’s decision.
Mrs Akkus now lives with her son-in-law, who provides for her needs.
By Law no. 3095 of 4 December 1984 the rate of interest on overdue State debts is 30% per annum. At the material time the average rate of inflation was 70% per annum and the rate of interest for delay payable on debts owed to the State was 7% per month (84% per annum) (section 51 of Law no. 6183 on the Collection of Debts due to the State and Cabinet Ordinance no. 89/14915).
Article 105 of the Code of Obligations provides:
"Where the loss sustained by the creditor exceeds the interest for late payment and the debtor is unable to show that the creditor has been at fault, it is for the debtor to make good the loss.
If the additional loss can be assessed immediately the court may determine the amount when giving its decision on the merits."
On 3 June 1991 the Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation, which has jurisdiction in cases concerning compensation for expropriation, ruled as follows:
"The way in which creditors are compensated for the late payment of debt is through statutory interest. Since creditors are able, when resorting to enforcement measures, to claim the amount due to them plus interest, they are not entitled to claim any other form of compensation; accordingly, the decision to grant the creditor’s claim, on the basis that the rate of inflation was high, was ill-founded..."
On 23 February 1994 (judgment E: 1993/5-600, K: 1994/80) the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, ruled as follows:
"Law no. 3095 was approved and came into force when inflation in the country was high with rates well over 30%. Notwithstanding that fact, the legislature fixed the rate of interest for delay at 30%. In the present case it would therefore be unlawful to award compound interest at a rate exceeding 30% on the erroneous basis that the rate of interest payable on bank deposits was applicable."
Mrs Akkus applied to the Commission on 26 August 1991. She complained of an infringement of her right to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions on account of the Water Board’s delay in paying the additional compensation for expropriation. She alleged a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).
The Commission declared the application (no. 19263/92) admissible on 10 January 1994. In its report of 27 February 1996 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion by twenty-two votes to six that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
In their memorial, the Government invited the Court, as their primary submission, to declare the application inadmissible for failure to comply with the six-month time-limit and to exhaust domestic remedies and, in the alternative, to dismiss it as being unfounded.
