This particularly occurs in situations where the child has social problems in . Moreover, there are examples of parents who consciously choose to let a child remain in his or her country of origin, either together with one of the parents or with other family members, until the child is nearly grown up, although the child could have had a residence permit in  earlier. The result of this is that the child grows up in accordance with the culture and customs of its country of origin and is not influenced by Danish norms and values during its childhood. In the Government\u2019s view, under-age aliens who will live in Denmark should come to Denmark as early as possible and spend the longest period of their childhood in  in consideration of the child and for integration reasons. Similarly, children and young aliens who already live in  should grow up here, to the extent possible, and not in their parents\u2019 country of origin. Against that background, the Government finds that the age limit for under-age children\u2019s entitlement to family reunification should be reduced from 18 to 15 years. The purpose of such reduction of the age limit for family reunification of children is to counteract both re-education journeys and the cases in which the parents consciously choose to let a child remain in its country of origin until the child is nearly grown up.",

It stated, among other things, \u201cneither [the applicant] nor her parents contacted the immigration authorities during her stay abroad, and it has not been substantiated that illness or other unforeseen events prevented such contact. Although the distance from Hagadera to Nairobi is significant [485 km] and it can be assumed that [the applicant] did not have the means to travel to Nairobi, the Ministry finds that these circumstances did not prevent [the applicant\u2019s] parents from contacting the immigration authorities before [the applicant\u2019s\u2019] departure, which was planned. ...It is stated for the record that it was not [the applicant\u2019s] decision to leave  and stay away so long. The ministry finds that this will not lead to a different outcome of the case as [the applicant\u2019s] parents had custody over her at the time of her departure ... they could thus lawfully make decisions about [her] personal circumstances...\u201d. The Court notes in this respect that the immigration authorities had discretionary powers by virtue of section 9 c to issue a residence permit to the applicant if exceptional reasons made it appropriate, including regard for family unity and by virtue of section 17, subsection\u00a02 of the Aliens Act to decide that a residence permit must have been deemed not to have lapsed for the reasons given in subsection 1. However, under both provisions the immigration authorities found against the applicant.",

The Court agrees that the exercise of parental rights constitutes a fundamental element of family life, and that the care and upbringing of children normally and necessarily require that the parents decide where the child must reside and also impose, or authorise others to impose, various restrictions on the child\u2019s liberty (see, for example Nielsen v. Denmark, 28\u00a0November 1988, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 144).

In the Court\u2019s view, however, the fact that the applicant\u2019s mother did not visit the applicant in Kenya, or that mother and child apparently had very limited contact for four years, can be explained by various factors, including practical and economical restraints, and can hardly lead to the conclusion that the applicant and her mother did not wish to maintain or intensify their family life together.",

The latter provision was amended, however, as from 1 July\u00a02004, when the applicant was still in , reducing the right to family reunification to children under fifteen years old instead of eighteen years old.
