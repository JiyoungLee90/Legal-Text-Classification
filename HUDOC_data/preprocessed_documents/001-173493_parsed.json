In particular, it is not for the Court to indicate how any new trial is to proceed and what form it is to take.

Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2015). Where a Contracting State provides for the possibility of requesting a reopening of terminated judicial proceedings on the basis of a judgment of the Court, it is for the domestic authorities to provide for a procedure to deal with such requests and to set out criteria for determining whether the requested reopening is called for in a particular case (ibid.). However, the Court has also stressed that the foregoing considerations should not detract from the importance, for the effectiveness of the Convention system, of ensuring that domestic procedures are in place which allow a case to be revisited in the light of a finding that Article 6\u2019s safeguards of a fair trial have been violated. Such procedures may be regarded as an important aspect of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments as governed by Article 46 of the Convention and their availability demonstrates a Contracting State\u2019s commitment to the Convention and to the Court\u2019s case-law (ibid., \u00a7 58).",
