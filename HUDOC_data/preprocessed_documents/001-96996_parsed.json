In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant had failed to pay the expert fees even one year and four months after the court's order (see paragraph 8 above). In addition, she had paid the expert fees the second time they were ordered with a six-month delay (see paragraph 9 above). The Court hence concludes that the applicant was responsible for a delay of one year and ten months in the proceedings in question. On the other hand, it notes that the three adjournments cannot be attributed to her since it is the State's responsibility to organise a proper system of delivery of court summons. The Government did not present any arguments to the contrary.",

As to the applicant's request for reimbursement of the costs incurred in the proceedings before the domestic courts, the Court notes that such costs had not been incurred in order to seek through the domestic legal order prevention and redress of the alleged violation complained of before the Court. Accordingly, it does not award any sum under this head (see Milo\u0161evi\u0107 v. the , no.\u00a015056/02, \u00a7\u00a034, 20 April 2006). Concerning the legal costs and expenses incurred before it, the Court notes that no evidence was presented that her donation in amount of EUR 200 was made with reference to the application before it.
