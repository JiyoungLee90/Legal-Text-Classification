It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of proceedings compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 might have been, had the requirements of that provision not been violated (compare Menchinskaya v. Russia, no. 42454/02, \u00a7\u00a046, 15\u00a0January 2009, and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, \u00a7\u00a0260, 13 July 2006). It therefore rejects the applicant\u2019s claim in respect of pecuniary damage. As to his claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Court awards him EUR\u00a01,000. Lastly, the Court notes that the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case which ended with the judgment of 27\u00a0May 2015 have not been the subject matter of the present application and dismisses the applicant\u2019s request for their re-opening.",
