It appears from the case file that, when delivering their respective non-prosecution decisions, neither the Nusaybin Public Prosecutor nor the Izmir Public Prosecutor tried to establish how these injuries were caused. The Court also finds it regrettable that no additional medical examination was ordered during the domestic investigation although the applicant had repeatedly made this request to the domestic authorities (see paragraphs 18 and 22 above). As a result of the failure to perform an additional medical examination and having regard to the lack of details in the three medical reports, the Court finds that the applicant was deprived of the fundamental guarantees to which persons in detention are entitled (see Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7143).",
