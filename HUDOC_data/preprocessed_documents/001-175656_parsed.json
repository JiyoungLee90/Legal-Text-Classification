The draft law, which was registered in Parliament under no. 2930, proposes, in particular, an amendment to section 1(3) of the Law of 12 August 2014 (see paragraph 45 above). It would remove the proviso that cases can be examined on the basis of the material submitted by the parties, \u201cprovided that such material is sufficient for the court to decide on the matter\u201d.

The draft law, which was registered under no.\u00a03343, proposes adding a new subsection to section 12 providing that, if it is impossible to obtain the case file from the occupied territory, the competent court to which jurisdiction of the case has been reassigned has to examine the case on the basis of material provided by the parties. The draft law also proposes that the courts before which appeals are pending should be empowered to examine the question of restoration of case-file material at the request of the parties or ex officio. A\u00a0new section would also provide that if copies of the material from the file left in the occupied territory are insufficient for examination of the case, the prosecutor\u2019s office or other investigating authorities can conduct a new investigation to gather evidence. If the newly gathered material is still insufficient to examine the case, the court may adjourn the proceedings and release the defendants being held in pre-trial detention.",

In any event, section 1(3) of the Law of 12 August 2014 explicitly provides that in a situation such as that of the applicant, that is to say where a case file cannot be transferred to the Government-controlled area, the case can be examined on the basis of material submitted by the parties, \u201cprovided that such material is sufficient for the court to decide on the matter\u201d. However, it is apparent that the parties, the applicant and the prosecutor\u2019s office, were unable to furnish sufficient material, which led the Lysychansk Court to reject the applicant\u2019s application for the restoration of the case file (see paragraph 25 above).

Likewise, in view of the variety of types of proceedings, there are no absolute criteria for determining the point at which the length of proceedings becomes excessive (see Havelka v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no.\u00a042666/10 and 61523/10, 20\u00a0September 2011). The reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, regard being had to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the applicant\u2019s conduct and the conduct of the competent authorities (see\u00a0P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.

The applicant did not argue that the lack of a mechanism for the Luhansk Region was due to a shortcoming on the part of the Ukrainian authorities rather than any other party. Account should also be taken of the fact that hostilities in the area have been continuing throughout the period at issue and no stable and lasting ceasefire has so far been established (see paragraphs 52 and 55 above).",
