As to the impugned pre-arrest delay, all five judges of the Supreme Court considered that that lapse of time was not such as should give rise to a prohibition order. The court considered it legitimate for the Irish police to have waited for his release from prison to arrest him under section 30 of the OASA. There was insufficient evidence to initiate a prosecution prior to his being questioned. The parameters of any questioning while he was in prison in  would have been entirely different from those applicable to a person arrested under section 30 of the OASA. In this latter respect, he was obliged to at least listen to the questions; the structure and duration of the questioning (subject to the proper treatment of persons in custody) would have been under their control and not under that of other (Northern Irish) authorities or that of the applicant himself; and, in the end, he made some statements during questioning which provided additional evidence and, consequently, a basis to initiate a prosecution.

He suggested that an inadequate number of judges would, if anything, be a reason to assess a longer delay as reasonable in the circumstances, although he acknowledged that that view might not accord with the Convention. The Convention's jurisprudence in Irish cases was not sufficiently clear as to the correct approach to systemic delay and, notably, as to the blameworthiness of a State for systemic delay: could, for example, a State be blamed for diverting limited economic resources to a hospital as opposed to judicial institutions? In any event, the present case was not the appropriate one to examine systemic delay as none of the impugned periods of delay warranted a prohibition order. As to the lapse of time in approving the High Court judgment, he found it unnecessary to consider whether this delay should be taken into account in considering whether a trial should be prohibited because he was \u201cquite satisfied that prohibition would not be appropriate in this case at any rate\u201d.",

Secondly, while he may assert increased levels of stress and anxiety arising from prosecutorial delay, any balancing exercise will have to take into account the length of such blameworthy delay, because if it is a short delay rather than one of years, the mere fact that some blameworthy delay took place should not of itself justify the prohibition of a trial.\u201d",

Ireland and the Attorney General ([2009] IEHC 178) the Court of Criminal Appeal set aside the applicant's conviction for rape and sexual assault on the grounds that the manner in which his trial had been conducted rendered his trial unfair. A retrial was not ordered. However, by that date the accused had served his sentence and had been released. Not being entitled to damages under section 9 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1993 (his conviction was not quashed on the grounds of a miscarriage of justice), he took proceedings against the State claiming essentially damages for a breach of his constitutional right to a fair trial. In dismissing the application, the High Court found that the State could not be vicariously liable for errors which a judge may commit in the administration of justice nor could a plaintiff sue the State on other grounds as regards the failure by the trial judge to ensure a fair trial. In addition, the High Court opined that, in any event, the immunity conferred by law on the judiciary also applied for the benefit of the State when an attempt was made to render the State liable for the wrongs of a judge.

Indeed, \u201creasonable expedition\u201d was the most litigated area of constitutional law in the late 1990s, the cases often concerning late allegations of sexual assault. Virtually every such case concerned an application for a prohibition of prosecution and apparently no claim for damages for a breach of the right to reasonable expedition was referred to in any judgment. However, this was probably explained by the fact that the threshold for granting leave to seek a prohibition order on judicial review was low (an arguable case) and generally a stay on the criminal proceedings would be accorded pending a final decision on prohibition. An accused was clearly more interested in stopping a prosecution than in damages and/or did not wish to jeopardise a request for a prohibition order with an alternative claim for damages.",

To support this view, the Opinion relied on \u201crelatively developed jurisprudence\u201d (notably the generally applicable Meskill doctrine) which established the principle of compensation for a breach of a constitutional right and the right to seek damages for such a breach when no other effective or sufficient remedy existed. The Opinion went on to refer in detail to cases where damages had been awarded for a breach of different constitutional rights. This principle was borne out by the case of O'Donoghue v. Legal Aid Board, the closest parallel found to the present case: a delay in granting a legal aid certificate for 25 months when the plaintiff manifestly qualified for it was found to amount to a breach of the plaintiff's constitutional right of access to court and to fair procedures so that she had a right to recover damages for demonstrated loss.",

The Opinion stated that the courts would apply the principles governing awards of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages in tort to an award of damages. In McDonnell v. Ireland the Supreme Court treated, for the purposes of the Statute of Limitations, an action for a breach of constitutional rights in the same way as an action in tort. Accordingly, much of the adjectival law governing tort actions applied to constitutional actions for damages. While there was some authority to the effect that a breach of a constitutional right could be actionable per se, without proof of loss, in the majority of cases the courts would compensate as in a tort action on the basis of demonstrated pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss. Exceptionally, awards of punitive or exemplary damages might be made.",

The applicant did not explain why he did not make an alternative claim for damages in his prohibition actions and it was absurd in an adversarial system to suggest that the State (via its courts or the prosecution) should have taken the initiative to offer damages for delay which was excessive but did not warrant prohibition.

As well as the Opinion outlined above, the Supreme Court indicated in the applicant's second prohibition action that the question of an action for damages for breach of the right to trial with reasonable expedition was an open one to be examined when raised (Fennelly J. and Kearns J., paragraphs 38 and 41 above).

Ireland ((dec.), no. 26499/02, 27 June 2006) where, despite there being no statutory or case-law precedent, the Court acknowledged that it was important that the domestic courts (especially in a common law constitutional system) should be afforded the opportunity to test the extent of domestic protection, thereby allowing domestic courts to develop legal and constitutional remedies.",

The principle of judicial immunity was recognised by the common law (inter alia, Sirros v. Moore [1975] QB 118; Deighan v. Ireland [1995] 2 IR 56; Devoy v. DPP and Kemmy v.  and Another, both cited above). Judicial independence was protected by the Constitution, the Convention and the Court's jurisprudence (Ernst and Others v. Belgium, no. 33400/96, 15 July 2003). The Court should not therefore base a violation of Article 13 on the observance by the State of this recognised principle of judicial immunity. The damages remedy proposed could still be effective with this limited exception. However, in their oral submissions the Government suggested that the applicant should have tested, in the proposed action for damages, the nature, extent and application of the principle of judicial immunity, without which it was not apparent what immunities (of the police, prosecutors or judges) would stand against a claim for damages for delay.\u00a0The Government rejected the applicant's reliance on the case of L.L.M. (Plaintiff) and the Commissioner of An Garda Siochana, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the DPP, Ireland and the Attorney General: that case was ongoing and did not concern immunities but rather the question of whether a State owed to a victim of crime a legal obligation in connection with the prosecution of a criminal trial, an issue which raised profound issues as to the relationship between the presumption of innocence of a person acquitted and the right of a victim to a trial.",

While the Government suggested that the applicant should have tested this issue in a constitutional action for damages, they accepted in both their written and oral submissions to the Grand Chamber that there was likely to be an exception to the right to damages for a breach of a constitutional right when the delay was caused by the failure of an individual judge to deliver judgment within a reasonable time, given the important and established principle of judicial immunity. While this period of delay was considered relevant - although not blameworthy - in the second prohibition action, the High Court opined in a later judgment (Joseph Kemmy v. Ireland and the Attorney General) that the immunity of suit conferred by law on the judiciary applied for the benefit of the State in the context of an action against the State in damages for the wrongs of a judge. The 17-month period required to approve the High Court judgment and found blameworthy under Article 6 \u00a7 1, would not therefore appear to be addressed by this proposed constitutional remedy.",

The Court has also had regard to the information supplied by the Government to the Venice Commission in the above-described study on average relevant waiting times before Irish courts as of 2005: the delays were noted as 15 months before the High Court on (non-asylum) judicial review (although it is not clear from when this period began to run) and 14 months before the Supreme Court from the date of filing of the Certificate of Readiness, to which periods of time would have to be added the period of execution of any damages awarded. Moreover, the parties agreed before the Grand Chamber that the average waiting time before the Supreme Court on appeal is, at present, in the region of 32-34 months. The Report of the Working Group on a Court of Appeal (May 2009) outlined the average \u201cwaiting times\u201d for a hearing before the Supreme Court as 22 months in 2006, 26 months in 2007 and 30 months in 2008. As to requesting damages as alternative relief in the prohibition actions, the second action may have taken less than 2 years but the first lasted approximately 6 years and six months. Given existing delays, notably before the Supreme Court, the Court could not base an assessment of effectiveness of the proposed remedy on an assumption that all actions for damages for delay could be accorded priority.",

Excessive costs could constitute an unreasonable restriction on access to such a remedy and thus a breach of the right of access to court (Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 201).

While legal representation is not obligatory, as noted above, the remedy would be legally and procedurally complex.

The action would, at least initially, be novel and uncertain (paragraphs 117-121): should an applicant be unsuccessful, there was a risk of a costs order against him or her; and, even if damages were pursued as an alternative claim in the prohibition action, there would be separate costs attributable to the damages claim (notably, those of the Attorney General who would be a respondent) and thus any costs' exposure could be high. The Court considers that the Government have not demonstrated that, in such circumstances, an applicant would not be unduly hampered in taking an action for damages for a breach of the constitutional right to reasonable expedition (Cocchiarella v.

The case law of the Supreme Court on the right to reasonable expedition and on the consequences of its breach as regards obtaining a prohibition order was at that point developing (see, for example, the judgments of the Supreme Court in the second prohibition action referred to at paragraphs 36, 39 and 43 above and that of Denham J. in the Devoy case at paragraph 63 above).

In Bullen and Soneji v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a03383/06, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, 8 January 2009) the Court found that even the applicant's agreement to a later hearing date did not remove the State's obligation to ensure expedition. Indeed, the Court has found that, even a principle of domestic law, that the parties to civil proceedings were required to take the initiative to progress the proceedings, did not dispense the State from the requirement to organise its system to deal with cases within a reasonable period of time. If a State allows proceedings to continue beyond a \u201creasonable time\u201d without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay (Foley v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a039197/98, \u00a7 40, 22 October 2002; and Price and Lowe v. the United Kingdom, nos. 43185/98 and 43186/98, \u00a7 23, 29 July 2003). These principles apply a fortiori where the State is itself a party to the proceedings and responsible for their prosecution (Crowther v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a053741/00, \u00a7 29, 1 February 2005).",

As to the delay in approving the transcript by the High Court judge, the Court does not consider it reasonable to suggest that the onus was on the applicant in this instance. While he had carriage of the overall prohibition action, it was the prosecution's appeal which was delayed pending the transcript's approval (Richard Anderson v. the , no. 19859/04, \u00a7 28, 9 February 2010) and, furthermore, during the relevant 17-month period he had a High Court order of prohibition in his favour on the basis of a real and serious risk of an unfair trial and it was unrealistic to suggest that he should apply to speed up a prosecution appeal against that order. In this respect, the Court would note that the 2002 Act, which entered into force in March 2005 and which placed the onus on the Court's Service to supervise the delivery of judgments, does not concern criminal proceedings.",

Relying on Kud\u0142a the majority begins its analysis by concluding that \u201cit follows\u201d that less than a full application of the guarantees of Article\u00a013 would undermine the operation of the subsidiary character of the Court (see \u00a7\u00a0112 of the Judgment). The starting point of its analysis appears to be, with respect, a conclusion concerning the less than full application of the guarantees of Article 13. How can this Court assess whether there has been 'a less than full application' of such guarantees if the national courts have not been asked by the applicant to apply them? What the majority regards as \u201cthe question to be determined\u201d in this case is \u201cwhether the way in which domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention\u201d (see \u00a7114); but no opportunity for the interpretation and application of the domestic law of remedies for 'length of proceedings' has arisen because the applicant sought only one outcome \u2013 prohibition of trial. Domestic courts are not obliged to order prohibition of trial each time a complaint concerning 'unreasonable time' is established. Far less radical remedies, such as, damages are acceptable. Had the majority started its analysis with the relevant test, namely, whether the applicant had done everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies (see Aksoy v.

For this Court to deprive the Irish courts of the opportunity to determine the applicant's claim for damages is not just failing to respect subsidiarity; it is assuming the functions of a first instance court. Allowing the national courts to be the first to hear and determine a claim is a fundamental aspect of the principle that the Convention's 'machinery of protection' is subsidiary to theirs in the safeguarding of human rights (see Akdivar and Others v.

If, in reality, there is any doubt about the availability of damages for the alleged breach of the applicant's right to an expeditious trial then, in our view and in line with this Court's own case law, any such doubt should have been resolved by him, domestically, before asking this Court to rule upon the issue.",

An entirely different case would have been presented to the domestic courts had the applicant sought damages either instead of or as an alternative to prohibition. Fennelly J. stressed that it was not possible for the Supreme Court, having an appellate function only, to pronounce in the abstract on whether damages would be available if they were claimed.

Firstly, it should be clarified that the case in question had nothing to do with the issue of State liability for judicial delay. McMahon J. expressly stated that there had been no allegation of delay and that \u201cabsent this\u201d the State could not have been faulted. Furthermore, a careful reading of the Judgment illustrates that the 'distinction' emphasised by the majority was not, in fact, lost on the High Court Judge. The case before him concerned the question of State immunity for alleged unfairness of trial caused by a judicial error. It was not about State liability for delays in the legal system. In general, such delays tend to occur where a State fails to erect the proper \u201cscaffolding\u201d to support the efficient administration of justice. Such scaffolding may be vulnerable if a State fails, for example, to provide a sufficient number of judges or to have in place an efficient case management system. In Kemmy the High Court Judge specifically distinguished between liability for judicial error (as in the case before him) and liability for what one might call the system's failure.

In D. v  (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100) the Court expressly rejected such an argument which had been raised by the applicant and it found that \u201cthe 'costs' risk does not, as a matter of principle, constitute a reason to classify a constitutional remedy as generally ineffective\u201d.",

Furthermore, it stands as an invitation to all who fail to have their criminal trials prohibited in Ireland to simply by-pass the domestic courts and to come directly to Strasbourg for damages even though such applicants could readily include, within their domestic pleadings, an additional and/or an alternative claim for compensation in the event that prohibition is refused. It appears impervious to the express statements of the Supreme Court that careful consideration would be given to a claim for damages for breach of the right to an expeditious trial if and when such a claim is made.",

I am not convinced that such a remedy did not (or does not) exist. The applicant relies on the Court's Barry judgment to conclude that there was no effective domestic compensatory remedy for the alleged unreasonable length of the criminal proceedings.

As a result, I would have preferred the Court to apply Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Convention and declare the application inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. In addition, from the allegations of the parties (paragraph 73) it appears that the six-year limitation period in which to file a claim for damages for an alleged breach of constitutional rights had not yet expired, so this possibility still remained open to the applicant.",
