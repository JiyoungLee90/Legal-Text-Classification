However, this freedom was not unlimited; it went hand-in-hand with certain obligations and restrictions.

Any restrictions imposed on the exercise of that right had to be closely scrutinised. It referred to the case-law of the Court and reiterated that criticism in respect of politicians and their views and actions was acceptable in the context of a democratic society, even where it took the form of violent attacks, exaggeration or even provocation. However, these principles had always to be applied and fine-tuned in the context of concrete factual circumstances. In the present case, the applicants\u2019 interest in the circumstances of the case, given the public character of the plaintiff\u2019s function, was fully justified. Their diligence in gathering relevant information was not open to any criticism. It was only at the stage where they wrote and published the articles concerned that they had demonstrated negligence. Nothing in the material which they had gathered justified a conclusion that the plaintiff had received the car as a gift.

Therefore, such persons must display a greater degree of tolerance (see, for example, Incal v.\u00a0, 9\u00a0June 1998, \u00a7\u00a054, Reports\u00a01998IV, and D\u0105browski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a018235/02, \u00a7\u00a028, 19\u00a0December 2006). Nonetheless, it does not follow from this that politicians should not be given an opportunity to defend themselves when they consider that publications about them are erroneous and capable of misleading public opinion. In the Court\u2019s view, in such cases a fair balance between the privileged position of the press in exercising its freedom of expression, and the politician\u2019s right to protect his or her reputation is called for (see Sanocki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a028949/03, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62, 17\u00a0July 2007).",
