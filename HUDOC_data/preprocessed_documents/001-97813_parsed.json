It does not seem that any of those matters could have been addressed through a \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d, which was designed to prevent the slow examination of a case or delays in delivery of a judgment or in transmitting of an appeal (see paragraph 15 above). It is also questionable whether that avenue of redress was available to the applicant when the case was pending before the Supreme Court of Cassation, given that there was no higher court, whereas a \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d is to be made to the president of the higher court. No other acceleratory remedies seem to exist under Bulgarian law, nor remedies allowing litigants to obtain compensation for excessively lengthy civil proceedings (see, among other authorities, Hadjibakalov, cited above, \u00a7 60).",
