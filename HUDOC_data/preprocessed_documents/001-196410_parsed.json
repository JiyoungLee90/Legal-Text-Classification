However, he did not provide an explanation as to why he had failed to raise this complaint at an earlier stage, before communication of his case to the Government. Accordingly, the Court considers that the Article\u00a05 complaint lodged by the applicant later in the proceedings does not constitute a mere elaboration on his original complaints to the Court, and therefore it is not appropriate to deal with this newly raised matter in the present case (see Rafig Aliyev v.

Furthermore, the reopening of proceedings by itself may not automatically be regarded as sufficient redress capable of depriving the applicant of his victim status.

The scope of the judicial review must include the reasons why the covert operation was mounted, the extent of the police\u2019s involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant was subjected.

It held inadmissible evidence which was obtained during the undercover operation and which was used to convict the applicant of sale of drugs. On the basis of its analysis, the court then found grounds for the requalification, in the applicant\u2019s favour, of his offence in respect of the first episode of sale of drugs and quashed his conviction in relation to the second episode. In respect of the requalification of the applicant\u2019s offence to a lesser one, the Court agrees with the findings of the domestic court and also notes from the case material before it that the applicant admitted that he had been routinely acquiring drugs for personal use, including on the day of the undercover operation. The Court also notes that in his observations the applicant did not claim that he had been incited to buy drugs by the police. Lastly, the domestic court reduced significantly the original term of imprisonment of seven years imposed on the applicant in the first set of proceedings and established the applicant\u2019s right to partial rehabilitation (see paragraphs 22 and 38 above). Accordingly, the Court considers that in the particular circumstances of Mr Manelyuk\u2019s case, its re-examination in general was in accordance with the standards of judicial review developed in the Court\u2019s case-law concerning police entrapment and in conformity with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention.",
