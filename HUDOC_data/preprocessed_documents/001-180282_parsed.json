In the last ten years alone, fifty-one journalists have been swallowed up by this well. The important message behind this is that we need determination to go beyond the darkness and reach the light. Or, to put it a different way, it is not possible to reach the light from the darkness without eliminating the eliminators (Ya da, ba\u015fka bir deyi\u015fle, \u201cbertaraf ediciler\u201d, \u201cbertaraf\u201d edilmeden karanl\u0131ktan s\u00fcrekli ayd\u0131nl\u0131\u011fa \u00e7\u0131kmak da m\u00fcmk\u00fcn de\u011fil). Following Metin\u2019s death, the honest journalists of Turkey, especially the young ones, thought that waiting to confront that reality was a hopeless prospect. Indeed, they thought that it was already too late. It was also like this for the country\u2019s working class who constantly encountered the police in their struggle to seek legal solutions. Moreover, Metin was one of them. This consciousness became the driving force behind the transformation of every hearing of his trial \u2212 which was \u201cexiled\u201d, first to Ayd\u0131n then to Afyon Province, with the aim of keeping it hidden from public view \u2212 into a demonstration.",

They stated first of all that the article in question had been written on the fourth anniversary of the killing of journalist Metin G\u00f6ktepe, who had been beaten to death by the police in 1996 whilst in custody. The applicants argued that the purpose of the article had been to raise concern over the fact that some high-ranking officials had not been tried and that those accused in Metin G\u00f6ktepe\u2019s trial had still not been convicted, four years after the death of Metin G\u00f6ktepe. The applicants maintained in this respect that the two officials concerned, namely O.T. and K.B., were the ones who had given and executed the detention order which had resulted in Metin G\u00f6ktepe\u2019s death. The applicants also pointed out that these two officials had been the only ones in respect of whom the requests for authorisation to prosecute under Law no.\u00a04483 (Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants and Public Officials) had been rejected by the Interior Minister at the material time. The names of the two officials had therefore been mentioned in the article because of their involvement in the abovementioned events and not because of their role in the fight against terrorism. The applicants further submitted that the names of the officials had already appeared in the public domain and that the officials, being the Director and the Vice-Director of Istanbul Security Directorate, were already known to the public and thus not in a position to complain about the disclosure of their identities.",

As for the question of whether it was aimed at protecting \u201cnational security\u201d, the Court reiterates the need to apply that concept with restraint and to interpret it restrictively, as a result of which it should be brought into play only where it has been shown to be necessary to suppress the release of information for the purposes of protecting national security and public safety (see G\u00f6rm\u00fc\u015f and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 49085/07, \u00a7 37, 19 January 2016).

The Court is thus deprived of the benefit of the views of the national courts, which are better placed than an international court given their advantage of possessing direct knowledge of the situation and having all the evidence before them (see, by contrast, Dorota Kania v.

In this respect, the State Security Court failed to weigh up the interest in protecting the identities of public officials \u2013 who, on account of their status, would have been well known in Istanbul, at least \u2013 as opposed to disclosing them for reasons of public interest (see S\u00fcrek v.
