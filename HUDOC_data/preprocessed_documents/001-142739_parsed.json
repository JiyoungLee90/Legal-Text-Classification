In his reasoning he began by stating that, while Article\u00a022 of the Constitution and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights protected the freedom of correspondence, those two Articles also provided for limitations of such freedom on grounds such as national security and public order. He further mentioned that Law no. 5275 on the enforcement of sentences and preventive measures (\u201cLaw no. 5275\u201d) provided that telephone conversations had to be conducted under the conditions and according to the principles laid down in the Rules on the enforcement of sentences and preventive measures (\u201cthe Rules\u201d). He noted that the prison authorities had not yet received any reply to their request for it to be ascertained, under Rule 88/2 (p) of the Rules, whether or not the individuals with whom the applicants wished to speak understood Turkish. He pointed out in this connection that the question remained to be clarified and that the applicants\u2019 action thus concerned the general practice of the prison authorities which, in his view, was not in breach of the law. He concluded that the prison authorities had acted in conformity with Law no.\u00a05275 and Rule 88/2 (p).",

The Government explained that the Kurdish language had different dialects and that, at the time of the applicants\u2019 requests, there were no Kurdish speaking personnel in the prison. The prison authorities had asked the applicants, in accordance with Rule\u00a088/2 (p) of the Rules then in force, for the names and addresses of the individuals with whom they wished to speak in order to seek information on them. In the Government\u2019s submission, those prisoners who had good intentions would give such information and, once the investigation had been carried out, permission to use Kurdish was granted for those who did not speak Turkish. However, some prisoners with bad intentions had requested permission to use Kurdish without giving the requisite information.

They recognised that some measure of control over prisoners\u2019 interaction with the outside world was necessary for prison security and for preventing criminality. However, they took the view that those aims, which they considered legitimate, should have been used proportionately and not as a justification for restrictions on the communication they wished to have with their family and the outside world in a language other than Turkish. They further submitted that the ban on communicating with the outside world in Kurdish could not be justified solely by a lack of personnel. They pointed to the fact that the domestic authorities had not investigated whether their telephone conversations had any illegal content or could have jeopardised prison security. They criticised the State authorities for simply assuming that, since they were to be conducted in Kurdish, their telephone conversations would necessarily have some illegal content. They complained of the automatic and unfair application of the impugned ban in their case. They alleged that the measure was neither proportionate nor necessary in a democratic society. In their view, the ban on communication in a minority language was not compatible with a genuine democracy, since respect for cultural, ethnic and religious plurality was, for them, one of the most prominent values of contemporary democracies. The applicants stated that they belonged to an ethnic minority group which was not recognised by the respondent State, but that in international law the existence of a minority group did not depend on such recognition. They took the view that the Government were at least under an obligation not to prevent them from enjoying their identity, language and culture. They referred to the European Prison Rules of the Council of Europe, citing in particular Rule 38. This Rule required that special arrangements be made to meet the needs of prisoners who belonged to ethnic or linguistic minorities; that, as far as practicable, the cultural practices of different groups be allowed to continue in prison; and that linguistic needs be met by using competent interpreters and by providing written material in the range of languages used in a particular prison. Lastly, in the applicants\u2019 submission, it was clear from the Oslo Recommendations regarding the Linguistic Rights of National Minorities and from Article\u00a051 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, that the State was required to take the necessary measures to meet their specific needs.
