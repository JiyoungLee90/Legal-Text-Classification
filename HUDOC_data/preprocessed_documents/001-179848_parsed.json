The Government contested the applicant\u2019s argument that the Court of Cassation was no longer an available remedy in detention cases after the introduction of the constitutional amendments of 2005 and argued that there was no law limiting the jurisdiction of the Court of Cassation to examine such cases. They also contested the applicant\u2019s reliance on the case of Grigoryan v.

He referred to the circumstances of the case of Grigoryan (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02527 and 110-115) in which the Court of Cassation had left an appeal on points of law against a detention decision unexamined with reference to the constitutional amendments and the decision of the Council of Court Chairmen of 8\u00a0December 2005, and argued that the Government\u2019s submissions were in contradiction with the official position of the Court of Cassation. As regards the two cases examined by the Court of Cassation in 2007, neither decision had even been published for the applicant to be aware of the fact that the Court of Cassation had abandoned its malpractice. Furthermore, the existence of a mere two decisions for the whole period between 2005 and August 2007 clearly demonstrated that that remedy had been unavailable in practice. Moreover, the decisions in question had been taken either during the running of the appeal time-limit in his detention case or after its expiry. He could therefore not predict such developments.",

Turkey (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99 et al., ECHR\u00a02010). Under Article 35 of the Convention, the existence of remedies which are available and sufficient must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 34932/04, \u00a7\u00a075, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, no. 26839/05, \u00a7 109, 18 May 2010). Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see Betteridge v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a01497/10, \u00a7 48, 29 January 2013).",

Thus, the Government\u2019s allegation that such a right was provided by Article 403 of the CCP appears to contradict the interpretation given to the relevant provisions of the CCP by the judicial authorities. The Court further notes that, following the decision of 12\u00a0February 2000, the right to appeal to the Court of Cassation in detention cases was made available in practice if not in law, but \u2013 as the Government themselves had acknowledged in their observations in the case of Grigoryan (see Grigoryan, cited above, \u00a7 110) \u2013 that practice was abandoned following the introduction of the constitutional amendments of 6\u00a0December 2005: on 8 December 2005 the Council of Court Chairmen repealed its decision of 12 February 2000 and on 5 April 2006 it issued another decision stating that, due to its new constitutional status, the Court of Cassation was no longer to examine appeals against decisions taken in pre-trial proceedings, including any decision on detention (see paragraphs 17, 23 and 24 above). As it appears from the case of Grigoryan, the Court of Cassation applied that new approach in practice (as Grigoryan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 25-27 and 113-115).",

                                        "content": ".\u00a0\u00a0Nothing suggests that there had been any decisive shift on that matter in law or in practice by the time the courts examined the applicant\u2019s detention case. The decisions of the Council of Court Chairmen of 8\u00a0December 2005 and 5\u00a0April 2006 had not been repealed or modified and there had not been any pertinent amendments to the CCP. It is notable also that none of the decisions taken by the Court of Appeal in the applicant\u2019s case stated that they could be contested before the Court of Cassation, which was the normal practice (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above and compare with paragraphs 7, 10 and 13 above). As regards the two decisions of the Court of Cassation indicated by the Government (see paragraph 25 above), it is not clear on what grounds appeals on points of law were lodged in those two cases by the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office and, moreover, admitted for examination by the Court of Cassation. It is noteworthy that the Court of Cassation did not provide any explanation or reasoning for its decisions to admit those appeals or any interpretation of the relevant domestic provisions regarding the right to appeal in detention cases that would signal a shift in its approach. Thus, the situation at hand must be distinguished from cases in which a new remedy is created as a result of interpretation of the domestic law by the courts, in which cases it normally takes six months for such a development of the case law to acquire a sufficient degree of certainty before the public may be considered to be effectively aware of the domestic decision which had established the remedy and the persons concerned be enabled and obliged to use it (see, among other authorities, Majski v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 33593/03, \u00a7 70, 1 June 2006; Depauw v. Belgium (dec.), no.\u00a02115/04, 15 May 2007; and Provide S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 62155/00, \u00a7 18, 5\u00a0July 2007). Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that those two cases simply fell into the category of \u201cexceptional cases\u201d mentioned in the decision of the Council of Court Chairmen of 5\u00a0April 2006 (see paragraph\u00a024 above). However, no explanation has been provided by the Government \u2013 or the Court of Cassation itself \u2013 as to whether that was indeed the case and, if so, what criteria were applied in such \u201cexceptional cases\u201d. In such circumstances, the Court cannot but endorse its earlier findings and conclude that the right to appeal to the Court of Cassation in detention cases was not available at the material time (see Grigoryan, cited above, \u00a7 113), since it has not been demonstrated that such a right was sufficiently certain either in law or in practice and in fact all the circumstances point to the contrary. The Court would nevertheless lastly add that, even assuming that there was a clearly defined shift in the Court of Cassation\u2019s approach and the principles and time limits enshrined in the above-mentioned case law were applicable in the present case, the first appeal in question was examined by the Court of Cassation on 13 July 2007, that is roughly around the same period when the applicant\u2019s detention case was pending before the lower courts. In such circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to have predicted such a development or be blamed for not being aware of it. Nor would the existence of only two decisions suggest that there was an established practice at the material time. In view of the foregoing, the Court decides to dismiss the Government\u2019s nonexhaustion objection.",
