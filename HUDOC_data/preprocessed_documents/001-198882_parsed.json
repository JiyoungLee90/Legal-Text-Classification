V. stated that the driver, whom he identified as the applicant, had placed the victim in the rear seat of his car; an ambulance had subsequently arrived and taken the latter to hospital. Another witness, R., submitted that he had been walking near the site of accident when, having heard a noise, he had turned his head and had seen the applicant\u2019s car on a pedestrian crossing and G. in front of the car. The applicant had got out of his car and had remarked that he had been driving slowly. Another witness, Ga., stated that she had been crossing the street at the same time and at the same pedestrian crossing as G., but in the opposite direction. After G. had passed her by, she had heard a car braking. She had turned around and had seen G. falling. The applicant\u2019s car had been there. The applicant had placed G. on the rear seat of his car saying: \u201cI am sorry, I did not mean to\u201d. When Ga. had approached the applicant, he had said to her that he would take G. to hospital and that there was no point in calling the police.

He reiterated his plea of not guilty and submitted that his conviction had not been based on any conclusive evidence. The applicant argued, in particular, that nobody had actually witnessed the accident itself. As regards the statement of V. (see paragraph 29 above), the applicant observed that that witness had initially submitted that he had first heard a noise and had then seen G. falling. Accordingly, in the applicant\u2019s opinion, V.\u2019s statement in court that he had witnessed the accident had been untruthful. In so far as the submissions of G.\u2019s widow were concerned, the applicant observed that they had not been confirmed by any evidence. The applicant also denied having confessed to having hit G. with his car and having participated in the inspection of the scene (see paragraphs 9-12 above). The applicant submitted that the \u201cexplanation\u201d signed by him on 12\u00a0September 2002 (see paragraph 11 above) had no legal standing and that its contents thus constituted inadmissible evidence, given that: firstly, he had signed it without reading it as he had left his glasses at home, and, secondly, the paragraph asserting that his rights under Article 63 of the Constitution had been explained to him had been added later (see paragraph 12 above). The applicant accordingly insisted that the above-mentioned document should not be taken to confirm the truthfulness of the police officer\u2019s statements. Lastly, the applicant asked the appellate court to disregard his lawyer\u2019s request for the case to be remitted for additional investigation. Instead, he argued that the charges against him should be dropped for lack of evidence.",
