Lord Justice Moses, delivering the first judgment, began by setting out a number of well-established principles relevant to committal hearings. The need to observe the Human Rights Act 1998 (see paragraphs 50 to 55 below) was central to the practice direction on committal proceedings, which had applied to the proceedings before the County Court (see paragraph 41 below). Such proceedings concerned a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d for the purpose of Article 6 of the Convention and the defendant therefore benefited from the right to legal assistance set out in Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c). A defendant to committal proceedings was not obliged to give evidence and enjoyed a right against selfincrimination and, referring to Article 6 \u00a7 2, the burden of proving guilt lay on the person seeking committal.",

Translating that finding into the terms of Article 13, the Court cannot but conclude that the domestic remedies available to the applicant in relation to his complaint under Article 6 were not fully \u201ceffective\u201d for the purposes of Article 13, since they were not capable of affording adequate redress for the prejudice suffered by him in the form of the lengthened deprivation of liberty caused by the absence of legal representation in his case. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 13 in the present case.",

This is because in the context of Article 41 of the Convention it is also relevant that he was unrepresented and not legally advised at the committal hearing. The lawyers whom he contacted from prison failed to assist him properly. While he received GBP 500 from those lawyers in compensation for their failure to assist (see paragraph 14 above), that compensation does not, in the Court\u2019s opinion, remove the \u201cnecessity\u201d under Article 41 of the Convention to afford him \u201cjust satisfaction\u201d as reparation for the prejudice caused to him by the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1, taken in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3(c). It follows from the Court\u2019s conclusion on \u201cvictim\u201d status (see paragraph 137 above) that the additional, unjustified five weeks\u2019 deprivation of liberty, which the High Court was satisfied had occurred in the applicant\u2019s case on account of the procedural shortcomings before the County Court (see paragraph 34 above), gave rise to prejudice which was not sufficiently compensated by the domestic courts\u2019 acknowledgement of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention. There are no exceptional reasons (see Piper v. the United Kingdom, no. 44547/10, \u00a7\u00a073, 21 April 2015) to hold that the finding by this Court of a violation of Article 6 would in its turn in itself constitute adequate \u201cjust satisfaction\u201d for the purposes of Article 41 in relation to those five additional weeks of imprisonment.",

It is not for this Court to examine, proprio motu, a complaint under Article 5 on the basis of a particular justification provided by that provision not invoked, directly or indirectly, by the defendant Government. Thus, in the case of Beiere v.\u00a0Latvia (no. 30954/05, \u00a7 53, 29 November 2011), the Court found that \u201cthe deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty was not ordered in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention\u201d. The Court then concluded that as the Government \u201c[had] not argued that it was justified by any of the remaining subparagraphs of Article 5 \u00a7 1, [there had] been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1\u201d.

Firstly, as explained in more detail below (see paragraph 12), it is the settled case-law of the Court that the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 \u201cvaries to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved\u201d (Saadi v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 13229/03, ECHR 2008). Secondly, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) forms in substance the applicable exception to all deprivations of liberty in the form of prison sentences for criminal acts falling under Article 6 of the Convention. Since the Court is not an appeal court against decisions of national courts, it will not substitute its own views on the appropriateness of a sentence for those national authorities. However, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) is different. In the assessment of whether a detention order is arbitrary, the first limb, which is clearly applicable in the present case, requires a strict assessment of the necessity of the detention for a particular and well-defined aim, that is to say to secure compliance with a lawful order of a court which may or may not be a criminal act under domestic law. The same applies in principle to those detentions that are justified under Articles\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (d), (e) and (f).",

Applying Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) would have led to the opposite conclusion, a finding of a violation in the applicant\u2019s case, as we will now explain.",

A period of detention is, in principle, \u201clawful\u201d if it is based on a court order.

Lastly, before proceeding with our examination on this basis, we observe that in the application of these principles, we, like the majority (see paragraph 74 of the judgment), will take into account the well-settled principle in the Court\u2019s case-law that only a narrow interpretation of the permissible grounds under Article 5 \u00a7 1 is consistent with the aim of this provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty.

We note that in Mooren, cited above, \u00a7 75, one of the examples given by the Grand Chamber of where a detention order might be ex facie invalid, due to a gross and obvious irregularity in the proceedings, is \u201cwhere the interested party did not have proper notice of the hearing\u201d. In our view, and here we fully share the characterisation given to the proceedings by the Court of Appeal, although the applicant was given notice to appear and attended the hearing, he was firstly put in an \u201cimpossible position\u201d by having on the one hand to make representations in the contact proceedings and on the other to defend himself without any legal knowledge against the application for committal. Secondly, he was incapable, owing to his lack of legal assistance, to draw the judge\u2019s attention to \u201cmaterial relevant to the facts of the breaches\u201d, the actual charges upon which the committal order was based, and thirdly to make any arguments against the actual prison sentence, Lord Justice Moses characterising this phase of the proceedings as \u201cfatally flawed\u201d.",

Indeed, for the purposes of the requirements of lawfulness under this provision, and taking account of the nature of the elements to be determined under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b), by proceeding with committing the applicant to prison without giving him any real and effective opportunity of defending himself against the committal order with the assistance of a lawyer, the procedural defects were not materially different in their overall scope and consequences from a situation where the applicant would have simply been committed to prison without having been notified of the dates of the hearings.",
