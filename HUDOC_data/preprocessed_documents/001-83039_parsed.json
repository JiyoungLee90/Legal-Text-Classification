The ill-treatment was said to have been inflicted principally in the central corridor of the detention facility, usually when prisoners were taken to an investigator's room for questioning or when they were returned to their cells after such questioning; apparently, prisoners were also on occasion physically ill-treated in the investigators' rooms. Investigators were said to have been fully aware of the ill treatment being inflicted, and some prisoners affirmed that it was inflicted at their instigation.

If no remedies are available or if they are judged to be ineffective, the six-month period in principle runs from the date of the act complained of (see Hazar and Others v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 62566/00 et seq., 10 January 2002). Special considerations may apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period may be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of those circumstances (see Bulut and Yavuz v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 73065/01, 28 May 2002).",

To the contrary, three medical reports drawn up while the applicant was in detention, in the pre-trial detention centres in Chernokozovo, Pyatigorsk and Stavropol, did not refer to any injuries or complaints (see, a contrario, Chitayev and Chitayev v. , no.\u00a059334/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0150-151, 18 January 2007).",

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article\u00a013 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by acts or omissions by the authorities of the respondent State (see Ayd\u0131n\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997VI, pp.\u00a01895-96, \u00a7\u00a0103).",

Consequently, any other remedy available to him, including the claim for damages, had limited chances of success. While the civil courts have the capacity to make an independent assessment of fact, in practice the weight attached to preliminary criminal enquiries is so important that even the most convincing evidence to the contrary furnished by a plaintiff would often be dismissed as \u201cirrelevant\u201d (see Menesheva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 59261/00, \u00a7 76, 9 March 2006).",
