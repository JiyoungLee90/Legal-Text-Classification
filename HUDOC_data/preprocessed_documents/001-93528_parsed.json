That finding was consistent with the well-established case-law of the criminal courts (compare the cases cited at paragraphs 48-49 above) that, for reasons of legal certainty, incorrect court decisions could only be considered void ab initio in exceptional circumstances in which the recognition of their at least provisional validity pending the issue of a replacement order would manifestly fly in the face of fundamental principles of the constitutional order. In all other cases, defective court decisions, such as the detention order in the applicant's case, were considered valid until replaced in the course of proceedings for judicial review. Thus, notably formal defects in court decisions, such as the insufficient statement of reasons in the detention order in the instant case, could be cured in judicial review proceedings, which served precisely to correct mistakes.",

Accordingly, unless they constitute a gross and obvious irregularity, defects in a detention order may be remedied by the domestic appeal courts in the course of judicial review proceedings.",

On this last point, the Court stresses that, where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied (see Baranowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52; Je\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 56; and Khudoyorov, cited above, \n\u00a7 125).

As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty which is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention. While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis.

The Court has considered the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time to be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Sta\u0161aitis v.

Thus, the Court considered in the context of sub-paragraph (c) that a period of less than a month between the expiry of the initial detention order and the issuing of a fresh, reasoned detention order following a remittal of the case from the appeal court to a lower court did not render the applicant's detention arbitrary (see Minjat, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 48). In contrast, a period of more than a year following a remittal from a court of appeal to a court of lower instance, in which the applicant remained in a state of uncertainty as to the grounds for his detention on remand, combined with the lack of a time-limit for the lower court to re-examine his detention, was found to render the applicant's detention arbitrary (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \n\u00a7\u00a7 136-37).",

It observes that according to the findings of the German courts, the order in question did not suffer from a serious and obvious defect which rendered it null and void. In fact, the German legal system, like the Convention system, distinguishes between detention orders which are null and void and those which remain valid until overturned by a higher court (see paragraphs 48-49 above).

However, contrary to the applicant's submission, neither that nor any other breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 \u2013 even though that provision is part of domestic law \u2013 automatically entails a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1.

It observes that in the present case, following the Court of Appeal's decision of 14 October 2002 to remit the case to the District Court, the applicant remained in custody on the basis of the initial detention order of 25 July 2002 \u2013 despite the fact that it had been considered defective by the Court of Appeal \u2013 until 29 October 2002, when the District Court issued a fresh detention order which was based on more detailed facts. Thus, for a period of fifteen days the applicant was detained while being only partly, but not fully, aware of the facts on which the strong suspicion of his involvement in tax evasion and his arrest were based, although the Court of Appeal had made it clear that it considered his detention to be justified in substance.",

In circumstances such as those obtaining in the present case, the benefits of remitting the case to a lower court may outweigh the inconvenience caused by the delay and may even serve to avoid unnecessary delays. Thus, firstly, remittal can enable the defects of the initial decision to be remedied while taking advantage of the lower court's full command of the case-file along with its more precise knowledge of the suspect's personal situation and of the state of the investigations against him. Moreover, in the case at hand the Court of Appeal did not confine itself to overturning the District Court's decision but instructed it how to avoid defective decisions in the future. This served the purpose of improving the administration of justice in the long run. Secondly, it was necessary to schedule a hearing attended by the applicant (represented by counsel), the Public Prosecutor's Office and a tax official in order to enable the applicant to be informed at least orally of the evidence against him and to make representations, and this required practical arrangements to be made. In these circumstances, the decision to remit the case may have actually avoided delays because, from the procedural perspective, it may well have proved quicker for the case to be remitted and for the District Court to decide whether a new detention order should be issued than for the Court of Appeal to decide that issue. Finally, under the domestic law, the District Court's fresh decision was subject to time constraints in that it had to be taken speedily (see paragraph 47 above) and it was that court which, following the remittal, had to arrange for a renewed hearing of the parties. Having regard to its case-law (see, in particular, that cited in paragraph 80 above, and, mutatis mutandis, in paragraph 81), the Court finds that in these circumstances, the time that elapsed between the Court of Appeal's finding that the detention order was defective and the issuing of a fresh detention order by the District Court did not render the applicant's detention arbitrary either.",

The Chamber observed that there had been no substantial periods of inactivity in the review proceedings. However, at the time the Court of Appeal took its decision, these proceedings had already been pending for two months and seven days before the domestic courts, including the period of twenty-eight days the proceedings had stood pending before the Court of Appeal itself. Moreover, as the Court of Appeal had quashed all the decisions taken in the judicial review proceedings up to that point, two months and twenty-two days had elapsed between the applicant's request for judicial review of his detention order filed on 7 August 2002 and the District Court's decision on the merits of his request following the remittal on 29 October 2002.

It considered that the applicant's complaint about the failure to grant his counsel access to the case file was only one aspect of his more comprehensive complaint about the lawfulness of his detention order. Additional proceedings for judicial review of the decision not to grant the applicant's counsel access to the case file under Article 147 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not therefore have been capable of providing redress in respect of the alleged unlawfulness of the detention order, but only in respect of one aspect of the violation the applicant had complained of. Moreover, the Regional Court, which would have had jurisdiction to hear an application under Article 147 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, had in fact dealt with the applicant's complaint about the refusal of access to the file, and the applicant had also raised this issue before the Federal Constitutional Court in the course of the proceedings for judicial review of the detention order, which he had pursued to a conclusion. The Chamber concluded that in these circumstances, an additional application for judicial review under Article 147 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not have been an effective remedy offering reasonable prospects of success which the applicant was required to exhaust (see paragraphs 83-84 of the Chamber judgment).",

Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 19, Series A no. 32; Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 1999-II; and \u0130lhan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2000-VII). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to convince the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress directly in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been discharged, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 68, Reports 1996-IV, and Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2003-VI). Thus, an applicant cannot be criticised for not having made use of a legal remedy which would have been directed to essentially the same end as the proceedings the applicant pursued to a conclusion and which moreover would not have had a better prospect of success (compare Iatridis, cited above, \u00a7 47, and Miailhe v. France (no. 1), 25 February 1993, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 256-C).",

In its decision of 9 September 2002, the  suggested that counsel for the applicant should be informed orally of the content of the case file in the first instance and could not claim unlimited access at that stage of the proceedings (see paragraph 20 above). The Federal Constitutional Court, which would also have had jurisdiction to review a dismissal by the Regional Court of any separate application expressly made by the applicant under Article 147 \u00a7 5, declined to consider the applicant's constitutional complaint about the detention order, in which he had raised the issue of lack of access to the file. In view of this, the Court considers that it can leave open the question whether a separate request under Article\u00a0147 \u00a7 5 could in general be considered an effective remedy capable of providing redress in cases in which a detainee contests the lawfulness of his detention in the first place. It finds that, in any event, in the particular circumstances of the case, in which the Regional Court expressly addressed and rejected the request for access to the case file in a decision that was upheld by the Federal Constitutional Court, any further, separate application under Article 147 \u00a7 5 to those same courts would have been bound to fail.",

The fact that the Court of Appeal had later acknowledged that the applicant's procedural rights had been curtailed by the failure to grant his counsel access to the case file and that the domestic authorities had allowed his counsel to inspect the file after his conditional release were incapable of remedying in an effective manner the procedural shortcomings that had occurred in the earlier stages of the proceedings.

The Court of Appeal explained that the requirement set out in Article 114 \u00a7 2, no. 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for a detailed statement applied particularly to cases such as the applicant's in which defence counsel had been refused access to the case file. It also reiterated that the requirement could not be satisfied by a purely formal exposition of the requisite information. It found, however, that the impugned detention order was defective in law (rechtsfehlerhaft), but not void (unwirksam). Accordingly, without quashing the order, ordering the applicant's release or making a fresh order for his detention itself, as required by domestic law (Article 309 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), it simply remitted the case to the District Court.",

In its judgment of 14 October 2002, the D\u00fcsseldorf Court of Appeal explained this deficiency in the following terms: \u201cThe District Court did not comply in its detention order with the prescribed requirements. \nThe detention order simply states that the accused is strongly suspected of the acts he is accused of 'on account of the business documents found during the house search'.

While the remittal procedure appears to have been in line with judicial authority that permitted exceptions to the rule in cases similar to the applicant's, it nevertheless poses serious problems as regards compliance with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Article 309 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires courts of appeal to decide for themselves whether contested detention orders are well-founded, appears to have been designed to protect defendants from being kept in detention on the basis of orders that do not comply with domestic law. \nThat is exactly what happened to the applicant in the instant case. After the D\u00fcsseldorf Court of Appeal declined in its judgment of 14 October 2002 to examine the well-foundedness of the impugned order itself after finding flaws in it, the applicant remained in custody until 29 October 2002, uncertain of the exact reasons why he was being deprived of his liberty and on the basis of an order that had been deemed defective.",

Poland, 28 March 2000, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2000-III; Goral v. Poland, no. 38654/97, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58, 30 October 2003; and Ciszewski, cited above, \u00a7 30).",
