In addition, there were no hearings in the applicant\u2019s case at all during six months and fourteen days between 8 April 2002 and 22 October 2002 and the Government have failed to submit any explanations in this respect. Finally, the Court notes that the respondents in the case did not attend the hearings at least on three occasions on 25 June 1999, 19 January and 8 February 2000 respectively and did not excuse themselves by reference to a good reason, whilst the District Court could have reacted to such conduct but failed to do so. Overall, it can be concluded that out of four years, one month and six days during which the case was pending at first instance (from 16 September 1998 to 22 October 2002), the delay in proceedings clearly attributable to the authorities was of one and a half years.",
