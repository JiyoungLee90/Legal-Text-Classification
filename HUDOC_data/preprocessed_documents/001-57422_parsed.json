Accordingly, the right to continue to practise constituted, in the case of the applicants, a private right and thus a civil right within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), notwithstanding the specific character of the medical profession - a profession which is exercised in the general interest - and the special duties incumbent on its members.",

In many member States of the Council of Europe, the duty of adjudicating on disciplinary offences is conferred on jurisdictional organs of professional associations.

Such reasoning is based on a complete misconception of the purpose of appeal proceedings. In point of fact, the object and nature of a case (or a contestation/dispute) do not change with the various levels of jurisdiction, independently of the arguments, grounds and claims put forward on appeal: if the proceedings before the Provincial Council did not have as their object the determination of a contestation (dispute) over civil rights and obligations, it could not be otherwise in regard to the proceedings before the Appeals Council and the Court of Cassation. In other words, the \"contestation\" (dispute) formed the object of those proceedings, or was irrelevant thereto, from the very outset; it could not \"arise\" (see paragraph 34, first sub-paragraph of the judgment) on appeal or during the cassation proceedings.",
