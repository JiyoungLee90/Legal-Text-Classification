The plaintiff complained that the ordinary courts had discontinued proceedings concerning his action challenging a decision of the Minister of Defence by which he had been dismissed as a professional soldier. The courts based their decision on the fact that review of the decision in issue was excluded from their jurisdiction under Article\u00a0248 \u00a7 2(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Constitutional Court held that Article 46 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution was complied with only where a court examined whether an administrative decision contested by the plaintiff had a bearing on any of his or her fundamental rights and freedoms, regardless of whether or not the relevant law permitted a judicial review of such decisions. In the case under consideration the ordinary courts had discontinued the proceedings on the ground that the law excluded judicial review of the relevant decision, without considering whether or not that decision concerned the plaintiff's fundamental rights and freedoms.
