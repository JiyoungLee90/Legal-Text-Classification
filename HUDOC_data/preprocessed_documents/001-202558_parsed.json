In particular, the Supreme Administrative Court held that Article 72, the purpose of which was to secure the smooth running of the market and the protection of investors, did not specify particular forms of disseminating inexact or misleading information that could lead to artificially influencing the price of shares. If those transactions had therefore been entered into with the intention of providing false information concerning the price and marketability of securities so as not to reflect their true value, and had resulted in misleading investors as regards elements that could influence their decision-making, then the performance of those transactions would be in breach of the provision. The transactions entered into had constituted dissemination of inexact or misleading information, given that the artificially formulated data concerning the price and marketability of the shares had been published, by virtue of the relevant legislation, in the daily stock exchange official list and in the electronic record of transactions. In addition, the above-mentioned conclusion was reinforced by the second sentence of Article\u00a072\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02, which provided that professional facilitators, that is to say those who on a daily basis enter into many transactions on behalf of others, would not be sanctioned unless they knew or ought to have known that by entering into those transactions, they had been attempting to disseminate inexact or misleading information.\u00a0\u00a0The conclusions mentioned above were not affected by the fact that in a subsequent law, no.\u00a03340/2005, the ways in which manipulation of the market could be achieved were specified. Those included both entering into transactions and disseminating inexact or misleading information as two distinct ways of manipulating the market. In fact, Law no.\u00a03340/2005 had merely specified the terms and conditions of an infringement of the said provision, in compliance with Directive 2003/6/EC.",

They could also have anticipated that sanctions would be imposed on them by virtue of Article 72 \u00a7\u00a02. Furthermore, the applicants had not claimed that the Supreme Administrative Court or the administrative courts in general had interpreted the provision differently. Having regard to those considerations, the applicants had erroneously claimed that the above-mentioned interpretation of the impugned provision had violated Article 7 of the Convention, which applied not only to criminal sanctions but also to other sanctions that emulated \u201cpenalties\u201d based on certain criteria.",

Austria (23 October 1995, Series A no. 328C). In addition, the degree of severity of the penalty provided for by the impugned legal provision was not such as to be considered of criminal law.

To\u00a0render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective, the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of this provision (see G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others v. Italy [GC], nos. 1828/06 and 2 others, \u00a7 211, 28 June 2018; Welch v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 307A; Jamil v.\u00a0France, 8 June 1995, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 317B; and Del R\u00edo Prada, cited above, \u00a7 81). The wording of the second sentence of Article 7 \u00a7 1 indicates that the starting-point \u2013 and thus a very weighty factor (see Glien v.\u00a0Germany, no. 7345/12, \u00a7 121, 28 November 2013, and Bergmann, cited above, \u00a7 150) \u2013 in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question was imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28; Van \u00a0der \u00a0Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 142).

In particular, the above-mentioned provision, which sought to guarantee the smooth operation of the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors, provided for the imposition of a fine for the publication or dissemination \u201cin any way\u201d of inaccurate or misleading information which, by its nature, could influence the price or marketability of securities that were to be listed or were already listed in a stock market.",

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, \u00a7\u00a092, 17\u00a0September 2009, and Huhtam\u00e4ki v.\u00a0Finland, no. 54468/09, \u00a7\u00a041, 6\u00a0March 2012). Article 7 of the Convention is not confined to prohibiting the retroactive application of criminal law to the disadvantage of an accused. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to the detriment of an accused, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019\u00a0interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of \u201claw\u201d, Article\u00a07 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22\u00a0November 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03233, Series A no. 335C; S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22\u00a0November 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03435, Series A no. 335B; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.\u00a0Germany [GC], nos.\u00a034044/96, 35532/97, 44801/98, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR 2001-II; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 140).",

In particular, it is clear to the Court that the legislator wished to secure the market from the dissemination or publication of false or inaccurate information that could affect the price or marketability of securities. In this connection, the conclusions of the domestic court that any intervention in respect of securities that affected their real value or marketability and resulted in artificial supply and demand, produced information that was capable of distorting the market and affecting the price and marketability and thus fell within the ambit of Article 72 \u00a7 2 of Law no.\u00a01969/1991, do not appear unreasonable.

In this regard, the Court notes that the Government provided several judgments, albeit from first-instance administrative courts and not from the Supreme Administrative Court, which had interpreted the said Article as they did in the case of the applicants as long ago as 2002 and 2003, that is to say before the applicants had proceeded with the transactions for which they were sanctioned by the Commission. Although there was a subsequent change in how that provision was interpreted by the domestic courts (see paragraph\u00a021 above concerning judgment 1898/2006 of the Supreme Administrative Court), the applicants cannot say that they were influenced by that change in the case-law, which took place after they had committed the offence. In this regard, the case differs from Dragotoniu and Militaru-Pidhorni (cited above), in which the Court held that there had been a violation of Article\u00a07 of the Convention due to the fact that the applicants could not have foreseen the change in the domestic case-law, which had rendered their actions punishable offences, whereas that had not been the case until then (ibid., \u00a7\u00a044). It is here reiterated that Article 7 of the Convention is not incompatible with judicial law-making and does not outlaw the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos.\u00a011082/06 and 13772/05, \u00a7\u00a0221, 25\u00a0July 2013). The above-mentioned considerations are equally applicable to a country whose legal system is based on statute and not on court precedents, such as Greece. As long as a criminal statutory provision may be objectively construed as referring to the indicated conduct, foreseeability of judicial interpretation may not be excluded (see, in this regard, K.A. and A.D. v. Belgium, nos.\u00a042758/98 and 45558/99, \u00a7\u00a055, 17 February 2005, in which the Court held that no decisive importance should be attached to a lack of comparable precedents).",

Persons carrying on a professional activity must proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation and can be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, \u00a7 235, ECHR 2010). It follows that the applicants, acting in their professional capacity, were expected to take such special care when entering into transactions in assessing the risks of their activity.",

In particular, it is clear that Article 7 of Law no.\u00a03340/2005, which replaced the impugned provision in 2005, was a transposition of Directive 2003/6/EC (see paragraph 18 above). If one looks at the original text of the Directive, it is easily inferred that the Greek legislator merely transposed into national law the provisions of the Directive and that the wording of the two texts is almost identical in its relevant parts (see paragraphs 22 and 18 above). Therefore, it cannot be said that the legislator for the first time meant to include that behaviour as a way of manipulating the market, because in any event, the more detailed wording was a result of the wording used in the European legislation that was subsequently transposed into the national law.",
