However, it is ready to accept that that protest was an immediate response of the people who had gathered near the Baku Court of Serious Crimes to the judgment of that court against certain Nida members. Those circumstances warranted a spontaneous protest on that particular date, and overrode the obligation to submit a prior notice about an assembly (see, mutatis mutandis, Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, ECHR 2007III). The Court also observes that, indeed, according to Article 5 \u00a7 IV of the Law on Freedom of Assembly, no prior written notification was required for \u201cspontaneous assemblies\u201d (see paragraph 25 above). In such circumstances, the Court has doubts as to whether the dispersal of the assembly of 6 May 2014 was prescribed by law (contrast with Ibrahimov and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11, 69252/11 and 69335/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 11 February 2016).

Therefore, for the same reasons as those outlined in that judgment, the Court concludes that the authorities in the present cases have not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the protest (see Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 61).

They were sentenced to thirty and twenty days of administrative detention respectively. The measures applied in the present cases, and the fear of sanctions that could potentially be applied against participants and organisers of unauthorised peaceful assemblies, undoubtedly had a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of assembly.

The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions in that judgment also apply to the present cases. In that case, the Court noted in particular that the administrative offence proceedings in question had lacked the necessary safeguards and guarantees. The time and facilities to prepare the defence had been inadequate (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 78-81). In addition, there had been: a strong reliance by the domestic courts on the administrative-offence report prepared by the police and the statements given by a police officer (ibid., \u00a7\u00a085); utter disregard by the domestic courts of important factual circumstances and legal issues in the case, inter alia, the peaceful nature of the unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7 86); an absence of legal assistance at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-91); a failure to provide an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of one\u2019s own choosing (ibid., \u00a7 92); and purely formalistic representation by the State-funded lawyer (ibid., \u00a7 93).
