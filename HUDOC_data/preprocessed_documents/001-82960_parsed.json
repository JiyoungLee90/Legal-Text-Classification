By the last decision given in the case on 21\u00a0September\u00a02001, the Court of Appeal obliged the District Court to reconsider the issue of admissibility of his complaint, having found unpersuasive its previous decision to dismiss it on the ground that the reinstatement proceedings, raising the same issue, had been pending. The District Court has since failed to take any formal decision in the case. Its explanation that the two sets of proceedings were identical, given to the applicant in an informal letter of 29\u00a0June\u00a02006 (see paragraph 19 above), which could not be appealed against, does not, in the Court's view, provide a plausible explanation for its failure to take a formal decision as instructed by the Court of Appeal. More so, the Court recalls that the applicant's reinstatement claims were finally dismissed on account of his failure to comply with the reinstatement-specific statutory time-limit for instituting them (see paragraphs 8-10 above). Therefore, it is not obvious that the examination of the admissibility of the applicant's \u201cunlawful transfer\u201d claim, whether or not it was identical in substance with the reinstatement claim, would have yielded the same result.",
