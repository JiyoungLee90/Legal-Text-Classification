Nor did he summon other officers who had been on duty or identify potential witnesses who worked at the Motherland Party\u2019s provincial branch in , other than a certain Y.U.

In the Court\u2019s view, the Beyo\u011flu public prosecutor should have awaited the outcome of the criminal proceedings against the applicant before holding that she had participated in an illegal meeting and resisted the police, or deciding not to bring criminal proceedings in respect of her allegations. The Court further finds it noteworthy that the  upheld that decision of the Beyo\u011flu public prosecutor even though another criminal court had, in the meantime, established the facts surrounding the incident and concluded that the applicant and the other women had not taken part in an illegal meeting or resisted the police.",
