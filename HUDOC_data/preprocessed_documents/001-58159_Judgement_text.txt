The case was referred to the Court by the Italian Government (“the Government”) on 9 October 1997, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 32305/96) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 25 by an Italian national, Mr Gian Carlo Fisanotti (“the applicant”), on 28 April 1994.
The Government’s application referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby Italy recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings.
On 25 October 1997 the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, decided that, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, this case should be considered by the Chamber already constituted on 27 August 1997 to consider the case of S.R. v. Italy (Rule 21 § 7). That Chamber included ex officio Mr C. Russo, the elected judge of Italian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)); the other seven members, drawn by lot, were Mr R. Macdonald, Mr N. Valticos, Mr I. Foighel, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr J. Makarczyk and Mr U. Lōhmus (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 § 1 and 40). Pursuant to the orders made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s claims for just satisfaction on 9 December 1997 and the Government’s memorial on 19 December 1997. On 26 January 1998 the Secretary to the Commission indicated that the Delegate did not wish to submit observations in writing.
On 12 December 1997 the Commission had produced the file on the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the instructions of the President of the Chamber.
In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 29 January 1998. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.
There appeared before the Court:
The Court heard addresses by Mr Soyer and Mr Esposito.

7.  As Mr Macdonald was unable to take part in the deliberations on 25 March 1998, he was replaced by Sir John Freeland, substitute judge (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).
Mr Gian Carlo Fisanotti was born in 1935 and lives in Cagliari. He was a civil servant until he took early retirement on 31 July 1989.
On 13 July 1992 the applicant applied to the Sardinia Regional Division of the Court of Audit (“the Regional Division”) for an enhanced pension. He claimed that his illness had been caused by his work.
On 11 November 1992 the file was forwarded to Principal State Counsel for preparation of the case. Following the entry into force of Legislative Decree no. 232 of 17 July 1993, which abolished the role of State Counsel in pensions litigation, the file was sent back to the Regional Division on 28 July 1993.
The first hearing was held on 28 January 1995. By an order of the same date, which was deposited with the registry on 4 March 1996, the Regional Division requested the opinion of the Medical Board of Cagliari Military Hospital. On 3 June 1997 the applicant was examined by the Board.
On 6 October 1997 the President of the Regional Division set down a hearing for 11 February 1998.
The applicant applied to the Commission on 28 April 1994. Relying on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he complained of the length of the proceedings in the Court of Audit.
On 15 April 1997 the Commission (First Chamber) declared the application (no. 32305/96) admissible. In its report of 9 July 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1. The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
The Government asked the Court to hold that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The applicant called upon the Court to find a violation of that provision and to award him just satisfaction.
