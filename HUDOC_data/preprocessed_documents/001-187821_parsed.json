As regards the second applicant, it transpires from his constitutional appeal that he expressly complained, albeit in a succinct manner, about the length of the impugned proceedings (contrast Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 82, in which the applicants did not raise their discrimination complaint before the Constitutional Court, either expressly or in substance, and \u0160a\u0107irovi\u0107, cited above,\u00a7 12). They indicated the key developments and decisions taken in the course of their proceedings. They used phrases such as \u201cas it is evident that the respondent protracts the proceedings by different acts\u201d, \u201cunfortunately, and I consider it as a shame of the court, I am being served with the [second instance] decision after three years, which makes this dispute lasting six years and which I do not consider as a trial within a reasonable time\u201d, \u201ca labour dispute which lasts since 2006, which amounts to a violation of a right to a trial within a reasonable time\u201d, \u201cprotraction of the proceedings and irresponsibility\u201d, \u201cby violation Article 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure the court violated a right to a trial within a reasonable time\u201d, \u201cthe proceedings lasted more than seven years\u201d. They all had also explicitly relied on Article\u00a032 of the Serbian Constitution which corresponds to Article 6 of the Convention. Complaints about the length of proceedings, unlike some other complaints under the Convention, normally do not require much elaboration. If, exceptionally, the Constitutional Court needed any additional information or documents, it could have requested the applicants to provide them. It follows that the applicants provided the national authorities with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, namely of putting right the violations alleged against them (see, amongst many others, Mur\u0161i\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2016, Joksimovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no.\u00a037929/10, \u00a7 21, 7 November 2017, and \u0160a\u0107irovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 12).",
