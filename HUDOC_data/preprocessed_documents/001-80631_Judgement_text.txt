The case originated in an application (no. 77147/01) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Rafi Hrant Kuyumdzhiyan, a Bulgarian national born in 1944 and living in  (“the applicant”), on 23 October 2001.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms S. Stefanova, lawyers practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms M. Pasheva and Ms M. Kotseva, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 19 September 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
In 1948 and 1950 a flat owned by an ancestor of the applicant was nationalised. In 1969 the State sold that flat to Mr and Mrs B. It seems that Mr B. died on an unspecified date prior to 1987.
On 11 May 1992 the applicant brought an action against Mrs B. and the municipality of Plovdiv under section 7 of the Restitution of Ownership of Nationalised Real Property Act of 1992 (“the Restitution Act of 1992”), seeking a declaration that the sale of the flat had been null and void. He stated that the sale had been made in breach of the law and that Mr B., who had been registered as an “anti-fascist and anti-capitalist veteran” – a title which at the relevant time carried a number of privileges guaranteed by law – had abused his position to obtain the flat.
At the first hearing, held on 4 August 1992, the Plovdiv District Court admitted written evidence and gave leave to the parties to adduce further evidence.
At the next hearing, held on 26 October 1992, the court rejected the applicant's request to supplement his statement of claim, admitted written evidence, heard the parties and reserved judgment.
On 5 November 1992 the court, sitting in private, observed that the claim as initially worded by the applicant was inconsistent and instructed him to clarify his request for relief. It scheduled a new hearing for 4 December 1992. On 30 November 1992 the applicant declared that he claimed the restitution of the apartment under section 7 of the Restitution Act of 1992.
The hearing scheduled for 4 December 1992 was adjourned as the  had not been properly summoned.
The Plovdiv District Court held hearings on 20 January, 13 April and 28 December 1993, and 12 April 1994. At the hearing on 13 April 1993 it granted the applicant's request to constitute the heirs of Mr B. as additional defendants. One hearing listed for 21 September 1993 was adjourned because the newly constituted defendants had not received copies of the statement of claim. At the hearings of 28 December 1993 and 12 April 1994 three of the newly constituted defendants, two of whom were residing in , were represented by counsel.
In a judgment of 8 June 1994 the Plovdiv District Court ordered that the part of the flat which had been acquired by Mrs B. be restituted to the applicant and dismissed the remainder of his claim.
On 13 July 1994 the applicant appealed. So did the defendants.
At a hearing held on 3 October 1994 the  admitted written evidence and reserved judgment.
In a judgment of 23 February 1995 the  quashed the lower court's judgment and dismissed the entirety of the applicant's claim.
On 11 April 1995 the applicant lodged a petition for review. The Plovdiv District Court tried to serve a copy of the petition on the counsel of the two defendants who were residing in , but she refused to accept the service of process, stating that her power of attorney did not extend to the review proceedings. On 4 January 1996 the Plovdiv District Court agreed that the representative's power of attorney was only valid until the end of the secondinstance proceedings and accordingly ordered that the defendants be served personally in . In view of this, on 12 April 1996 the Bulgarian Ministry of Justice sent a letter rogatory to the Russian authorities, asking them to serve a copy of the petition on the two defendants. It seems that the letter rogatory was executed in respect of one of the defendants on an unspecified date prior to November 1998. However, it remained unexecuted in respect of the other defendant. Between 1996 and 1999 the Bulgarian Ministry of Justice sent nine reminders to the Russian authorities and twice asked the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for assistance. However, these efforts were to no avail. Accordingly, the petition for review remained with the Plovdiv District Court and was not sent to the Supreme Court of Cassation for examination.
In the meantime, in 1997, the applicant found out that the two defendants residing in Russia were on a visit to  and apprised the Plovdiv District Court about that. On 30 September 1997 the court ordered that a copy of the petition for review be served on them in . However, the process was returned to the court with a note that the defendants could not be found at the address specified.
On 23 February 1998 the applicant complained about the protraction of the proceedings to the Ministry of Justice. In a letter of 7 March 1998 the Ministry informed the applicant that the letter rogatory was unfortunately still not executed and that, regrettably, the Russian authorities used to procrastinate in the execution of letters rogatory. On 16 April 1999 the applicant complained to the chairperson of the Plovdiv District Court and asked him to apply Article 44 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1952 (“the CCP”) (see paragraph 26 below).
Despite the lack of service, on an unspecified date in 2000 the Plovdiv District Court sent the petition for review to the Supreme Court of Cassation.
The first hearing before the Supreme Court of Cassation, listed for 8 November 2000, was adjourned due to the defective summoning of the two defendants residing in .
On 28 February 2001 the Supreme Court of Cassation held a hearing, despite the absence of the two defendants residing in . It briefly noted that all defendants, including those residing in , had been properly summoned.
In a final judgment of 31 May 2001 the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's petition for review.
Until 31 March 1998 the judgments of the regional courts given as a secondinstance court were “final” and could be set aside only in accordance with Article 225 et seq. of the CCP.
Articles 225-30 of the CCP, repealed with effect from 1 April 1998, governed review proceedings before the former Supreme Court. Prior to 1990 these texts stipulated that review proceedings were initiated on the proposal of the Chief Prosecutor or the chairperson of the Supreme Court, which was not, as a rule, limited by time, and was examined in private by a section of the Supreme Court or its Plenary.
However, these texts were fully reshuffled with effect from 21 April 1990 and henceforth provided that review proceedings were initiated upon the petition of a party to the case (Article 225 § 1), lodged within two months after the entry into force of the lower court's judgment (Article 226 § 1), or the proposal of the Chief Prosecutor (Article 225 § 2), lodged within one year after the judgment's entry into force (Article 226 § 1). The petition was examined by the Supreme Court at a public hearing in the presence of the parties to the case (Article 227 § 2). The Supreme Court had the power to set the judgment aside wholly or in part, whenever (i) it was “contrary to the law”, (ii) “substantial breaches of procedural law [had] occurred during the proceedings or in connection with the delivery of the judgment”, or (iii) it was “ill-founded” (Article 225 § 3 in conjunction with Article 207). If the Supreme Court set the lower court's judgment aside, it could either decide the case itself, or exceptionally remit it to the lower court for reexamination (Article 229 § 2).
By Article 22 § 4 of the CCP, unless stipulated otherwise, the power of attorney of the representative of a party to a case is valid for all levels of court until the proceedings come to an end.
By Article 44 § 1 of the CCP, if a party resides outside Bulgaria or goes out of the country for more than thirty days, and does not have a representative residing in the country, it has to indicate an address in Bulgaria for the service of process. If it fails to do so, all documents which need to be served on it are put in the case file and are considered as duly served. The parties must be warned about this upon the first communication from the court (Article 44 § 2). The obligation stemming from Article 44 § 1 of the CCP continues until the case is examined by the Supreme Court in review proceedings (реш. № 380 от 26 ноември 1999 г. по гр.д. № 246/1999 г., ВКС, петчленен състав), but does not apply in the fresh proceedings before the firstinstance court, if the case is remitted (реш. № 2441 от 29 август 1979 г. по гр.д. № 1494/1979 г., ВС, І г.о.).
Article 217a of the CCP, adopted in July 1999, provides:
“1.  Each party may lodge a complaint about delays at every stage of the case, including after oral argument, when the examination of the case, the delivery of judgment or the transmitting of an appeal against a judgment is unduly delayed.
The complaint about delays shall be lodged directly with the higher court, no copies shall be served on the other party, and no State fee shall be due. The lodging of a complaint about delays shall not be limited by time.
The chairperson of the court with which the complaint has been lodged shall request the case file and shall immediately examine the complaint in private. His instructions as to the acts to be performed by the court shall be mandatory. His order shall not be subject to appeal and shall be sent immediately together with the case file to the court against which the complaint has been lodged.
In case he determines that there has been [undue delay], the chairperson of the higher court may make a proposal to the disciplinary panel of the Supreme Judicial Council for the taking of disciplinary action.”
