The third applicant and its representative, KJ, were indicted for having failed, from 1999 to 2002, to declare salaries and car allowances enjoyed by the first applicant and other employees, for not having withheld public levies on these allowances and pay them to the state treasury, for having neglected to declare correctly the profits and losses from the sale of shares in Baugur Group and for having overdeclared expenditure and losses.",

Russia ([GC], no. 14939/03, ECHR 2009), the District Court therefore dismissed those parts of the indictment on the ground that they referred to offences for which the applicants had already been tried and punished by the decisions of the Directorate of Internal Revenue of 30\u00a0December 2004 and 29 December 2005, as upheld by the Internal Revenue Board in its decisions of 29 August and 26 September 2007.",

It referred to section 2 of the Act on the European Convention on Human Rights (L\u00f6g um mannr\u00e9ttindas\u00e1ttm\u00e1la Evr\u00f3pu, no. 62/1994), in which the legislature had reiterated the validity of the principle of dualism of national law and international law in respect of the decisions of the institutions established under the Convention. It stated that the courts should look to the judgments of the European Court when interpreting the Convention, but that the principle of dualism required that the necessary amendments to national law to honour the State\u2019s obligations under the Convention would have to be made by the legislature. Domestic law provided for the current system where tax offences could be dealt with in two separate sets of proceedings, one deciding on surcharges and the other on criminal punishment, even in circumstances where the proceedings were based on the same or substantially the same facts. According to the Supreme Court, the case-law of the European Court had not been clear on this issue and, consequently, there was uncertainty as to the scope and content of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. In the light of this, the Supreme Court found that the domestic courts could not decide that the current system of tax surcharges and subsequent criminal proceedings was in violation of the Convention.",

France (dec.), nos. 36855/97 and 41731/98, ECHR\u00a01999VI; Janosevic v. Sweden, no. 34619/97, ECHR 2002VII; Rosenquist v. Sweden (dec.), no. 60619/00, 24 September 2004; and Carlberg v.

The primary purpose of the surcharges was therefore to ensure that the tax authorities were provided with adequate, correct and timely information to enable them to regulate in a practical and efficient manner the levy of taxes. There needed to be an effective and immediately applicable sanction to ensure this. Criminal proceedings could take a long time and it would reduce the deterrent effects against violations of the tax law if sanctions could only be applied after the conclusion of criminal proceedings. Moreover, the tax authorities did not take any stand on the criminal character of the actions of taxpayers; there were other provisions in the Income Tax Act and other acts relevant to taxation which were more akin to criminal sanctions and which involved a requirement of intent or gross neglect.

Sweden ((dec.), no. 73661/01, ECHR 2005XIII), they argued that the provision did not prohibit parallel proceedings. In the present case, the tax proceedings and the criminal proceedings had begun at virtually the same time, since the investigation of the Director of Tax Investigations had been finalised on 27 October 2004 and he had reported the matter to the Economic Crimes Unit of the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police on 12 November 2004. The criminal proceedings had begun on the latter date and the criminal investigation had been ongoing for the entire period during which the tax proceedings had taken place. In August 2006 the applicants had been informed that they had the status of suspects in the criminal investigation and they had been indicted on 18 December 2008. The Government submitted that it was of no relevance that the indictment had been issued after the decisions of the tax authorities relating to the tax surcharges had become final, as the investigation had begun many years earlier. When, as in the present case, the criminal proceedings had begun long before the final decision by the tax authorities had been issued, the applicants could have had no legitimate expectation that the criminal proceedings would be discontinued. Moreover, the two sets of proceedings had been closely connected in substance as they had been rooted in the same events. Thus, they had been a part of an integrated dual process.",

Nonetheless, as explained above (see notably paragraphs 111 and 117-120), Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 does not exclude the conduct of dual proceedings, even to their term, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. In particular, for the Court to be satisfied that there is no duplication of trial or punishment (bis) as proscribed by Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, the respondent State must demonstrate convincingly that the dual proceedings in question have been \u201csufficiently closely connected in substance and in time\u201d. In other words, it must be shown that they have been combined in an integrated manner so as to form a coherent whole.

However, in determining the prison sentence the court only considered the excessive length of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the Court concludes that, given that the tax surcharges were offset against the fines, the sanctions already imposed in the tax proceedings were sufficiently taken into account in the sentencing in the criminal proceedings.",

The applicants\u2019 conduct and their liability under the different provisions of tax and criminal law were thus examined by different authorities and courts in proceedings that were largely independent of each other.",

During that period, the proceedings were in effect progressing concurrently between August 2006, when the first interviews were held by the police, and 29 August 2007 (in the second applicant\u00b4s case) or 26\u00a0September 2007 (in the first applicant\u00b4s case), when the Internal Revenue Board issued its decisions upon the applicants\u2019 tax appeals, confirming their obligation to pay tax surcharges. The proceedings were thus conducted in parallel for just a little more than a year. Moreover, the applicants were indicted on 18\u00a0December 2008, 15 and 16 months after the mentioned tax decision had been taken and nine and ten months after they had acquired legal force. The criminal proceedings then continued on their own for several years: the District Court convicted the applicants on 9\u00a0November 2011, more than four years after the decisions of the State Internal Revenue Board, and the Supreme Court\u00b4s judgment was not pronounced until more than a year later, on 7 February 2013. This, again, stands in contrast to the case of A and B v. Norway (cited above), where the total length of the proceedings against the two applicants amounted to approximately five years and the criminal proceedings continued for less than two years after the tax decisions had acquired legal force, and where the integration between the two proceedings was evident through the fact that the indictments against the applicants were issued before the tax authorities\u2019 decisions to amend their tax assessments were taken and the District Court convicted them only months after those tax decisions. Furthermore, in the present case the Government have failed to explain and justify the delay which occurred in the domestic proceedings and which, as the Supreme Court held, had not been the applicants\u2019 fault (see A. and B., cited above, \u00a7\u00a0134).",
