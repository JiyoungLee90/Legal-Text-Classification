What is clear is that in the very early morning hours of March 27, government authorities arrived at the Republican Prison Hospital to transfer to Tbilisi Prison no.\u00a07\u00a0six alleged crime bosses who, according to the government, were attempting to instigate riots in the prison system. People interviewed by Human Rights Watch and others state that these six individuals were beaten during this operation; the government denies that they were ill-treated. As the authorities removed these men from the prison hospital, other detainees began to make noise and burn sheets and other items. This disturbance quickly spread to the nearby Tbilisi Prison no. 1 and Prison no. 5, where many detainees made noise, set fire to linens, escaped from their cells, and barricaded the doors of the prison. Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Interior troops conducted a special operation to end the disturbance in Prison no. 5, resulting in at least seven deaths and numerous injuries.\u201d",

The back injury extended to the pleura and the spine, and entered the skull via the neck. The skull was fractured. A piece of yellow metal was removed from the skull and \u201csent to the investigating authorities\u201d. There were numerous red lesions on the lower back, the nose, the forehead, around the left eye and on the left hand, and the right nostril was torn. The internal organs were examined. It was established that various types of alcohol were present in the blood. The expert concluded that death had occurred between six and eight hours before the autopsy, and had been caused by numerous firearm injuries. The bullets had damaged the internal organs and the spine and had caused broken bones. With regard to the many red lesions observed on the body, the expert concluded that they had been sustained when A.B. had still been alive and had been caused by a blunt object or blunt objects.",

K.M. himself went to Prison no. 5 to reinforce the outside security arrangements and prepare for a possible attempted breakout. Shortly afterwards the disturbance spread to Prison no. 5. Amongst the shouting and noise, the prisoners were throwing burning mattresses, sheets and clothes out of the windows. Prison officers and police officers arrived. A while later the directors of the Prisons Department also arrived. K.M. went up onto watchtower no. 1, from where one could see into Prison no. 5, and observed that the inmates were moving freely about the building and even trying to get out. The roof of Prison no. 1 caught fire. The police drove a car equipped with a loudspeaker into the yard of Prison no. 5 to address the inmates. Each appeal for calm was greeted by louder noise from the inmates. The Prisons Department then urgently summoned all off-duty officers. Security was reinforced on every watchtower around the prison. At the same time firefighters and the anti-riot squad of the Ministry of Justice arrived. The anti-riot forces were deployed at a distance of 30-40 metres from the building, as burning objects and metal objects were falling from the windows.

They therefore used a back door. When they got to the first floor the officers of the anti-riot squad were already there. It was relatively calm on the first and second floors, but loud noise could be heard coming from the third floor (dormitory no. 4), to which they had no access as the door had been barricaded from the inside. They therefore went up to the fourth floor before going back down to the third floor and using another door to get to dormitory no. 4. The prison governor, who was first in line, was followed by K.M., M.S. and several other prison officers, who were themselves followed by anti-riot officers. Unlike the anti-riot officers, the prison officers were not armed and were not carrying truncheons or wearing hoods. K.M. and the governor were wearing black uniforms, and M.S. was in civilian clothes. The group entered the corridor, with the governor appealing to the inmates for calm and explaining that the old prison building might collapse and kill thousands of people. When the group turned right in the corridor, they were confronted with barricades. The prison officers attempted to dismantle them, but the inmates started throwing pieces of brick and iron in their direction. The anti-riot officers then fired rubber bullets. In response, five or six shots rang out very close by. M.S. fell down. Other shots rang out and K.M. felt his arm go warm. He did not realise that he had been injured until he was out in the prison yard. When M.S. and K.M. were injured, the anti-riot squad passed in front of them, shouting that some of their men had been injured, and opened fire with their automatic weapons.",

According to him, at approximately 2.15 a.m. on 27 March 2006 inmates at his prison started a disturbance, following the unrest in the prison hospital. Considering that the disturbance could spread throughout the prison, he telephoned B.A, the head of the Prisons Department, to tell him that he did not have the means to bring the situation under control alone and was therefore declaring a state of emergency in the prison and requesting assistance. While waiting for help, G.P. decided to allow the guards of all the dormitories to leave their post, close the doors of their dormitories and the entrances to the building, and distribute weapons to their officers. The security around the prison was reinforced to bar any escape attempt. In the meantime, the inmates had succeeded in getting out of their cells and were freely circulating in the corridors of the dormitories. Burning objects and pieces of brick and iron were falling from the windows. The anti-riot squad, B.A., firefighters and the police arrived. At about 2.45 a.m. the decision was taken to take the prison by storm. G.P. then suggested to his deputies and other colleagues that they should get ahead of the anti-riot squad in order to avoid the members of the squad having direct contact with the inmates. He hoped that once they saw familiar faces, the inmates would become more compliant. The prison officers opened the main door and entered the building, accompanied by the anti-riot officers. The lower floors of the prison were empty. The entrance to the third floor (dormitory no. 4) was barricaded. The prison officers started to take down the barricades. While doing so, G.P. appealed to the inmates on the other side of the barricades for calm. In reply, the inmates swore at them, throwing pieces of brick and iron, whereupon the anti-riot officers fired rubber bullets at them. In response, four or five shots rang out on the inmates\u2019 side and M.S. fell down. K.M. was also injured. G.P. and a member of the anti-riot squad took M.S. out of the corridor. At that moment the anti-riot squad, who were positioned in the stairway, moved into the corridor and opened fire using their automatic weapons. According to G.P., the officers aimed at the ceiling and the walls. The inmates scattered and returned to their cells.",

In about five minutes the guard from dormitory no. 2 had come to open the door to let Z.D. out. They had closed the door behind him from the outside. Z.D. explained that all the cell doors were made of wood reinforced with metal sheets. The door frames were also made of wood. These old doors could only be locked with padlocks, and it was not difficult to break them down. Z.D. stated that in dormitory no. 4 two inmates from cell no. 76, A.B. (the second applicant\u2019s son) and G.Dj., and an inmate from cell no. 78, K.Q., had been the first to start rioting following the rioting that had started in the prison hospital.

The Minister of Justice went to Prison no. 5 to examine the situation and hear B.A.\u2019s explanation. According to B.A., when appeals for calm issued by the Ombudsman, the President of the Human Rights Parliamentary Committee, police officers and prison officers were unsuccessful, and when the fire that had been started in \u201cPrison no.\u00a05\u00a0took hold\u201d, the lives of 4,000 prison inmates were in danger, and the risk of a massive prison breakout became real. A decision was then taken to intervene.",

In his view, the likelihood of a massive breakout and the death of inmates in the fire increased. The crisis unit then decided to order the anti-riot squad to \u201ctake all necessary measures in accordance with the law to reinstate order, and if necessary use firearms within the statutory limits in force\u201d. Following the measures taken, and \u201cwith the use of firearms\u201d, according to B.A., \u201cthe mass disorder and insurrection by the prisoners were quelled\u201d by about 4\u00a0a.m. The damage suffered by the Prisons Department amounted to 50,737 Georgian laris (GEL \u2013 approximately 16,500 euros (EUR)). In answer to the only question asked by the investigator, B.A. replied that in similar situations the crisis unit acted in accordance with the rules on detention and weapons, order no. 60, the joint action plan of January 2003, and the rules governing anti-riot forces (see paragraphs 96-107 below).",

In contrast, the Ministry of Justice states in its May 2006 report to CAT, \u2018After bilateral fire seven prisoners died and 22 inmates received injuries of different gravity.\u2019 Representatives of the Office of the Ombudsman, including one physician, visited detainees in Rustavi Prison No. 6 who had been transferred from Tbilisi Prison No. 5 following the March 27 operation. Initially, the staff of Rustavi Prison No. 6 told the ombudsman\u2019s representatives that eight of the prisoners transferred had been wounded during the March 27 operation. However, the representatives found 15 patients with wounds, including gunshot wounds, sustained during the March 27 operation. They stated: \u2018For lack of time we could not survey all the cells, so we can assume that the number of [wounded] prisoners is even higher.\u2019",

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others v.

Since the competent authorities were opposed to the applicants\u2019 attempts to get involved in the relevant investigations, the applicants could justifiably have regarded making any further requests to the same authorities as a futile exercise, recourse to which could have posed an obstacle to bringing the matter before the Court (see Giorgi Nikolaishvili, cited above, \u00a7 114, and compare with Guzzardi v.\u00a0Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7\u00a080, Series A no. 39).",

The decision of 21 June 2006 to separate the criminal case concerning the alleged abuse of power by the law-enforcement officers (see paragraph 64 above) from the original investigation had similarly been a result of increased public pressure and the need to elucidate the circumstances surrounding the anti-riot squad\u2019s use of force.

As no potential suspects had been identified at that time amongst the implicated State agents, there had been no need to grant victim status to either of the applicants. In that respect, the Government argued that the procedural obligations contained in Article 2 of the Convention could not be construed in such a manner as to require the domestic investigating authorities to grant victim status by default to those who claimed to be directly or indirectly affected by the commission of a purported criminal offence.

As regards the length of the investigation, the Government justified this by referring to the particular complexity of the case: three custodial institutions (the prison hospital, Prison no. 5 and Prison no. 1) had been implicated in the riot, and several hundred witnesses (prisoners, prison guards and members of the anti-riot squad) had needed to be interviewed.

When considering the requirements flowing from the obligation, it must be remembered that the essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no. 32457/04, \u00a7 65, 27\u00a0November 2007, with further references). In order to comply with the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention, the investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the establishment of the relevant facts and to the identification and, if appropriate, punishment of those responsible. This is an obligation which concerns the means to be employed and not the results to be achieved. The authorities must take reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning an incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death. The requirements of promptness and reasonable expedition are implicit in this context (see \u0160ilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7 195, 9 April 2009; Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 324, ECHR 2007-II; and Anguelova v.

Moreover, an investigation must be accessible to the victim\u2019s family to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests. There must also be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation, the degree of which may vary from case to case (see, for example, Hugh Jordan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7 109, 4 May 2001). Furthermore, the investigation\u2019s conclusions must be based on thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements. Failing to follow an obvious line of inquiry undermines to a decisive extent the investigation\u2019s ability to establish the circumstances of the case and, where appropriate, the identity of those responsible (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a024014/05, \u00a7 175, 14 April 2015). The investigation must also be broad enough to permit the investigating authorities to take into consideration not only the actions of the State agents who directly and unlawfully used lethal force, but also all the surrounding circumstances (see Mocanu and Others v.\u00a0Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09 and 2 others, \u00a7 321, ECHR 2014 (extracts)), in particular the legal or statutory framework in force and the preparation and supervision of current operations, should those elements prove necessary in order to determine whether the State has honoured its obligation to protect life under Article 2\u00a0(see Aydan v. Turkey, no. 16281/10, \u00a7\u00a0107, 12 March 2013). The authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7 183, ECHR 2012).",

While there is no absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the domestic courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow life-threatening offences to go unpunished. The Court\u2019s task therefore consists in reviewing whether and to what extent the courts, in reaching their conclusion, may be deemed to have submitted the case to the careful scrutiny required by Article 2 of the Convention, so that the deterrent effect of the judicial system in place and the significance of the role it is required to play in preventing violations of the right to life are not undermined (see, for instance, Armani Da Silva v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 5878/08, \u00a7 239, 30 March 2016; Giuliani and Gaggio v.

Furthermore, while identification and punishment of those responsible for the death in question and the availability of compensatory remedies to the applicant are important criteria in the assessment of whether or not the State has discharged its Article 2 obligation (see, among other authorities, Fedina v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 17185/02, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67, 2 September 2010), in a significant number of cases already brought before the Court, the finding of a violation was largely based on the existence of unreasonable delays and a lack of diligence on the authorities\u2019 part as regards conducting the proceedings, regardless of the final outcome of those proceedings (see, for example, Merkulova v. Ukraine, no. 21454/04, \u00a7 51, 3 March 2011, with further references). Whilst compliance with the procedural requirement of Article\u00a02 is assessed on the basis of several essential parameters, including those mentioned above, these elements are inter-related and each of them, taken separately, does not amount to an end in itself. They are criteria which, when taken jointly, enable the degree of effectiveness of the investigation to be assessed. It is in relation to this purpose of an effective investigation that any issues, including those of promptness and reasonable expediency, must be assessed (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0225).",

According to the information submitted by the Government, the investigation was launched as late as 21 June 2006, that is to say almost three months after the anti-riot operation had taken place. This was far too long a delay, given the nature and the scale of the incident, and created a substantial risk that important information could never be recovered. According to the Government\u2019s explanations, and as reflected in the report prepared by Human Rights Watch (see paragraph 110 above), the competent authorities initially refused to open a separate investigation into the allegations that disproportionate force had been used against the population of Prison no. 5, on the grounds that relevant investigative measures had already been implemented within the framework of the criminal case opened against the six riot organisers. However, the Court observes that all the initial investigative actions in the immediate aftermath of the anti-riot operation of 27 March 2006 were undertaken by the same unit of the Ministry of Justice \u2013 the Prisons Department, which had given the order to storm the prison and had been the authority in direct command of the anti-riot squad. In such circumstances, the investigative steps taken by the Ministry of Justice had to be assessed with reference to the requirements of independence and impartiality, and procedural deficiencies in that regard risked tainting all of the subsequent developments in the investigation (see, for instance, Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0245-249, and Kolevi v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 1108/02, \u00a7\u00a7 208 and 212, 5\u00a0November 2009).",

Turkey, no. 22492/93, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-82, ECHR 2000III). Furthermore, the Court notes that there were clear signs that the State authorities were predisposed to discount any wrongdoing on the part of the law-enforcement agents. Thus, leaving aside the statements made by the President of Georgia in the immediate aftermath of the incident (see paragraph 110 above), the Court notes that a senior official from the GPPO, the authority that subsequently (on 21 June 2006) took charge of the investigation into the proportionality of the anti-riot forces\u2019 use of force, expressed as early as 23 May 2006 that \u201cthe assumption from the beginning\u201d had been that the use of force against the prisoners behind the barricades \u201cwas justified (see paragraphs 110 and 124 above). It was on the basis of that assumption that D.Z., the prosecutor from GPPO who was supposed to supervise the investigation carried out by the Ministry of Justice into the events surrounding the antiriot operation of 27 March 2006, was, in actual, clearly predisposed, as confirmed by his letters of 29\u00a0July and 17 August 2006 and 15 May 2007, to find a justification for the use of lethal force against the inmates of Prison no. 5 from very first stages of the investigative process (see paragraphs 1517 and 30 above). In the circumstances and, based on the available evidence, the Court does not consider that the investigation would have been independent, impartial and effective (see Tan\u0131\u015f and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a065899/01, \u00a7\u00a7 209-10 and\u00a0215, ECHR 2005\u2013VIII for the impact of preconceived ideas on the part of the investigating authorities in the context of a criminal investigation launched into a disappearance case, and also, mutatis mutandis, Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7 323).",

They emphasised that the informal authority of such criminal bosses extended well beyond the criminal underworld, and also contaminated numerous facets of ordinary public life. This undue influence resulted in, among other things, the total control of prisons by \u201cthieves in law\u201d. Through threats, coercion, and co-opting, criminal bosses exerted tremendous influence over other prisoners and the prison authorities. The Government submitted that for many years there had been no real fight against the rule of \u201cthieves in law\u201d and their criminal syndicates, due to the absence of genuine political will. Only from November 2003 onwards had the State started to take legislative and other measures aimed at challenging the power of the criminal bosses (for more details about the phenomenon of the \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d and the specific measures that the respondent State has introduced since 2003, see Ashlarba v.\u00a0Georgia, \u00a7\u00a7 21-24 and 28-31). The riot that had started on 27 March 2006 in the prison hospital and extended to Prison no. 5 and other prisons in the country was a perfect example of how mob bosses attempted to challenge State power in the prison sector.

They argued that it was on the basis of those particular legal texts that the anti-riot squad was entitled to deal with critical situations such as the prison riot of 27 March 2006. The Government further claimed that members of the anti-riot squad were trained to use firearms only in self-defence and in situations of absolute necessity, within the meaning of Article 28 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. The Government pointed out that there had been no preconceived plan to execute detainees, and that the anti-riot squad had received no order or encouragement from superiors to shoot prisoners without justification. On the contrary, there had been a clear and pre-approved plan of action, whose implementation by the anti-riot officers had been managed by a chain of command, so that the scope for arbitrary action would be minimal and the officers\u2019 conduct could be adapted to the evolution of the situation on the ground. The Government concluded by stating that the lethal force used had not been disproportionate to what was honestly considered to have been absolutely necessary to quell the detainees\u2019 riot, prevent the mass escape of some 4,000 prisoners, and protect the lives and health of prison officers and members of the anti-riot forces (in this connection, they made reference to Huohvanainen v.\u00a0Finland, no. 57389/00, \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 98, 13 March 2007).",

Russia, nos.\u00a018299/03 and 27311/03, \u00a7 210, ECHR 2011 (extracts), and G\u00fcl v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 22676/93, \u00a7\u00a7 77 and 78, 14 December 2000). Unregulated and arbitrary action by State agents is incompatible with effective respect for human rights. This means that, as well as being authorised under national law, policing operations must be sufficiently regulated by it, within the framework of a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force, and even against avoidable accident (see, among other authorities, Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 96 and 97). Members of the security forces should not be left in a vacuum when performing their duties, whether in the context of a prepared operation or a spontaneous chase of a person perceived to be dangerous: a legal and administrative framework should define the limited circumstances in which law-enforcement officials may use force and firearms, in the light of the international standards which have been developed in this respect (see Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no.\u00a050385/99, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59, ECHR 2004\u2011XI, and An\u0131k and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 63758/00, \u00a7 54 in fine, 5 June 2007). In particular, lawenforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the pre-eminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97; see also, in McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27\u00a0September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 211 to 214, Series A no. 324, the Court\u2019s criticism of \u201cshoot-to-kill\u201d military training).",

When considering a case of that kind, the Court must, in making its assessment, subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, and take into consideration not only the actions of the agents of the State who actually administered the force, but also all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the relevant legal or regulatory framework in place and the planning and control of the actions under examination (see Musayev and Others v.

A duty to take specific measures arises only if the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to life, and if the authorities retained a certain degree of control over the situation. Since a respondent State is only required to take such measures which are \u201cfeasible\u201d in the circumstances, the positive obligation in question must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities, bearing in mind the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct, and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources (see Finogenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 209, with the references therein). In that context, it should also be remembered that the use of force by State agents in pursuit of one of the aims set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 may be justified under that provision where it is based on an honest and genuine belief that the use of force was necessary. In addressing this question, the Court will have to consider whether the belief was subjectively reasonable, having full regard to the circumstances that pertained at the relevant time. If the belief was not subjectively reasonable, it is likely that the Court would have difficulty accepting that it was honestly and genuinely held (see Armani Da Silva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0248; Chebab v. France, no. 542/13, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 83, 23 May 2019; and also McCann and Others, cited above, \u00a7 200).",

As a result, and in line with the principle of subsidiarity, the Court prefers to rely, where possible, on the findings of competent domestic authorities, such as courts or a parliamentary body established for fact-finding purposes (see, for instance, Peri\u015fan and Others v.

Nor has there been any parliamentary probe into the matter, and in that regard the Court regrets that the Parliament did not deem it necessary to set up a special body of inquiry, after such a massive incident had shaken the country and attracted significant international attention (see the briefing prepared by Amnesty International, cited in paragraph 112 above). In such circumstances, when the Court is prevented from having knowledge of the exact circumstances surrounding the anti-riot operation of 27 March 2006 for the reasons objectively attributable to the State authorities, it is for the respondent Government to explain, in a satisfactory and convincing manner, the sequence of events and to exhibit solid evidence that can refute the applicants\u2019 allegations, and if the Government fail to do so, the Court may then draw strong inferences (see Mansuro\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 43443/98, \u00a7\u00a080, 26\u00a0February 2008, with further references). Since it is ultimately for the Court to make its own findings and reach its own conclusions on the applicants\u2019 allegations (see, for instance, El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 167), it will draw on all the material available, including the factual findings of the relevant domestic and international human rights observers and the results of the investigation launched against the six riot organisers. The following principles, developed in relation to its task of establishing the facts of events on which the parties disagree, will further guide the Court: the factual findings reached should be based on the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d; such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact; and the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained may be taken into account. In this connection, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, for instance, Tagayeva and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a026562/07 and 6 others, \u00a7 586, 13 April 2017).",

The Court observes that various international and domestic human rights watchdogs also reported that the anti-riot operation of 27\u00a0March 2006 had been, amongst other things, an intentional demonstration of force directed against a prison population. Without underestimating the scope of the social blight represented by the criminal institution of the \u201cthieves\u2019 underworld\u201d in Georgia and the difficulties encountered by the respondent State in its attempt to fight effectively against that deleterious social phenomenon (see Tsintsabadze v.\u00a0Georgia, no.\u00a035403/06, \u00a7\u00a7 61, 66-69 and 87-92 and Ashlarba, also cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a021-24 and 36), the Court considers that the use of lethal force for purely punitive, retaliatory purposes, even if those purposes target alleged members of the criminal underworld, cannot be justified under any of the grounds contained in Article 2 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to undermining the spirit of Article 2 of the Convention, which is all about putting stringent constraints on the State\u2019s power to resort to lethal force (compare, for instance, with Finogenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0207).",

Having regard to the factual findings, it accepts that the law-enforcement officers, confronted with gunshots fired from the prisoners\u2019 side, and with two officers wounded, could indeed have subjective good reasons to believe that the use of force was necessary. In this connection, it should be noted that the Court, detached from the events in issue, cannot substitute its own assessment of the situation for that of a law-enforcement officer who was required to react in the heat of the moment to avert an honestly perceived danger to his life or the lives of others (compare with Huohvanainen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a097). Furthermore, the Court is well aware of the potential for violence in prison and the risk of violent acts quickly breaking down into active resistance against law enforcement or even insurrection (see Leyla Alp and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a029675/02, \u00a7 84, 10 December 2013, and \u0130smail Altun v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022932/02, \u00a7 73, 21 September 2010). Based on the evidence available, the conduct of the inmates who barricaded themselves into Prison no.\u00a05\u00a0showed certain signs of being an attempted uprising (compare with, mutatis mutandis, Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 173-174). In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the respondent State, confronted with the unlawful violence and the risk of an insurrection, could resort to measures involving potentially lethal force, and that this could be reconcilable with the aims set out in Article 2\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 (a) and (c) of the Convention.

However, in the instant case, the Court considers that it must stick to the above-mentioned rigorous standard of very strict scrutiny, because, as the Government themselves have acknowledged, the authorities were aware of the criminal bosses\u2019 plans to instigate disobedience in prisons well before the incident of 27 March 2006. The Court is concerned that, despite the above-mentioned predictability of the hazard, the officers of the anti-riot squad did not receive specific instructions and orders from their superiors regarding the requisite form and intensity of any use of lethal force in order to keep the likelihood of casualties to a minimum (see \u0130smail Altun, cited above, \u00a7 75, and Ceyhan Demir and Others, cited above, \u00a7 98). Having recourse to automatic weapons within the close confines of the prison walls would necessarily have meant that the risk of causing fatalities was inordinately high, owing to such weapons being used in close proximity to the prison population. The Government have failed to produce any evidence to show that the anti-riot squad acted in a controlled and systematic manner, under a clear chain of command.

Moreover, as reported by Amnesty International (see paragraph 112 above) and Human Rights Watch (see paragraph 110 above), which findings were then left undisputed by the respondent Government, the gunshots in the inmates\u2019 direction came not just from the anti-riot squad inside the building, but also from shooters situated outside on the roofs of neighbouring buildings, with stray bullets entering prison cells through the windows. These facts show that the use of lethal force by the anti-riot squad was indiscriminate and excessive. Furthermore, although the Court is obviously not in a position to indicate to member States the best policy in relation to dealing with a crisis of this kind, or to lay down rigid rules in this sphere, the Court attaches significance to the fact that, as reported by Human Rights Watch, no serious attempts were made to conduct negotiations with the prisoners behind the barricades. Whilst the prisoners clearly showed that they were ready to enter into such negotiations (see the statements of the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights and Civil Integration, E.T., and of the ombudsman, S.S., as reported by Human Rights Watch, cited in paragraph 110 above), the law-enforcement authorities did not consider the possibility of solving the crisis by negotiations and resorted to lethal force (compare with Kavakl\u0131o\u011flu and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0202204; \u0130smail Altun, cited above, \u00a7 73 in fine; and also Andronicou and Constantinou v. Cyprus, 9 October 1997, \u00a7 184, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI). In this respect, the Court, whilst confirming that it is far beyond its competence to speculate on the issue of whether, as a matter of principle, it is always necessary to negotiate with extremists (see Finogenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 223), considers it appropriate to restate that a prison population is by its nature a vulnerable group, in need of the protection by the State (see, for instance, Av\u015far, cited above, \u00a7 391).",

Human Rights Watch documented in detail the manifestly insufficient nature of the medical assistance provided to the wounded (see paragraph 110 above). The Court reiterates in this connection that since the anti-riot operation was not launched in a spontaneous manner, the authorities should have made the relevant arrangements for the provision of medical assistance to the wounded well in advance of the storming of the prison. Since the hazard was predictable, the relevant authorities\u2019 obligation to come up with a proper medical evacuation plan was even greater (see Finogenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 243). The Court further notes with concern that not only did the relevant authorities fail to provide requisite medical assistance after the anti-riot operation had ended, but there were credible reports, documented both by the domestic and international observers, that numerous detainees were ill-treated by special forces agents and even shot in their cells, despite the fact that they were no longer putting up resistance (see paragraphs 108, 110 and 112 above). The respondent Government left those credible reports undisputed, and the Court finds it appropriate to draw inferences by accepting that the ill-treatment and disproportionate use of force against the detainees persisted even after the termination of the anti-riot operation.",

However, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicants\u2019 family members, Z.K. and A.B., died as a result of lethal force which, although pursuing legitimate aims under Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a) and (c) of the Convention, could not be said to have been \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d within the meaning of that provision. That conclusion is based on the fact that the anti-riot operation of 27 March 2006 was not conducted in a controlled and systematic manner, without law-enforcement agents receiving clear orders and instructions aimed at minimising the risk of casualties. The authorities did not consider less violent means of dealing with the security incident, including the possibility of solving the crisis by negotiations. The use of lethal force during the anti-riot operation was indiscriminate and excessive and the relevant authorities failed to provide adequate medical assistance to those affected. They also failed to account for the individual circumstances of the deaths of Z.K. and A.B. Having regard to all those factors, the Court concludes that the anti-riot operation of 27\u00a0March 2006 resulted in a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive aspect.",

The claims were based on the contention that their deceased family members, Z.K. and A.B., had been the sole breadwinners in their families, and that the amounts claimed reflected what they could have earned in the event that they had lived beyond 27 March 2006. As neither of their deceased family members had been gainfully employed prior to the institution of the criminal proceedings and their imprisonment, apart from having odd jobs, the applicants based their claims on the official minimum subsistence income (GEL 1038 \u2013 approximately EUR 432) for 2008, multiplied by the number of years that each of the applicants would live before reaching the average life expectancy for women in Georgia (seventyeight and a half years).",

Secondly, from the few documents submitted by the applicants, it cannot be established with certainty that they were exclusively financially dependent upon their deceased family members (compare, for instance, Gakiyev and Gakiyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 3179/05, \u00a7\u00a7 171-73, 23 April 2009; Albekov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 68216/01, \u00a7\u00a7 125-127, 9 October 2008; and \u0130kincisoy v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 26144/95, \u00a7 137, 27 July 2004).",

The opposite is the case with respect to the fees of a representative who, without waiving them, has simply taken no steps to pursue their payment or has deferred it. The fees payable to a representative under a conditional-fee agreement are actually incurred only if that agreement is enforceable in the respective jurisdiction (see Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], no. 72508/13, \u00a7\u00a0371, 28 November 2017). Furthermore, the Court is not bound by domestic scales and practices for legal fees, and is therefore free to not endorse domestic lawyers\u2019 hourly rates which appear to be excessive (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 206, ECHR 2004-II).",
