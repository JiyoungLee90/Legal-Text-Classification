The High Court agreed that in so far as the family had acted directly against the foster parents and children, this was blameworthy and an undesirable situation.

She submitted that prior to the present case and after the entry into force of the Child Welfare Act the Supreme Court had delivered two judgments (reported in Norsk Retstidende, 1997-534(540) and Norsk Retstidende, 2001-14(23)) in which it had refused adoption. In both judgments reference had been made to the fact that in the event of adoption the question of contact would be left to be decided by the adoptive parents and that this would not be entirely unproblematic. In the former judgment the Supreme Court had invited the legislator to consider whether to empower the courts to authorise adoption and at the same time to grant contact rights to the biological parents. Subsequently, from a White Paper (St.meld. 40 (2001-2001)) it appeared that the Ministry of Children and Family Affairs had been of the view that there was insufficient basis for amending the legislation and that authorisation for adoption should not be given where it was desirable for the child to maintain contact with his or her biological parents.",

At the age of six months A had been taken into public care, as an emergency measure in August 1998, then as a permanent measure in December 1998, on the ground of suspicion that he had been subjected several times to severe ill-treatment causing brain haemorrhage and of his parents' drug abuse problem. That suspicion had given rise to a police investigation that was later discontinued in view of the state of the evidence. Whereas the extent of the applicant's drug abuse before A's birth had been uncertain, she had used heroin after A had been taken into care in August 1998, had spent periods in detoxification centres since 2000 and had started methadone treatment in the autumn of 2005. The compulsory care order was upheld by Trondheim City Court on 22 September 1999, which limited the applicant's contact with A to four visits of four hours in a year. For formal reasons, the Court has no jurisdiction under the Convention to examine the justification of these measures, which became final after the applicant had withdrawn her appeal to Frostating High Court.

Because of this he had a significant need for security, notably to be certain about his belonging to his foster parents, which was likely to increase as he grew up. His need for absolute emotional security would become crucial as he became aware of the fact that both his mother and father had been heavy drug abusers, that they were undergoing methadone treatment, that he had been exposed to serious ill-treatment and that the parents had been suspected of this, as well as the fact that the father had spent more than six years in prison.

Agreeing with this finding, Mrs Justice Coward considered that the fact that contact rights as such would disappear as a result of adoption could not carry great weight in the assessment of A's best interest.",

In the Court's view, the fact that the level of contact after the Supreme Court judgment corresponded to that which had existed before, clearly confirms the correctness of the national assessment as to A's foster parents' openness to continued contact. This is not undermined by the applicant's various submissions to the effect that the contact arrangements proposed did not always meet her expectations and demands.",
