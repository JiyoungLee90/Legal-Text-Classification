In this respect, the wearing or displaying of symbols has also been held to fall within the spectrum of forms of \u201cexpression\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention. The Court held that the display of a symbol associated with a political movement or entity, like that of a flag, was capable of expressing identification with ideas or representing them and fell within the ambit of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention (see F\u00e1ber v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 40721/08, \u00a7 36, 24 July 2012).",

In that respect, it observes that the applicant\u2019s criminal conviction for the offence of praising and condoning acts punishable by law under Article 312 \u00a7 1 of the former Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of expression, as noted above, and that he was sanctioned for engaging in such activities, despite his denial of any knowledge of the materials. The Court considers that in such circumstances, the applicant\u2019s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. It should be borne in mind in this respect that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Y\u0131lmaz and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v.

Moreover, not accepting that a criminal conviction constituted an interference, on the ground that an applicant denied any involvement in the acts at issue, would lock him in a vicious circle that would deprive him of the protection of the Convention.",
