However, their decisions in this field must, in so far as they may interfere with a right protected under paragraph 1 of Article 8, be in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society, that is to say, justified by a pressing social need and, in particular, proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Dalia v.

While a number of Contracting States have enacted legislation or adopted policy rules to the effect that long-term immigrants who were born in those States or who arrived there during early childhood cannot be expelled on the basis of their criminal record (see paragraph 39 above), such an absolute right not to be expelled cannot, however, be derived from Article 8 of the Convention, couched, as paragraph 2 of that provision is, in terms which clearly allow for exceptions to be made to the general rights guaranteed in the first paragraph.",

The Court considers nevertheless that, even if a non-national holds a very strong residence status and has attained a high degree of integration, his or her position cannot be equated with that of a national when it comes to the above-mentioned power of the Contracting States to expel aliens (see Moustaquim v. Belgium, 18 February 1991, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 193) for one or more of the reasons set out in paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Convention. It is, moreover, of the view that a decision to revoke a residence permit and/or to impose an exclusion order on a settled migrant following a criminal conviction in respect of which that migrant has been sentenced to a criminal-law penalty does not constitute a double punishment, either for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 or more generally. Contracting States are entitled to take measures in relation to persons who have been convicted of criminal offences in order to protect society \u2013 provided, of course, that, to the extent that those measures interfere with the rights guaranteed by Article 8, paragraph 1, of the Convention, they are necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the aim pursued. Such administrative measures are to be seen as preventive rather than punitive in nature (see Maaouia v. France [GC], no. 39652/98, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2000-X).",

Indeed, the rationale behind making the duration of a person\u2019s stay in the host country one of the elements to be taken into account lies in the assumption that the longer a person has been residing in a particular country, the stronger his or her ties with that country and the weaker the ties with the country of his or her nationality will be.

It is to be noted, however, that the first three guiding principles do not, as such, relate to family life. This leads the Court to consider whether the \u201cBoultif criteria\u201d are sufficiently comprehensive to render them suitable for application in all cases concerning the expulsion and/or exclusion of settled migrants following a criminal conviction. It observes in this context that not all such migrants, no matter how long they have been residing in the country from which they are to be expelled, necessarily enjoy \u201cfamily life\u201d there within the meaning of Article 8. However, as Article 8 also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2002III) and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s social identity (see Mikuli\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-I), it must be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants and the community in which they are living constitute part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8. Regardless of the existence or otherwise of a \u201cfamily life\u201d, therefore, the Court considers that the expulsion of a settled migrant constitutes interference with his or her right to respect for private life. It will depend on the circumstances of the particular case whether it is appropriate for the Court to focus on the \u201cfamily life\u201d rather than the \u201cprivate life\u201d aspect.",

Quite apart from a problem of method (how do we assign relative weight to the various factors on the basis of some ten guiding principles \u2013 are we not seeing here the implicit emergence of a method which gives priority to one criterion, relating to the offence, and treats the others as secondary or marginal?), we believe a question of principle to be at stake, on which we should like to conclude.",

We do not agree with the assertion in paragraph 56 that the applicant\u2019s expulsion was to be seen as preventive rather than punitive in nature. Whether the decision is taken by means of an administrative measure, as in this case, or by a criminal court, it is our view that a measure of this kind, which can shatter a life or lives \u2013 even where, as in this case, it is valid, at least in theory, for only ten years (quite a long time, incidentally) \u2013 constitutes as severe a penalty as a term of imprisonment, if not more severe. This is true even where the prison sentence is longer but is not accompanied by an exclusion order or expulsion. That is why some States do not have penalties of this kind specific to foreign nationals, while others have largely abolished them in recent times (the case of France springs to mind: see the Laws of 26\u00a0November 2003 and 24 July 2006).",

We truly regret this. True, the Convention is a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions. But we would have liked to see this dynamic approach to caselaw tending towards increased protection for foreign nationals (even criminals) rather than towards increased penalties which target them specifically.",
