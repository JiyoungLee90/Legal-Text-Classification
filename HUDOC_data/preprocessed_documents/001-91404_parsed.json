Ukraine (dec.), no. 41974/98, 4 May 1999). The Court considers, however, that the applicant\u2019s administrative detention itself was closely linked to his apprehension as a criminal suspect and his detention in this quality, therefore the Court joins the Government\u2019s objection as to this period of the applicant\u2019s detention to the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The first period concerns the arrest and the administrative detention of the applicant between 20 and 25 April 2000. The second period, covered by the detention order issued by the prosecutor, lasted from 25 April until 25 June 2000, when his detention ordered by the prosecutor expired. The third period, which was not covered by any decisions, lasted from 25 June until 21 August 2000 and from 8 September to 3 October 2001. The fourth period, which was covered by the court decisions maintaining the applicant\u2019s detention at the trial stage, lasted from 21 August 2000 to 18 July 2001 and from 3 October 2001 to 10 May 2002. Finally, on two occasions the courts ordered the applicant\u2019s detention for a definite period of time, but in both cases the major part of such detention was ordered retroactively: from 18 July to 8 August 2001 and from 31\u00a0August to 5 September 2001.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion from the moment of his apprehension under this order on 20\u00a0April 2000 the applicant was deprived of his liberty with a purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on suspicion of having committed a crime of murder, therefore his initial deprivation of liberty fell within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention. The applicant\u2019s forceful resistance to the police and his administrative detention for this offence took place after he had been already apprehended. In these circumstances, the applicant\u2019s detention for an administrative offence could not, in the Court\u2019s view, dispense the authorities from complying with the procedural guarantees associated with the applicant\u2019s status as a criminal suspect.",

[GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7\u00a0116, ECHR 2008..., with further references). The facts of the case demonstrate that during his administrative detention the applicant was treated as a suspect in the criminal case and was interviewed by the investigator in respect of the case of murder. The Court notes that although the applicant\u2019s administrative detention had been ordered on different grounds in domestic terms, there had been no visible signs of a change of the applicant\u2019s status before, during and after his administrative detention. Therefore, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s administrative detention was in reality also a part of the longer uninterrupted period of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) as a criminal suspect in a murder case. The Court, therefore, dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as to the application of the six-month rule to this period of applicant\u2019s detention.",

It was only after five days of his administrative detention expired, that the authorities decided the issue of holding the applicant in custody as a criminal suspect under the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the Court\u2019s view, the above conduct of the investigating authorities is incompatible with the principle of legal certainty and arbitrary, and runs counter to the principle of the rule of law. The Court, therefore, concludes that there was a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention during this period.",

However, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires that after a certain lapse of time the persistence of reasonable suspicion does not in itself justify deprivation of liberty and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention (see Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v.
