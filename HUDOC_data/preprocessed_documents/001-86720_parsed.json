He argued that the measure ought to be replaced by another, more lenient means of securing his presence in court. In the applicant\u2019s view, it was unlikely that the proceedings would be completed by 30\u00a0November 1999. In this connection, he submitted that the fact that Z.R.R. had been required to undergo psychiatric observation was not the only obstacle to the progress of the trial as most of the delays had been caused by the repeated absence of witnesses. The applicant asked the Supreme Court to consider the case in the light of all the available material and to reject the \u2019s application.",

According to the authorities, the likelihood of a severe sentence being imposed on the applicant and the fact that he had previous criminal convictions created a presumption that he would obstruct the proceedings. However, the Court notes that it does not transpire from the material submitted that the applicant made any attempts to intimidate witnesses during the proceedings or showed any obstructive behaviour. Moreover, the Court would reiterate that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of detention on remand (see, for instance, Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26 July 2001).",

Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a047, 4\u00a0May 2006; Depa v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a062324/00, \u00a7\u00a049, 12 December 2006). To reiterate, the Court notes that while Article 5 \u00a7 4 guarantees no right, as such, to an appeal against decisions ordering or extending detention \u2013 as it speaks of \u201cproceedings\u201d and not of appeals \u2013 a domestic procedure relating to those matters must, in order to be compatible with that provision, satisfy two indispensable conditions. First, the judicial procedure followed must be adversarial and must always ensure \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the parties, the prosecutor and the detained person. Second, it must give to the individual concerned guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (G.K.\u00a0v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 91).",

The lawyer, although duly convened, was however absent from one session (see paragraph 19 above). However, the applicant has not furnished any explanation for the lawyer\u2019s absence. The applicant also contends that it was impossible for him to appeal against the rulings of the Supreme Court extending the period of his detention. However, the Court reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention does not guarantee as such a right to appeal against decisions ordering or extending detention \u2013 as it speaks of \u201cproceedings\u201d and not of appeals (see G.K. v.

It fell to the Supreme Court, in the presence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer and in the context of adversarial proceedings (see above), to rule on whether to lift or to extend the measure in question on the basis of the Regional Court\u2019s application. Accordingly, to the extent that the applicant is critical of the fact that at its session held on 5\u00a0March 1999 the Regional Court applied to the Supreme Court for an extension of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention in the absence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer, the Court would once again stress that the power to do so ultimately lay with the Supreme Court. It would further add that, in any event, the fact that the lawyer could not make submissions at that session was a result of an error on the part of the  rather than an indication that the authorities had departed from the general rule allowing detainees to attend or to be represented in those proceedings. Finally, despite the lack of any specific remedy to contest the application made to the Supreme Court by the trial court, it was open to the applicant at all stages to challenge the legality of holding him in custody by making an application for release. Recourse to that remedy as regulated by the 1997 Code would have enabled him to have the lawfulness of his detention examined in a procedure satisfying the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
