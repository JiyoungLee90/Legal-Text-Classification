The case originated in two applications (nos. 3060/07 and 45533/09) against the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan and a Russian national, Mr Serghei Sobco and Mr Serghei Ghent (“the applicants”), on 15 December 2006 and 19 August 2009 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr P. Postică and Mr A. Postică, lawyers practising in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr L. Apostol, and the Russian Government were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants complained that they had been denied a fair trial by a court which had not qualified as a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Contention.
On 6 and 20 June 2014 notice of the complaints concerning fairness of civil proceedings was given to the Government and the remainder of application no. 45533/09 was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Russian Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were born in 1969 and 1955 and live in Slobozia and Tiraspol, respectively.
In 2005 they were both dismissed from employment. They initiated reinstatement proceedings against their employers before the courts of the self-proclaimed “Moldovan Republic of Transdniestria” (“MRT”).
The proceedings ended with the final judgments of the Supreme Court of the “MRT” of 15 June 2006 and 19 February 2009 by which the applicants’ actions were dismissed.
Reports by inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations, the relevant domestic law and practice of the Republic of Moldova, and other pertinent documents were summarised in Mozer v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia ([GC], no. 11138/10, §§ 61-77, 23 February 2016).
