Such ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. The assessment of this minimum level is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0162, Series A no. 25). Although the purpose of such treatment is a factor to be taken into account, in particular the question of whether it was intended to humiliate or debase the victim, the absence of any such intention does not inevitably lead to a finding that there has been no violation of Article 3 (see Peers v.

Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, McKay v. the  [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2006X, and Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 110).",

Serbia, no. 2361/05, \u00a7 73, 23 September 2008). To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the true facts mentioned by applicants in their appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7 152).",
