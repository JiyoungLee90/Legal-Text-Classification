At about 4 p.m. on 13 May 1999 four police officers from , including chief sergeant Y., arrived at the Pravets police station. There, they were informed that Mr Filipov was probably in his house, having arrived there in his car. They were also informed that a Mercedes minivan had been spotted in the house\u2019s yard. Five officers, using two cars, drove towards the house. There, one of the officers saw that a minivan parked in the yard matched one of those involved in one of the robberies. After discussing their further course of action, the officers split up. Two of them headed back to the Pravets police station to report on their findings, and three, including chief sergeant Y., positioned themselves on the road leading to Mr Filipov\u2019s house, with the intention of checking the identities of the drivers of passing cars.

They got into their car and drove after him. After the first turn, they saw that his car had stopped on the left side of the road, with the engine still turned on. They approached, stopped their car in front of Mr\u00a0Filipov\u2019s, got out, presented themselves to Mr Filipov and asked him to show his identification documents. He quickly drove off. The officers got into their car and gave chase. Chief sergeant Y. was driving, the second officer was sitting beside him, and the third was in the back seat. Chief sergeant Y. turned on the police light and the siren, and the officer in the back seat repeatedly shouted into a megaphone \u201cPolice, pull over and stop!\u201d Mr Filipov did not heed that order. According to the findings of the Military Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 37 and 46 below), but not those of the  (see paragraphs 35 and 43 below), while driving he was brandishing a small doublebarrelled handgun and was pointing it at the officers. The third officer tried to contact the station but could not, because the police car was in a radio shadow area as the road passed through mountainous terrain. At one point chief sergeant Y. took out his firearm, loaded it, and fired a warning shot in the air. Mr Filipov kept on driving without slowing down. Then the officer who was in the back seat also took out his firearm and fired several shots at Mr Filipov\u2019s car, aiming towards the right side of the car to avoid hitting Mr Filipov. The shots caused the car to break down and start emitting black smoke. It slowed down, turned to the right, and stopped beside the road, slanting towards it. Mr Filipov jumped out of it and onto the road, with his back towards the officers. Chief sergeant Y. stopped the police car, opened the left front door, aimed at Mr\u00a0Filipov, shouted \u201cLie down, police!\u201d and fired at him from a distance of about ten metres. At the same time, the two other officers were getting out of the car. According to the findings of the Military Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 37 and 46 below), but not those of the Sofia Military Court (see paragraphs 35 and 43 below), at that point or moments before it Mr Filipov had twisted his upper body and had pointed his handgun at the officers. The bullet hit Mr Filipov in the lower back. He fell to the ground, and the other two officers ran to him and handcuffed him. Chief sergeant Y., after several attempts, was able to contact the police station over the radio, and asked for an ambulance to be called in. At least one of the officers remained at the scene. The ambulance arrived at about 8.30 p.m. and Mr Filipov was taken to the emergency ward of a hospital in Botevgrad, where the onduty doctor pronounced him dead. Five rounds of ammunition for the doublebarrelled handgun were found in his clothes.",

The entry wound was close to the vertebral column, and the channel of the wound, assuming an upright position of the victim, was from the back to the front, slightly leftward and upward. It was not possible to determine the distance from which the shot had been fired; that could be done by testing the clothes worn by Mr Filipov. When passing through the body, the bullet had, amongst other damage caused, ruptured the common iliac vein, which had caused massive internal bleeding and death. Death had not been immediate, but had been quick and inevitable. There were, in addition, some bruises on Mr Filipov\u2019s head, body and limbs. Those had been caused while he was still alive and had not been among the factors contributing to his death. Most of them could have been the result of his falling to the ground after the shot. Those on the left foot had been caused by separate blows with blunt objects, and the marks on his wrists had been caused by handcuffs.",

At the time of being shot he had had his back to them, and it was illogical for him to have attacked three officers who outnumbered and outgunned him. The assertion that he had tried to attack the officers was based exclusively on their statements, and its probative value was diminished by their obvious interest in proving that they had acted in selfdefence. The statements of the two officers who had accompanied chief sergeant Y. were contradictory and did not match the findings of the medical expert reports. They had not been confirmed by the reconstruction carried out during the investigation. The doublebarrelled handgun found at the scene had not borne Mr Filipov\u2019s fingerprints. The statement of one of the officers to the effect that Mr Filipov had thrown it into a ditch did not match the record of the inspection of the scene, which had noted that it had been found in a lawn, eighteen metres from the place where Mr Filipov had fallen to the ground. All of that made it highly doubtful whether Mr Filipov had indeed held and pointed a handgun at the three officers. As there had been no attack, there had been no selfdefence, and therefore no exceeding the limits of selfdefence.

It criticised the lower court for failing fully to take into account the officers\u2019 statements concerning the events preceding the fatal shot and for rejecting them as unreliable. It noted that all three of them had stated that Mr Filipov had been brandishing a handgun during the car chase and had been pointing it at the police car. One of them had even warned the other two that Mr Filipov was armed. When the two cars had stopped, Mr Filipov had still been holding the handgun, and had thrown it away when hit by chief sergeant Y.\u2019s bullet. During the ensuing inspection of the scene, the handgun had been found with rounds in both barrels. Five more rounds of ammunition for that gun had been found in Mr\u00a0Filipov\u2019s clothes at the hospital. The lower court had failed fully to analyse some of those points or give due weight to others. In particular, it had rejected outright the officers\u2019 statements as self-serving, and had relied on the lack of fingerprints on the handgun to disregard its relevance to the case. All of the foregoing made it necessary for the appellate court to make different findings of fact. It accepted that during the car chase Mr Filipov had been brandishing a handgun and had been pointing it at the officers. He had continued holding the weapon after jumping out of his car, had turned towards the officers and had started running. The officers had seen that he was armed and chief sergeant Y. had shot at him from a distance of about ten metres. Before falling to the ground, Mr Filipov had managed to throw away the handgun. Most of those facts could be established from the officers\u2019 statements, which could not be discarded as unreliable simply because the officers would be affected by the outcome of the case. In view of the lack of further eyewitnesses, other evidence was needed to cast doubt on those statements. The direction of the wound did not disprove them. It had to be borne in mind that Mr Filipov been trying to escape, had run, bent, twisted, turned back, and had brandished his handgun. It was therefore not inconceivable for him to have been facing his pursuers at one point, and then suddenly turning his back to them or bending over. The lower court\u2019s finding that there was a discrepancy between the statement of one of the officers and the record of the inspection of the scene had been unfounded. The ground at the scene had been broken and covered with grass. While the officer and the investigator who had later drawn up the inspection record might have described the terrain differently, the fact remained that a handgun had been found eighteen metres from the road. The record said that the handgun had been found \u201cbelow the right edge of the asphalt cover\u201d, which indicated that it had been below the level of the road. It was unlikely that it had been planted there before or after the shooting, especially bearing in mind that rounds of ammunition for it had later been found in Mr\u00a0Filipov\u2019s clothes. Therefore, the lack of his fingerprints on the gun did not refute the officers\u2019 statements. Fingers did not always leave prints on the objects that they touched. The ballistics and medical experts had arrived at matching conclusions about the distance from which Mr Filipov had been shot.",

Under the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s caselaw, such a defence was permissible whenever there was a real and proximate risk of attack, even before it had materialised. There were a number of elements that showed that such a risk had existed. Mr Filipov had been an individual suspected of serious offences. After seeing the police, he had tried to escape in his car. During the chase he had been brandishing a handgun and had been pointing it at the officers. After jumping out of his car, he had still been holding the weapon, swinging it, and pointing it at the officers. It had thus been obvious that he might at any point have shot at them. The situation had been dynamic and had unfolded rapidly, and it was conceivable that Mr Filipov might have turned away quickly at the moment when chief sergeant Y. had fired at him, and had thus been shot in the back. The sergeant had not been bound to wait for Mr Filipov to point the gun at him again before shooting. The mere fact that a person who had just displayed aggressive behaviour was holding a weapon had been a sufficient basis to suppose that he might shoot.",

It held that it had not been proved beyond doubt that chief sergeant Y. had not acted in selfdefence. It criticised the manner in which the lower court had analysed the evidence, finding fault chiefly with the manner in which it had assessed the truthfulness of the statements of the officers and the way that it had juxtaposed them with the forensic evidence. There was no reason to disbelieve the evidence given by the two officers who had been eyewitnesses to the shooting, because their statements had been coherent and full. Some of their statements had been given immediately after the incident, which further boosted their credibility. Their account had not been refuted, but on the contrary had been confirmed by the forensic evidence. The ballistics report showed that Mr Filipov\u2019s handgun had been able to produce a shot. Ammunition for that handgun had been found in Mr\u00a0Filipov\u2019s clothes, and this made it unlikely that it had been planted at the scene. The medical experts had concluded that Mr Filipov could have thrown the gun for eighteen metres. Based on their observations about the channel of the wound, they had also concluded that he could have sustained it in the manner described by the officers. During a dynamic chase, he could have turned and pointed his handgun at the officers while running away. The lack of fingerprints on the gun was not conclusive and could not categorically disprove the statements of the two officers. The reconstruction of the events had yielded similar information. Based on those considerations, the court found it necessary to make fresh findings of fact. Relying on the statements of the two officers who had accompanied chief sergeant Y., the conclusions of the various expert reports, the data obtained during the reconstruction, and other written material, it found it established that Mr Filipov had been brandishing a handgun during the chase and that he had pointed it at the officers after jumping out of his car. Seeing that threat, chief sergeant Y. had shot at him. In the court\u2019s view, that step had clearly been taken in selfdefence. In support of that conclusion, the court gave reasons that were similar to the ones it had given when first examining the case (see paragraph 38 above). It held:",

The doctrine and the caselaw concerning the directness of the attack and the suitability of selfdefence do not require that the attack be already harming the person who is defending himself; they allow selfdefence when there is a real and proximate risk that a person\u2019s interests will be harmed. ... It is very important to establish the moment when the attack becomes immediate, because it is at that point that the right to self-defence arises. In its caselaw the Supreme Court has many times said that to regard an attack solely as an offence and accept that it becomes immediate only when the actus reus of the offence has begun to be carried out would diminish the defence\u2019 effectiveness. For instance, if the attacker uses a firearm or a knife, under such a view the attacked would not be able to defend himself before the firearm has been pointed or the knife has been swung from a close distance. That view is wrong and would in many cases render the defence impossible. It must therefore be accepted that an attack is immediate not only when it has already started to cause harm, but also when there is a real and immediate danger that State or public interests, or the person or the legal rights of those concerned, will be harmed. The doctrine and the courts\u2019 caselaw say that to prevent significant injury to interests imperilled by such an attack it is always permissible to act vigorously against the attacker. This is so even if there are other ways of preventing or averting the attack. In the case at hand, the police officers could not be expected to avoid \u201ccomplications\u201d by letting the offender continue his unlawful actions unabated. It should also be borne in mind that throughout the incident the officers\u2019 actions were lawful and carried out in line with the provisions of the then applicable Ministry of Internal Affairs Act [1997], now repealed, and that there has been no abuse of their powers.",

After the officers presented themselves to him, that person tried to escape with his car. During the chase he pulled out a handgun and pointed it at them. He refused to obey the officers despite several lawful invitations to do so. After his car had stopped moving, [Mr Filipov] again refused to heed the officers\u2019 orders, and instead tried to flee by jumping out of the car and pointing his firearm at [chief sergeant Y.] and his colleagues, who were very close to him. There was a real and direct risk that [Mr Filipov] might shoot [chief sergeant Y.] and the other officers. The mere pulling out of the handgun and its pointing at the [chief sergeant] presented an immediate, proximate and undeniable threat of attack. In those circumstances, it was only natural that the [chief sergeant] should fire to protect himself and his colleagues.

The assessment of the lack of proportion between the attack and the defence is to be made on the basis of all the circumstances. In the instant case, there was no clearly expressed, unquestionable and patent disproportion between the attack and the defence, because the specific circumstances called for the lawful defence of protected interests. The importance and the character of the interests imperilled by the attack and those harmed by the defence were identical. The statements of the two eyewitnesses lead to the conclusion that at the time when he was shot [Mr Filipov] was posing through his conduct a real and evident risk of harming the lives or the health of [chief sergeant Y.] and his colleagues, which required them to counteract and neutralise him by shooting him. The Supreme Court has more than once had the occasion to point out the incorrectness of the view, expressed in some judgments, that the defence should not seek to touch vulnerable spots where a shot could harm the attacker\u2019s life or health. The law does not require that because it would diminish the efficacy of the selfdefence. As already noted, what matters is whether there is a manifest disproportion between the attack and the defence, not the spot in which the attacker has been harmed. ...\u201d",

They promptly interviewed all three police officers involved in the incident and various other witnesses, carried out further interviews, gathered other evidence, obtained a number of expert reports, and conducted both a reconstruction of the events and confrontations between the officers (see paragraphs 920 above).",

Those authorities manifestly and demonstratively, to borrow the words of the , failed to heed the courts\u2019 instructions following the referral of the case for additional investigation (see paragraphs 26 and 31 above). This is particularly worrying because it was capable of stripping the system of judicial review of discontinuances of pretrial investigations of its effectiveness. In a recent case concerning the investigation of illtreatment by private persons, the Court expressed serious concerns about such practices (see Biser Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 32662/06, \u00a7\u00a7 8283, 10 January 2012). Those concerns apply all the more to the investigation of police misconduct. The resulting delay almost caused the charges against chief sergeant Y. to be dropped under Article 239a of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1974 (see paragraphs 27, 29, 31 and 32 above), a development which would have in itself been capable of putting the proceedings at variance with the respondent State\u2019s procedural obligations under Article 2 (see, mutatis mutandis, Biser Kostov, cited above, \u00a7 85). In those circumstances, the time taken to complete the criminal proceedings against the police officer who shot and killed Mr Filipov cannot be regarded as compatible with the State\u2019s obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to ensure that investigations into deaths resulting from the use of force by State agents are carried out with reasonable expedition.",

They attempted to reconcile the conflicting versions and gave reasons for their decisions to, respectively, convict and acquit chief sergeant Y. (see paragraphs 35, 37, 38, 40, 43, 46 and 48 above). Moreover, in acquitting the chief sergeant the Military Court of Appeal explained why it considered that he had not exceeded the limits of selfdefence (see paragraphs 38 and 46 above), and the Supreme Court of Cassation also gave reasons on that point (see paragraph 48 above).",

                                                "content": "72.\u00a0\u00a0However, it cannot be overlooked that the domestic proceedings appear to have focused solely on the last moments of the standoff between Mr Filipov and the three officers chasing him. The Court, for its part, is of the view that in assessing the necessity of the force used against Mr Filipov, the national authorities should have taken into consideration the entire chain of events leading to that standoff. It should be noted in this connection that the police apparently mounted the operation against Mr Filipov pursuant to information that he might have been involved in three armed robberies (see paragraph 7 above). However, the Court is struck by the apparent lack of clarity as to the exact object sought to be attained by the three officers who positioned themselves on the road leading to Mr Filipov\u2019s house, the apparent lack of instructions as to how they were to react when coming into contact with Mr Filipov \u2013 in particular, instructions emphasising their responsibility to refrain from using disproportionate force in the event of an armed engagement (see Vlaevi v. , nos. 272/05 and 890/05, \u00a7 79, 2\u00a0September 2010) \u2013, and the apparent lack of backup arrangements in case their encounter with Mr Filipov did not turn out smoothly. The fact that the officers put on bulletproof vests shows that they were alive to the possibility of a violent encounter (see paragraph 7 in fine above). It cannot therefore be said that the police were caught in a situation in which they had to react without any prior preparation (contrast Makaratzis v.  [GC], no. 50385/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2004XI). It is true that the events evolved rapidly after the officers spotted Mr Filipov in his car and tried to approach him (see paragraph 8 above). However, it cannot be overlooked that when chasing Mr Filipov the officers resorted to using their firearms and fired repeatedly at his car, which, considering the high speed at which that car and the police car that was chasing it were moving, could hardly be regarded as posing no risk to life (see, mutatis mutandis, Tzekov v. , no. 45500/99, \u00a7 64, 23 February 2006). It is in addition not fully clear whether the officers gave due consideration to other ways of stopping Mr\u00a0Filipov. It does not appear that those elements featured prominently in the analysis carried out by the domestic authorities. A perusal of the judgments of the Military Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 46 and 48 above), which had to deal with the case on the basis of the charges laid down by the prosecuting authorities, shows that in assessing the necessity of the force used against Mr Filipov those courts focused their attention on the last moments of the chase, and analysed the need for that force almost entirely in the context of the moment of engagement. The criminal proceedings against chief sergeant Y. cannot therefore be regarded as discharging the State\u2019s procedural obligations under Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nachova and Others v.  [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 114, ECHR\u00a02005VII). The investigation required under that provision should be broad enough to permit the authorities to take into consideration not only the actions of the State agents who directly used lethal force but also all surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the planning and control of the operation in question, where this is necessary in order to determine whether the State complied with its obligation under Article 2 to protect life (see AlSkeini and Others v. the  [GC], no.\u00a055721/07, \u00a7 163, ECHR 2011...). The Court has not been made aware of any other proceedings scrutinising the incident in which Mr Filipov lost his life.",
