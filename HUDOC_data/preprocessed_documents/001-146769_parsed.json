The police had set up checkpoints along the route, blocking the roads and preventing the Witnesses from arriving at their destination. Nineteen buses and several cars stopped by the police were obliged to turn back. Meanwhile, the police allowed a bus carrying Orthodox believers to continue to Marneuli. Upon arrival, the group of Orthodox believers burst into the property belonging to R. Tsartsidze (applicant no. 60) in which the meeting was to be held. They destroyed religious objects and removed items belonging to the owner of the property. The police officers present refused to intervene to protect the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and at least some of them went as far as to beat members of the meeting. At least twenty-eight Witnesses were beaten and robbed during the attack. Property belonging to the Witnesses valued at several thousand US\u00a0dollars was destroyed or stolen. In addition, according to an audit report submitted by the applicants, 1,500 kilograms of religious literature worth several thousand US dollars was burnt on that day.",

Late in the evening some seventy persons approached the house and tried to interrupt the religious gathering. Several of them, who were apparently drunk, including L.Ch. and O.E., the latter being armed with a wooden stick, burst into the house and verbally assaulted the Witnesses; the applicant was physically assaulted by L.Ch. Police intervention was requested and the head of the city police, T.K., arrived but, according to the applicant, only to assist the attackers. He forced the applicant to go to a police station, where the latter was physically assaulted by T.K., insulted by other people, including an Orthodox priest, and threatened with further physical violence unless he stopped practising his religion in Lanchkhuti. He was detained at the police station for about three hours.",

In the village of Dviri (Borjomi district, Western Georgia), they were attacked by a group of villagers accompanied by Mr S.Kh., and Mr J.B., administrative head of the county town of the district and administrative head of the village respectively. One of the attackers, a private individual, struck B.\u00a0Gogoladze, who started bleeding and grabbed his bag containing a Bible and other religious literature. The same person then attacked the other two applicants, lashing them with the strap of the bag belonging to Gogoladze. The two administrative heads condoned the violence and insulted the applicants.

The attackers are said to have beaten the worshippers with iron crosses and wooden clubs. A few adherents escaped and reported the attack to local police, who allegedly refused to come to their aid or provide protection.

At one roadblock, however, some buses returning to Tbilisi were reportedly attacked by a stone throwing crowd. Windows were broken, and one woman passenger was said to have been struck on the head by a rock.

The Court also points out that illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000IV; see also El-Masri v.\u00a0the\u00a0former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a039630/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0195196, ECHR\u00a02012, with further references therein).

In this connection, while accepting that the scale of the religious violence in Georgia was undoubtedly distressing and humiliating for Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses at the material time, it is still necessary, in the Court\u2019s opinion, to rule on the question of the applicability of Article 3 of the Convention to the facts of each and every alleged incident of violence individually.

Against this background, and particularly having regard to the violent attack of 8 September 2000 on the religious convention held in the village of Rokhi (see paragraphs\u00a0915 above), it should have been obvious to the police that future attacks were likely to follow (see Milanovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 89; see also P.F. and E.F. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28326/09, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 39, 23\u00a0November 2010).

The roadblocks set up by the police along the route, as apparent from the relevant evidence, served simply to prevent the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses from arriving at their destination. The convention site at Marneuli was attacked, religious objects and literature were destroyed and the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were physically and verbally assaulted.

In view of the sensitivity of the case, the authorities were expecting a high attendance at court, as well as a possible confrontation on a religious basis. Nonetheless, it appears that the relevant authorities did not take adequate security measures to ensure safety and order in court (see paragraph 79 above). As for the incident itself, various representatives of the Gldani-Nadzaladevi Court, including the judge and the security personnel, were present during the incident and did not intervene to stop the confrontation and end the violence. Particularly striking in this connection is the fact that despite the violence experienced on the first day of the hearing (16 August 2000), the relevant authorities took no measures whatsoever to prevent a recurrence the next day. As a result, the hearing of 17 August 2000 was also violently disrupted and the applicants listed in paragraph 123 above were assaulted.

All the applicants explicitly alleged in their criminal complaints that they had been subjected to violence because of their religion. Nevertheless, in none of the investigations ordered were any efforts taken to discover the discriminatory intent behind the violent incidents. In criminal cases nos. 1 and 3 for example, the applicants\u2019 criminal complaints concerning the unlawful prevention of their religious gatherings were never looked into, while in criminal cases nos. 2 and 20 no investigation had been ordered whatsoever. The Government submitted no explanation for the authorities\u2019 failure in this respect.\u00a0The Court considers it unacceptable that, being aware that the attacks in question had probably been motivated by religious hatred, the respondent State\u2019s authorities allowed the investigations to simply ignore the possible religious motives behind the repeated acts of violence (see in this connection paragraph\u00a0179 below).",

This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practice or not to practice a religion (see, among other authorities, Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, \u00a7\u00a031, Series A no. 260A, and S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, \u00a7 124, 1\u00a0July 2014, with further references therein).",

The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance (see Kokkinakis, cited above, \u00a7 31, and Leyla \u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey\u00a0[GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2005XI). Since the manifestation by one person of his or her religious belief may have an impact on others, the drafters of the Convention qualified this aspect of freedom of religion in the manner set out in Article 9 \u00a7 2. This second paragraph provides that any limitation placed on a person\u2019s freedom to manifest religion or belief must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of one or more of the legitimate aims set\u00a0out\u00a0therein (see Miro\u013cubovs and Others v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a0798/05, \u00a7\u00a080, 15\u00a0September 2009, and S.A.S., cited above, \u00a7\u00a0126).",

Romania [GC], no. 2330/09, \u00a7\u00a0165, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As indicated previously, it also considers that the State\u2019s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State\u2019s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Manoussakis and Others v.\u00a0Greece, 26 September 1996, \u00a7 47, Reports 1996-IV; Hasan and Chaush\u00a0v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2000XI; Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v.

Spain [GC], no. 56030/07, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2014 (extracts)), and that this duty requires the State to ensure mutual tolerance between opposing groups (see, among other authorities, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, \u00a7 57, Reports 1998I, and Leyla \u015eahin, cited above, \u00a7 107). Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other; this State role is unlikely to diminish the role of a faith or a Church with which the population of a specific country has historically and culturally been associated (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Others, cited above, \u00a7 132 with further references therein).",

Where the organisation of the religious community is at issue, Article 9 of the Convention must be interpreted in the light of Article 11, which safeguards associative life against unjustified State interference. Seen in that perspective, the right of believers to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that they will be allowed to associate freely, without arbitrary State intervention. The autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 of the Convention affords. It has a direct interest, not only for the actual organisation of those communities but also for the effective enjoyment by all their active members of the right to freedom of religion. Were the organisational life of the community not protected by Article 9 of the Convention, all other aspects of the individual\u2019s freedom of religion would become vulnerable (see Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0127, and Sindicatul \u201cP\u0103storul cel Bun,\u201d cited above, \u00a7 136 with further references therein).",

As regards the question of what constitutes prima facie evidence capable of shifting the burden of proof on to the respondent State, the Court stated in Nachova and Others (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR\u00a02005VII) that in proceedings before it there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or predetermined formulae for its assessment. The Court adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Furthermore, in its recent cases on the question of discrimination, the Court relied extensively on statistics produced by the parties to establish a difference in treatment between two groups in similar situations (see, among others, Zarb Adami v. Malta, no. 17209/02, \u00a7\u00a7 77-78, ECHR 2006VIII and Gine Wilhelmina Elisabeth Hoogendijk v. the Netherlands\u00a0(dec.), no.\u00a058641/00, 6 January 2005).",
