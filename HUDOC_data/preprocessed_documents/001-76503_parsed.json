Thus, for example, in the former case a policeman or police officer who is in litigation with the authority employing him on grounds of the insalubrious condition of his official residence could not, on account of his status, rely on Article 6 \u00a7 1 to claim a right of access to a tribunal. Nor, for example, could a soldier who has obtained judgment awarding him a transport allowance rely on Article 6 \u00a7 1 to seek enforcement of it, on account of his status as soldier. Taken out of context, a literal interpretation of Pellegrin, which refers to \u201cno disputes between administrative authorities and employees who occupy posts involving participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law\u201d (ibid., 67), might well lead to results that are unreasonable and contrary to the purpose and aim of the Convention.\u201d (Martinie v. France [GC], no. 58675/00, judgment 12 April 2006).",

Thus, it is quite inevitable to recognise that the Article 6 \u00a7 1 is not only applicable, but violated if we strictly follow the Court\u2019s case-law.",

The long-term dispute between military and State officials inevitably provoked distress and frustration resulting from this conflict.
