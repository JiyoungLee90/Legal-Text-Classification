Secondly, the applicants referred to the rejection of M.C.\u2019s financial report concerning his presidential campaign and the subsequent forfeiture of some of the donations made to his committee (2). In this respect, the domestic courts held that it was untrue that M.C. had personally breached the provisions of the electoral law because the irregularities established had formally concerned his electoral committee. Thirdly, the applicants reported that M.C. had disclosed confidential information from a hearing held in private and had thus broken the law (3). Here, the domestic courts observed that the applicants had not been entitled to report on the matter since no proceedings had been instituted against M.C. in this respect.",

With regard to the proceedings against M.C. brought by a local radio journalist, even if it would have been more appropriate to mention that it was only a first-instance ruling, the applicants nevertheless accurately reported that M.C. had been found guilty of defamation. As regards the assertion concerning the financial irregularities during the presidential campaign, the Court notes that M.C. had not been held personally liable. However, it is reasonable to consider that he bore at least political responsibility for the irregularities established in the financing of his campaign. With regard to the alleged disclosure of confidential information, the Court observes that the domestic courts\u2019 analysis was very restrictive; it had been established in the proceedings against the applicants that such information, namely a witness statement had been disclosed by M.C. (see\u00a0paragraph 18 above). The degree of precision for establishing the wellfoundedness of a criminal charge by a competent court can hardly be compared to that which ought to be observed by a journalist when expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern, in particular when expressing his opinion in the form of a value judgment (see, Unabh\u00e4ngige Initiative Informationsvielfalt v.

That latter assertion may be considered to have been fair comment on a matter of public interest which was underpinned by a sufficient factual basis. It appears that it was the applicants\u2019 primary intention to expose M.C.\u2019s reprehensible behaviour in public life and not to label him as an offender. Indeed, in the opening line of their article of 4 February 2004 they stated that \u201cthe activity of M.C. has been based on balancing on the edge of the law, and even on breaking it\u201d (see paragraph 7 above). The applicants repeated the same argument in their appeal against the trial court\u2019s judgment.",

The Court considers that in the present case the applicants complied with those obligations. When preparing their articles, they approached a significant number of M.C.\u2019s former collaborators and fellow local politicians to have as objective a picture of him as possible. They requested M.C. to comment on the court cases in which he had been involved; however, their requests were refused.",

The domestic courts limited their assessment to certain passages from the articles and somehow disregarded the general critical opinion about M.C.\u2019s activities as a local politician which was supported by information from various sources. Having regard to the overall context of the series of articles published by the applicants, the Court considers that they do not appear to have been a gratuitous personal attack on M.C. It emerges from the articles, which were not in that part contested by M.C., that he was a divisive and antagonistic figure in local politics as evidenced by a number of statements quoted in the two articles. In this connection, the Court notes also the very negative assessment of M.C. expressed in a statement of the municipal council signed by thirty-four councillors (see paragraph 8 above). Since M.C. was a controversial figure in local politics, he should have been prepared to display a greater degree of tolerance when exposed to scathing remarks about his performance or policies (see, mutatis mutandis, Lombardo and Others v. Malta, no.\u00a07333/06, \u00a7 54, 24 April 2007; Kubaszewski v. Poland, no. 571/04, \u00a7 43, 2\u00a0February 2010). Lastly, the Court has accepted on many occasions that a\u00a0degree of exaggeration and immoderation is allowed for those who take part in a public debate on issues of general interest (see, Mam\u00e8re, cited above, \u00a7 25; D\u0105browski v.
