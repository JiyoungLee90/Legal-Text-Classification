Having read the statements that the applicant had given during various stages of the inquiry, the statements by the police officers and investigators implicated in the events and the results of the medical expert examinations, the commission confirmed that the decision to close the inquiry had been reasonable. In addition, the commission cited statements by the applicant\u2019s co-defendant, Mr T., who had allegedly told the investigators that the applicant had acknowledged an attempt to frame the police officers by complaining of ill-treatment. According to Mr T., the applicant had told him that he had hit his head against a bookshelf a number of times during the interrogation, and had broken a tap in a lavatory in the police station and had poured water on his clothes. The commission concluded that the applicant\u2019s head injury had resulted from his own careless actions and that his statements about the beatings should be treated with caution as they had been merely revenge for his arrest and the subsequent institution of criminal proceedings against him. The commission also noted that it had been impossible to establish the cause of the bruises on his back and chest. They also relied on statements by the police officers, who had allegedly observed the applicant touching his chest during the interrogation after his arrest and who had reiterated the applicant\u2019s explanations that he had been beaten up by unknown persons in the entrance lobby of his home.",

However, the Court is not convinced by that explanation. It firstly notes that that version of events appeared for the first time in the statements made by the applicant five months after the inquiry into the alleged ill-treatment had been initiated. The police officers whom the applicant had accused of ill-treatment had never mentioned having seen the applicant hit his head. It also does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that that explanation for the applicant\u2019s head injury was put forward by him only after his meeting with the police investigator, Ms Sa., from the same police station where the ill-treatment had allegedly taken place. The Court notes that the applicant amended his statements as to the true cause of his injuries following a meeting with the official implicated in the events in question. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that the applicant felt intimidated by the persons he had accused of having ill-treated him (see Colibaba v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 29089/06, \u00a7 49, 23 October 2007, and Bat\u0131 and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 33097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2004IV (extracts)). This conclusion becomes even more salient if the Court reiterates the Government\u2019s argument that merely several days after that interview on 8\u00a0June 2002, the applicant attempted to withdraw his ill-treatment complaint and asked the investigators to close the inquiry (see paragraph 24 above). The Court must also have regard to the fact that the applicant, in his complaints to the prosecution authorities and later to the courts, was unequivocal in his account that he had been ill-treated by police officers while in custody. The applicant consistently denied the accuracy of the statement which he had made to the investigator on 8 June 2002.",

While the Court does not exclude the possibility of accidents occurring in detention, it does not lose sight of the fact that in addition to a closed cranio-cerebral injury and concussion, the doctors recorded a number of bruises on various parts of the applicant\u2019s head. The Court notes that this description corresponds to physical sequelae resulting from multiple impacts, rather than a single impact, against a firm surface or blunt object. This finding is also supported by the experts\u2019 reluctance to conclude that the injuries could have resulted from the applicant having hit his head against a shelf.",

In particular, they reconstructed the events in the police station by way of an experiment. According to the applicant, the experiment showed that his height made it impossible for him to have hit the shelf when standing up from a chair. In this respect, the Court notes that it asked the Government to provide the complete investigation file pertaining to the events of 16 and 17 January 2002 but that the Government, without any explanation, selectively submitted materials from the file. The record of the above-mentioned investigation experiment was not among them. Noting the lack of any explanation for the failure to comply with its request, the Court is prepared to draw inferences from the Government\u2019s conduct. It also notes that it appears from the decision of 30\u00a0November 2004 that the possibility of the applicant having sustained a head injury by hitting his head against the shelf was, if not entirely excluded, extremely limited, given that the applicant would have had to remain in a very specific position and would have had to stand up and hit his head against the shelf a number of times. Furthermore, although unconvinced by the Government\u2019s argument, the Court still considers it necessary to note that they gave no explanation as to why, in the circumstances as described by them, a doctor was not immediately called to provide the applicant with medical assistance and to document his head injuries, which were rather serious.",

While the effectiveness of the investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment will be examined below, the Court would stress at this juncture that the investigators never verified whether the applicant participated in a fight. Furthermore, the medical experts who examined the applicant in the course of the investigation concluded that the injuries had been caused no more than twenty-four hours before he was examined in the hospital. Given that the applicant had been arrested at around 9 p.m. on 16\u00a0January 2002 and was examined in the hospital after 6 p.m. the following day, the Government\u2019s assertion that the applicant sustained the injuries in a fight with unknown individuals appears unreliable.",

At the same time, the official record listed entirely different grounds for his deprivation of liberty: the applicant had allegedly been drunk in a public place and his appearance had been considered an insult to human dignity and social morals. He was accordingly charged with an administrative offence and fined RUB 10. There is no dispute between the parties that the applicant was kept in the station for more than fifteen hours after that administrative offence record had been drawn up, and was questioned at length in the absence of a lawyer and during the night about his involvement in the theft of a car. It is also undisputed that the applicant was released after he had confessed to that criminal offence. While the Court is not called upon in the present case to assess the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention or to deal with the deficiencies of the criminal proceedings against him, it is prepared to conclude that the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s detention make all the more plausible his assertion that the police officers used force to acquire a confession from him.",

The Court has already noted in previous cases that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7 114, ECHR 2000VII). According to the Court\u2019s consistent approach, treatment is considered \u201cinhuman\u201d if it is premeditated, applied for hours at a stretch and causes either actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering. It is deemed to be \u201cdegrading\u201d if it is such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 92). The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a violation of Article 3 (see, for example, Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2001-III, and Kalashnikov v. Russia, no.\u00a047095/99, \u00a7 101, ECHR 2002-VI).",

It has not been established that the applicant resisted arrest, attempted to escape or did not comply with lawful orders from the police officers. Furthermore, there is no indication that at any point during his arrest or subsequent detention at the police station he threatened the police officers, for example by openly carrying a weapon or by attacking them (see, by contrast, Necdet Bulut v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 77092/01, \u00a7 25, 20 November 2007, and Berli\u00ffski v.

Firstly, the Court has already observed that the first decision refusing to open a criminal investigation into the events was issued within days of the applicant\u2019s parents bringing their complaint. That decision was based on statements by the police officers and two staff members of the hospital where the applicant had been admitted on 17\u00a0January 2002 and the medical report listing his injuries. The Court finds it unexplainable that, despite the medical report attesting to very serious injuries on the applicant\u2019s body and the fact that the investigator had been informed that the applicant had been admitted to hospital for inpatient treatment, the investigator closed the inquiry without attempting to find an explanation for the cause of those injuries. However, the Court is even more concerned by the way in which the investigator recounted statements by the hospital personnel who, despite the fact that the applicant had been admitted for inpatient treatment for his injuries, either allegedly had not seen any injuries on the applicant\u2019s body or had not seen any fresh injuries (see paragraph 19 above). The Court is troubled by the investigator\u2019s approach to the restatement of witness testimony, particularly in the light of the applicant\u2019s submissions from which it appears that the statements of at least one hospital staff member had not been reflected correctly in the investigator\u2019s decision (see paragraphs 19 and 76 above).",

The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7 55 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X). When a doctor writes a report after the medical examination of a person who alleges that he has been tortured, it is important that the doctor states the degree of consistency with the allegation of torture. A conclusion indicating the degree of support to the allegation of torture should be based on a discussion of possible differential diagnoses (non-torture-related injuries \u2013 including self-inflicted injuries \u2013 and diseases). The Court is not convinced that that was done in the present case. In his report of 5 February 2002 the expert made no reference to the degree of support to the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment, limiting his conclusions to very general and vague observations, such as the blunt surface and firm structure of the object with which the applicant had been hit. Taking into account the defects of the initial expert report, the Court finds it regrettable that the additional expert examination was not performed until January 2003, that is, a year after the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment had taken place. The Court believes that the delay in requesting an additional expert opinion led, among other things, to the experts\u2019 inability to come to firm conclusions as to the cause of the applicant\u2019s injuries.",

It is apparent from the decision submitted to the Court that the investigators based their conclusions mainly on the testimonies given by the police officers involved in the incident. Although excerpts from the applicant\u2019s testimony were included in the decisions to close the inquiry, the investigators did not consider that testimony to be credible, apparently, because it reflected a personal opinion and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant. However, the investigators did accept as such the credibility of the police officers\u2019 testimonies, despite the fact, which was also noted by the District Court (see paragraph 36 above), that their statements were contradictory, could have constituted defence tactics and were aimed at damaging the applicant\u2019s credibility. In the Court\u2019s view, the prosecution inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies: that given by the applicant was deemed to be subjective, whereas those given by the police officers were not. The credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation had sought to establish whether the officers were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 46317/99, \u00a7 99, 23 February 2006). The Court further considers it extraordinary that the investigators never inquired into why the applicant had been prompted to amend his statements on 8 June 2002, and subsequently even to withdraw his ill-treatment complaint. Nor did they attempt to settle the abundant discrepancies in the police officers\u2019 statements, starting from their description of the injuries on the applicant\u2019s body and ending with their versions of how those injuries could have been sustained (see paragraphs 19 and 29 above).",

The Court, however, does not find those statements to be reliable given the remoteness of the events in question from the date when Mr T. made them.

The Court is concerned about the investigators\u2019 eagerness to accept, without verifying its veracity, any explanation for the applicant\u2019s injuries as long as it did not implicate the police officers. It once again finds it striking that, having concluded that the applicant had sustained the injuries in a fight and having noted the absence of complaints by the applicant against any third parties, the investigator closed the inquiry without any evidence in support of the conclusion that the fight had in fact taken place. The Court therefore finds that the investigating authorities\u2019 failure to look for corroborating evidence and their deferential attitude to the police officers must be considered to be a particularly serious shortcoming in the investigation (see Ayd\u0131n v. Turkey, judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997VI, \u00a7\u00a0106). The Court\u2019s conclusion to that effect is supported by the District Court\u2019s finding that the investigators had failed to comply with its orders to look for additional evidence which could have shed light on the facts of the case (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above).",

He pointed to the fact that certain police officers had not mentioned his having resisted arrest and that the authorities had not recorded any injuries when he was placed in the police station detention unit.

Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000VII). Having regard to the evidence before it, the Court is not convinced that the applicant sustained the injuries listed in the expert report of 22 March 2003 in the circumstances as described by the Government. It notes serious flaws undermining the Government\u2019s version of events. The Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant was in the police custody for three days on the basis of an administrative offence report, without any criminal charges being brought against him. During these three days he was not allowed to see a lawyer and his family members were not notified of his detention. The peculiar circumstances of the applicant\u2019s detention, as well as the acknowledgment on the part of the Government that the grounds for the detention during those three days were deficient, provide a strong support to the applicant\u2019s allegations that he was detained for the purpose of extracting confession from him through the use of force. Reiterating its consistent approach that cases of unacknowledged or arbitrary detention, such as in the applicant\u2019s case, render detainees particularly vulnerable, the Court is prepared to lay on a State a stricter burden of proof to present evidence to refute suspicions of serious human rights violations during the detention, in particular allegations of inhuman treatment. It does not consider that the Government have met such evidentiary burden in the present case.",

It was not until 18\u00a0February 2003, four days after the arrest and only when the applicant was finally allowed to see his lawyer, that a medical examination was authorised (see paragraph 45 above). The authorities\u2019 reluctance to examine the applicant as soon as he was brought to the police station serves as an additional argument in support of his version of events. It also appears that another delay occurred between authorisation of the medical examination and the examination itself (see paragraph 47 above). In this respect, the Court is concerned with a quality of the expert report prepared by the medical expert on 22 March 2003 to characterise the applicant\u2019s injuries. The Court notes the irreparable defects of the report making it impossible to establish, with a sufficient degree of certainty, the date of the applicant\u2019s medical examination and, as follows, to confirm or disprove his allegations of having been ill-treated for two days in the police station.",

While the Court does not lose sight of the relations the two witnesses had with the applicant (see paragraph 41 above), the detailed character of their testimony, as well as the fact that they maintained their testimony throughout the investigation, allow overcoming a certain doubt as to the veracity of their statements. The applicant\u2019s consistent testimony as to the nature and origin of his injuries is yet another ground for the Court to dismiss the Government\u2019s version of events as implausible. The only episode when the applicant changed his statements and attempted to withdraw the complaint in February 2006 does not alter this conclusion. The Court is not ready to interpret the applicant\u2019s behaviour in any other way but as an act of frustration by the authorities\u2019 superficial and delayed response to his ill-treatment complaints.",

Having opened an inquiry almost immediately after the applicant\u2019s complaint on 18 February 2003, the investigating authorities had a spree of closing and opening the inquiry in the course of more than three years, taking a final decision only on 5 May 2006. The proceedings were discontinued and resumed four times because the investigation had been found to be incomplete and inadequate. The Court reiterates that repeated remittals of a case for further investigation may disclose a serious deficiency in the domestic prosecution system (see Filatov v.

The investigators eagerly closed the proceedings following the applicant\u2019s refusal to support his ill-treatment complaint, without questioning the applicant\u2019s personal motives or determining whether his decision had been taken voluntarily (see paragraphs 49 and 50 above). Such deficiencies and the slack attitude on the part of the authorities caused, in the Court\u2019s view, a loss of precious time and complicated the investigation of the applicant\u2019s allegations (see, for similar reasoning, Ablyazov v. Russia, no. 22867/05, \u00a7\u00a058, 30 October 2012).",

Even when statements had finally been obtained from the two witnesses \u2013 the applicant\u2019s passengers \u2013 the investigators demonstrated a different attitude towards assessing their accuracy and reliability from the one they took in assessing the police officers\u2019 statements. However, the Court again reiterates that the probative value of witness testimony should never be automatically raised or impeached on account of the witness\u2019s affiliation to State bodies or their relation with a suspect or a victim.

While they inquired whether the applicant could have sustained the injuries as a result of being forced into the police car, the investigators did not ask the expert whether similar injuries could have been sustained in the circumstances described by the applicant. The Court therefore cannot but conclude that the investigators\u2019 efforts were focused rather on the dismissal, in hasty and perfunctory fashion, of the applicant\u2019s complaint than on a thorough verification of the substance of his allegations.",

In this respect, the Court reiterates that in the Russian legal system the power of a court to reverse a decision not to institute criminal proceedings is a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of powers by the investigating authorities. An appeal to a court of general jurisdiction against a prosecutor\u2019s decision not to investigate complaints of ill-treatment constitutes therefore an effective domestic remedy which must be exhausted (see Belevitskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a072967/01, \u00a7\u00a061, 1 March 2007).

In addition, he did not benefit from an adequate and effective investigation of his complaints of ill-treatment. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation.
