The authorities thus had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into her allegations against the police officers. For the reasons set out above, no effective criminal investigation can be considered to have been carried out. Consequently, any other remedy available to the applicant, including the claim for damages, had limited chances of success. While the civil courts have capacity to make an independent assessment of the facts, in practice the weight attached to a preceding criminal inquiry is so important that even the most convincing evidence to the contrary furnished by a plaintiff would often be discarded as \u201cirrelevant\u201d. The civil proceedings brought by the applicant illustrate that. The court simply endorsed the prosecutor's opinion that the applicant's claim was unmeritorious without assessing the facts of the case (see paragraphs 29-30 above). Therefore the action for damages was, in the circumstances of the case, only a theoretical and illusory remedy, not capable of affording redress to the applicant.",

Even assuming that the police intended to press charges for the administrative offence, this did not absolve them from complying with such basic formalities before detaining her. That fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, as it has been the Court's traditional view that the unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of the fundamentally important guarantees contained in Article 5 of the Convention and discloses a most grave violation of that provision. The absence of a record of such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Anguelova, cited above, \u00a7 154, and Kurt v.
