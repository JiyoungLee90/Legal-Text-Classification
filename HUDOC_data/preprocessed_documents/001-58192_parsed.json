Although the majority does not expressly put it this way, this sounds as if, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the shortcomings of the first-instance proceedings have been remedied on appeal. But how can those shortcomings have been remedied if they were not brought to the attention of the appellate court and were not dealt with there? If under domestic law an accused is entitled to a hearing before an independent and impartial court with full jurisdiction at least at two levels, he is entitled to two sets of proceedings which each meet the requirements of fairness. If the first-instance proceedings fail to meet those requirements, that failure cannot be remedied simply by the fact that the appeal proceedings are fair; this would make the fairness issue of the first instance proceedings completely irrelevant. The failure would only be remedied if the appeal court, in view of the shortcomings in fairness, quashed the first-instance decision and ordered a retrial. That has not happened in the present case.",
