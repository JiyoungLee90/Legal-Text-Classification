This silence on the subject is perfectly understandable, moreover, given that the provisions of Roman law on adoption could not easily be transposed to Andorran families living in the first half of the twentieth century for the following reasons: since the nineteenth century it could be regarded as an institution that had become obsolete and, to a certain extent, unnecessary given that the main purpose \u2013 to appoint a successor or heir \u2013 had been achieved in the Principality of Andorra through the institution of heretament (agreement, specific to Catalan law, on the succession of a living person), introduced by customary law. In that social and family context, it is difficult to sustain the proposition that, in setting up a family settlement in case her heir should die without leaving offspring of a lawful and canonical marriage, the testatrix was also referring to adopted children, given that, at the time, adoption was not an established institution in the Principality of Andorra.",

Moreover, the inheritance rights were also limited in the present case: the deed of adoption referred to the relevant 1960 Catalan legislation, that is, a compilation of 1960 Catalan civil law. Article 248 provided that on an intestate succession adopted children were entitled to inherit only from their adoptive father or mother and not from the rest of their adoptive parents\u2019 family.

In that connection, the Government referred to the lack of a genuine relationship between the grandmother, Carolina Pujol Oller, who had died in 1949, and the first applicant, who was adopted in 1969. In the Government\u2019s submission, the Court had always adopted a pragmatic approach to the concept of \u201cfamily life\u201d in order to protect de facto rather than de iure family life. In that sense, the existence of a formal family tie was insufficient to attract the protection of Article 8.",

Belgium (judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, pp. 23-24, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52), it accepted that the right of succession between children and parents, and between grandchildren and grandparents, was so closely related to family life that it came within the sphere of Article 8. It has thus considered that matters of intestate succession \u2013 and voluntary dispositions \u2013 between near relatives prove to be intimately connected with family life. Family life does not include only social, moral or cultural relations, for example in the sphere of children\u2019s education; it also comprises interests of a material kind, as is shown by, amongst other things, the obligations in respect of maintenance and the position occupied in the domestic legal systems of the majority of the Contracting States by the institution of the reserved portion of an estate (r\u00e9serve h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire). The fact that Carolina Pujol Oller had died before the first applicant was adopted is no reason for the Court to adopt a different approach in the present case (see, mutatis mutandis, Camp and Bourimi v. the Netherlands, no. 28369/95, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2000-X).",

Adoption had already been a feature of canon law when it was first drafted over a thousand years ago. The Catholic Church attributed to adopted children the status laid down in canon 1094 of the Benedict XV Code, which was the relevant legislation in force when the will had been drafted in 1939. That status had been confirmed in 1983 by canon 110 of the modern Code of Canon Law, which enshrined the principle that adopted children and legitimate children were equal. There was abundant case-law authority to support the submission that canon law was a supplementary source of law in the Principality of Andorra. Moreover, under Roman law adopted children had the same inheritance and family rights as legitimate and illegitimate children. Adoption had therefore been envisaged both in canon law and in Roman law. It was therefore undeniably a known legal institution that had been used by Andorrans in 1939.",

That total failure to apply the appropriate law had resulted in an interference with their rights by the Andorran authorities, which were the ultimate guarantors of their right to enjoy their family life without any unjustified discrimination.

In the Government\u2019s submission, the present case differed substantially from Marckx because the first applicant had been left more than EUR 300,000 by his father and had had the same inheritance rights as his sister or any other legitimate brother or sister if there had been one.",

Once the portion reserved to the heirs was protected, testators were free to dispose of the rest of the property as they wished. That was precisely what had happened here. The Government submitted that there had been no interference with the applicants\u2019 family life. Moreover, even supposing that the decisions of the Andorran courts could be deemed to have interfered with the rights to which the applicants referred, the interference had been justified.

Similarly, the court observed that the deed of adoption had been drawn up in  in accordance with the Spanish procedure for full adoption. Under the Spanish law applicable at the time, particularly Catalan law (to which the deed of adoption referred), on an intestate succession adopted children could inherit only from their adoptive father or mother and not from the rest of the adoptive parents\u2019 family. When examining the testatrix\u2019s intention, the court found that both at the time when the will was made in 1939 and on the testatrix\u2019s death in 1949 the adopted children of her legitimate son or son of the marriage were outside the family circle from a legal and sociological point of view. The court found that, in order for adopted children to be able to inherit under a Catalan family settlement, there would have to be no doubt as to the testatrix\u2019s intention to depart from the usual meaning ascribed to that arrangement.

Thus, even supposing that the testamentary disposition in question did require an interpretation by the domestic courts, that interpretation could not be made exclusively in the light of the social conditions existing when the will was made or at the time of the testatrix\u2019s death, namely in 1939 and 1949, particularly where a period of fifty-seven years had elapsed between the date when the will was made and the date on which the estate passed to the heirs. Where such a long period has elapsed, during which profound social, economic and legal changes have occurred, the courts cannot ignore these new realities. The same is true with regard to wills: any interpretation, if interpretation there must be, should endeavour to ascertain the testator\u2019s intention and render the will effective, while bearing in mind that \u201cthe testator cannot be presumed to have meant what he did not say\u201d and without overlooking the importance of interpreting the testamentary disposition in the manner that most closely corresponds to domestic law and to the Convention as interpreted in the Court\u2019s case-law.",

As appears from the terms of its judgment, in upholding the appeals of the Serra Areny sisters and finding that, as an adopted child of the life tenant under the will of Carolina Pujol Oller, the first applicant was excluded from inheriting under the will, the High Court of Justice of Andorra sought to give effect to the intention of the testatrix herself in the exercise of her right to dispose of her property on her death.

It must in principle be open to a testator, in the exercise of his or her right of property, to choose to whom to leave the property and, by the terms of the will, to differentiate between potential heirs, by (inter alia) distinguishing between biological and adoptive children and grandchildren. As pointed out in the opinion of Judge Garlicki, the testator\u2019s right of choice finds protection under the Convention, namely in Article 8 and in Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01. The State must in principle give effect, through its judicial organs, to such private testamentary disposition and cannot be held to be in breach of its Convention obligations (including its obligations under Article 14) by doing so, save in exceptional circumstances where the disposition may be said to be repugnant to the fundamental ideals of the Convention or to aim at the destruction of the rights and freedoms set forth therein.

Nor do I understand the majority of the Chamber of the Court to suggest to the contrary. It is true that in paragraph\u00a046 of the judgment it is said that an issue of interference with private and family life under the Convention could arise if the national court\u2019s assessment of the facts or domestic law were \u201cblatantly inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the Convention\u201d and in paragraph 59 such inconsistency is found to have existed in the national courts\u2019 assessment in the present case. However, I do not read this finding as suggesting that the upholding by a national court of a will which distinguishes between biological and adopted children is of itself to be seen as incompatible with Convention principles. The majority\u2019s finding is, as I understand it, based rather on the ground that the High Court\u2019s interpretation of the will in the present case and its assessment of the intention of the testatrix were clearly wrong and that accordingly it was that court\u2019s decision that, as an adopted grandchild, the first applicant was excluded from inheriting the estate which itself gave rise to a violation of Article 14.",

I would agree with the majority that this principle applies a fortiori when the national courts are concerned with resolving disputes between private individuals or interpreting a private testamentary disposition, such courts being better placed than an international court to evaluate, in the light of local legal traditions, the particular context of the legal dispute and the competing rights and interests involved.",

As appears from the judgment, it found that adoption had been practically unheard of in  during the first half of the twentieth century. It concluded from this that it was difficult to reconcile the testatrix\u2019s act of creating a family settlement in case the life tenant should die without leaving offspring of a lawful and canonical marriage with an intention to extend the arrangement to adopted children, since adoption was not an established institution in the Principality at the time. Similarly, the court observed that the deed of adoption had been drawn up in  in accordance with the Spanish procedure for full adoption. Under the Spanish law applicable at the time, particularly Catalan law (to which the deed of adoption referred), on an intestate succession adopted children could inherit only from their adoptive father or mother and not from the rest of the adoptive parents\u2019 family. When examining the testatrix\u2019s intention, the court found that both at the time when the will was made in 1939 and on the testatrix\u2019s death in 1949 the adopted children of her legitimate son or son of the marriage were outside the family circle from a legal and sociological point of view. The purpose of a family settlement si sine liberis decesserit under Catalan law was, in the view of the court, to keep the family estate in the legitimate or married family and Catalan legal tradition had always favoured the exclusion of adopted children from such family settlements. The court thus found that, in order for adopted children to be able to inherit under a Catalan family settlement, there would have to be no doubt as to the testatrix\u2019s intention to depart from the usual meaning ascribed to that arrangement. The terms used in the will did not support that conclusion.",

In particular, it is suggested that any interpretation should not have overlooked \u201cthe importance of interpreting the testamentary disposition in the manner that most closely corresponds to domestic law and to the Convention as interpreted in the Court\u2019s case-law\u201d (see paragraph 62 of the judgment).",

The courts first determined the correct interpretation of the will and, in accordance with that interpretation, gave effect to it. Thus, the real question before our Court is to what extent the Convention enjoys a \u201chorizontal\u201d effect, that is, an effect prohibiting private parties from taking action which interferes with the rights and liberties of other private parties.

Such \u201cindirect third-party effect\u201d has been addressed by the Court in many different areas, such as the right to life (State obligation to carry out an effective investigation in a case of a murder committed by private persons \u2013 see, for example, Menson v. the United Kingdom, (dec.), no. 47916/99, ECHR 2003-V), freedom of expression (Appleby v. the United Kingdom, no. 44306/98, ECHR 2003-VI, in which the Court indicated that the State may be obliged to adopt \u201cpositive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals\u201d, \u00a7 39), freedom of association (Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, representing the first ruling of this kind), freedom of assembly (Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v.

The very fact that, under the Convention, the State may be prohibited from taking certain action (such as introducing inheritance distinctions between children \u2013 see Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31; Vermeire v. Belgium, judgment of 29 November 1991, Series A no. 214-C; and Mazurek v. France, no. 34406/97, ECHR 2000-II) does not mean that private persons are similarly precluded from taking such action. In other words, what is prohibited for the State need not necessarily also be prohibited for individuals. Of course, in many areas such prohibition may appear necessary and well-founded. However, it should not be forgotten that every prohibition of private action (or any refusal to judicially enforce such action), while protecting the rights of some persons, unavoidably restricts the rights of other persons. This is particularly visible in regard to \u201cpurely\u201d private-law relations, such as inheritance. The whole idea of a will is to depart from the general system of inheritance, that is, to discriminate between potential heirs. But at the same time, the testator must retain a degree of freedom to dispose of his/her property and this freedom is protected by both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01. Thus, in my opinion, the rule should be that the State must give effect to private testamentary dispositions, save in exceptional circumstances where the disposition may be said to be repugnant to the fundamental ideals of the Convention or to aim at the destruction of the rights and freedoms set forth therein.
