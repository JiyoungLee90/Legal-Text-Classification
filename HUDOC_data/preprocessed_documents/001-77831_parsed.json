It is the Court\u2019s established case-law that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. Where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see, for instance, Feldek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76; Jerusalem, cited above, \u00a7 43; De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, \u00a7 47; Oberschlick v.

It simply referred to his conviction at first instance without mentioning the offence of which he was convicted. However, the Court has accepted that the necessity of a link between a value judgment and its supporting facts may vary from case to case according to the specific circumstances (see, Feldek, cited above, \u00a7 86). The necessity to provide the facts underlying a value judgment is less stringent where these facts are already known to the general public (ibid.).",

As a result of this litigation, Mr Haider had been ordered to retract his statements via television broadcast. The video-tape which he had prepared for the purpose of being broadcast had again contained defamatory statements.

In contrast, the Vienna Court of Appeal convicted her on the ground that, pursuant to Article 111 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Criminal Code, the defence of good faith was not available in cases like the present one, in which a defamatory statement had been published in the media. In this connection the Court reiterates its case-law, according to which the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, among other authorities, Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2004II, and Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7 65, ECHR 1999II).

It notes that the Vienna Court of Appeal in its judgment of 10 October 2001 did not dismiss the applicant\u2019s request on formal grounds but found that they were in any case irrelevant to the proceedings, since it followed from the text of the article at issue that the applicants had not accused Mr. Haider of having ruined D.\u2019s reputation with regard to staff members of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation.

It is this reading of that part of the complaint under Article 10, which led the Chamber to its decision not to take up the issue, and not to answer the applicants\u2019 assertion (see paragraph 50 of the judgment). Under Article 6, on the other hand, the applicants raised the same issue, but this time, from a purely procedural angle ; namely that they were not given the opportunity to produce evidence before a court of law, and to examine witnesses who, according to the applicants, were important for the proper establishment of the facts of the case.",
