It had not been practical to reassign the case to another judge because 6 out of 8 civil judges of the District Court had been in the same situation. The President further submitted that since the reorganisation of the judiciary in 1996 her court had been chronically understaffed and overburdened to such an extent that it had been impossible to take any measures to prevent delays.",
