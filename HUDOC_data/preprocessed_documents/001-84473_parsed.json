In particular, the first-instance proceedings lasted more than four years (from 15 January 2001 to 31\u00a0January 2005), out of which more than two years and nine months fell within the period after the Convention\u2019s entry into force with respect to  on 15 April 2002. The only event that appears to have happened during this period was the obtaining of the expert opinion in August 2004. However, there were significant periods of inactivity, both prior to this event and between this event and the hearing held on 31 January 2005. Moreover, the full text of the Sabunchu District Court\u2019s judgment of 31\u00a0January 2005 was made available to the applicant with a delay of four months. This also contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings, as the applicant could not appeal to the higher courts during this period.",
