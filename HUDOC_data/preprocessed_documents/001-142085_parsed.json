He is formally a Sunni Muslim, but does not practise and considers himself to be an atheist. He had a shop in Mosul where he had rented out computer games and game consoles. In early August 2008 he had employed a young woman who did not wear a veil. After a few days, on 7 August, two masked men claiming to be members of Tahtim al-Jihad, an Iraqi branch of al-Qaeda, had entered the shop. They had told him that hiring a woman without a veil was against Islam and had required that she leave her job immediately. The applicant had refused their demand and had stated that \u201cif this is Islam, then I am not a Muslim\u201d. The woman had quit her job the following day. Still, three days later the applicant had received a letter with a bullet, stating that he had to excuse himself before the emir within five days or else he would be considered to have left Islam and could be killed. The applicant had refused to apologise. Some days later he had received a death threat and had been shot at. Soon thereafter, his shop had been destroyed by a bomb. Through a friend, whose brother had worked for the police, the applicant had been informed that the police were looking for him because they believed that the applicant had destroyed the shop himself to cover up for hiding weapons for terrorists there. His parents\u2019 neighbour had later told him that both the police and alQaeda had come to the parents\u2019 apartment to look for him on several occasions. The applicant had then fled to Dahuk in the Kurdistan Region, as alQaeda was less dominant there. Nothing had happened to him in Dahuk. After a month there, he had left Iraq on 26\u00a0September 2008. The applicant claimed that he risked being sentenced to death if he returned to Iraq, since he had uttered an unacceptable religious opinion in front of local al-Qaeda representatives and since he was wanted by the police for alleged cooperation with terrorists. Both al-Qaeda and the police were allegedly searching for him all over Iraq.",

The Board questioned the applicant\u2019s allegations that al-Qaeda had been searching for him in his parent\u2019s home and that he was sought by the police for having hidden weapons for terrorists in his shop, because he had submitted this information only very late in the proceedings. In any event, noting that the police accusations were false, the Board did not consider that the risk of being prosecuted could be characterised as persecution that would justify the grant of asylum. However, it accepted the applicant\u2019s claim that his life had been threatened by al-Qaeda and that he would thus face a real risk of persecution upon return to Mosul. The Board went on to examine the possibility of internal flight and found that the applicant had not made it plausible that he was at risk in all parts of Iraq. He was not considered in need of protection in relation to areas of the country where al-Qaeda was not strong. The Board noted that, while al-Qaeda retained a strong presence in Mosul, the security situation in the Kurdistan Region was stable and displaced persons could gain entrance there without a sponsor. Having regard to the general situation and the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances \u2013 including his gender, age, health, religion and ethnicity \u2013, it further found that he could reasonably relocate to the Kurdistan Region, even if he would lack a social network there. That finding was supported by the fact that he had already stayed in Dahuk for a month without encountering any problems.",

Armed groups are also thought to be responsible for targeted attacks on government and security officials, politicians, tribal and religious leaders, and members of religious and ethnic minorities, among others. Occasionally, local cells manage to coordinate attacks across the country. The number of civilian casualties, though less than at the peak of violence in 2006 and 2007, remains nonetheless significant with around 4,000 civilians killed in both 2010 and 2011, respectively. At least 464 civilians were killed in January 2012, in what appeared to be a surge in mass casualty attacks. Shi\u2019ite civilians have been the most affected. After a short lull in violence, several major attacks across central Iraq were again reported in late February, March and April 2012.",

The number of civilian deaths from suicide attacks and car bombs decreased in 2011 compared to previous years, to an average of 6.6 per day. While these attacks still account for the highest number of civilian deaths each month, the number of civilians killed from gunfire/executions rose to an average of 4.6 per day in 2011. This suggests that an increasing number of Iraqis, especially government and security officials, are being individually targeted. Violence is mostly concentrated in the predominantly Sunni or mixed central governorates of Al-Anbar, Baghdad, Diyala, Ninewa, Kirkuk, and Salah Al-Din, but occasionally moves into the mainly Shi\u2019ite governorates further south. Armed Sunni groups such as Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq and Ansar Al-Islam are thought to be responsible for most of the violence. Shi\u2019ite armed groups have to a large extent been integrated into the ISF [Iraqi security forces] and the political process, though they reportedly maintain their independent military capabilities and at times threaten to use it to further their political agendas. Armed groups target civilians on the basis of their (imputed) political views, religion, ethnicity, social status or a combination of reasons. As a result of the weak law enforcement and justice system, persons at risk of persecution are reportedly unable to find protection or judicial redress. Observers mention undue political influence, the lack of trained legal professionals and corruption as further obstacles to the administration of justice, including in the Kurdistan Region. Legal professionals continue to work in a very difficult security environment, and remain a target of armed groups. Crime is widespread and some armed groups reportedly engage in extortion, kidnappings and armed robberies to fund their other, politically \u2013 or religiously, or ideologically \u2013 motivated activities, conflating acts of persecution and criminality. Consequently, the line between persecution and criminality appears to be increasingly blurred.\u201d",

Since 2006, Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq has claimed to operate under the umbrella of the Islamic State of Iraq. According to US officials, the group has between 800 and 1,000 members in Iraq. It is claimed to be most active in the governorates of Al-Anbar, Baghdad, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa (with Mosul being its major urban stronghold) and Salah Al-Din. But it is also present in Babel and Kerbala, and even further south, as evidenced by occasional attacks for example in Kut, Basrah or Nasseriyah. Unlike other armed groups, Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq has reportedly deliberately targeted Iraqi civilians at large, in particular Shi\u2019ites, apparently with the aim of (re)igniting violence among Iraq\u2019s ethnic and religious groups. Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq claims responsibility for continuous attacks against the Shi\u2019ite population and their places of worship \u2013 including the attack on the Al-Askari shrine in Samarra in February of 2006, which led to widespread sectarian violence between Sunni and Shi\u2019ite armed groups in 2006 and 2007. Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq has also claimed responsibility for attacks against the USF-I, the Iraqi Government, including its political, administrative and security representatives, and anybody considered to be collaborating with either the Government or the USF-I. Persons involved in fighting or openly criticizing Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq risk being killed. As a result of diminished popular support, opposition from the Sahwa forces, increased USF-I/ISF offensives as well as high-profile arrests of leaders, the group was weakened and no longer holds territorial control of vast areas in central Iraq. Over time, Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq is said to have transformed into a mainly \u201chome-grown\u201d terrorist group made up of Iraqi fighters, including those whose views are said to have radicalized after years in detention. Nonetheless, Islamic State of Iraq / Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq remains capable of launching major attacks, including multiple coordinated attacks across the country, and has reportedly resurfaced in former strongholds. While Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq originally fought to expel the MNF-I/USF-I from Iraq, it is said to have shifted its focus to combat the Iraqi Government, which it considers to be controlled by Shi\u2019ite Iran. Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq is reported to finance its activities through extortion, kidnappings for ransom and other criminal activities, especially since funding from abroad has reportedly slowed. Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq professes to pursue a long-term goal of establishing a Sunni Islamic state based on Shari\u2019a law, including by targeting Shi\u2019ites and Sunnis participating in the political process, members of religious minorities, as well as women and men for their behaviour or dress, or professions considered to be \u201cun-Islamic\u201d. Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq is also thought to engage in forcible recruitment, including of women and children, as suicide bombers or for other tasks.\u201d",

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials.

In particular, the Court reiterates that the Migration Board \u2013 with which the Migration Court agreed \u2013 questioned the authenticity of the arrest warrant and the judgment invoked by the applicant, inter alia because of their very simple nature, and considered them to be of very low value as evidence. More importantly, following the communication of the present case, the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad, at the request of the respondent Government, has had the documents examined by the relevant Iraqi court, which found them to be obvious falsifications, pointing out that they deviated from genuine documents in regard to their content, terminology, structure and logos. The applicant has maintained that the documents are genuine, without addressing the evidence presented by the Government. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the documents in question fail to substantiate the applicant\u2019s claim that he has been wanted and later convicted by the Iraqi authorities for trumped up charges of having aided terrorists. Moreover, having regard also to the possible inconsistencies in the applicant\u2019s statements concerning relatives\u2019 membership of the Ba\u2019ath party and their arrests by the present Iraqi government, the Court considers that it has not been shown that he risks persecution or ill-treatment at the hands of that government or other Iraqi authorities.",

The Court reiterates that the Migration Board, while questioning the veracity of some details of the applicant\u2019s story, accepted his claim that his life had been threatened and that he would face a real risk of persecution by al-Qaeda. The Board concluded, however, that the risk was limited to areas of the country where al-Qaeda was strong. While the Court agrees with the Government that the applicant\u2019s general credibility is affected by what has been concluded above in regard to the documents invoked by him, the Court sees no reason to deviate from the Board\u2019s assessment as to the threat posed by al-Qaeda. Accordingly, although the incidents occurred in 2008, five years ago, the applicant may be considered to face a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention at the hands of that organisation if he is returned to Mosul or to other parts of Iraq where it has a strong presence.",

Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight or relocation alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his or her ending up in a part of the country of origin where there is a real risk of illtreatment (Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, \u00a7 266, 28 June 2011, with further references).",

The UNHCR states that single Arab males are likely to be denied entry or to be allowed entry only after a lengthy administrative procedure and heavy interrogation and are usually required to have a sponsor in the region. In its recent country guidance determination in HM and others (\u00a7 37 above), the UK Upper Tribunal reached a somewhat different conclusion, however; it considered the evidence to show that no-one, including Arabs, needed a sponsor to enter or to reside in the KRI. The Danish/UK report (\u00a7\u00a039 above) supports the latter conclusion; it presents evidence to the effect that the entry requirement of having a reference present at the checkpoints was abandoned several years ago. Moreover, several officials had testified to the Danish/UK fact-finding team that all Iraqis irrespective of ethnic origin or religious beliefs were free to enter the KRI. Thousands of persons of Arab origin already lived there. Arabs would normally be required to undergo greater scrutiny than, for instance, Christians, but the procedure was said to be unproblematic and appeared to focus on the entrant having proper identification papers.",

Sweden, for this Court to require that \u2018guarantees\u2019 be in place before deportations can proceed on the basis of internal relocation, is to set a high threshold of evidence in terms of a returnee\u2019s future safety. \u2018Guarantees\u2019 are not synonymous with nor can they be satisfied by mere likelihoods, chances or positive indications. This is rightly so given the seriousness of what is in issue in forcibly returning a person with a clear history of persecution in his home country to a different region therein. It is entirely appropriate that the Court should and has set the bar at the level of \u2018guarantee.\u2019",

This Report was based on a fact finding mission that described the situation as it was in Iraq in November 2011\u2014well over two years ago. The joint authorities then reported that an Arab\u2019s need to provide a reference person at the KRG checkpoint arose \u2018when the situation was more precarious\u2019 and that the requirement to have such a reference person \u2018was abandoned two or three years ago.\u2019 Given the date of the fact-finding mission, one can only deduce that the practice was, allegedly, abandoned in or about 2008/2009 when the \u2018more precarious\u2019 situation of previous years had eased somewhat.",

It is common knowledge that the situation in the country has deteriorated significantly during the last 12 months. 2013 was the worst year for civilian casualties since the height of the war in 2006. Given the rapid escalation in violence and the general volatility in Iraq today, the situation as it stands can only be considered as being, once again, \u2018precarious.\u2019 Thus, to my mind, the fact that the \u2018sponsor\u2019 requirement may have been abandoned by the Kurdish authorities during comparatively safer times, is a rather fragile basis on which to conclude that a person with this applicant\u2019s profile would have little difficulty in gaining admission to the Kurdistan region today.",

On the basis of their own fact-finding mission, those authorities noted that (as of May 2011) \u2018single male Sunni Arabs\u2019 who are without a sponsor are refused entry into the KRG area (\u00a7 38).",
