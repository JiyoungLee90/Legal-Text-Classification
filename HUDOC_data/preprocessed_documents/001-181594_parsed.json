The Khabarovsk Regional Court pointed out that the procedural rights of parties to the proceedings could not be restricted in an arbitrary fashion and that Mr Resin\u2019s exclusion had been incompatible with the position of the Constitutional Court. It ordered a reopening of the civil proceedings. By contrast, the appeal judgment by the Perm Regional Court of 31 May 2017 in case no. 33-5962 dismissed an application for the reopening of proceedings lodged by Mr Davydov, in respect of whom the Court found a similar violation (see Barkov and Others v.

The distinction hinges on the fact that the assessment of whether or not the proposed redress is adequate involves a degree of subjectivity relating to the applicant\u2019s individual situation. The applicant\u2019s position is therefore relevant and important, even if not decisive. By inviting applicants to submit their comments on the declaration, the Court provides them with an opportunity to alert it to any deficiencies in the proposed redress, such as a manifestly insufficient amount or an outstanding undertaking to re-examine the issue at domestic level. Just as with claims under Article\u00a041 of the Convention, the Court normally looks only to the items actually claimed and will not of its own motion consider whether the applicant has been otherwise prejudiced (see Nagmetov v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a035589/08, \u00a7 68, 30 March 2017). This approach is capable of preventing situations such as the one before the Court in the Jeronovi\u010ds case, in which the applicant initially rejected the declaration solely because of an insufficient amount of compensation, but later raised a complaint about the absence of a clause requiring the respondent State to reopen the criminal investigation (see Jeronovi\u010ds v.\u00a0Latvia (dec.), no. 547/02, \u00a7 47, 10 February 2009, and Jeronovi\u010ds [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a023 and 37).",

Accordingly, the Court finds that payment of the specified amount constitutes adequate redress in the particular situation of these applicants. In the light of the above considerations, and in particular given the clear and extensive case-law on the issue, the Court is satisfied that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto does not require it to continue the examination of the applications (Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine), and the applications lodged by Mr Kuznetsov, Mr\u00a0Siverkov and Mr Sulimov should be struck out of its list.

The re-examination of the case would be the most appropriate form of redress in the situation where the violation stemmed from procedural errors or shortcomings of such gravity that a serious doubt was cast on the outcome of the domestic proceedings complained of (see Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a019867/12, \u00a7\u00a7 48-49, ECHR 2017 (extracts), and Davydov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027, both citing the Committee of Ministers\u2019 Recommendation No.\u00a0R(2000)2 to member States on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights).\u00a0The complete exclusion of the applicant from the proceedings to which he was a party without putting in place any counterbalancing arrangements amounts to a breach of the principle of a fair trial and casts doubt on the outcome of the proceedings (see Yevdokimov\u00a0and Others, cited above, \u00a7 52). Russian courts appear to have endorsed that view by acceding to an applicant\u2019s request for the reopening of proceedings following the Court\u2019s finding of a violation (see the Khabarovsk Regional Court\u2019s appeal judgment in paragraph 14 above). The Court finds no reason to hold otherwise and finds that, were a violation of the Convention alleged in the present case to be established, the appropriate form of redress would be to provide the applicants with a possibility to apply for the reopening of proceedings. It is however important to reiterate that making use of that possibility does not prejudge a domestic court\u2019s decision on whether such a reopening should be granted on the facts of the specific case, having regard to the principle of res judicata or legal certainty in civil litigation, in particular where such litigation concerned private parties with their own legitimate interests to be protected (see Davydov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a029; Bochan v.

The Court has previously refused unilateral declarations if the right to apply for reopening of domestic proceedings was not guaranteed in domestic law (see Hakimi v. Belgium, no. 665/08, \u00a7 29, 29 June 2010; \u0160ari\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Croatia, nos. 38767/07 et al., \u00a7\u00a7 26-29, 18\u00a0October 2011; Rozhin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 50098/07, \u00a7\u00a7 23-25, 6 December 2011; Vojt\u011bchov\u00e1 v.\u00a0Slovakia, no.\u00a059102/08, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28, 25 September 2012; Davydov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 23-32, and Aviakompaniya A.T.I., ZAT, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037). The Court is satisfied that the finding of a violation in a Court judgment is considered under Russian law of civil procedure a \u201cnew circumstance\u201d warranting examination of an application for the reopening of civil proceedings (see Article 392 \u00a7 4(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure cited in paragraph 10 above). It is also satisfied that there appears to be an established practice of considering applications for the reopening of proceedings after the Court has found a violation in cases similar to the present one (see the case-law cited in paragraph 14 above). The situation is different, however, with regard to unilateral declarations or a decision by the Court to strike a case out of its list. Russian law contains no provision allowing for the reopening of domestic proceedings further to a declaration by the Government or a Court decision striking the case out of its list (see Rozhin, cited above, \u00a7 23). The domestic courts accordingly consider applications for the reopening of proceedings inadmissible in the absence of a Court judgment on the merits or a finding of a violation (see paragraph 13 above). The Government conceded as much, indicating that unilateral declarations would not be an acceptable way of settling similar cases, as they do not furnish a legal basis for applying for the reopening of proceedings (see paragraph 44 below). In these circumstances, the Court finds that a unilateral declaration or a Court decision approving it does not provide the same assured access to a procedure allowing for examination of the question of the reopening of domestic proceedings as a Court judgment would (see Aviakompaniya A.T.I., ZAT, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

This issue is not new and has been the subject of well-established case-law. Since one of the first judgments finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Kovalev v. Russia, no.\u00a078145/01, \u00a7\u00a7 30-38, 10 May 2007), the Court has highlighted the widespread nature of the problem in more than a hundred cases in which Russian courts had refused to secure the attendance of imprisoned applicants wishing to take part in hearings on their civil claims (see the cases listed in Yevdokimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 32). Russia\u2019s highest courts \u2013 the Constitutional Court and the Plenary Supreme Court \u2013 have directed their attention to the issue on several occasions, providing specific indications on how to secure the rights of incarcerated litigants within the framework of the existing legislation and how to comply with the requirements of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 12-15). In 2016, the Court adopted a leading judgment consolidating its approach to the problem and traced its origin to an apparent deficiency in the Russian legal system, which makes no provision for detainees\u2019 participation in civil proceedings (see Yevdokimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 60). The number of incoming applications that are prima facie admissible went down in 2016 and 2017. However, the main reason for that development appears to be the Court\u2019s decision to recognise that the two-tier cassation in civil proceedings is an effective remedy that needs to be exhausted (see Abramyan and Others v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), nos.\u00a038951/13 and 59611/13, 12 May 2015). Nevertheless, in the last two years the Court has processed approximately fifty such applications, of which two thirds were lodged in 2017. Noting that the legislative framework has not evolved at the domestic level and that Russian courts have not followed the directions given by the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, the Court finds that the actions based on defective legislation and inconsistent judicial practice amount to a structural problem which gives rise to repetitive applications.",

It has also reiterated that the existing situation calls for the adoption of general measures by the respondent State, which remains, subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (ibid., \u00a7\u00a060).

The Court also holds that the situation in the present case does not call for the adoption of general measures. I respectfully disagree with this conclusion and argue that this case was a missed opportunity to adopt a pilot-judgment approach, through which the Court could have provided the respondent Government with concrete indications on how the structural and systemic problem should be resolved. Adopting a pilot judgment would have been in line with previous case-law, would have helped the Court to deal with the large number of pending and incoming cases and would have aided the Committee of Ministers in examining the execution of these judgments.",

In Burdov v. Russia (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, \u00a7\u00a0122, ECHR 2009), for example, the applicants claimed that long delays in the enforcement of judgments awarded in their favour violated the Convention.

Both the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court have provided lower courts with directions on how to solve the structural problem (see paragraph 47 of the judgment). The pilot judgment would simply have turned these suggestions into concrete indications that the Russian Government would then have been required to implement. Rather than waiting and hoping that the respondent Government would follow the suggestions, the Court could have indicated more concrete solutions. A particular feature of the Russian legal system is that the rules of civil procedure stipulate that proceedings must be concluded orally (Article\u00a0157 of the Code of Civil Procedure), and make no provision for dispensing with an oral hearing or conducting the proceedings in writing (Articles 155, 327 (currently in force) and 350 (formerly in force) of the Code of Civil Procedure; see also Yevdokimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027). The right to be present in person is not, in principle, subject to any formalities and parties need not seek leave from the court to appear in order to attend a hearing (see Yevdokimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 28). These rules prevent Russian courts from adjudicating any claims or disputes without holding a hearing and grant all parties a right to attend and to make submissions to the bench orally (ibid., \u00a7\u00a030). Nevertheless, despite this structural feature of the Russian legal system, it would not be impossible to find a practical solution to ensure that all individuals have an opportunity to present their case orally. Making oral submissions before a court does not necessarily mean that a party must physically be present in the courtroom. Alternative measures, such as video-conferencing where distance or security issues make hearings in person particularly difficult, could ensure that the applicants\u2019 rights are upheld and could provide some flexibility to the domestic courts.",
