He did not behave aggressively or swear at them. The applicant spoke with the officers. He did not remember exactly what they talked about, except that it concerned a knife and that the applicant said that he did not have one.

The police officers who found the applicant and M.Z. at the playground had been given information about two men, one of whom was possibly carrying a knife, while the other one was reportedly drunk and walking with difficulty. At the playground, the applicant behaved aggressively and used obscene language. Officer E.V. tried to talk to the applicant, but the applicant acted in an erratic manner, and started waving his hands around and shouting at the officers. Officer E.V. decided to force him to the ground and keep him there until a police patrol vehicle arrived. He handcuffed the applicant with the help of two police officers, S.J. and N.S., who had arrived by car. While he was being kept on the ground, the applicant attempted to get up, kicked out and continued to utter obscenities at the officers. The police officers did not use excessive force against him and did not beat him. The applicant continued to resist the police while he was being put into a police van, which was last to arrive and was carrying Officers S.T. and J.S. Some force therefore had to be used to get the applicant in the van. In the course of that process, the applicant hit his left temple against the door of the van. The applicant also remained aggressive during his transportation. The officers on the front seats of the van heard what sounded like something being pounded against another object from the back compartment.",

He was lying on the floor with his hands cuffed. When he attempted to stand up, S.B. kneed him in the area of his left ear. When the applicant tried to sit on a chair, he was knocked off his feet and ordered to sit on the floor. After E.V. left the room, S.B., who had on black leather gloves, started systematically punching and kicking the applicant. The applicant stood up and fell over several times. At one point, he was taken to the toilet, the sink tap was turned on and his head was put under the water. He was then taken back to the detention room. While passing the detention cells, he asked those inside whether they would confirm anything they had seen or heard. In the detention room, the applicant sat on the chair and S.B. punched him again several times. When E.V. returned, the applicant was knocked off the chair and beaten again on every part of his body. S.B. continued beating him after E.V. left the room. The applicant lost consciousness for a while and when he came around he had blood on his face and was eventually put on the chair. His handcuffs were removed and he was allowed to go to the toilet, where he washed himself. He returned to the detention room and was then placed in a cell to sober up. After a while, an ambulance came and he was taken to a hospital in the company of different policemen. He had blood on his clothes, but he threw away the T-shirt, while his mother washed his trousers.",

As he did not obey orders to calm down and stay still, physical force had to be used to make him sit or to place him on the floor. When he began to calm down, he was placed on a chair with his hands cuffed. He suddenly lost his balance and fell off the chair face down. The police officers lifted him up and put him back on the chair. Shortly after, the applicant again fell on the floor. In the interests of the applicant\u2019s safety, the officers left him sitting on the floor. The police removed the applicant\u2019s handcuffs as soon as he calmed down.

The applicant reacted quite violently, and started arguing and waving his hands around. E.V. therefore used the radio to call for assistance to have the applicant removed so he could sober up. Meanwhile, the elderly man had approached and told the applicant to calm down because he was dealing with police officers. The applicant replied that he did not care and started throwing money on the ground, telling the man to keep it. The man picked the money up, said he did not need it and put it back in the applicant\u2019s pockets. By that time, S.B. had gone after M.Z. E.V. attempted to calm the applicant down, but he continued to walk back and forth, waving his hands around and uttering obscenities. E.V. decided to handcuff the applicant because there were a lot of children around. The applicant was also clearly being aggressive and might have hurt other people, particularly given the possible presence of a knife. As the applicant did not let E.V. handcuff him, he forced the applicant to the ground, but did not hit him. Officers N.S. and S.J. arrived and helped in handcuffing the applicant and then took him to the police car, which was 10 metres away. The applicant did not have a knife. E.V. had no further contact with the applicant at the playground.

The exact cause of those injuries could not be established as their description in the documents was not sufficiently detailed. Nevertheless, the expert concluded that they had been inflicted shortly before the applicant had seen a doctor, possibly on 29 April 2009. He also noted that as there were no detailed descriptions of the injuries to the upper limbs, it was not possible to conclude whether those injuries had been received in self-defence. None of the documents disclosed any information about the ethanol content in the applicant\u2019s blood, but stated simply that the applicant had been in a state of alcoholic intoxication.",

He had not reacted to the orders given by the police officers. Police Officer E.V. had decided to put handcuffs on the applicant given that children were standing around, that the applicant was clearly of an aggressive state of mind, that he might have injured others and that there was a certain context to the call (the suspicion of carrying a knife). At that moment Officers N.S. and S.J. had arrived and helped to put the handcuffs on. The applicant had not complied with the officers\u2019 orders to stay still and calm down, but had started kicking the police vehicle. N.S. and S.J. had kept the applicant on the ground to restrain him. The applicant had continued to resist, use foul language and behave aggressively. Because of his aggressive behaviour, E.V. had been forced to call for a police van to transport the applicant to the police station. The applicant had resisted being put in the police van and had continued to behave aggressively and use foul language while being transported.

The Government argued that in the applicant\u2019s case it had been proven that his mother, at whose address the applicant was living, had received the letter containing the decision before the date the applicant claimed to have received it himself. In the Court\u2019s view, in both cases the issue was whether the authorities had proven that a decision had been received on a certain date, which would serve as the starting point for the calculation of the time-limit for submitting an appeal. Before the Supreme Court the authorities sought to prove their case by relying on calculations based on the deadlines for mail delivery as declared by the postal service operator, but the court rejected that argument. The prosecutor\u2019s office put forward the same arguments in the applicant\u2019s case. In that context it is irrelevant whether they were used to support the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s mother had received the letter before a certain date or that the applicant himself ought to have received it before that date. What counts is that the prosecutors were not able to prove the exact date the applicant received the decision in a situation where they had not served the decision by registered mail, as they were required to do, and where the applicant denied having received it on the date suggested by the authorities. The failure to serve the decision by registered mail made it in practice impossible for the authorities to challenge the applicant\u2019s statement that he received the decision on 5 March 2010.",

He had therefore no reason to believe that he had not submitted the appeal on time and needed to seek the restoration of the time-limit. In any event, the Court considers that it would have been futile to request that the time-limit be restored. According to the domestic case-law which the Government themselves referred to, the time-limit could only have been restored if the person had not been able to submit the appeal owing to external circumstances beyond his or her control, or because of some extraordinary personal circumstance, such as serious illness, temporary mental disorder and so forth.

Two witnesses (Y.B., who had witnessed the arrest, and A.D., who had been present at the police station) had never been interviewed, despite the fact that the applicant had on several occasions explained to the police that they had seen the events.

That had been due to the applicant\u2019s active resistance to his arrest, being placed in the police vehicle and his refusal to obey orders at the police station. Notably, the haematoma and oedema on the left temple could have been caused when the applicant had hit his head against the door of the police van when he had resisted being transported to the police station, when he had hit himself against the internal walls of the police van during his transportation or when he had fallen off the chair at the police station. The oedema of the right wrist could be explained by his resistance to the police while being handcuffed. However, the bodily harm in question was minor and of a temporary nature. Regarding the haematoma around the left eye and the haematomas on the upper limbs recorded for the first time on 1 May 2009, their origin remained unclear. It could not be excluded that the applicant had hurt himself after being released from the police station, especially because he had also been in a state of intoxication the day after his release. In any event, the applicant\u2019s injuries were inconsistent with his allegation that the police officers had punched and kicked him all over his body for several hours. Some weight should also be given to Officer E.V.\u2019s opinion that the applicant had intentionally caused the injuries in order later to accuse the police. Health issues discovered later could not be presumed to have been caused by the police.",

The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7 83, and the case-law cited therein). In particular, where an individual, when taken into police custody, is in good health, but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v. France, 27 August 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 108-11, Series A no. 241\u2011A, and Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 87). In the absence of such an explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government (see, among other authorities, El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 152).

Even after the complaint was finally accepted for submission, the police did not formally open an investigation into the incident until 5 May 2009, when six days had gone by (see paragraph 18 above). The Government justified that delay by saying that the complaint had been lodged the day before a public holiday and just before the weekend. The Court considers that weekends and public holidays cannot serve as an excuse for unacceptable delays in carrying out an effective investigation, as required under Article 3 of the Convention. In any event, there is no evidence in the case file of any investigative activity between 6 May 2009 when, according to the Government, the police asked the hospital to provide the applicant\u2019s medical records, and 13 May 2009 when the applicant gave a statement as a victim two weeks after the complaint had been lodged.",

The Court has noted that delays in questioning the potential perpetrators of a crime constitute a serious challenge to the effectiveness of an investigation, especially when there is a risk of justice being obstructed through collusion, which is particularly acute in a situation of hierarchical subordination and common service, such as that of police officers (see Antayev and Others v. Russia, no. 37966/07, \u00a7 108, 3 July 2014). In the past the Court has found a violation of the Convention where the alleged perpetrators were not kept separate after the incident, and were not questioned for nearly three days, notwithstanding the fact that no evidence indicated any collusion among them or with their colleagues. As indicated above (\u00a7 108), the Court found that the mere fact that appropriate steps were not taken to reduce the risk of such collusion amounted to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation. In the present case, the Court is unaware of any measure taken by the authorities to reduce the risk of collusion among the alleged perpetrators or with the other police officers. The delays in taking statements from the police officers therefore greatly increased the risk of collusion between the suspects and among other police officers who served as witnesses.",

Even the assessment of the applicant\u2019s medical records and certain other documents by a forensic medical expert was ordered more than a month and delivered more than three months after the criminal proceedings were opened (see paragraphs 37 and 42 above). The Court emphasises that a forensic medical examination should have been ordered as soon as the applicant had alleged ill-treatment. The failure to do so made it almost impossible to determine exactly what injuries the applicant had sustained and how he had got them and whether his complaint about the loss of vision in his left eye (see paragraph 87 above) was related to his alleged illtreatment.",

The Court considers that that hindered the possibility for the applicant to substantiate his claims of ill-treatment and comment on the findings of the assessment. Turning to the content of the expert\u2019s opinion, the expert insisted both in writing and subsequently in his oral statements that the haematoma around the left eye could have been caused between 29 April and 1 May 2009. On the basis of that information the police investigator concluded that the applicant\u2019s allegation that the haematoma had resulted from the incident at the police station on 29 April was completely baseless and did not conform to reality.

By the time the photographs were presented for identification there was no longer any doubt about the identity of the possible suspects. It was clear that E.V. and S.B. were the officers who had responded to the call about an alleged breach of the peace. It was equally clear that the applicant and M.Z. accused those officers of beating the applicant at the scene of the arrest and later in the police station and, even more importantly, the suspects themselves never denied that they had been the ones who had used force on the applicant. Be that as it may, the time between the incident and the identification might have affected the results of the identification process. The outcome might have also been influenced by the fact that the investigator presented photographs for the identification of the suspects instead of holding an identification parade with real people.

In essence, she was investigating the activities of her colleagues. The investigation therefore lacked the necessary appearance of independence as it was carried out by a police officer institutionally linked to those targeted by it (compare, among others, \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 v.

Following a merger and reform of the Police Board and the Border Guard Board on 1 January 2010, her job title had changed to senior disciplinary officer of the III department of the internal control bureau of the Police and Border Guard Board. That meant that the police investigator\u2019s post in the organisational structure had been transferred from a regional level to the central administration. However, by that time the investigative measures had already been taken and the investigation had in substance been finished. Simply changing the police investigator\u2019s position within the organisational structure could not therefore have influenced the potential undermining of the independence of the present investigation.",

It is true that the Court has found that shortcomings in the independence of those carrying out an investigation could, to a certain extent, be counterbalanced by effective supervision of the investigation (see, among others, Vovru\u0161ko v. Latvia, no. 11065/02, \u00a7 51, 11 December 2012). However, the Court held in Kummer (cited above, \u00a7 87) that while the prosecutor was independent from the police, his role as a mere supervisor was not sufficient to make the police investigation comply with the requirement of independence. In the present case there is no evidence of active participation by prosecutors in directing or supervising the investigation which could have counterbalanced shortcomings in its independence. On the contrary, the Court observes that the prosecutors\u2019 position was tainted by the unlawful refusal to admit the applicant\u2019s initial complaint (see paragraph 114 above). There were also several dismissals by the prosecutor, on purely formal grounds, of the applicant\u2019s requests to take certain, apparently justifiable, investigative measures, which in the end were never taken, including a forensic medical examination of the applicant in person (see paragraph 116 above) and an examination of Y.B. and A.D. as witnesses (see paragraph 118 above)). Additionally, the prosecution dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 54 above). The Court therefore cannot accept that the prosecutors\u2019 role in the present case guaranteed an independent investigation, as required under its case-law.",
