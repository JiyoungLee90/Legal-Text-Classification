The Government pointed out that, although the investigations in the instant case had been governed by the provisions of the 1945 ordinance, the new procedural arrangements laid down in the ordinance of 1 December 1986 had been applied, so that the applicant companies had been able to avail themselves of the newly established judicial remedies to complain of the manner in which the inspections had been conducted. They argued that the current rules distinguished between ordinary investigative powers and powers requiring prior authorisation by a judge. It followed from sections 47 and 48 of the 1986 ordinance, taken together, that the inspectors' right of unannounced access could be exercised only in respect of business premises, and for the sole purpose of inspecting documents. The DGCCRF officials' power to enter business premises and seize documents was subject to authorisation in the form of an order by a judge of the ordinary courts, against which an appeal lay to the Court of Cassation. Such operations were supervised by the judge.",

The inspectors in the instant case had gone to the applicant companies' premises and had exercised a general right to inspect documents in accordance with the provisions of section 15 of Ordinance no. 45-1484 of 30 June 1945. The aim had been to obtain documents in connection with an administrative investigation into anti-competitive practices for which only fines and not criminal penalties could be imposed. Determining what action to take in the light of the DGCCRF's investigations and imposing fines had been entrusted to an independent administrative authority, the Competition Council, which was responsible for monitoring compliance with legislation on trade and industry. The procedure was a special one, even though it complied with the adversarial principle and remained subject to review by the judges of the Court of Appeal. In the instant case both the Paris Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation had taken the view that the administrative investigation had not given rise to any searches or coercive measures.",

Relying on the additional observations submitted by the Minister for Economic Affairs in reply to their pleadings alleging a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, they inferred that the minister made no distinction between the right of inspection and the right of search, since he had referred to the judicial supervision introduced by section 48 of the ordinance of 1\u00a0December 1986, which applied solely to \u201csearches of any premises\u201d \u2013 that is to say, either house searches or general searches. They concluded that both the minister and his department, to which the inspectors were answerable, regarded the right of inspection (section 15) and the right of search (section 16) as an indivisible whole. Besides, the fact that the precise nature of the operations was in question showed that the inspectors' powers were not subject to any safeguards or limits whatsoever. The inspectors' reports had described the \u201cseizure\u201d of documents without indicating whether the documents had been obtained by exercising the right of inspection or the right of search; no safeguards had been in place in either case. They observed that in the absence of any judicial supervision of the operations, it had been possible for the inspectors to switch at any time from exercising the right of inspection to exercising the right of search. Lastly, they argued that the reference in the judgments of the Paris Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation to the absence of coercion was purely theoretical. Since inspectors had the power and the practical opportunity to make searches, even where they merely availed themselves of their right of inspection, they did so with the underlying threat of a possible search.

The new supervisory measures laid down in the ordinance were linked to the requirement of prior judicial authorisation in the form of an order.

The possibility of ex post facto review stemmed from a court order which could be challenged by means of an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation.

Lastly, the fact that the applicants were companies was particularly irrelevant as the items seized in the instant case had included not only business documents but also employees' personal papers (handwritten notes and extracts from diaries recording personal appointments).

Moreover, the inspections in issue took place without any prior warrant being issued by a judge and without a senior police officer being present (ibid., mutatis mutandis, p. 25, \u00a7 57, p. 63, \u00a7 40, and p. 90, \u00a7\u00a038, respectively).

It had been during that very period that the inspections in issue had been carried out. The applicant companies further stated that no advice had been issued to the inspectors to exercise a minimum of caution. Having regard to the proceedings after the case had been remitted to the Paris Court of Appeal, the applicant companies argued that that court had not drawn the necessary inferences from the observations submitted by the minister in reply to their pleadings alleging a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. In their submission, the minister's reasoning should logically have led the court to find, in the light of Funke, Cr\u00e9mieux and Miailhe (no. 1), that there had been a violation of Article 8 and therefore to set aside the investigation proceedings. The Paris Court of Appeal's finding that only the right of inspection had been exercised in the instant case had therefore been made proprio motu and was a statement of principle which did not follow from any of the material before it. The applicant companies considered that the judicial authorities had \u201csalvaged\u201d the proceedings in disregard of the Court's case-law. In practical terms, the actions complained of had resulted in the following fines for the applicant companies: 5,000,000 French francs (FRF) for Colas Est, FRF 3,000,000 for Colas Sud-Ouest and FRF 6,000,000 for Sacer.",

In their submission, the fines had been intended to punish proven anti-competitive practices and there was no evidence to suggest that if the inspections carried out at the applicant companies' offices had taken place within a different legal framework, the outcome of the proceedings would not have been exactly the same and a penalty would not have been imposed. They therefore argued that the applicant companies' claims under this head must be dismissed as no causal link had been established between the alleged violation, the circumstances in which the inspection of the companies' offices had been carried out and the damage complained of. Accordingly, they submitted that the finding of a violation would be sufficient to make good any damage sustained by the applicant companies. They pointed out that in Cr\u00e9mieux, which had been relied on by the applicant companies and had concerned a similar complaint, the Court had held that the finding of a violation constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction.
