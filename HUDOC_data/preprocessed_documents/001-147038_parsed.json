She opted to lodge a complaint with the prosecutor\u2019s office, asking it to institute criminal proceedings against the alleged perpetrators. Consequently, even if it were correct that her choice had fallen on a remedy less suited than others to her particular circumstances, this would be of no moment (see, mutatis mutandis, Airey v.\u00a0Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 23, Series A no. 32).
