By lodging her application with the Court the applicant was complaining of a situation in which she had already been for some time and which seemed set to last. In these circumstances, any subsequent developments in the criminal proceedings against her would not have affected the core of the matter underlying her complaint under the Convention, because a significant period of her detention had already taken place. Accordingly, the Court is unable to find that a lack of information about further extensions of the applicant\u2019s detention and her conviction could have had a decisive influence on its judgment, or could have prevented it from ruling on the case (see Kalinin v.\u00a0Russia [Committee], no.\u00a054749/12, \u00a7\u00a7 18-21, 19 February 2015).
