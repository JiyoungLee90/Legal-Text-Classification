However, the Court also held that the effectiveness of a remedy to accelerate proceedings may depend on whether it has a significant effect on the length of the proceedings as a whole (see Holzinger, cited above, \u00a7 22). Thus, where proceedings include a substantial period during which there is no possibility to accelerate them by making a request under Section 91, such remedy cannot be considered effective (see mutatis mutandis, Holzinger (no. 2) v. , no. 28898/95, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22).",

Section 91 of the Courts Act does not provide an effective remedy against delays caused by these administrative authorities. Also the delay in the trial after the hearing was adjourned on 19 October 2004 was unlikely to have been effectively remedied by a request under Section 91 of the Courts Act. On the basis of the file it appears that the delay was linked to the difficulties in summoning the witnesses living abroad. There is no indication that the court remained inactive. Attempts to summon the witnesses were made, a hearing was scheduled for 13 October 2005 but had to be cancelled. In these specific circumstances the Court considers that the applicant was not required to make use of the remedy provided for by Section 91 of the Courts Act.",
