The applicant had initiated constitutional proceedings almost five years after the constitutional appeal had been incorporated in the legal system of the country. Moreover, the applicant should have submitted a new request for payment of his pension following the changes to the pension system in January 2012, when the Fund took over the payment of military pensions even for those military beneficiaries who did not receive their pension from the Military Fund (including the present applicant) in accordance with the Succession Agreement. The Fund had acted of its own motion after it had learned of the applicant\u2019s case before this Court. It is still open to the applicant to initiate civil proceedings seeking compensation for unpaid pension in accordance with the general rules of liability for damage caused by the competent authorities, provided he can prove that they were acting unlawfully in his case. In this connection the Government submitted that, in a few other cases similar to the present, plaintiffs had been successful in obtaining damages in civil proceedings (see paragraph 32 above).",

In the applicant\u2019s case, on the other hand, the Supreme Court twice remitted the case to the administrative bodies for reconsideration, and instructed them to apply the Succession Agreement.

From 2 June 2004 onwards the respondent State had assumed responsibility for the payment of military pensions to its citizens with dual nationality who resided in its territory. The present applicant clearly belongs to this category. While he had requested that his pension be paid from the Military Fund starting from 1 April 2004, the Court reiterates that this responsibility was established only with effect from 2 June 2004. The refusal of the competent administrative bodies to reinstate payment of the applicant\u2019s pension undoubtedly amounted to an interference with his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions for the purposes of the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

In a decision of 30 December 2009 the Appeals Commission found that since the applicant had residence in Croatia on 2 June 2004, when the Succession Agreement entered into force, the Croatian Pension Fund was solely responsible for the payment of his pension (see paragraph 22 above). However, this argument does not have any support in the facts of the case drawn from the case-file, and, indeed, the Government did not argue the contrary. Moreover, the payment of the applicants\u2019 pension from the Croatian Pension Fund was terminated on 31\u00a0March 2004, precisely because he no longer lived in Croatia.",
