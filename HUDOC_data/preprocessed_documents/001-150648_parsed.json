In addition, he complained that the prosecutor\u2019s decision had completely failed to mention certain crucial elements, in particular the severity of the injuries inflicted by the State agents on the victims. Furthermore, the number of days of recommended medical treatment in the medical reports could not be relied on when determining the seriousness of the injuries suffered by the victims.

The incident reportedly began when a police officer alleged that he had been assaulted by two Romani men. Shortly afterwards, a violent altercation broke out after plain-clothes police officers and masked Special Forces police officers arrived at the Apalina district, reportedly to serve two subpoenas. The police claimed they were attacked by several Roma using rocks, metal bars and pitchforks. The Roma claimed that Special Forces officers provoked the violence by using excessive force, including by firing rubber bullets and tear gas. The initial police investigation cleared the officers of any wrongdoing. In November, following a visit by two members of the European Parliament, the General Police Inspectorate opened a preliminary investigation into the incident. The investigation was continuing at the end of the year.\u201d",

However, according to the statements of all the State agents involved, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood started gathering in the street only upon the arrival of the police vehicles. Moreover, the officers from the Mure\u015f County police declared that they had not been aware that the Roma from Apalina might commit violent acts (see paragraph 28 above). In addition, the Government submitted no information as to whether the police had reason to suspect that the people from Apalina might be armed with firearms or whether the two suspects were considered to be extremely dangerous criminals. On this point it must be noted that, in the course of the investigation that followed, the criminal records of some of the Roma victims were checked, and none of them were found to have any previous convictions for serious offences (see paragraph 24 above).",

This conclusion results from the statement of prosecutor A.A. given at the disciplinary proceedings against A.M. (see paragraph 66 above). In this context, the Court notes that the Government did not submit any information regarding any preparatory meeting or plan with a view to conducting a secure and successful operation on 7 September 2006. Moreover, no arguments were put forward to suggest that the operation had been urgent, which might have justified the absence of preparation owing to a lack of time. Consequently, the Court considers that the authorities should have foreseen that on seeing several police vehicles and the special forces officers wearing masks, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood would gather in the street, as this would have been an unusual thing to happen in a small town.",

In this respect the Court observes that, when the decision to deploy special forces was taken, the authorities were not certain that a crime had indeed been committed and had no reasons to believe that the two suspects - or any other inhabitant of the neighbourhood - were armed or dangerous so as to require the intervention of a police force specially trained for interaction with terrorists and extremely dangerous and armed criminals.
