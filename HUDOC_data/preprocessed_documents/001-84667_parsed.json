Nevertheless, it must be stressed at the outset that this particular evidential criterion has an autonomous meaning in the Court's proceedings (see Mathew v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, no. 24919/03, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2005); it has never been the Court's purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 147, ECHR\u00a02005VII). Thus, according to the Court's established caselaw, in the absence of direct evidence, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (ibid. and the cases cited therein). The level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (ibid.).",

Noting that Mr Aygan named the alleged killer of the applicant's son and gave details of the alleged killing and the location where the body was buried, the Court disagrees with the Government that the allegations were vague.

This inability follows directly from the respondent Government's failure to carry out an investigation into the applicant's allegations. The Court finds it more appropriate to deal with the consequences of this failure when examining the applicant's complaint concerning the Government's alleged failure to protect his son's right to life (see paragraphs 70-84 below).",

The Court points out that in the cases referred to by the applicant in support of this argument (Akkum and Others and \u00c7elikbilek \u2013 see paragraph 38 above), the Court was unable to establish the facts on account of the Government's failure to submit to it a number of crucial documents.

Mr Osmano\u011flu's whereabouts were not known by the authorities. It was not even clear whether he was dead or not. Thus the only action that the authorities could reasonably have been expected to take was to conduct an investigation into the circumstances of his disappearance and establish whether or not he was dead, and if he were not, to find out where he was.",

He was a member of HADEP and was allegedly involved in PKK activities. Before his abduction he was receiving threats from the police, the Governor and the Mayor. By contrast, in the present case Mr Osmano\u011flu was not a political figure; he was not involved in any PKK-related activity.
