Thus, Article 6 \u2013 especially paragraph 3 thereof \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 275; \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2005IV; Salduz v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2008). The Court further recalls that the guarantees in paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of this provision which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings (Martin v. Estonia, no. 35985/09, \u00a7 94, 30 May 2013).
