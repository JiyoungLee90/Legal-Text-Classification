As to the conduct of the national courts, the Court considers that it cannot be said that they have been inactive during the proceedings. The main issue that affected the length of the proceedings was whether the enforcement had been admissible in view of the validity of the contract. In this connection, the Court observes that the first-instance court advised the debtor to challenge the admissibility of the enforcement only on 22\u00a0November 2005. It sees no reason why did it take that long for the first-instance court to do so given that that issue had been first raised in the debtor\u2019s objection of 16 February 1999 (see paragraph 15 above). Moreover, the proceedings lay dormant for two years and five months pending the outcome of the legality review proceedings (see paragraph 9 above).",
