The Court of Appeal confirmed the Regional Court\u2019s assessment that the text in the leaflet implied that the plaintiffs performed unlawful actions. This was not called into question by the further explanations, as the average reader could not be expected to draw the distinction between the act of abortion which was justified under Article 218a \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and the act of abortion which was merely exempt from prosecution under Article 218a \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 26 below). Seen from a layman\u2019s point of view, the text of the leaflet created the impression that the act of abortion, as permitted by the German legislator, amounted to unlawful homicide, or even to murder.

If the expression of opinion was part of a debate on matters of public interest, there was an assumption militating in favour of freedom of expression. However, in the instant case the applicant had created a massive \u201cpillory effect\u201d by singling out the plaintiffs, who had not given the applicant any reason to do so. The performance of abortions was criticised with harsh and rigid words. This was further aggravated by the Holocaust reference.

Although the assessment and interpretation of the factual background of a case is primarily a matter for the domestic courts, the Court, in the particular circumstances of the present case and also bearing in mind the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 8 June 2010 (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above) dealing with almost identical questions, is convinced that the mere fact that the additional explanation had not been visually highlighted does not imply that a reasonable person with ordinary awareness would assume that the abortions were performed outside the legal conditions and were forbidden in a stricter sense of criminal liability. With regard to the impact of the additional explanation, the Court also reiterates that it was directly attached to the first part of the applicant\u2019s statement and thus immediately accessible to the reader. Therefore, the facts of the present case have to be distinguished from those underlying the applicant\u2019s prior applications which the Court found to be manifestly ill-founded (see Annen v.

The Court also points out that the applicant\u2019s campaign contributed to a highly controversial debate of public interest. There can be no doubt as to the acute sensitivity of the moral and ethical issues raised by the question of abortion or as to the importance of the public interest at stake (see A, B and C v.\u00a0Ireland [GC], no. 25579/05, \u00a7 233, ECHR 2010). Although the Government pointed out that the doctors, as a consequence of negative public attention, had closed the day clinic and had built up another professional practice, it is not clear from their allegations whether the applicant\u2019s activities actually caused this development. In this respect, the Court further notes that the doctors did not lodge a claim for compensation with the civil courts due to the negative impact on their business.",

The reference to the Holocaust must also be seen in the specific context of German history (see Hoffer and Annen v. Germany, nos. 397/07 and\u00a02322/07, \u00a7 48, 13 January 2011, and PETA Deutschland v. Germany, no.\u00a043481/09, \u00a7 49, 8 November 2012). However, given the very wording of the leaflet, the Court cannot agree with the domestic courts\u2019 interpretation that the applicant had compared the doctors and their professional activities to the Nazi regime. In fact, the applicant\u2019s statement according to which the killing of human beings in Auschwitz had been unlawful, but allowed, and had not been subject to criminal liability under the Nazi regime, may also be understood as a way of creating awareness of the more general fact that law may diverge from morality. Although the Court is aware of the subtext of the applicant\u2019s statement, which was further intensified by the reference to the webpage \u201cwww.babycaust.de\u201d, it observes that the applicant did not \u2013 at least not explicitly \u2013 equate abortion with the Holocaust. Thus, the Court is not convinced that the prohibition of disseminating the leaflets was justified by a violation of the doctors\u2019 personality rights due to the Holocaust reference alone.",

The United States Supreme Court has recently invalidated a Massachusetts statute that prevented pro-life activists from campaigning within a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics, whilst the petitioners in that case were merely offering women information about alternatives to abortion. It could be perfectly legitimate to distribute leaflets and run a website criticising abortion as a phenomenon, which the applicant continues to do, but in the present case the actions prohibited by the domestic judicial authorities were limited to the continued destruction of the professional reputation of two doctors.",
