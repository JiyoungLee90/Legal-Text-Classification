Referring, inter alia, to Court of Cassation decision no.\u00a015138, it stated first of all that the legislative provisions in question were the result of cultural and legal change aimed at recognising gender identity as a component of the right to personal identity. Interpreting the absence of an explicit indication of the means of altering a person\u2019s sexual characteristics in the light of fundamental human rights, it added that such absence meant that surgical treatment was not a requirement for the purpose of obtaining a change of legal gender status, as it was only one of the possible treatments that could be used in order to alter a person\u2019s appearance.",
