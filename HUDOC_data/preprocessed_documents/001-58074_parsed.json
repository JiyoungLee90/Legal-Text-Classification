Their objection was formulated in two limbs. In the first limb the Government maintained that under section 36 of Royal Decree no. 267 of 16 March 1942 (\"the royal decree\") there existed a possibility, even for the bankrupt, to complain to the bankruptcy judge, not only in respect of the measures taken by the liquidator but also on account of the latter's inactivity. The applicants could therefore have asked the bankruptcy judge to take a more active part in the two sets of proceedings and to do his utmost to accelerate them. Under the second limb the Government contended that the applicants could also have demanded - by virtue of the same provision - that the bankruptcy judge terminate the bankruptcy proceedings without waiting for the outcome of the two sets of proceedings contesting the statement of liabilities. In that event the judge could have, and would have had to, set aside, when determining the final distribution of the assets deriving from the sale of goods, a specified sum intended to meet, if necessary, the debts claimed by the plaintiff creditors. These remedies were, the Government argued, available, effective and extremely rapid, as the bankruptcy judge could decide the matter in a few weeks by a simple reasoned decision and an appeal lay against his decisions to the district court.",

It is in exercising that function that he authorises the liquidator to join proceedings concerning objections to the statement of liabilities and he should intervene, even of his own motion, where the liquidator acts too slowly. In addition, although the case-law cited by the Government at the hearing shows that in some cases the bankruptcy judge can have the liquidator replaced or require him to submit his report on the management of the bankrupt's assets, there is considerable divergence of opinion in legal writing on this point. The Court observes that, while it is not its task to resolve this question, which is a matter for the Italian legislature, the remedy invoked by the Government cannot be regarded as effective. In these circumstances the applicants were under no obligation to avail themselves of it. The objection is therefore unfounded in this respect. The second limb was not put forward before the Commission and the Government are therefore estopped from relying on it. B. Merits of the complaint",

In addition the transfer of the latter, who also exercised the functions of bankruptcy judge, entailed a stay of more than three years in the preparation for trial of both cases (see paragraph 11 above). Consequently, the Court takes the view that any attempt by the applicants to expedite the proceedings would have been bound to fail. The judge had, moreover, never refused the applications for adjournment made by the liquidator and the plaintiffs (Mr A. and the L.M. company). A \"reasonable time\" was accordingly exceeded and there has therefore been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1).",
