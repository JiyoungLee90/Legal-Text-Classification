In the Government\u2019s view any delays in constitutional proceedings were counterbalanced by the fact that those jurisdictions could issue interim orders pending proceedings. They cited for example a decree in the case of Emanuel Camilleri vs Inspector Louise Callejja and the Commissioner of Police (no. 50/2013) where the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction released a sentenced person from prison pending the proceedings given the particular circumstances of that case, namely where the main witness, who had testified in the applicant\u2019s trial which had ultimately returned a guilty verdict, was now being tried for perjury in connection with her testimony. Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, in the absence of speedy proceedings there nevertheless existed a speedy interim remedy which could be decreed by the constitutional jurisdictions under Article 46 (2) of the Constitution and Article 4 (2) of the European Convention Act. Despite the exceptional circumstances of the case, the example went to show that releasing persons from prison by means of an interim measure was indeed a possibility which could be used by the constitutional jurisdictions, and the applicant had not proved the contrary.",

It thus concluded that it cannot be considered an effective remedy for the purposes of a complaint about conditions of detention under Article\u00a03 (see also, Mikalauskas v. Malta, no. 4458/10, \u00a7 49, 23 July 2013). Nothing has been brought to the attention of the Court which could cast doubt on that conclusion.",

In such proceedings, courts can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint, make findings of fact and order redress that is tailored to the nature and gravity of the violation. These courts can also make an award of compensation for nonpecuniary damage and there is no limit on the amount which can be awarded to an applicant for such a violation. The ensuing judicial decision will be binding on the defaulting authority and enforceable against it. The Court was therefore satisfied that the existing legal framework rendered this remedy capable, at least in theory, of affording appropriate redress. However, given the delay in those proceedings, the Court held that while it could not rule out that constitutional redress proceedings dealt with urgently (as should be the case concerning complaints of conditions of detention) may in future be considered an effective remedy for the purposes of such complaints under Article 3, the then state of domestic case-law could not allow the Court to find that the applicant was required to have recourse to such a remedy. In the present case the Government have not submitted any further examples enabling the Court to revisit its conclusion concerning the delay in such proceedings. On the contrary, they appear to acknowledge the existence of such delays, arguing however that such delays are counterbalanced by the possibility of interim measures being issued by constitutional jurisdictions pending proceedings.",

Similarly, the case of Tafarra Besabe Berhe, referred to by the applicant (in her submissions below, at paragraph 111) concerning the lawfulness of immigrants\u2019 detention and the conditions of such detention, which was still pending six years after it was lodged, also does not appear to have applied such a measure.

Such a measurement does not refer only to the space available in her dormitory, but to the entirety of the space to which she had access in her zone. However, given that the applicant had in fact the opportunity to move around in the zone, the Court considers that there is no reason why the entirety of the area should not be taken into consideration for the purposes of her living space. Even considering that in reality this space should be significantly lower in view of the fixtures in the rooms, both the common rooms and the dormitories (see Yarashonen, \u00a7 76, and Torreggiani and Others, \u00a7 75, both cited above), the Court considers that the ultimate living space over those months did not go below the acceptable minimum standard of multi-occupancy accommodation.",

In these circumstances the Court cannot find that the overcrowding was so severe as to justify in itself a finding of a violation of Article\u00a03.",

The Court observes that while it is true that adjacent to the dormitories the applicant could move around in the common room as well as the corridors, by the Government\u2019s own admission, during the period of April to July 2012, access to the yard was limited because of the significant number of break-outs. In the Government\u2019s view this limitation was justified for security reasons. The Court observes that no specific date as to when this limitation came to an end in July 2012 was submitted by any of the parties, thus, the applicant having been detained on 27\u00a0May 2012, this meant that the applicant had no access to any outdoor exercise for anything between about five and nine weeks.",

CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1Rev. 2013, \u00a7 48). These standards also say that outdoor exercise facilities should be reasonably spacious and whenever possible provide shelter from inclement weather (see Neshkov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos. 36925/10, 21487/12, 72893/12, 73196/12, 77718/12 and 9717/13, \u00a7 234, 27 January 2015, with further references). The physical characteristics of outdoor exercise facilities are also relevant. For instance, an exercise yard that is just two square metres larger than the cell, is surrounded by three-metre-high walls, and has an opening to the sky covered with metal bars and a thick net does not offer inmates proper opportunities for recreation and recuperation (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0152, with further references).",

Further, it is not disputed that in the present case there was not even any access to this yard for an unspecified period of time. The Court considers that the Government\u2019s security argument is no justification, and indeed the authorities should be in a position to provide safe exercise space irrespective of any fears of breakouts. The latter concerns may be addressed by other relevant measures falling under the authorities\u2019 responsibility, without impinging on the well-being of all the detainees indiscriminately.",

Greece, no. 8256/07, \u00a7\u00a7 38 to 44, 26\u00a0November 2009). Moreover, the Court highlights that the detention in the present case was imposed in the context of immigration, and was therefore a measure which is applicable not to those who have committed criminal offences but to aliens who, often fearing for their lives, have fled their own country. However, in the present case, the Court notes the uncertainty of the period during which no access to the yard was possible, a period of between five and nine weeks. Given the unspecified duration of this limitation which appears to have been due to specific circumstances occurring at the time, the Court considers that while the situation was highly regrettable, this element on its own cannot be considered as reaching the relevant threshold, even if accompanied by the fact that applicant did not benefit from regular recreational activities indoors either. This is so, particularly given that the applicant herself admitted that she often did not choose to make use of the allotted yard time. It is however, a matter which must be given its due importance when assessing the cumulative effects of detention.",

Nevertheless, the applicant admits that ceiling fans were in place, and despite the fact that Malta is an extremely hot country in the summer months the Court considers that the authorities cannot be expected to provide the most advanced technology. However, the Court is concerned by the applicant\u2019s allegation that detainees suffered from the cold despite the distribution of blankets (see paragraph 23 above). Little comfort can be found in the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant was only detained until February, given that January and February are the coldest months. However, the Court welcomes the Government\u2019s action in this regard, and notes that heating has now been installed. While the latter action had no consequence for the applicant, who had been released by then, the Court observes that the provision of blankets must have aided the situation to some extent.",

The Government admitted that only two females had been working in the detention centre at the time, and did not dispute that only one of them was working in the applicant\u2019s zone. The Government\u2019s submission that male staff were trained to distribute intimate products, even if it were true, cannot counteract the degree of discomfort to the female detainees who were for the most time dealt with and surrounded by male officers for their detention over several months.

In respect of Article\u00a025\u00a0A\u00a0(6) of the Immigration Act, she added that, as a rule, the Board granted bail in connection with removal orders, but has done so at least once in connection with a challenge as to the lawfulness of detention under Regulation\u00a011(10). Nevertheless, bail could only be granted against a financial deposit (usually around 1,000 euros (EUR)) as well as a third-party guarantee showing that the applicant will have accommodation and subsistence, conditions which were unlikely to be fulfilled by immigrants arriving by boat (as opposed to those overstaying visas).

The Government claimed that since many persons alleged to pertain to such categories, procedures were in place to screen such requests accurately and expeditiously. As an example they submitted that in the first half of the year of 2012, out of 1, 065 persons who arrived in Malta irregularly, seventyfive claimed to be minors. AWAS processed and determined all the cases and forty-six persons were issued with a care order. They further noted that age assessment of persons who were quite young was fast tracked as in such cases there was little difficulty in assessing the age.

On the other hand, the Court observes that in 2012, out of 1,065 arrivals only seventy-five individuals claimed to be minors, that is, less than 10 %. In this connection, the Court considers that despite the fact that \u201cborderline\u201d cases may require further assessment, the numbers of alleged minors per year put forward by the Government cannot justify a duration of around seven months to determine the applicant\u2019s claim. Indeed, the Government have not explained why it was necessary for the applicant in the present case to wait for two months for her first age assessment interview (see paragraph 14 above) and a further two months to perform an X-ray on her wrist (see paragraph 15 above) following a second interview, and more than three months to have a decision following a standard medical test (see paragraph 14 above).",

It is true that the asylum claim could not be processed before the applicant\u2019s age was determined, given that a number of procedural safeguards are attached to asylum claims lodged by minors. However, considering that age assessment is a preliminary step of an asylum assessment, as regrettable as the delay in determining the applicant\u2019s age may have been in the present case, it cannot be said that the seven months of detention until her age was determined, as well as the subsequent two weeks until her asylum claim was verified, were not closely connected to the ground relied on.",
