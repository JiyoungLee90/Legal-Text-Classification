We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary...",

The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court, setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution.

The legislation provides that the special counsel is not however \u201cresponsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent\u201d, thus ensuring that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which cannot be disclosed.",

Any such restriction on the rights of the defence should, however, be strictly proportionate and counterbalanced by procedural safeguards adequate to compensate for the handicap imposed on the defence. Whilst accepting that in certain circumstances it might be necessary in the public interest to exclude the accused and his representatives from the disclosure procedure, he contended that the ex parte hearings before the judge (see paragraphs 10-12 above) violated Article 6 because they afforded no safeguards against judicial bias or error and no opportunity to put arguments on behalf of the accused.",

He pointed to four examples of cases where a \u201cspecial counsel\u201d procedure had been introduced in the United Kingdom (see paragraphs 30-33 above). These examples, he submitted, demonstrated that an alternative mechanism was available which would ensure that the rights of the defence were respected as far as possible in the course of a hearing to determine whether evidence should be withheld on public interest grounds, whilst safeguarding legitimate concerns about, for example, national security or the protection of witnesses and sources of information, and he reasoned that the onus was on the Government to show why it would not be possible to introduce such a procedure.",

Moreover, the proposed scheme would give rise to significant difficulties in practice, for example, with regard to the duties which would be owed by the special counsel to the accused, the amount of information he or she would be at liberty to pass on to the accused and the defence lawyers and the quality of instructions he or she could expect to receive from the defence. Such difficulties would be particularly acute in cases involving more than one co-accused, where it would be necessary to appoint a special counsel in respect of each defendant to avoid the risk of conflict of interest, and in respect of long trials, with constantly evolving disclosure issues.",

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see the Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, p.\u00a0712, \u00a7 58). Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see the Doorson judgment cited above, p. 471, \u00a7 72, and the Van Mechelen and Others judgment cited above, p. 712, \u00a7 54).",

In any event, in many cases, such as the present one, where the evidence in question has never been revealed, it would not be possible for the Court to attempt to weigh the public interest in non-disclosure against that of the accused in having sight of the material. It must therefore scrutinise the decision-making procedure to ensure that, as far as possible, it complied with the requirements to provide adversarial proceedings and equality of arms and incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the accused.",

The prosecution made a second ex parte application on 25 April 1994, which was followed by an inter partes hearing on the question whether a witness statement taken from C. after his guilty plea should be disclosed to the defence. In the course of this hearing the defence were able to argue the case for disclosure and to hear the arguments of the prosecution and the judge\u2019s reasons for not ordering complete disclosure of the statement.

The Court notes, in particular, that the material which was not disclosed in the present case formed no part of the prosecution case whatever, and was never put to the jury.

He was fully versed in all the evidence and issues in the case and in a position to monitor the relevance to the defence of the withheld information both before and during the trial. Moreover it can be assumed \u2013 not least because he expressly stated on 23 March that he would have ordered disclosure if it might have helped the defence \u2013 that the judge applied the principles which had recently been clarified by the Court of Appeal, for example that, in weighing the public interest in concealment against the interest of the accused in disclosure, great weight should be attached to the interests of justice, and that the judge should continue to assess the need for disclosure throughout the trial (see the Ward and Davis, Johnson and Rowe judgments in paragraphs 21 and 23-24 above). The jurisprudence of the English Court of Appeal shows that the assessment which the trial judge must make fulfils the conditions which, according to the European Court\u2019s case-law, are essential for ensuring a fair trial in instances of non-disclosure of prosecution material (see paragraphs 44-45 above). The domestic trial court in the present case thus applied standards which were in conformity with the relevant principles of a fair trial embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Finally, during the appeal proceedings the Court of Appeal also considered whether or not the evidence should have been disclosed (see paragraphs 15-17 above), providing an additional level of protection for the applicant\u2019s rights.",

Although, after the second ex parte application on 25 April 1994, there was an inter partes hearing on the question whether a witness statement taken from C. after his guilty plea should be disclosed, the defence were required to argue their case in ignorance of the full nature of the evidence in question, never having seen it. It was purely a matter of chance whether they made any relevant points. This procedure cannot, in our view, be said to respect the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms, given that the prosecuting authorities were provided with access to the judge and were able to participate in the decision-making process in the absence of any representative of the defence. The fact that the judge monitored the need for disclosure throughout the trial (see paragraph\u00a049 of the judgment) cannot remedy the unfairness created by the defence\u2019s absence from the ex parte proceedings. In our view, the requirements \u2013 set out in the Doorson v. the Netherlands judgment of 26\u00a0March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, and the Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III \u2013 that any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on defence rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities, are not met by the mere fact that it was a judge who decided that the evidence be withheld. In stating this, we do not suggest in any way that the judge in the present case was not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, or that he was not fully versed in the evidence and issues in the case as mentioned in paragraph 49 of the judgment.

The special counsel\u2019s function is to assist the court in circumstances where a party may not be allowed to participate for national security or other reasons. The special counsel is to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings. The relevant legislation1 provides that the special counsel is not however \u201cresponsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent\u201d. This ensures that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which cannot be disclosed. The Government argued that the present arrangements in principle and in practice adequately protected the rights of the accused. In essence, they relied on the impartiality of the judge and the honour and professional integrity of the prosecution. They also raised the significant practical difficulties involved in creating such a role as special counsel in a criminal case. The problems, the Government pleaded, involved questions as to the duties owed by special counsel to the accused, the amount of information he or she would be at liberty to pass on to the accused and the defence lawyers and the quality of instructions he or she could expect to receive from the defence. Difficulties would be most acute, they argued, where there were more than one accused and problems also would arise where there were long trials with constantly evolving disclosure issues.",

One of these is the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill 1999 which makes provision for the appointment by the court of a special counsel in any case in which a trial judge prohibits an unrepresented defendant from cross-examining in person the complainant in a sexual-offence case. It is, therefore, contemplated by the Government that the special-counsel procedure may be used in a criminal case, albeit one somewhat different from the facts of this case.
