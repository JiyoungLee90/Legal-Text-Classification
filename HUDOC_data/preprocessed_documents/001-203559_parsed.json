In particular, when the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3 sq.\u00a0m of floor surface in multioccupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article\u00a03 arises (\u00a7 137). In cases where a prison cell \u2013 measuring in the range of 3 to 4\u00a0sq.\u00a0m of personal space per inmate \u2013 is at issue, the space factor remains a weighty factor in the Court\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of conditions of detention. In such instances, a violation of Article 3 will be found if the space factor is coupled with other aspects of inappropriate physical conditions of detention (\u00a7 139). Where a detainee had more than 4 sq. m of personal space at his or her disposal in multi-occupancy accommodation in prison, and where therefore no issue arises with regard to the question of personal space, other aspects of physical conditions of detention remain relevant for the Court\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of an applicant\u2019s conditions of detention under Article 3 of the Convention (\u00a7 140).",
