However, they contended that later \u2012 as of 8 December 2011 \u2012 the applicant could have lodged a civil claim for damages on the grounds that the criminal proceedings against him had been closed for lack of corpus delicti. In that regard the Court reiterates that the question of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally determined by reference to the date when the application was lodged with the Court (see Baumann v. France, no. 33592/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001V (extracts)). The rule is subject to exceptions which may be justified by compelling reasons deriving from the specific circumstances and the context in which the remedy becomes available to the applicant, such as the context of new remedies in length-of-proceedings cases, for example (see Brusco v. Italy, (dec.), no. 69789/01, ECHR 2001-IX, Nogolica v. Croatia (dec.), no. 77784/01, ECHR\u00a02002VIII and Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2005V). In the present case the Court does not find compelling reasons justifying such an exception. It considers that the applicant could have exhausted the remedy which became available to him more than two and a half years after the introduction of the application but had not been obliged to do so. Furthermore, it has not been shown that that remedy would have been capable of addressing all the elements of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 of the Convention. The Court therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.",

Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 171, ECHR 2004-II). The \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention under domestic law is the primary, but not always the decisive element. The Court must also be satisfied that during the period under consideration the detention was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary manner (see Oleksiy Mykhaylovych Zakharkin v. Ukraine, no. 1727/04, \u00a7\u00a084, 24\u00a0June 2010). In order for deprivation of liberty to be considered free from arbitrariness, it does not suffice that this measure is executed in conformity with national law: it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v. Slovakia, no.\u00a065559/01, \u00a7 74, 27 February 2007; Khayredinov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 38717/04, \u00a7\u00a027, 14 October 2010; and Korneykova v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a039884/05, \u00a7 34, 19 January 2012). Furthermore, under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that a criminal offence has been committed presupposes the existence of facts or information that would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned might have committed an offence (see W\u0142och v.

However, these allegations are not supported by any evidential material. The Court is therefore unable to establish whether the alleged facts took place or to determine, in particular, whether there had been deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, by contrast, Grinenko v.

The Court takes note of the applicant\u2019s allegation that his appearance in the police department was not voluntary and that at that time he had been on the list of wanted persons. In this context it finds it unrealistic to assume that the applicant was free to leave the police department (see, for example, Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, \u00a7 49, 9\u00a0November 2010).

The investigator did not obtain a preliminary arrest warrant from the court, as required by Article 29 of the Constitution and Article 165-2 \u00a7 4 of the CCP, but based his decision on Article 106 of the CCP, which provided exceptional grounds to arrest an individual without a court order. However, the arrest report only repeated such general grounds without referring to any specific circumstances explaining why this provision of the CCP could be applied in the applicant\u2019s case. Without this information, the arrest report did not constitute a meaningful guarantee showing that the applicant\u2019s arrest had been effected on the basis of reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a criminal offence (see Grinenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a083).",

The domestic authorities did not substantiate that there had been any of the specific purposes laid down in the domestic law for applying preventive measures. In this regard the Court does not consider that the applicant\u2019s detention could be justified by the fact that he had been placed on the national list of wanted persons, since there is nothing to show that he was in hiding. On the contrary, it appears that the applicant was doing business openly in Germany and Ukraine, had been living in Germany for several years prior to his arrest, and was in communication with the authorities \u2012 in particular the Ukrainian police authorities, who must have been aware that he was residing in Germany both from his own communications (see paragraph 8 above) and from the documents available in the criminal case file (see paragraph 9 above). In these circumstances, putting the applicant on the national list of wanted persons, and thereby triggering a search for the applicant on the territory of Ukraine, was a futile measure and could not give a valid reason for the applicant\u2019s detention. The Court also notes that on 7\u00a0December 2009 the District Court released the applicant from detention precisely because there was no evidence suggesting that the applicant might abscond from justice, obstruct the investigation or continue any criminal activity.",

The Court notes, however, that the selected preventive measure obliged the applicant to reside at a specific address in Ukraine and ignored the possibility that the applicant might continue to live in Germany, where he pursued his professional activities and where he and his family had settled several years before. Even occasional travels abroad were impossible, since the applicant\u2019s international travel passports had been seized. Accordingly, in the specific circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case, the written undertaking not to abscond was not a minimally intrusive measure, as maintained by the Government, but in fact amounted to an extensive interference with the applicant\u2019s private and family life. The fact that at the time of his arrest the applicant was allegedly temporarily unemployed does not mitigate the interference. As to the Government\u2019s contention that the applicant\u2019s family could have moved to Ukraine in order to overcome the restriction on the family life imposed by the domestic authorities, the Court considers that the resettlement of the applicant\u2019s family, including his children, would not have been a balanced solution, taking into account the other preventive measures available and the interests of the family. Meantime, the domestic authorities failed to make assessment of the other non-custodial preventive measures available in domestic law \u2012 such as bail, for example \u2012 which could have been less detrimental to the applicant\u2019s private and family life.",
