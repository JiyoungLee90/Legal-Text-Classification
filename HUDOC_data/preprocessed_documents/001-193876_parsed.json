Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR\u00a02003IX, and Ro\u015fca v. the Republic of Moldova, no 6267/02, \u00a7\u00a025, 22\u00a0March 2005).",

In doing so, the Court must bear in mind that it is in the first place the responsibility of national courts to interpret provisions of national law (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a026083/94, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999-I).",

The Court notes that the reason relied upon to justify the quashing of the judgment of 27 June 2009 was its alleged unlawfulness.
