In the light of the above, the court held that the concept of \u201cdocument\u201d had to be interpreted restrictively.

This principle emphasises the fact that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. A review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise and the mere possibility of two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. Departures from that principle are justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see for instance Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003IX).",
