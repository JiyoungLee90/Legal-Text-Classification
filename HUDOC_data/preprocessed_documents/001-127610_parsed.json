He was also dissatisfied at being linked to the Inkaras company, owned by the EBSW group of companies, which was at that time under criminal investigation for bringing Inkaras to insolvency. As the newspaper did not comply with this request, he then brought a claim in the civil courts, seeking rectification of the article and compensation for non-pecuniary damage.

The court took into account that when preparing the publication the journalist had talked to the applicants\u2019 neighbours, examined documents, telephoned the second applicant and had regard to his opinion. The court pointed out that, in accordance with Article\u00a02.24 \u00a7 5 of the Civil Code, the press could be held liable for defamation if it knew that information it published did not correspond to reality, that is if it acted in bad faith. However, in some circumstances the media had a right to trust certain sources of information (for example, an official police report or a document by other municipal or State authorities). In such cases the media were exempt from the obligation to verify the accuracy of that information. On this point the court noted that the applicants\u2019 neighbours had repeatedly addressed complaints to State and municipal institutions about the applicants\u2019 housing projects. Those complaints had been investigated by the authorities and official replies had been received. For the court, the case file showed that both of the applicants had been held liable under administrative law for rebuilding the house without a permit and for unlawfully occupying State land. Conversely, the applicants\u2019 neighbours had been honest when they addressed the State and municipal institutions, because, as the replies from those institutions indicated, their accusations in respect of the applicants had proved to be true. These were precisely those written replies that were given to the journalist when she was preparing the publication. Given that they were official documents, the journalist had a right to trust their content.",

This explained why the article mentioned not only the first applicant but also the second applicant. It was also noteworthy that in the civil court the second applicant had acknowledged that the authorities had ordered a halt to construction on the plot of land belonging to his wife, but argued that they had obeyed the order. However, from the letter of 29\u00a0April 2003 (see paragraph 8 above) it was clear that the reference in the article to administrative sanction was correct. As regards the second applicant\u2019s prior work at Inkaras, he himself admitted that he had worked at the Inkaras factory as head of a production unit (cecho vir\u0161ininkas). Accordingly, the second applicant had failed to prove that his dignity had been insulted because of the published reference to his position at Inkaras.",

It indicated further that the insulting nature of the material published did not have to be proven if the words or combination of words used were manifestly insulting. The court concluded that the publication at issue did not contain such language. Next, the court noted that in defamation cases the court had to examine the construction of the sentence as well as the whole context of the publication in order to find out the exact meaning of the word or combination of words. The court concluded that the second applicant had indicated only separate sentences but had not had regard to the whole content of the publication.",

The appellate court considered that the lower court had erred as regards the factual circumstances of the case. Specifically, the documents from the Real Estate Registry showed that the owner of the house and of the plot of land was the first applicant. Consequently, the published material did not correspond to reality, because the evidence of inappropriate use of the property had been linked to the first applicant but not to the second. Similarly, as regards the second applicant\u2019s former post at Inkaras, which belonged to the EBSW group, that statement was misleading, because the second applicant had in fact worked as a director at a [subsidiary] enterprise, Inkaro padai, which he did not deny. The appellate court thus concluded that naming the second applicant separately and together with the first applicant as persons who had broken the law, and linking those breaches of the law to the first applicant\u2019s employment, as well as stating that in the past the second applicant had had links to the EBSW group, was damaging to his authority as a public figure. The court considered that the journalist had deliberately ignored her obligation to provide information that was fair, accurate and impartial, in breach of Article 3 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public.",

Furthermore, Articles 4 and 19 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public obliged the media to present information correctly, without bias and in compliance with the requirements of journalistic ethics.",

It was clear from the content of the applicants\u2019 neighbours\u2019 complaints to various institutions and the replies they had received that those neighbours were trying to protect their rights which had been breached, and also to make sure that the second applicant, who was a public figure, abided by the law. The neighbours, acting in good faith, gave copies of those complaints and replies to the journalist, who in turn wrote an article on the subject. The first-instance court was correct to find that the official replies from municipal and State institutions, which referred to violations of law committed by both applicants in that they had reconstructed the house without a permit and had also occupied State-owned land and demolished part of a neighbour\u2019s wall, among others, were a sufficient basis for publication of information about a public figure, the second applicant, who had been elected Kaunas city centre elder.",

Despite the fact that the plot of land and the house where both applicants lived were registered in the first applicant\u2019s name, that property had been acquired during their marriage. Accordingly, this was their joint property which they had equal rights to manage and use, in accordance with Article\u00a021 of the Code of Marriage and Family. Moreover, in the event that a co-owner of the property of a public figure exercised their co-ownership rights inappropriately, the public figure (in this case the second applicant) had a duty to control his co-owner\u2019s actions and to prevent violations of the law, as in this case. For the Supreme Court, if a co-owner exercising the joint property rights of both spouses violated the pecuniary and non-pecuniary rights of other persons, the other co-owner incurred liability as well, the more so if that other co-owner was a public figure. Having regard to the above arguments, the Supreme Court concluded that the appellate court had wrongly interpreted Article 3 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public and erred in finding that the journalist had deliberately violated that law by breaching her responsibility to present correct, precise and impartial information. The Supreme Court concluded that those errors made the decision of the appellate court invalid. The decision of the first-instance court was upheld.",

On this point he strongly objected to the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion to the effect that the co-owners of a property were jointly responsible for it in the event of any misconduct, and that if one of the co-owners was a public figure he had a duty to prevent violations of the law (see paragraph 27 above). The second applicant vehemently asserted that neither he nor his wife had ever unlawfully occupied land belonging either to the State or to their neighbours, nor had they committed any of the other violations of the law attributed to them in the publication. He also maintained that reference to his previous employment as deputy director of the Inkaras enterprise, part of the EBSW group, was defamatory, because, given the bad publicity surrounding the EBSW group, he had thereby been classified as a person linked to criminal activities in the past.",

They noted that civil servants acting in an official capacity were, like politicians, subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than others (see Janowski v.  [GC], no. 25716/94, \u00a7 33, ECHR 1999I). Under Lithuanian law, civil servants had a duty to behave in an exemplary manner and to have an irreproachable reputation. This obligation extended beyond official duties, and was not exclusively associated with actions performed in an official capacity. The Government thus believed that the actions of civil servants should continually be subject to public scrutiny and be open to criticism, especially when it came to cases of disregarding the law. The Government also submitted that the adverse effect of the publication was limited only to possibly unpleasant feelings for the second applicant, given that, to their knowledge, he continued to hold the position of neighbourhood elder at least until April 2009, when the Government submitted their observations on admissibility and merits. Accordingly, the severity of the adverse effects on his reputation were not sufficiently serious to give rise to an interference with his private life (see Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, 25\u00a0March\u00a01993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 247C).",

Firstly, the interference was prescribed by law. The Civil Code and the Law on Provision of Information to the Public contained provisions on the protection of privacy in the context of freedom of expression. However, they equally stipulated that information on a person\u2019s private life could be made public without his consent, taking into consideration his official position and his position in society, if the dissemination of the said information corresponded to a lawful and well-founded public interest in that information. Furthermore, the interference had a legitimate aim, that of protecting the rights and interests of others. In the instant case the protection of private life had to be balanced against freedom of expression. Above all, the principal aim of the publication was not to tarnish the second applicant\u2019s reputation, but to disclose information of public importance, after the applicants\u2019 neighbours had approached the journalist with documents indicating that their legitimate interests were being violated by the applicants\u2019 actions.",

Firstly, they had rightly qualified the statements in the article as statements of fact and thus susceptible to proof, therefore placing a more stringent test on the journalist. The courts had emphasised that the journalist had acted in good faith. When preparing the article she had gathered information from all available sources: she had spoken not only with the applicants\u2019 neighbours, but with the second applicant himself. It was also critical that the journalist had relied on official documents \u2013 sources of information which, according to the Supreme Court, she had a legitimate right to trust. Taking into account the systemic, multiform nature of administrative-law violations attributed to the property jointly owned by both applicants and that they had acted in an extremely abusive and inappropriate manner, the statements in the publication were accurate enough to allow the conclusion that the right to freedom of expression did not overstep the bounds of responsible journalism. In the light of the above, the Government considered that there was a fair balance in the instant case in favour of freedom of expression.",

The interveners endorsed what they understood as the Court\u2019s view in Karak\u00f3 v. Hungary (no. 39311/05, 28 April 2009) that an alleged defamation victim was not automatically entitled to Article 8 protection, in so far as not every injury to public standing constituted an encroachment on that person\u2019s right to respect for his or her private life. The threshold for Article 8 protection had to be clear and convincing evidence that defamatory allegations were a) factual in nature; b) primarily intended to insult the applicant (rather than to honestly contribute to public debate); and c) \u201cof such a seriously offensive nature\u201d that the publication had \u201can inevitable direct effect on the applicant\u2019s private life\u201d. In judging whether the criteria have been met the Court should take into account the extent to which the applicant had entered the public arena and should therefore demonstrate a higher degree of tolerance to criticism. For the interveners, such a standard was not only required by the established tenets of the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 10, but was also consistent with the interpretation of Article 17 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights and the prevailing practices of the Council of Europe States. Most importantly, such a standard would provide media outlets with clear direction in making their decisions to publish important material on matters of public concern. Uncertainty would only encourage caution and thus deprive the public of material that should be published.",

The Court reiterates, however, that in the article the second applicant had been named as a person holding public office and repeatedly breaking the law.\u00a0It has already been accepted in the Convention organs\u2019 case-law that a person\u2019s right to protection of his or her reputation is encompassed by Article 8 as being part of the right to respect for private life. The Court therefore considered that a person\u2019s reputation, even if that person was criticised in the context of a public debate, formed part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore also fell within the scope of his or her \u201cprivate life\u201d (see Pfeifer v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a012556/03, \u00a7 35, 15 November 2007, with further references). The Court explained its approach to such cases in its judgment in A. v.\u00a0Norway (no.\u00a028070/06, \u00a7 64, 9 April 2009), holding that in order for Article 8 to come into play, the attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of gravity and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see Mikolajov\u00e1 v. Slovakia, no. 4479/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 18 January 2011; Roberts and Roberts v. the United Kingdom, (dec.), no.\u00a038681/08, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 5 July 2011). Having regard to the accusations in respect of the second applicant, the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. Article 8 of the Convention thus applies. The Court also finds that the second applicant\u2019s complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. The complaint must therefore be declared admissible.",

It reiterates that, although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundary between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision does not lend itself to precise definition. The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Von\u00a0Hannover v. , no. 59320/00, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2004VI, and Pfeifer, cited above, \u00a7 37).

Accordingly, whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life, the same is not true of public figures. A fundamental distinction needs to be made between reporting facts capable of contributing to a debate in a democratic society, relating to politicians in the exercise of their official functions for example, and reporting details of the private life of an individual who does not exercise such functions (see Von Hannover v.\u00a0Germany (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 110, with further references).

In the instant case the Court observes that the domestic courts considered the information published in the article of 11\u00a0November 2003 to be a question of fact, rather than a value judgment, and accordingly required more accuracy from the journalist. In setting out their reasons the first-instance and the cassation courts observed that the journalist had acted in good faith. She had questioned not only the neighbours, who represented the opposing side in the conflict, but also the second applicant himself. Most importantly, those two courts emphasised that when gathering her facts the journalist had relied on official documents issued by the State and municipal authorities (see paragraphs 21, 23 and 26 above). For those two courts, the journalist had no reason to doubt the veracity of that information. On this last point the Court reiterates its position that the press should normally be entitled, when contributing to public debate on matters of legitimate concern, to rely on the contents of official reports without having to undertake independent research. Otherwise, the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7 68).",

While this is true, the Court cannot overlook the fact that in April 2003 the first applicant had twice been warned by the territorial planning authorities because she had been pursuing construction works without permission and had unlawfully built a wall on State land (see paragraphs 8 and 15 above). Similarly, the first applicant\u2019s administrative- law violation in connection with unlawful reconstruction of the applicants\u2019 house had been established in September 2003 (see paragraph 9 above). Furthermore, the same month the court allowed a civil claim by \u010c.P., the applicants\u2019 neighbour, against the second applicant for unlawful demolition of \u010c.P.\u2019s wall (see paragraph 14 above). These facts had been clearly established by the State and municipal authorities before the article was printed in Respublika on 11\u00a0November 2003, and no final administrative court decision had yet been taken until that day (see paragraphs 12 and 17 above). Accordingly, the Court is not prepared to disagree with the first-instance and cassation courts\u2019 finding that there was sufficient evidence supporting the allegations against the second applicant of wrongful management of property. Lastly, whilst noting that reference to the second applicant\u2019s former job at the Inkaras enterprise had not been entirely accurate, the Court does not find it utterly misleading either, for the second applicant has himself admitted that he worked at a related enterprise, Inkaro padai, in the past (see paragraph 22 above). The Court thus considers that that reference alone did not overstep the limits of careful journalism. Moreover, the impugned article apparently had no serious consequences, because, as has been argued by the Government and not denied by the second applicant, he kept his post of a Kaunas city elder long after the article was printed (see paragraph 39 above).",

The Court notes, however, that the claim was examined and dismissed as unfounded by domestic courts at three levels of jurisdiction (see paragraph 18 above). Having had regard to the documents submitted by the parties, the Court sees no reason to question that finding. It follows, that this complaint must be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",
