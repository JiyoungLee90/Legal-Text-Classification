When he had been taken into care in 2012, he had been described as having a low level of cognitive, motor and linguistic functioning; he had been emotionally flat, unable to express his own needs, and had had little expectation of interaction with others. He had developed a serious eating disorder, and had had patterns of compulsive behaviour and an abnormally great need for sleep. In a report from an outpatient clinic of 29 August 2012, it had been indicated that X\u2019s symptoms were consistent with pervasive developmental disorders. The symptoms had been partly on the autism spectrum. However, a later assessment at a hospital\u2019s child assessment unit in December 2012 had concluded that he did not have an ordinary autistic disorder. Since the boy had moved into the foster home in March 2013, there had been no suspicion that he was suffering from a developmental disorder.",

Whereas previously he could not accept praise, he was now able to accept it when someone said something positive about him and show that he was pleased with himself. He allowed himself to be comforted and accepted physical intimacy with certain people. He had also shown progress in relation to meals. When he had been placed in foster care, he had not shown when he was hungry. He had liked to be fed and preferred baby porridge. After a long period of adjustment he was now able to eat a more varied diet. He was also able to communicate that he was hungry or full. In stressful situations he still had difficulties swallowing. He had also become socialised. His compulsive behaviour symptoms had decreased, and he tolerated getting his hands and clothes dirty. He still tired easily and had shorter days in kindergarten than other children of his age. However, his need for sleep was normal. He displayed an enormous need for security; he needed to be prepared for events and was very concerned with having everyone in the foster family present. If there were irregularities in his everyday life, he became very restless. Examples of this included when the supervisor visited the foster home or when the family went to their cabin. In such situations, he started thinking that he was going to move.",

She had described him as a well-functioning and social child, and had instead questioned how his being taken into care had affected him. The court noted that the applicant had used a great deal of resources in preparing her claim for revocation of the care order in respect of X, and stated that it was positive that she had wanted to strengthen her competence through a parenting course and a work placement for kindergarten assistants. However, the court could not see that these measures had had much effect on her ability to provide care. Her challenge was that she had little intuitive parenting skills. She did not have the capacity to intuitively understand the child\u2019s needs. Although she had wanted to understand the boy\u2019s perspective, she had not been able to. It was not possible to acquire such basic parenting skills through courses and a work placement in a kindergarten.

In the City Court\u2019s opinion, reports from the contact sessions also confirmed that the applicant\u2019s ability to provide care had not changed. She repeatedly corrected X\u2019s perception of who his mother was, despite the fact that he reacted by becoming insecure and confused. She behaved invasively and changed activities frequently, without X showing that he was following her. During the last contact session she had been very concerned with filming the boy, without caring about how this affected their interaction. The court gave consideration to the fact that a supervised contact situation could be a difficult arena in which to display natural caring skills. The applicant had also acted more calmly during one of the other contact sessions, in April 2014. However, viewing the four reports from the contact sessions in conjunction with each other, the court was nevertheless of the opinion that her behaviour showed that she still did not see the boy\u2019s perspectives and needs (ser guttens perspektiv og behov).",

The court found that X had sought security after all four contact sessions. Among other things, he had followed his foster mother around the home and called for her. He had been restless before being put to bed, his sleep had been disturbed, and he had woken up several times during the night. He had been tired and worn out, had slept during the day and had needed more sleep at night. He had been fidgety and had changed his play activities frequently, had had heightened emotions, and had become very angry, very sad and very happy. His reactions after the last contact session in November 2014 had been particularly strong. After this session, X\u2019s functioning had deteriorated considerably.

They had argued that the attachment that had formed between X and the applicant during the first two years of his life was strong, and that his reactions had to be interpreted as a sign that he missed his primary caregiver, the applicant. The court had a different interpretation of the reactions after the contact sessions. In its opinion, it was possible that the reactions were somewhat complex. However, its assessment was nevertheless that the reactions were mainly an expression of the boy\u2019s insecure attachment to the applicant and the fact that the contact sessions had had a retraumatising effect on him. His reactions indicated that there was a great risk that returning him to the applicant would seriously jeopardise his mental health, therefore such a return would be completely irresponsible.",

Norway [GC], no.\u00a037283/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0202-213, 10 September 2019, to which reference is made. For the purpose of the present analysis, the Court reiterates that regard to family unity and for family reunification in the event of separation are inherent considerations in the right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the Convention. Accordingly, in the case of imposition of public care restricting family life, a positive duty lies on the authorities to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible. Moreover, any measure implementing such temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parents and the child. The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the competent authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child. Furthermore, the ties between members of a family, and the prospect of their successful reunification will perforce be weakened if impediments are placed in the way of their having easy and regular access to each other (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 205 and 208).",

The Court thus recognises that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of taking a child into care. A \u201cstricter scrutiny\u201d is called for in any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by the authorities on parental rights of access, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between the parents and a young child are effectively curtailed (ibid., \u00a7 211).",

The Court emphasises that to the extent such a conclusion also implies \u2013 as it did in the instant case \u2013 that the authorities give up reunification of the child and the natural parents as the ultimate goal, thereby de facto transforming the placement order from being a temporary measure into becoming a permanent one, and since all subsequent measures, including the visiting regime, will flow as corollaries to this, the conclusion that the placement must be considered to be long-term should only be drawn after careful consideration and also taking account of the authorities\u2019 positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification (see, mutatis mutandis, Strand Lobben and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 208-209). Moreover, adding the permanency envisioned in the impugned decision \u2013 and thus its inconsistency with the aim of reuniting the family \u2013 to the fact that the City Court refused to grant the applicant any rights to see X whatsoever \u2013 and thereby \u201ctotally deprived the applicant of her family life with the child\u201d (Johansen v.

Moreover, the Court must be assured that any absence of bonds between the natural parents and the child is not because the authorities did not take any real measures to facilitate family reunification at a meaningful point in time (see, mutatis mutandis, Strand Lobben and Others, cited above, \u00a7 208).",

It went on to examine a number of specific issues, including X\u2019s functioning at the time he had been placed in public care, how this had developed in subsequent years, and his future needs. As to X\u2019s development, it relied largely on his foster mother\u2019s reports (see paragraphs 15-16 above). It also examined the applicant\u2019s ability to care, and whether this had improved. In that respect it referred to the applicant\u2019s information about the steps she had taken to improve her situation, which included several courses, working in a kindergarten, and assessments by a psychiatrist and two psychologists (see paragraph 21 above). In reply, it noted that the applicant had \u201cspent a great deal of resources\u201d for the purpose of preparing her claim and strengthening her competences, but that measures such as \u201ccourses and a work placement in a kindergarten\u201d had little impact on her caring skills, since her challenges related to intuitive parental skills, which could not be improved by way of such measures (see paragraph 22 above). Furthermore, the City Court examined the applicant\u2019s assertions that she had support in her family network, but found that her situation was in that respect no different from her situation as it had been when the care order was issued. It also provided an analysis of the contact sessions that had taken place since the care order had been issued in 2012, and X\u2019s negative reactions to those sessions as they had been reported by his foster mother (see paragraphs 24-25 above). In that regard, the City Court reiterated the arguments from the psychologists engaged by the applicant, but did not agree with them (see paragraph 26 above). Also, the question of whether further assistance measures could remedy the shortcomings in the applicant\u2019s care skills was briefly answered in the negative, by reference to the applicant\u2019s shortcomings relating to fundamental and intuitive parental skills (see paragraph 27 above). Lastly, X\u2019s vulnerability and attachment to his foster home were examined (see paragraphs 28-30 above). The City Court concluded that the applicant lacked sufficient skills to care for X, and that X had become so attached to his foster home that in any event he could not be returned at that time (see paragraphs 13 and 30, respectively). The City Court found that returning him would entail a great risk of serious harm to his mental health (ibid.).",

Moreover, the Court emphasises the importance of having a sufficiently broad and updated factual basis for far- reaching decisions such as the one taken by the City Court, effectively representing the end-point for the family life between X and the applicant. This is in particular so when a parent, as in this case, submits that there have been positive developments as to his or her parental abilities, warranting a new assessment of the placement order.",

However, it is striking that the City Court on that point rejected all evidence in the applicant\u2019s favour with limited or no reasoning, including the evaluation by S.C., the private psychiatrist and the assessment by psychologists E.S. and S.H.G. The fact that the applicant after the City Court\u2019s judgment of 25\u00a0February 2013 on her own account had, for example, attended a parenting course and a course for kindergarten assistants, and had actually also worked in a kindergarten for six months, was essentially briefly dismissed as irrelevant (see paragraphs 21-22 above). Furthermore, no account was taken of the fact that the applicant\u2019s contact rights in the period from February 2013 to November 2014 had been limited to one hour twice a year, and fully refused after that (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above).

The last independent assessment to that end was thus apparently that from the outpatient clinic, dated 29 August 2012 \u2013 about two and a half years before the City Court gave its judgment (see paragraph 14 above). The applicant\u2019s request to allow psychologist S.H.G. to observe her with the child was refused as well (see paragraph\u00a012 above). Instead, the City Court based its assessment primarily on the foster parents\u2019 account of the child\u2019s development in the period from 2013 to 2015, without a more thorough independent corroboration than that of the educational supervisor at X\u2019s kindergarten and S., a psychologist at an outpatient clinic who gave testimony before the City Court (see paragraph 16 above).",

As to this, the Court notes that the City Court\u2019s findings in respect of the nature of X\u2019s reactions were also first and foremost based on his foster parents\u2019 reports, since it was primarily they who had observed him during the periods between the contact visits, although the educational supervisor at the kindergarten had noted several of the \u201csame reactions\u201d (see paragraph 25 above). The Court also observes that, before the City Court, opinions differed on the reasons for X\u2019s reactions. The two psychologists engaged by the applicant, E.S. and S.H.G., took the view that the reactions could be due to X missing the applicant (see paragraph 26 above). The City Court, which had refused to appoint an independent expert or to allow the applicant\u2019s own expert S.H.G. to observe contact between her and X (see paragraphs 68 above), stated however \u2013 without any further explanation \u2013 that it \u201cinterpreted\u201d the reactions differently; although it found that the reactions could be \u201csomewhat complex\u201d, its own assessment was that the reactions were \u201cmainly\u201d an expression of the boy\u2019s insecure attachment to the applicant and the fact that the contact sessions had served to reawaken his trauma (see paragraph 26 above). In summary, the City Court provided limited grounds for its findings in respect of the nature and causes of X\u2019s reactions and the applicant herself had had few possibilities to present any weighty evidence in that regard, after her procedural requests relating to the appointment of an independent expert or S.H.G. being allowed to observe contact between her and X had been turned down by the City Court. Nor can it be inferred from its judgment that the City Court made any other efforts of its own motion to confirm the reports relating to X\u2019s reactions.",
