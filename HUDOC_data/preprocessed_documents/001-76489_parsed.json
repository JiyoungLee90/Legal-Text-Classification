This procedure obviously falls within the scope of Article\u00a04\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a07. However, the Court notes that, in addition, a system also existed which allowed the review of a case on the grounds of a judicial error concerning points of law and procedure (supervisory review, Articles 371-383 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The subject matter of such proceedings remained the same criminal charge and the validity of its previous determination. If the request was granted and the proceedings were resumed for further consideration, the ultimate effect of supervisory review would be to annul all decisions previously taken by courts and to determine the criminal charge in a new decision. To this extent, the effect of supervisory review is the same as reopening, because both constitute a form of continuation of the previous proceedings. The Court therefore concludes that for the purposes of the ne bis in idem principle supervisory review may be regarded as a special type of reopening falling within the scope of Article 4\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a07.\u201d",

Accordingly, the complaint raises no issues under Article 4\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a07 and falls to be examined solely under Article 6 of the Convention (see Bratyakin, cited above, and Savinskiy v.

In other words, the power to reopen criminal proceedings must be exercised by the authorities so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of the individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of criminal justice (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054-61).
