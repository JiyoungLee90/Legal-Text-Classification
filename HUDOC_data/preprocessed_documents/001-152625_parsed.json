The applicant was remanded in custody on 9\u00a0January 2007. In August 2007 he was admitted to the WarsawMokot\u00f3w Detention Centre in order to undergo a psychiatric examination (obserwacja\u00a0psychiatryczna). After a certain delay, the applicant was placed in a\u00a09person cell in the psychiatric wing of the Remand Centre. It was socalled \u201cobservation cell\u201d for detainees who just arrived in the psychiatric wing and which remained under particular supervision. The cell was located opposite the nurses\u2019 room and was equipped with a CCTV camera which enabled the warden to monitor the situation in the cell. The situation in the cell was normal until the arrival of inmate P.O. From this time, P.O. together with inmate T.G. started abusing the applicant. They poured cold water over him, hit him with a brush stick, and struck him in the face with a mop causing bruises, haematomas and abrasions. P.O. and T.G. told the applicant that a person like him had no rights and ordered him to clean the cell, sit in the corner and follow their orders. They also poured water on the applicant\u2019s bed, his blanket and tattooed a dot on his left arm. Furthermore, P.O. and T.G. held the applicant\u2019s arms and using the mental disability of another inmate (J.C.) persuaded the latter to show his penis just in front of the applicant\u2019s face and tried to force the applicant to have oral sex. These events began on Friday 7 September 2007 and lasted until Monday 10\u00a0September 2007. In the course of check-ups carried during this period of time the applicant requested both a doctor on duty and a warden on duty to speak to them urgently and in private. The doctor on duty refused to speak to the applicant and advised him to see his doctor on Monday. The warden also refused to speak to the applicant. On Monday morning another inmate from the cell, A.S. reported to the doctor the events of the last weekend. The applicant was immediately called to the doctor and recounted him the events. The applicant was then quickly moved to another 3-person cell which was occupied by two detainees charged with offences similar to those of the applicant\u2019s.",

The court held that every person detained in prison or remand centre should be treated in a manner respecting his or her dignity. However, in the applicant\u2019s case, his dignity was violated by allowing his inmates to subject him to degrading treatment over the period of three days while the wardens failed to react to these events. The events occurred notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had been placed in an \u201cobservation cell\u201d which was designed to monitor and react to inappropriate behaviour of inmates. In these circumstances, the State Treasury was liable for the infringement of the applicant\u2019s personal rights resulting from the negligence of the employees of the remand centre since despite the CCTV monitoring of the cell, the applicant\u2019s requests for a private conversation, his wet bed and his external injuries none of the wardens or members of the medical personnel had reacted. The court found unproven the State Treasury\u2019s assertion that the applicant had not informed the personnel about his abuse.

The Government referred first to the Warsaw Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 3 March 2010 which had expressly acknowledged a violation of the applicant\u2019s personal rights and held that the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment had resulted from the negligence of the penitentiary personnel.

With regard to the amount of compensation awarded in the proceedings against the State Treasury, the Government indicated that the award of PLN 3,000 could not be considered inadequate in comparison with the applicant\u2019s claims against the direct offenders since the State Treasury\u2019s liability was only indirect.

This prevented the Foundation from assessing whether there was a systemic problem with the lack of proper protection against inter-prisoner violence. The Helsinki Foundation produced the relevant statistical data for the years 2006-2010 and claimed that they did not reflect the actual scale of the inter-prisoner violence. One reason for this might be the unwillingness of prisoners to report cases of inter-prisoner violence to the penitentiary administration. Lastly, the third-party intervener underlined the importance of the procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention to investigate cases of violent incidents between prisoners.",

They, inter alia, poured cold water on the applicant\u2019s and his bedding and hit him with various objects causing the applicant\u2019s bruises, haematomas and abrasions. They also persuaded an inmate suffering from a mental disorder to strip off and attempted to force the applicant to perform oral sex with him. The internal prison inquiry further established that the applicant received death threats from P.O. and T.G. (see paragraph 17 above). The applicant also alleged that the abusers had tried to rape with a broom stick; however, this fact was not conclusively established. In any event, the Court finds that the treatment to which the applicant was subjected by his fellow inmates between 7 and 10 September 2007 was sufficiently serious to render such treatment inhuman and degrading, contrary to the guarantees of Article 3 of the Convention. It therefore remains to be determined whether the State authorities can be held accountable for the ill-treatment of which the applicant was a victim.",

In particular, it has held that to successfully argue a violation of his Article 3 right, it would be sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that the authorities had not taken all steps which could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent real and immediate risks to the applicant\u2019s physical integrity, of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge. The answer to the question whether the authorities fulfilled their positive obligation under Article 3 will depend on all the circumstances of the case under examination (see Premininy v. Russia, no. 44973/04, \u00a7 84, 10 February 2011). The Court therefore has to establish whether, in the circumstances of the present case, the authorities knew or ought to have known that the applicant was at risk of being subjected to illtreatment at the hands of his inmates P.O. and T.G., and if so, whether the administration of the Warsaw-Mokot\u00f3w Remand Centre, within the limits of their official powers, took reasonably available measures to eliminate that risk and to protect the applicant from abuse. In this context the Court also refers to the Recommendation Rec(2006)2 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on the European Prison Rules to the effect that the authorities have an obligation to put in place procedures ensuring the safety of prisoners and reducing to a minimum the risk of violence and other events that might threaten safety (see paragraph\u00a069 above).",

On the basis of the material submitted by the applicant the Court finds that the police was not actively pursuing their inquiry until the end of March 2008, i.e. six months after the alleged events. It was only on 21 March 2008 that the police took statements from one of the guards of the Remand Centre. On 27\u00a0March 2008 the police interviewed A.S., the inmate who had witnessed the ill-treatment and T.G., one of the alleged perpetrators. On 28 March 2008 P.O., the second alleged perpetrator was interviewed.",

The decision was taken on the same day on which the police interviewed P.O., one of the alleged perpetrators. The decision to discontinue the investigation was confirmed by the junior prosecutor on 31 March 2008. The Court notes the brief and perfunctory reasons for the decision quoted verbatim above (see paragraph 30 above). The decision did not address a direct contradiction between the evidence of inmate A.S. who confirmed the acts of ill-treatment and the evidence of the alleged perpetrators who stated that they simply teased the applicant. There was no reference in the decision to important items of evidence, such as the report from the internal prison inquiry or medical evidence attesting to the applicant\u2019s injuries. In addition, it does not appear, as alleged by the applicant and not refuted by the Government, that the police took statements from all prison guards or members of medical personnel who had been on duty during the material time. Neither they interviewed all inmates from cell no. 6, and in particular from J.C. who had allegedly taken part, even if inadvertently, in the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment. The evidence of those witnesses would have been relevant to establish the circumstances related to the impugned ill-treatment. The police also appears not to have inquired whether it was possible to obtain any evidence from the CCTV monitoring. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the question of possible negligence of the prison staff was addressed in the decision. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that the police inquiry was not conducted in a diligent manner. It considers that the authorities did not take all necessary steps to ensure, as far as possible, that all the facts were established, that culpable conduct was exposed and that those responsible were held accountable (see Premininy, cited above, \u00a7 96).",

The Court does not question the classification of the alleged offence by the District Court, these matters normally falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the national criminal courts (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 123). On the other hand, the Court notes that in his appeal against the police\u2019s decision to discontinue the inquiry the applicant argued that the reason for his illtreatment was the nature of the charge against him (a sexual offence involving a minor).
