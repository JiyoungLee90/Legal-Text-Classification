They contended that the doctors who examined detainees were civil servants who were pressurised by the authorities into ignoring evidence of ill-treatment and not noting it in their reports. Thus, the medical report prepared on 20 May 1998 under police supervision made no reference to any finding of ill-treatment whereas the judge at the Batman Magistrates' Court noted that the first applicant's left eye was bruised. The doctor attached to the Batman prison also noted this injury in his report of 21 May 1998. The applicants denied the authenticity of the protocol dated 20 May 1998 alleging that it was drafted following the communication of their application before the Court to the Turkish government.

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman\u00a0v.
