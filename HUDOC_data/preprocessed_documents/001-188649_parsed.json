The Court has indeed acknowledged that while the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, there may, in certain circumstances, be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life (see, among other authorities, Botta, \u00a7 33). However, it has held that Art. 8 ECHR does not impose on the Contracting States any obligation to provide specific financial assistance or to guarantee a specific standard of living (see Petrovic v. Austria, 27 March 1998, Reports 1998-II p. 579 \u00a7 26 et seq., and the inadmissibility decision in Pancenko v. Latvia, 28 October 1999). That provision places no restriction on the Contracting States\u2019 freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, 12\u00a0April\u00a02006, ECHR Reports 2006-VI p. 159, \u00a7 53). The ECtHR has thus considered that a refusal to grant a parental leave allowance cannot amount to a failure to respect family life, since Article 8 of the Convention does not impose any positive obligation on States to provide the financial assistance in question (see Petrovic, \u00a7 26).",

Nor does this measure impinge on the necessary respect for the home within the meaning of Art. 8 (1) ECHR and the European Court\u2019s case-law, which the appellants have interpreted broadly, as it does not involve any practical infringement of the area in which their private and family life develops.

The extraordinary invalidity pension pursues the same aim for individuals who have been disabled since birth (or have become disabled without having acquired entitlement to an ordinary pension). As regards the invalidity allowance, it is awarded on the basis of a long-term need for assistance by others or for the personal supervision of the insured person concerned in performing ordinary everyday actions on account of a health impairment.",

From that angle, the benefits are, precisely, intended to enable adult beneficiaries to lead as autonomous a life as possible, without having to depend on help and assistance from members of their families. They are not designed to promote family life or to intervene in personal or family relationships. Contrary to the examples cited by the appellants, and according to a legal opinion to which they refer (Matthias\u00a0Kradolfer, op. cit., p. 73), to wit a parental leave allowance (see Petrovic, \u00a7 27) and an \u2018assistance pension\u2019 paid to the parents of a disabled child (see Moskal v Poland \u00a7 93), the Swiss extraordinary invalidity pension and disability allowance are not aimed at enabling one of the parents to remain at home in order to look after their (adult) child.

Foreign residents can also obtain this pass if there is a \u201csufficient\u00a0link\u201d with the State of origin. Italy allows beneficiaries of some benefits to retain them abroad, albeit only for six months or for serious medical reasons. Poland also permits the exportation of specific benefits in the event of a temporary absence from the country. Belgium and Ireland allow for derogations from the general rule of non-exportability, particularly in cases of extreme necessity. In Portugal, exportation is exceptionally possible where the disabled person is accompanying a close relative working abroad in the Portuguese national interest.",

It was first and foremost a mixed benefit: on the one hand it had specific social-security features in that the persons concerned had a clearly defined right to that benefit and it covered the invalidity risk; on the other hand it was also linked to social assistance in that it was not based on periods of work or contribution and was not aimed at mitigating a situation of need by providing a minimum living wage to a socially underprivileged group (young persons with disabilities). The extraordinary pension was also a special benefit, since it was an alternative allowance aimed at persons who did not fulfil the insurance conditions to obtain an ordinary invalidity pension; it was closely linked to the socio-economic situation in Switzerland, since it corresponded to the minimum pension in that State. Finally, the extraordinary pension was non-contributory, as it was not funded from contributions but exclusively by the Confederation (see proposal of 28\u00a0June\u00a02010 cited above, p. 8).\u201d",

There is, therefore, nothing unusual or arbitrary about it. Secondly, the classification as \u201cnon-contributory benefits\u201d of the two benefits in issue in the present case, to wit, an extraordinary invalidity pension and a disability allowance, is in conformity with the practice of Council of Europe member States and with EU law. Thirdly, it cannot be overlooked that the fact of making entitlement to non-contributory benefits subject to a condition of residence in the paying country is the general rule in almost all the member countries of the Council of Europe and in all three Council of Europe non-member States compared (see paragraph 31 above).

In that regard, the Court considers particularly relevant the Government\u2019s argument to the effect that a non-contributory benefit is supposed to guarantee that disabled persons who did not satisfy the conditions for obtaining an ordinary pension could benefit from the solidarity of others and have the requisite means of subsistence to live in Switzerland. However, it is not contrary to the Convention to hold that the preservation of that solidarity mechanism depends on the will and the trust of other people, which requires the grant of benefits to be subject to certain conditions, for example requiring beneficiaries to have their ordinary residence in Switzerland. It is reasonable for a State granting non-contributory benefits not to wish to pay them abroad, particularly if the cost of living in the foreign country in question is considerably lower.",

In the present case, as stated by the Federal Court (see paragraph\u00a015 of the judgment) and the Government (see paragraph\u00a049 of the judgment), the purpose of the extraordinary invalidity pension and the disability allowance is not to facilitate family life. As the Government and the Federal Court explained, \u201cthey were designed to allow adult beneficiaries to lead an autonomous, independent life\u201d (paragraph 49) and \u201care paid regardless of the beneficiaries\u2019 lifestyle, that is, irrespective of whether they live alone, with family or in an institution\u201d (paragraph\u00a015).

The principle that a State cannot be held responsible on the basis of a Protocol which it has not ratified through the intermediary of another provision of the Convention is established in the case-law of the Court.

Conversely, persons who were not born with a disability but became disabled later on in their lives and had been able to contribute at some point of time before their invalidity, even for at least one year (see paragraph 24 of the judgment), can receive the disability benefits even if they too are domiciled outside Switzerland, like the first applicant.",

What is important is that the Court has not so far assessed the compatibility of the distinction in question with the Convention provisions, especially Article 8, and the present case would have been an excellent opportunity for the Court to decide the issue, but the majority preferred to simply defer to the relevant EU rules in order to be satisfied that there was no breach of Article 14.",

As far as the nature of the measure is concerned, the present case entails a request for social benefits, based on Swiss law, in favour of a person who has suffered from a major disability from birth. Therefore, the application is relevant to the most vulnerable group of persons who have been victims, and continue to be victims, of stigmatisation, disadvantages and discrimination in society. Regarding the aim pursued by the distinction, the Government invokes solidarity within the insurance regime, but this is only a very general and abstract principle that cannot be overestimated in the present case. Bearing in mind this solidarity, which did not benefit anybody in the instance case, the authorities clearly tried to bind the first applicant to Switzerland, with a real risk of her being sent to a special care home since the second applicant might chose to enjoy her family life with her husband in Brazil and because the first applicant\u2019s father cannot take care of her. Such a solution is of course diametrically opposed to the spirit and purposes of contemporary laws in the sphere of protecting persons with disabilities, geared to integrating such persons in society as far as possible.",
