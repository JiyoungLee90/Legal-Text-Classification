The basis of this principle is the designation of land for public use. As long as it remains thus designated, and no express decision has been taken reclassifying particular public land as private property, no transfer of land can be authorised. It is a means of preventing public land from being acquired by prescription or adverse possession under private law, hence the principle of imprescriptibility that is very often associated with the principle of inalienability.

It has not, however, recognised that the principle of inalienability has any constitutional status (CC, dec. no. 94-346 of 21 July 1994, Rights in rem over public property). The Conseil d\u2019Etat has recently reiterated that \u201cwhere property belonging to a public authority has been incorporated into the category of public land by virtue of a decision classifying it thus, it shall remain public land unless a decision is given expressly reclassifying it as private property\u201d. Accordingly, it has held that the question whether or not short-stay factories fell into the category of public property was not affected by the fact \u201cthat these short-stay factories were intended to be rented or assigned to the occupants or that the occupancy leases granted were private-law contracts\u201d (CE, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Lucofer, 26\u00a0March 2008).",

Moreover, the fact that public land is inalienable means \u2013 in theory \u2013 that no rights in rem can be established over it. However, the legislature has departed from this principle by passing two Acts, one of 5\u00a0January 1988 which creates long administrative leases, and the other of 25\u00a0July 1994 on the constitution of rights in rem over public land, thus making it possible to grant private rights in rem to occupants of maritime public property. The Act of 5 January 1988 concerns only public land belonging to local and regional authorities or groups thereof. The Act of 25\u00a0July 1994 relates to artificial maritime property and immovable constructions and installations built for the purposes of an authorised activity (Article L. 34-1 of the Code of State Property and Article L. 2122-6 of the CGPPP). In its above-mentioned decision of 21 July 1994, the Constitutional Council held that granting rights in rem in this way was compatible with the Constitution as public services were maintained and public property protected under the Act of 25 July 1994. However, it declared the provision allowing the renewal of authorisation beyond seventy years unconstitutional on the ground that it could potentially render ineffective the public authority\u2019s right to the automatic return, free of charge, of any constructions and therefore undermine the \u201cprotection due to public property\u201d.",

The latter are called concessions to occupy public land, which \u2013 on maritime public property \u2013 may be a beach concession or a concession to build a dyke. By means of this concession, the State authorises the concessionaire to carry out works on the foreshore by which land is removed from the action of the tide. In respect of natural maritime public property an arrangement was established in 1807, traditionally called a concession to build a dyke and by which ownership was transferred (former Article L. 64 of the Code of State Property): the concessionaire was authorised to drain land, which, once removed from the action of the tide, no longer fell within the definition of natural maritime public property and could therefore be reclassified as private property and transferred by the State. That arrangement, which was originally used to build agricultural polders, has more recently been used for property developments in the form of marinas, reclaimed from the sea. Following a reaction to what was perceived as a privatisation of the shore, a circular was issued in 1973 prohibiting such arrangements \u2013 a prohibition later confirmed by the Coastal Areas Act, which imposes a broader prohibition on any interference with the natural state of the shore. It is now no longer possible to build marinas or polders by means of concessions to build dykes by which ownership is transferred. This arrangement can now apply only to past draining works and is the sole means of legalising these (source: , consulted on 3 February 2010).",

It is in this spirit that the Coastal Areas Act of 3 January 1986 (consolidated on 7 August 2007) was unanimously passed by Parliament. Section 1 of the Act provides that coastal areas are \u201cgeographical entities which call for a specific policy of development, protection and enhancement\u201d. The general principles of that Act consist in preserving rare and fragile areas, managing spatial planning and tourist development economically and, lastly, making the shore \u2013 like the beach \u2013 more widely accessible to the public and giving priority in coastal areas to marine-related activities.",

Only four States (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sweden and the United Kingdom) do not recognise the existence of maritime public property exclusive of any private ownership rights. In the other twelve States (Croatia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey), maritime public property belongs either to the State or to other public bodies and is inalienable on that basis. In all these States maritime public property can nevertheless be designated for private use on the basis of fixed-term concessions. And in all these States illegal use exposes the offender to administrative or even criminal penalties. In particular, the illegal construction of immovable property can result in the offender being ordered to demolish the building concerned at his or her own expense and without compensation. This type of measure also exists in , where the private right of ownership of land on the seashore is recognised by law but the land is subject to relatively strict easements which prohibit the construction of new buildings and guarantee public access to the sea.",

It accepts that the domestic courts analysed the interference with the property in question only from the standpoint of its classification as public property. It observes, further, that by issuing successive decisions authorising occupancy, the State de facto weakened the protection of the property\u2019s designation as land for the benefit of the public. However, it is since the enactment of the Coastal Areas Act \u2013 section 1 of which provides that \u201cthe coast is a geographical entity that requires a specific development, conservation and enhancement policy\u201d \u2013 that authorisations have no longer been renewed, with the aim of protecting the seashore and more generally the environment. The Court reiterates that environmental conservation, which in today\u2019s society is an increasingly important consideration (see Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1), 18 February 1991, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 192), has become a cause whose defence arouses the constant and sustained interest of the public, and consequently the public authorities. The Court has stressed this point a number of times with regard to the protection of the countryside and forests (see Turgut and Others, cited above, \u00a7 90; K\u00f6ktepe, cited above, \u00a7 87; and \u015eat\u0131r, cited above, \u00a7 33). The protection of coastal areas, and in particular beaches, which are \u201ca public area open to all\u201d, is another example (see N.A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 40) of an area where an appropriate planning policy is required. The Court therefore considers that the interference pursued a legitimate aim that was in the general interest: to promote unrestricted access to the shore, the importance of which has been clearly established (see paragraphs 46-49 and 51 and 54 above).",

The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, and therefore also in the second paragraph thereof: there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v.

The Court also observes that the house was apparently built over a century ago on public land drained for that purpose without any concession authorising the construction (see paragraph 24 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the question of whether the house was legally built should not be a matter for consideration in the present case. In any event, the alleged illegality of the building should not be held against the applicant, particularly as it is not disputed that he acquired his \u201cpossession\u201d in good faith. His situation is therefore clearly different from that of an individual who has knowingly erected a building without a permit (see, by contrast, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z; Saliba; and Hamer, all cited above). The house in question is not therefore comparable with those that have recently been illegally built along the coast.",

Each prefectoral decision authorising occupancy specified the length of the authorisation and, in accordance with former Article A 26 of the Code of State Property, that the authorities could modify or withdraw the authorisation should they deem it necessary, on any ground whatsoever, without the permittee thereby acquiring any right to claim compensation. Furthermore, it was specified that the permittee must, if required, restore the site to its original state by demolishing the constructions built on the public property, including those existing on the date on which the decision was signed. The Court concludes from this that the applicant had always known that the decisions authorising occupancy were precarious and revocable and considers that the authorities cannot therefore be deemed to have contributed to maintaining uncertainty regarding the legal status of the \u201cpossession\u201d (see, by contrast, Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-I).",

Accordingly, there is no evidence to support the applicant\u2019s suggestion that the authorities\u2019 responsibility for the uncertainty regarding the status of the house increased with the passage of time (see paragraph 60 above). The exceptional length of the occupancy and certain hesitations on the part of the authorities (see paragraphs 14 and 29 above) should be viewed in the context at the relevant time, when development and environmental concerns had not yet reached the degree witnessed today. It was not until 1986 that the applicant\u2019s situation changed, following the enactment of the Coastal Areas Act which put an end to a policy of protecting coastal areas merely by applying the rules governing public property. In any event, the above-mentioned tolerance could not result in a legalisation ex post facto of the status quo.",

The Court reiterates in this connection, however, that it is first and foremost for the national authorities to decide which type of measures should be imposed to protect coastal areas. These will depend on urban and regional planning policies, which are, by definition, evolutive, and are, par excellence, spheres in which the State intervenes, particularly through control of property in the general or public interest (see Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070, and Galtieri v.

Furthermore, prior to the Coastal Areas Act, the applicant did not request a concession to build a dyke at a time when he could perhaps still have done so. However, the State started reacting as early as 1973 to the risk of public property being used for private ends (see paragraph 43 above).",

I agree with the Government\u2019s submission that the impossibility of acquiring property by adverse possession invalidates the argument relating to the effect of the length of occupation of the site; accordingly, no legitimate expectation of being able to continue enjoying the \u201cpossession\u201d arose in favour of the applicant and his wife (see paragraph 61 of the judgment).",

It is true that the applicant has always been aware that his continued possession and occupation of the house was precarious, the decisions authorising the temporary occupation of the dyke and house, from the date of purchase, expressly reserving to the authorities the right to modify or withdraw the authorisation should they deem it necessary on any ground, without the permittee acquiring a right to claim damages or compensation in that regard. The decisions also made clear that, if required, the permittee would be obliged to restore the site to its original state by demolishing any constructions built on the public property, including those existing on the date of the decision, and that should he fail to comply with that obligation, the authorities would do so of their own motion and at his expense. However, it is also true that the authorisation had been consistently renewed by the authorities, after the applicant had purchased the house, in the years 1961, 1975, 1986 and 1991 without the applicant being given any reason to believe that the authorisation would not continue to be granted for a house which had been in existence from the 1880s.

While we do not find it necessary to characterise the actions of the authorities as negligence, we attach weight to the lack of coherence of those actions which, to use the words of the Government Commissioner, allowed occupants of public property to nurture for almost a century the hope that they would not be brutally compelled to demolish their property. This lack of coherence is reinforced by the events following a fire in 2005 when the applicant applied for a building permit to restore the house to its previous condition. By a decision of 5 September 2005, he was issued with a building permit after a favourable opinion given by an architect from the Architectes des b\u00e2timents de France under the 1986 Act; however, the permit was subsequently revoked at the request of the prefect on the ground that it was illegal because it had been issued in contravention of the rules of inalienability and imprescriptibility of public property. In this respect, we reiterate the Court\u2019s finding that, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate manner and with utmost consistency (see Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000-I).",

Reliance is placed by the majority on the fact that the applicant refused the compromise solution in the prefect\u2019s proposal that he should continue in occupation of the house subject to certain conditions. We acknowledge that the prefect\u2019s offer went some way towards redressing the balance and that, to use the words of the Government Commissioner, the offer was at least preferable to the \u201cdrastic solution\u201d of a straightforward demolition order. However, in the end we have concluded that the proposal was not such as to restore a fair balance, since it imposed substantially greater restrictions on the applicant\u2019s continued enjoyment of his property, by not only confining the use of the house to strictly personal use and prohibiting any sale or transfer of it or any work other than maintenance work, but by reserving to the State an option on the expiry of the authorisation to have the land restored to its original state or to reuse the building. In short, under the proposal the continued ownership and occupancy of the house would not survive the life of the applicant himself, whose family members would be deprived of a very valuable possession which would pass to the authorities without any compensation being paid. We note, in this regard, that the very fact that under the proposal the State reserved the right to preserve and reuse the house on the expiry of any authorisation is itself difficult to reconcile with any compelling need to restore the natural state of the shoreline.",

The present case can be distinguished from the above-mentioned ones, however. The applicant, who was unaware when he bought his house that it had been built illegally built on publicly owned land, referred to the decades spent peacefully in a strong social and family environment, thus raising a matter which, in my opinion, falls within the category of a right to \u201cprivate life\u201d and to \u201cfamily life\u201d guaranteed by Article\u00a08. I would have preferred the Court to examine the case under that provision rather than under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Far from calling into question the submissions of the applicants\u2019 representatives or the Court, I simply subscribe to the concurring opinion of Judge Casadevall, who expressed doubts as to the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in this case, and rightly so, as it is in reality the right to respect for \u201chome\u201d (\u201chouse\u201d if this concept is applied to a second home) that is at stake here.",
