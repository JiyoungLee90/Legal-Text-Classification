The case originated in an application (no. 45435/99) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Commission under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Croatian nationals, Mr Zvonimir Radoš, Mr Goran Lajnert, Mr Dmitar Malešević, Mr Branko Jugović, Mr Stjepan Živković and Mr Gojko Mikecin (“the applicants”), on 23 December 1996.
The applicants were represented by the second applicant Mr Goran Lajnert, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Lidija Lukina- Karajković.
The applicants alleged that several sets of proceedings concerning their civil claims for re-payment of loans had exceeded the “reasonable time” requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and that they had no remedy at their disposal in respect of the length of these proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 23 October 2001 the Court declared the application partly admissible and joined the question concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies to the merits.
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Court has decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine). On 19 and 26 July 2001, respectively the Government and the applicants replied in writing to each other’s observations.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
On 4 July 2002, following a friendly settlement, the Court adopted a partial judgment in respect of the sixth applicant Mr Gojko Mikecin.
The first to fifth applicants were born in 1929, 1970, 1934, 1929 and 1934 respectively and live in Zagreb.
During 1992 the applicants lent various sums of money to a number of agencies that were supposed to pay back the loans within periods ranging from 2 to 12 months and at interest rates ranging from 10 to 30 % per month (so called “financial engineering”). As these agencies failed to re-pay the loans, the applicants instituted civil proceedings against the agencies and their alleged owners.
On 18 October 1993 the applicant filed an action with the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) seeking payment of his loan in the amount of 10,000 German Marks (DEM).
The preliminary hearing scheduled for 24 January 1994 was adjourned.
As on 15 February 1994 the presiding judge resigned from her office, the case was transferred to another judge in October 1996.
The next hearing scheduled for 6 December 2000 was adjourned because the presiding judge was absent.
The hearing scheduled for 20 April 2001 was adjourned because B.J. did not appear. As the documents indicated that she had been released from detention on remand, the court invited the applicant to submit her new address. When the applicant informed the court that he did not know B.J.’s new address, the court requested the Ministry of Interior (Ministarstvo unutarnjih poslova Republike Hrvatske) to submit B.J.’s new address. The Ministry of Interior informed the court that B.J. had changed her name into B.Č.
The hearings scheduled for 21 September 2001 and 4 April 2002 were adjourned because B.J. had not collected a notice of the hearing date.
It appears that the proceedings are pending before the court of first instance.
On 18 October 1993 the applicant filed an action with the Zagreb Municipal Court for re-payment of his loan in the amount of DEM 20,000.
Before the period to be examined by the Court several hearings were held and several adjourned. The hearing scheduled for 18 June 1997 was adjourned because B.B. did not appear. The court invited the applicant to submit the number of the case-file concerning criminal proceedings against B.B. before the same court.
As the applicant failed to do so, the court itself found the file number, but was unable to review that file because it was sent to the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) on 13 June 1997. The court repeated its request to examine the file on 15 November 1998, 15 September 1999 and 5 September 2000.
As neither party appeared at the hearing scheduled for 11 April 2001 the court found that the applicant had withdrawn his claim.
The applicant appealed against that decision stating that he had been ill on the date of the hearing. On 23 May 2001 the court invited the applicant to submit evidence as to the fact that he had been ill. The applicant appeared before the court on 13 June 2001 and stated that he had no medical documentation.
On 5 July the court sent the case-file to the Zagreb County Court as the appellate court. However that court found that the applicant’s appeal in effect had been a request to resume the proceedings. Consequently, on 22 October 2001 the case-file was returned to the Zagreb Municipal Court.
It appears that the proceedings are pending before the Zagreb Municipal Court.
On 6 May 1993 the applicant, together with 244 other plaintiffs, filed an action for re-payment of their loans with the Zagreb Municipal Court. The applicant claimed a sum of DEM 28,000.
Before the period to be examined by the Court two hearings were held.
On 17 July 1997 the court dismissed the claims of 43 plaintiffs, but not in respect of the second applicant. As on 24 September 1997 the plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed appealed against that decision, the case file was sent to the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) on 29 September 1997, for consideration on appeal.
On 14 July 1998 the Zagreb County Court upheld the first instance decision except in respect of one of the plaintiffs.
On 10 February 1999 the Zagreb Municipal Court invited the plaintiffs’ counsel to submit a certificate from the registry of the Zagreb Commercial Court (Trgovački sud u Zagrebu) regarding the legal status of F.I.M.
On 10 March 1999 the plaintiffs’ counsel withdrew the claim in respect of F.I.M.
The next hearing took place on 18 June 1999.
At the hearing on 14 October 1999 the court heard Đ.M. and then adopted judgment rejecting all claims. The judgment was served on the plaintiffs’ counsel on 26 September 2000. On 4 October 2000 the plaintiffs’ counsel appealed against the judgment.
The Zagreb County Court, as the appellate court, found that the appeal was submitted by Mr Lajnert on behalf of all plaintiffs although he had not had a power of attorney. The case file was therefore returned to the Zagreb Municipal Court on 20 September 2001. On 27 September 2001 the Zagreb Municipal Court invited Mr Lajnert to submit a power of attorney to represent the other plaintiffs. 
It appears that the proceedings are pending on appeal before the Zagreb County Court.
On 1 June 1993 the applicant, together with 603 other plaintiffs, filed an action with the Zagreb Municipal Court for re-payment of their loans. The applicant claimed DEM 16,500.
Before the period to be taken into account one hearing was held and one was adjourned.
At the next hearing on 2 February 1998 the court invited the plaintiffs to submit additional documentation.
Although they failed to submit that documentation, the next hearing was held on 10 April 2000. The plaintiffs asked the court to hear several witnesses but were unable to submit their addresses.
On 10 November 2000 the court invited the plaintiffs to submit further evidence necessary to proceed with the case. The plaintiffs claimed that they were members of the “Association of the Financial Engineering Investors V.M.M.”, but did not submit either its registration certificate or its articles of association. Furthermore, three plaintiffs failed to submit evidence as to their investments into the “financial engineering” and seven plaintiffs failed to submit their addresses.
At the hearing on 15 December 2000 the plaintiffs’ counsel submitted the registration certificate and the articles of association as well as the addresses of the witnesses to be heard.
At the hearing on 31 January 2001 the court heard one witness. It invited again the plaintiffs’ counsel to submit evidence in respect of three plaintiffs as to their investments into the “financial engineering” as well as the addresses of seven plaintiffs.
On 22 February 2001 the plaintiffs submitted the requested addresses and asked the court to allow them an additional period of 30 days to submit evidence in respect of three plaintiffs as to their investments into “financial engineering”.
On 2 May 2001 the plaintiffs submitted evidence in respect of two plaintiffs as to their investments but were unable to produce such evidence for the third plaintiff. They also changed their claims.
At the next hearing scheduled for 17 September 2001 the court stayed the proceedings because the plaintiffs’ representative did not appear.
On 1 October 2001 the applicant filed a request to resume the proceedings.
It appears that the proceedings are pending before the court of first instance.
On 21 December 1994 the applicant filed an action with the Zagreb Municipal Court for re-payment of his loan in the amount of Swiss Francs (CHF) 15,000.
Before the period to be examined by the Court two hearings were adjourned. It turned out that F.I.S. had ceased to exist and that J.S. had changed her address. In 1995 the court invited the applicant to submit her correct address within 30 days.
On 14 May 1998 the court repeated its request.
On 25 May 1998 the applicant submitted J.S.’s new address.
On 21 July 1998 the court ordered the applicant to request the Social Welfare Centre (Centar za socijalnu skrb) to appoint a legal representative for J. S.
On 11 December 1998 the Zagreb Social Welfare Centre informed the court that by a decision of 8 December 1998 it had appointed a legal representative for J.S.
At the next hearing on 7 April 1999 the representative gave her reply to the applicant’s claim. The applicant informed the court that he had obtained J.S.’s new address and asked the court to invite J.S. to the next hearing.
At the next hearing on 21 May 1999 the applicant was heard. J.S. failed to appear. Her representative asked the court to enclose the case-file concerning the criminal proceedings against J.S. before the same court.
However, the court was unable to enclose the criminal case file as the criminal proceedings against J.S. were still pending.
According to the Government, on 28 December 2000 the court requested the Zagreb Commercial Court’s registry to submit a certificate regarding the legal status of F.I.S. It turned out that on 18 July 2001 the Zagreb Commercial Court had instituted ex officio proceedings for liquidation of F.I.S.
At the next hearing on 19 December 2001 the court concluded the proceedings.
On 5 October 1995 the applicant, together with five other plaintiffs, filed an action with the Zagreb Municipal Court for re-payment of their loans. The applicant claimed a sum of DEM 5,000.

The next hearing scheduled for 7 June 1999 was adjourned because four plaintiffs, including the applicant, who were supposed to be heard, failed to appear.

On 21 July 1999 the plaintiffs’ counsel submitted their addresses.
The next hearing scheduled for 2 April 2001 was adjourned because I.A. did not appear.

On 3 February 1998 the Ministry of Interior informed the court that B.J.’s address was unknown.

On 21 May 2001 the plaintiffs’ counsel asked the court to request the Social Welfare Centre to appoint a legal representative for B.J.

The court scheduled the next hearing for 6 November 1997 and invited B.B. to submit the evidence he relied on in his written reply to the plaintiffs’ claims. However, he failed to do so and also did not appear at the hearing. The plaintiffs’ counsel submitted that B.B. was found guilty for fraud in criminal proceedings conducted before the same court in connection with the plaintiffs’ loans. On 10 November 1997 the plaintiffs’ counsel submitted the number of the criminal case-file against B.B.
On 14 November 1997 the court requested the criminal case-file against B.B. from the criminal division of the Zagreb Municipal Court, but the case-file was at the Zagreb County Court pending decision on appeal.
The court repeated its request to enclose the criminal case-file on 22 October 1998, 11 March and 22 November 1999 and 24 October 2000, but the case-file was at the Public Prosecutor’s Office (Ured državnog odvjetništva).

Section 59 (4) of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (which entered into force on 24 September 1999 – hereinafter “the Constitutional Court Act” – Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu) reads as follows:
“The Constitutional Court may, exceptionally, examine a constitutional complaint prior to exhaustion of other available remedies if it is satisfied that a contested act, or failure to act within a reasonable time, grossly violates a party’s constitutional rights and freedoms and that, if it does not act, a party will risk serious and irreparable consequences.”
Section 26 of the Constitutional Act on the Changes of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (entered into force on 15 March 2002, published in the Official Gazette no. 29 of 22 March 2002 – hereinafter “The Act of 15 March 2002” – Ustavni zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Ustavnog zakona o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske) introduced a new Section 59 (a), which subsequently became Section 63 of the 2002 Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court. The relevant parts of that Section read as follows:
(1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint even before all legal remedies have been exhausted in cases when a competent court has not decided within a reasonable time a claim concerning the applicant’s rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him ...
(2) If the constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this Section is accepted, the Constitutional Court shall determine a time-limit within which a competent court shall decide the case on the merits... 
(3) In a decision under paragraph 2 of this Article, the Constitutional Court shall fix appropriate compensation for the applicant in respect of the violation found concerning his constitutional rights ... The compensation shall be paid from the State budget within a term of three months from the date when the party lodged a request for its payment.
