According to him, the commander of the investigative-operational unit of the ROVD, Major\u00a0A.S., had dragged him out of the car by his beard and had hit him on the head with the butt of a machine gun. He and his two friends had then been subjected to beatings, taken to the police station and then to its courtyard. Her son had been questioned afterwards about his religious beliefs and his beard; Major A.S. had filmed it all on a telephone. After spending a night in the cell without food, drink or medical assistance, her son had been taken to court and fined for an administrative violation. No paperwork concerning either his detention or the court proceedings had been given to him. He had then been taken home. By 4 and 5 May 2010 his health had deteriorated as he could not walk or speak. Indeed, his state had worsened because his two ribs had been broken by Major A.S. The fractured ribs had damaged an artery, which in turn had caused extensive internal bleeding.

Indeed, the essential purpose of an investigation under Article 2 is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7\u00a0105, 4 May 2001; Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0110, ECHR 2005VII; and Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a055721/07, \u00a7 163, ECHR 2011). Article 2 requires investigations to be prompt (see Armani Da Silva, cited above, \u00a7 237) and to proceed with reasonable expedition (see Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a023458/02, \u00a7\u00a0305, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The Court accepts that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, but it considers that a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, \u00a7 167; Tahsin Acar v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a026307/95, \u00a7 224, ECHR 2004III; and Armani Da Silva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0237).

Keeping in mind the principles established by its case law (see paragraphs 83 and 84 below) and given the investigators\u2019 systematic and clear failure to comply with the orders issued by their superiors, the Court finds that any further challenge by the applicants before a court of the very same failures would appear devoid of any practical purpose (see, for example, Aliyev and Gadzhiyeva v. Russia, no. 11059/12, \u00a7\u00a7 99-100, 12 July 2016).

This assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no.\u00a023380/09, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2015). In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element, which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim,\u00a0inter alia, of inflicting punishment or intimidating (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 197). Keeping in mind these criteria, the Court finds that the ill-treatment to which Mr Satybalov was subjected between 2 and 3 May 2010 (see paragraphs 9-12 and 18-20 above) and which led to his subsequent death on 7 May 2010 amounted to torture.",

The right to liberty and security is of the highest importance in a \u201cdemocratic society\u201d within the meaning of the Convention (see Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 2010). The Court therefore considers that the unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of the fundamentally important guarantees contained in Article 5 of the Convention and discloses a most grave violation of that provision (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0233; Al Nashiri v. Poland, no. 28761/11, \u00a7 529, 24 July 2014; and Belozorov v.\u00a0Russia and Ukraine, no. 43611/02, \u00a7 113, 15 October 2015). The absence of a record of such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible, inter alia, with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7\u00a0125, Reports 1998III). It is also incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness under the Convention (see Anguelova v.
