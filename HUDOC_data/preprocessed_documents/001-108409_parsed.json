It is central to the concept of a fair trial, in civil as in criminal proceedings, that a litigant is not denied the opportunity to present his or her case effectively before the courts and that he or she is able to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2005-II).",

Poland, no. 18176/05, \u00a7 37, 8 December 2009). The question whether the provision of legal aid is necessary for a fair hearing must be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of each case and will depend, inter alia, upon the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the proceedings, the complexity of the relevant law and procedure and the applicant\u2019s capacity to represent him or herself effectively.",

Turkey, no. 50939/99, \u00a7\u00a7 74-78, 12 June 2007; Mehmet and Suna Yi\u011fit, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 31-39; Ey\u00fcp Kaya v. Turkey, no. 17582/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22-26, 23\u00a0September 2008; and Kaba v. Turkey, no. 1236/05, \u00a7\u00a7 19-25, 1\u00a0March 2011). The Court has also examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned cases. In this respect, it would once again recall that pursuant to Article 469 of the CCP, decisions regarding legal aid are binding and are delivered on the basis of the case file, without hearing the applicants (Bakan, cited above, \u00a7 76). The Court further observes that the refusal of the applicant\u2019s legal aid application deprived her of the possibility of submitting her case before a tribunal.",

The Court finds that this principle applies in the present case as well. Consequently, it considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to quash or otherwise set aside the Izmir Administrative Court\u2019s decision dated 14 June 2006 (paragraph 11 above) and restart the proceedings, in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, should the applicant so request.",
