The applicant had observed indications of sexual abuse which other experts had not been able to detect. In Dr A.K.\u2019s opinion, the applicant was in need of involuntary psychiatric treatment in order to recover from her disorder, which mainly related to judicial matters, but also to a delusion of grandeur as to the correctness of her own actions. Further, as a doctor she was endangering other people\u2019s well-being by prescribing them treatment which put their health at risk. Because the applicant had for a long time evaded psychiatric assessment, and as she opposed treatment, outpatient treatment would not be sufficient. In conclusion, Dr A.K. considered that the applicant was paranoid and that she had made accusations against various authorities about continued abuse of office. She had become entangled in the tiny details of her own case without being able to perceive the wider picture. He considered that her delusional disorder had reached the level of psychosis, which distorted her conception of reality. Owing to her illness, she did not understand the unlawfulness and repercussions of her actions and she had been psychotically deluded when she had taken part in the deprivation of a child\u2019s liberty.

As a general remark it was noted that the primary and sometimes only symptom of a delusional disorder was a false belief which the patient holds to and attempts to act upon. The delusion was continuous, clear and systematic, and could be very persistent and steadfast. It was common for a patient suffering from a delusional disorder not to manifest any other anomalous behaviour. A special form of delusion was what was known as a querulous delusion, which was characterised by continual claims for rectification, complaints and legal proceedings, driven by psychotic thinking, with the aim of restoring the person\u2019s injured self-esteem. A delusional disorder was treated with therapeutic consultations and antipsychotic medicines. Lack of motivation for treatment and an inadequate response to treatment posed fundamental risks to the successful outcome of medical treatment.

On 4 June 2001 the public prosecutor L.K. waived charges against the father, as there was no evidence that an offence had taken place during the period from September\u00a01998 to June 2000. In June 2000 the mother took V. to a university hospital for examination. Those examinations did not support her suspicions of sexual abuse. On 13 June 2000 the girl was taken into emergency public care because of her mother\u2019s mental health problems and was placed in a family support centre. An ordinary care order was made in July\u00a02000. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2000 the mother removed the girl from the centre without permission and they were found later that day in a town some 100 km away, whereupon the girl was returned to the centre by the police. On 3 April 2001 the Court of Appeal granted the father sole custody of the girl, who was to see her mother during supervised visits three times a week.",

In the Finnish system medical evaluation is thus done by two physicians of the same mental hospital in which the patient is detained. The patients do not therefore have the opportunity to benefit from a second, independent psychiatric opinion. The Court finds such an opportunity to be an important safeguard against possible arbitrariness in decision-making where the continuation of confinement in involuntary care is concerned. In this connection the Court also refers to the CPT\u2019s recommendation that periodic review of an order to treat a patient against his or her will in a psychiatric hospital should involve a psychiatric opinion which is independent of the hospital in which the patient is detained (see paragraph 133 above).

Leaving aside the question whether a period of six months can be considered a reasonable interval or not, the Court draws attention to the fact that under section 17(2) of the Mental Health Act this renewal is initiated by the domestic authorities. A patient who is detained in a mental hospital does not appear to have any opportunity to initiate any proceedings in which the issue of whether the conditions for his or her confinement for involuntary treatment are still met could be examined. The Court has found in its earlier case-law that a system of periodic review in which the initiative lay solely with the authorities was not sufficient on its own (see, mutatis mutandis, Rakevich v. , no.\u00a058973/00, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44, 28 October 2003, and Gorshkov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a067531/01, \u00a7 44, 8 November 2005).

Having regard to the opinion on the need to appoint a guardian expressed by the National Forensic Medical Authority and the applicant\u2019s written comments, holding an oral hearing had not, in the Government\u2019s view, been necessary. Moreover, the applicant had, at the detention hearing of 15 October 2004, and on a number of occasions during the criminal proceedings, argued before the court in person that she was in good health. She had thus had several opportunities to express orally before the District Court her opinion on the need to appoint a guardian, and she had taken advantage of those opportunities. Having regard to the fact that appointing a guardian for the purposes of criminal proceedings was a subordinate decision in the context of otherwise oral proceedings, the procedure followed by the District Court had satisfied the requirements of a fair trial.",

The court\u2019s decision was based on the statement of the National Forensic Medical Authority, according to which the applicant\u2019s capacity to look after her own interests in the ongoing criminal proceedings was reduced by her mental illness.

It has been established in the Court\u2019s case-law that Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not guarantee an absolute right to an oral hearing, and that the nature of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the national court (see, inter alia, Jussila v.  [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7 41-43, ECHR 2006XIII). The Court notes that Finnish law allows the Court of Appeal to dispense with an oral hearing where, inter alia, the matter to be decided is procedural only or the hearing is for another reason considered manifestly unnecessary. The Court notes that at this stage of the proceedings the Court of Appeal was merely called upon to examine whether the applicant was in need of a guardian for the criminal proceedings. The Court observes that the appellate court examined the applicant\u2019s appeal on the basis of her own submissions and that she was thus not prevented from putting forward any argument she wished to make to that court, even regarding her views concerning the correctness of the psychiatric assessment and her state of health. It is difficult to see how an oral hearing would have shed any more light on the matter, having regard in particular to the fact that the applicant did not name any witnesses to be heard before the court.",

The applicant failed to name any other person she considered suitable to be appointed guardian. Although the District Court did not give detailed reasons for considering Mr M.S. suitable, the Court observes at the outset that he was a lawyer and an experienced member of the Finnish Bar. While the applicant claimed before the Court that Mr M.S. was known as a business lawyer, it has not been alleged that he had no experience in other fields of law.

Witness testimony would also have shown that the applicant had not participated in the alleged kidnapping of V in [town A] on 16 December 2000 and that she had not transported the child and her mother in her car on that day.

Furthermore, it is not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard, and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003-V). The Court further takes note of the obligation on the part of the Finnish courts, as pointed out by the Government, to ensure that no irrelevant issues are introduced into the proceedings. Having regard to the above-mentioned matters, and in the absence of convincing reasons given by the applicant for the necessity of receiving the testimony of the five witnesses in question, the Court accepts that the District Court cannot be regarded as having exceeded its discretionary powers in refusing to hear the oral evidence proposed by the applicant at the main hearing.",

No witnesses were heard at that hearing, as the applicant\u2019s guardian did not find it necessary to call witnesses. The applicant, whose presence was no longer obligatory at that stage, had left the court before the hearing began. No formal decision on the applicant\u2019s request was taken by the District Court.

In a sphere covered by written law, the \u201claw\u201d is the enactment in force as the competent courts have interpreted it (see, inter alia, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Colas Est and Others v. France, no. 37971/97, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2002-III). In that connection the Court reiterates that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited, it being in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply that law (see, inter alia, Chappell v. the United Kingdom, 30 March 1989, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 152A). As submitted by the Government, section 8 of the Mental Health Act lays down the criteria for ordering the confinement of a person for involuntary care in a mental hospital. The Court would also observe that section 22b of that Act contains more detailed provisions on the treatment of mental illness. Subsection 3 stipulates that it is for the physician treating the patient to decide on the treatment to be given, regardless of the patient\u2019s wishes. The Court is thus satisfied that the interference complained of had a legal basis in Finnish law.",

According to the preparatory works relating to that provision (see Government Bill HE 113/2001 vp), a care order issued for involuntary hospitalisation of a psychiatric patient is understood also to contain an automatic authorisation to treat the patient, even against his or her will. Even though the doctors may seek to obtain a person\u2019s consent prior to the treatment, there is no obligation to have such consent in written form or to seek such consent from the patient\u2019s relatives or guardian. If a patient refuses to give his or her consent or withdraws consent given previously, the provision allows forcible administration of medication. This is, according to the preparatory documents relating to the Act, in the interests of the patient in order to secure his or her constitutional right to the necessary care in a situation in which he or she is not personally able to make a decision about the treatment on account of his or her illness.",

That authority in turn confirmed in its reply of 15 July 2005 that it was not competent to interfere directly with the administration of medication or to order it to be discontinued, as the power of decision-making in such matters lay with the doctors responsible for the patient\u2019s treatment.

In the present case such safeguards were missing. The decision to confine the applicant for involuntary treatment included an automatic authorisation to proceed to forcible administration of medication if the applicant refused the treatment. The decision-making was solely in the hands of the doctors treating the patient, who could take even quite radical measures regardless of the applicant\u2019s wishes. Moreover, their decision-making was free from any kind of immediate judicial scrutiny: the applicant did not have any remedy available whereby she could require a court to rule on the lawfulness, including proportionality, of the forced administration of medication, or to have it discontinued.",
