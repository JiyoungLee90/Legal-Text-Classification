According to them, the armed conflict which was taking place in Chechnya\u00a0at the material time had led them to believe that investigative delays were inevitable. Owing to their lack of legal knowledge and financial means to hire a lawyer, and in the absence of any domestic provisions for free legal assistance to victims of enforced disappearances, they had been unable to assess the effectiveness of the investigations. It had been only with the passage of time and a lack of information from the investigating authorities that they had begun to doubt the effectiveness of the investigation and had started looking for free legal assistance in order to assess the effectiveness of the proceedings and then, subsequently, to lodge their applications with the Court without undue delay.

Russia (no.\u00a035816/10) the applicant stated that Mr\u00a0Anzor Tangiyev\u2019s mother had contacted the authorities immediately after the abduction of her son but that no criminal case had been opened, despite her and his efforts, until he had lodged his complaint in 2010.

In the case at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigations have been pending for many years without any significant developments in respect of determining to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants\u2019 missing relatives. As for the Government\u2019s argument that the applicants had undermined the investigations by failing to lodge formal complaints in due time, the Court notes that, firstly, the local authorities became aware of the abductions before the formal complaints were lodged (see paragraphs 48, 73 and 88 above) and that they were not precluded from verifying the applicants\u2019 allegations at once. Secondly, the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results. Even assuming that a complaint was lodged belatedly, the authorities were nevertheless under an obligation to conduct a fully-fledged investigation and to take prompt steps to secure the evidence and follow an obvious line of inquiry in order to establish the identity of those responsible (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a024014/05, \u00a7\u00a7 173-75, 14 April 2015).",
