However, the applicant\u2019s omission in this respect did not release the State from the duty to carry out \u201can official investigation\u201d, as required under Article 3 of the Convention. In this connection the Court reiterates that the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the individual either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see, mutatis mutandis, McKerr v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2001III). The duty to investigate was more apparent in view of the fact that the applicant was, at the time, a prisoner, and accordingly under the care and responsibility of the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Pankov v. , no. 12773/03, \u00a7 50, 7 October 2010). In the present case, the public prosecutor remained inactive despite the fact that alleged offence was subject to State prosecution. Furthermore, no step to uncover the truth was taken after the applicant brought the incident to the attention of the public prosecutor in his request for legality review proceedings (see paragraph 25 above). An investigation that would lead to establishing criminal liability under section 294 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 44 above) for any omissions imputable to State officials leading up to the incident, would have had a deterrent effect on the commission of similar offences in future (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

In this connection the Court reiterates that persons in custody, as was the applicant, are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (see Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, \u00a7 56). This duty was underlined in the domestic legislation, and also formed the background to the first instance decision of 7 October 2002 (see paragraphs 15 and 29-31 above).",

The same was confirmed by Mr K.M., the examining vet (see paragraph 12 above).

Furthermore, before he had taken up that duty, he had attended a week\u2019s work-related induction course and remained on the farm for a month before he was allowed pasture duties (see paragraph 10 above). The bull had been also under constant medical supervision by the examining vet (see paragraph 12 above). Lastly, the prison had in place a disciplinary system that deterred prisoners from attacking livestock, whose aim was not only to protect the animals, but also prisoners (see paragraph 58 above). In these circumstances, there is nothing to suggest that there were any particular reasons requiring the authorities to take any special measures, over and above those discussed above, to reduce any potential risk. Consequently, no responsibility can be attributed to the State for having permitted the applicant to handle the bull.",
