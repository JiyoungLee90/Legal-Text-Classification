It expressed the view that they should not be penalised for the fact that their requests for legal aid were not processed speedily enough. The court held that the seven-day time-limit for a legally-aided party started to run only on the day when a legal aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal, and not when he or she was informed of his or her assignment to the case. The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigid and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal aid system illusory.

Accordingly, the thirty-day time limit to lodge a cassation appeal was due to expire on 28 February 2013 (see paragraph 5 above). By a letter of 20\u00a0March 2013 the applicant\u2019s lawyer informed him about being assigned as a legal aid lawyer to his case. The thirty-day time-limit for lodging a request for leave to lodge a cassation appeal out of time started to run from the day when this letter was served on the applicant. The parties have not supplied that date. Nine days later, after sending the above-mentioned letter, on 29\u00a0March 2013 the lawyer sent a letter informing the applicant about her refusal to prepare the cassation appeal. Together with the letter she submitted an extensively reasoned opinion in which she explained why, in her opinion, the cassation appeal in the applicant\u2019s case had no chance of success (see paragraphs 6-7 above).",

However, the applicant indicated that he had received the second letter only on 16\u00a0April 2013 and produced a handwritten note of the delivery date made on that day. The Government did not present any evidence to contradict the applicant\u2019s statement in this respect. Moreover, since neither the applicant nor the Government provided the Court with the date on which the applicant had been served with the letter of 20 March 2013 referred to above, it may be assumed that it could have been delivered to the applicant at the earliest on 22 March 2013. Consequently, the applicant had at least until 22\u00a0April 2013 (as 21 April 2013, which would have been the last day of the 30-day timelimit, was a Sunday) to lodge a cassation appeal prepared by a privately-hired representative. Hence, when receiving information about the legal aid lawyer\u2019s refusal to prepare the cassation appeal, he would have been left with six days (four of which were working days) within which to avail himself of the possibility of seeking leave to appeal out of time by a privately-hired lawyer.",
