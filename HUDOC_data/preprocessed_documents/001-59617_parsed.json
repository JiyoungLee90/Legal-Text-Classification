In particular, activities by them incompatible with the rule of law could not be tolerated. The Constitutional Court referred to the provisions of the Constitution which imposed respect for secularism on the various organs of political power. It also cited the numerous provisions of domestic legislation requiring political parties to apply the principle of secularism in a number of fields of political and social life. The Constitutional Court observed that secularism was one of the indispensable conditions of democracy. In Turkey the principle of secularism was safeguarded by the Constitution, on account of the country\u2019s historical experience and the specific features of Islam. The democratic regime was incompatible with the rules of sharia. The principle of secularism prevented the State from manifesting a preference for a particular religion or belief and constituted the foundation of freedom of conscience and equality between citizens before the law. Intervention by the State to preserve the secular nature of the political regime had to be considered necessary in a democratic society.",

Six thousand five hundred verses have been quietly forgotten ... You found a Koranic school, you build a hostel, you pay for a child\u2019s education, you teach, you preach. ... None of that is part of the chapter on jihad but of that on the amel-i salih (peacetime activities). Jihad is the name given to the quest for power for the advent of justice, for the propagation of justice and for glorification of Allah\u2019s Word. Allah did not see that task as an abstract political concept; he made it a requirement for warriors (cahudi). What does that mean? That jihad must be waged by an army! The commander is identified... The condition to be met before prayer (namaz) is the islamisation of power. Allah says that, before mosques, it is the path of power which must be Muslim... It is not erecting vaulted ceilings in the places of prayer which will lead you to Paradise. For Allah does not ask whether you have built up vaulted ceilings in this country. He will not ask that. He will ask you if you have reached a sufficient level ... today, if Muslims have a hundred books, they must give thirty to the Koranic schools, to train our children, girls and boys, and the sixty remaining books must be given to the political establishments which open the road to power. Allah asked all his prophets to fight for power. You cannot name a single member of a religious movement who does not fight for power. I tell you, if I had as many heads as I have hairs on my head, even if each of those heads were to be torn from my shoulders for following the way of the Koran, I would not abandon my cause... The question Allah will ask you is this: \u2018Why, in the time of the blasphemous regime, did you not work for the construction of an Islamic State?\u2019 Erbakan and his friends want to bring Islam to this country in the form of a political party. The prosecutor understood that clearly. If we could understand that as he did, the problem would be solved. Even Abraham the Jew has realised that in this country the symbol of Islam is Refah. He who incites the Muslim community (cemaat) to take up arms before political power is in Muslim hands is a fool, or a traitor doing the bidding of others. For none of the prophets authorised war before the capture of State power. ... Muslims are intelligent. They do not reveal how they intend to beat their enemy. The general staff gives orders and the soldiers obey. If the general staff reveals its plan, it is up to the commanders of the Muslim community to make a new plan.

The Republic of Turkey had been founded as a result of a revolutionary process which had changed a theocratic State into a secular State, and reactionary Islamic tendencies were still a danger in the present day.

In so doing, it showed the characteristics of a totalitarian regime.

In the Government\u2019s submission, militant democracy required political parties, its indispensable protagonists, to show loyalty to democratic principles, and accordingly to the principle of secularism.

That tendency was confirmed also by the European Parliament\u2019s Resolution of 10 December 1996 on the constitutional status of European political parties, according to which the programme and activities of political parties must respect democracy, human rights and the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law enshrined in the Union Treaty.

The Constitutional Court found that Refah\u2019s intention had been to set up in Turkey a plurality of legal systems under which society would have to be divided into several religious movements; each individual would have to choose the movement to which he wished to belong and would thus be subjected to the rights and obligations prescribed by the religion of his community. The Constitutional Court pointed out that such a system, whose origins lay in the history of Islam as a political regime, was inimical to the consciousness of allegiance to a nation having legislative and judicial unity. It would naturally impair judicial unity since each religious movement would set up its own courts and the ordinary courts would be obliged to apply the law according to the religion of those appearing before them, thus obliging the latter to reveal their beliefs. It would also undermine legislative unity, given that each religious movement would be empowered to decree what legal rules should be applicable to its members.",

It is difficult to declare one\u2019s respect for democracy and human rights while at the same time supporting a regime based on sharia, which clearly diverges from Convention values, particularly with regard to its criminal law and criminal procedure, its rules on the legal status of women and the way it intervenes in all spheres of private and public life in accordance with religious precepts. In addition, the statements concerning the desire to found a \u201cjust order\u201d or the \u201corder of justice\u201d or \u201cGod\u2019s order\u201d, when read in their context,and even though they lend themselves to various interpretations, have as their common denominator the fact that they refer to religious or divine rules in order to define the political regime advocated by the speakers.

In addition, they give the impression that Refah did not exclude the possibility of recourse to force in certain circumstances in order to oppose certain political programmes, or to gain power and retain it. The Court considers that such a vision of society is based on the Islamic theocratic regime which has already been imposed in the history of Turkish law. It accordingly concludes that the offending remarks and policy statements made by Refah\u2019s leaders form a whole and give a fairly clear picture of a model of State and society organised according to religious rules, which was conceived and proposed by Refah.",

The first of these relates to its influence as a political party and its chances of gaining power, the only possibility for a political party to keep its promises. At the time of its dissolution Refah, with its 157 MPs, had nearly a third of the seats in the Turkish Grand National Assembly. The speeches and policy statements cited by the Constitutional Court as grounds for Refah\u2019s dissolution date from the period (1993-97) during which the party had obtained significant results in the general and local elections and was close to the spheres of power. The second reason lies in the fact that in the past political movements based on religious fundamentalism have been able to seize political power and have had the opportunity to set up the societal model which they advocated. The Court therefore considers that the real chance Refah had to implement its political plans undeniably made the danger of those plans for public order more tangible and more immediate.",

It notes that although the persons who were expelled from Refah had publicly defended the various elements of a theocratic regime before and after their election, that did not prevent Refah from putting up some of them as candidates for important public office, such as the position of mayor of a large city or member of parliament, or from showing one of the offending speeches in its local branches for the political training of its members. The case file shows that until the dissolution proceedings were brought against Refah the persons who had made these speeches never had to face disciplinary action within the party for their offending conduct or public statements and that Refah had never criticised those statements. That being so, the Court considers that the decisions to expel the persons concerned were taken in the hope of avoiding Refah\u2019s dissolution and were not made freely, as the decisions of leaders of associations should be if they are to be recognised under Article\u00a011 (see, mutatis mutandis, Freedom and Deocracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP) v.

It is also known that Refah opposed criminal penalties for such acts. The Court notes in that connection that Necmettin Erbakan clearly expressed Refah\u2019s opposition to the criminal-law provisions which made acts of this type punishable offences in a speech at a party conference on 10\u00a0October 1993, when he said: \u201cWhen we were in government, for four years, the notorious Article 163 of the Persecution (Torture) Code was never applied against any child in the country\u201d (see paragraph 26 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the applicants cannot derive argument from the fact that Refah\u2019s leaders were never convicted of acts contrary to the principle of secularism when such acts are no longer punishable offences in Turkey, a development which the applicants themselves called for and argued in favour of at the time when the law was changed (see, mutatis mutandis, the Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.

To verify that it does not, the content of the programme must be compared with the actions of the party and the positions it defends (see the previously cited United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.

It takes the view that, even though the margin of appreciation left to States must be a narrow one where the dissolution of political parties is concerned, since the pluralism of ideas and parties is itself an inherent part of democracy, a State may reasonably forestall the execution of such a policy, which is incompatible with the Convention\u2019s provisions, before an attempt is made to implement it through concrete steps that might prejudice civil peace and the country\u2019s democratic regime.",

The Court has previously held that the dissolution of a political party accompanied by a temporary ban prohibiting its leaders from exercising political responsibilities was a drastic measure and that measures of such severity might be applied only in the most serious cases (see the previously cited Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey judgment, p.\u00a01258, \u00a7 51). In the present case it has just found that the interference in question met a \u201cpressing social need\u201d. It should also be noted that after Refah\u2019s dissolution only five of its MPs (including the applicants) temporarily forfeited their parliamentary office and their role as leaders of a political party. The 152 remaining MPs continued to sit in parliament and pursued their political careers normally. Moreover, the applicants did not allege that Refah or its members had sustained considerable pecuniary damage on account of the transfer of their assets to the Treasury. The Court considers in that connection that the nature and severity of the interference are also factors to be taken into account when assessing its proportionality (see, for example, S\u00fcrek v.

The present case is also the fourth in a succession of cases before the European Court involving such dissolution, the previous cases being those of the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others (judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports 1998-I), the Socialist Party and Others (judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III) and the Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP) (Judgment of 8 December 1999). It is, in terms of its political significance in Turkey by far the most important of the four cases. The Communist, Socialist, and \u00d6ZDEP Parties were not only relatively small; they were at the time of dissolution in their infancy. In the case of \u00d6ZDEP, the proceedings to dissolve the party were brought within four months of its formation. In the case of the Communist and Socialist Parties, the dissolution proceedings were originally commenced within a fortnight of their formation. By contrast, Refah was founded in 1983 and had been in existence for nearly fourteen years before proceedings were brought to dissolve it. In that period it had, as noted in the judgment, grown to become one of the largest single political Parties in Turkey, with a claimed membership at the time of its dissolution of over 4.3 million people. In the General Election of 1995 Refah received some 22% of the total votes, winning 158 seats in the Assembly, and in the local election of November 1996 it received 35% of the total votes cast. In June 1996, as the party commanding the greatest number of seats in the Assembly, Refah formed a coalition government with the True Path Party under the premiership of its leader, Necmettin Erbakan. At the time of the commencement of the dissolution proceedings in June 1997 Refah remained the governing party in power. ",

It is true that other grounds were also invoked by the Constitutional Court - in the case of the Communist Party, the use of the name \u201cCommunist\u201d; and in the case of \u00d6ZDEP, the party\u2019s proposal that religious affairs should be under the control of the religious institutions themselves. But it was what the Constitutional Court perceived to be the aim of undermining the unity and territorial integrity of the State in violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and sections 78 and 81 of the Law on Political Parties which was at the heart of its decision to dissolve the party. The case of Refah is quite different. The sole ground for dissolution of the party was that, in terms of section 103 of the Law on Political Parties, it had become a \u201ccentre\u201d for activities contrary to the principle of secularism which was guaranteed by Article 2 of the Constitution and in breach of section 78 of that Law.

The dissolution of the Socialist Party was in this respect somewhat different. The first and unsuccessful attempt to dissolve the party was based exclusively on its political objectives as stated in the party\u2019s programme. However the second and successful application to dissolve the party was based both on extracts from the party\u2019s election publications and on oral statements made by its Chairman, Mr Perin\u00e7ek, at public meetings and on television.

Such expression is inconceivable without the participation of a plurality of political parties representing the different shades of opinions to be found within a country\u2019s population. By relaying this range of opinion, not only within the political institutions but also at all levels, political parties make an irreplaceable contribution to political debate, which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society (Communist Party case, \u00a7 44).",

By contrast, the Court found that the Turkish Communist Party satisfied the requirements of democracy, including political pluralism, universal suffrage and freedom to take part in politics.

Even if there were evidence that his actions had led to the divisions indicated, it could not in our view possibly justify the dissolution of the whole party. In this regard, the Constitutional Court and the Government draw support from two decisions of the Commission (No. 16278/90, Karaduman v. Turkey; No. 18783/91, Bulut v. Turkey) in which it was held that the application of the rules of secular universities prohibiting the wearing of the Islamic scarf did not violate the freedom of religion of the applicants in those cases.

Mr. Ceylan was prosecuted for the statements after the proceedings for the dissolution of the party had commenced. He was also expelled from the party. Nevertheless, the party was held to have shown that they approved of his statements by supporting his candidature for election and by distributing a video recording of the latter speech within the local party organisation.",

The former, as mayor of Kayseri, in a speech in November 1996 called on the Muslim population to harbour their hatred until there was a change in the regime. Mr. Karatepe was prosecuted and convicted for inciting religious hatred after the dissolution proceedings had begun. Ibrahim \u00c7elik, a Refah Party member of the National Assembly, was found to have stated in the corridors of the Assembly in May 1997 that, if religious schools were closed, blood would flow and that he wished to install the Sharia. As in the case of the other three members of the party, an investigation was opened against him on a number of grounds. Like Mr. Yilmaz and Mr. Ceylan he was expelled from the party. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court found that the fact that he had been put forward as a candidate by the party in the knowledge of his activities and views showed that Refah approved of them. ",
