It was contended on the applicant's behalf that she had been led to believe that she would be released following the grant of bail at the magistrates' court and that she had not properly understood the implications of the prosecution's appeal. Counsel for the applicant asserted that if she were present she would see that her case was being dealt with fairly and he further clarified that the basis for his application was \u201ccommon humanity\u201d and \u201cnot technical\u201d. Judge Globe declined the request, reasoning that the applicant could be given a full report of what had happened from her counsel. Moreover, her attendance would be undesirable as one of the applicant's co-accused had not been present at the hearing of the appeal against the grant of bail to him, and it would therefore be unfair to treat the applicant more favourably.",

Although Rule 19.17 (4) had not been expressly cited to Judge Globe, the latter's approach to the application made to him had been entirely consistent with that rule. The general principle underlying Rule 19.17 (4) was that an applicant should not generally be entitled to be present at the hearing of a prosecution appeal. The first exception to that proposition had not been fulfilled as the applicant was not acting in person. Therefore the judge would have to take the view that the case was of an exceptional nature and/or that the interests of justice required the applicant to be present. Judge Globe, in considering the matter, undoubtedly had the interests of justice in mind. He had referred to the position of the co-defendant and had made an enquiry as to whether there was any particular reason to believe that injustice would occur, having regard to the fact that an explanation could be given to the applicant immediately afterwards as to the judge's decision and his reasons for it. Judge Globe had also, notably, left open the possibility of altering his decision if, for example, it became apparent that oral evidence might be required from the applicant in support of her application.",

As concerned the applicant's complaints under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04, the legal framework covering applications for bail, including appeals, did in Mr\u00a0Justice Gibbs view enable her to take proceedings whereby the lawfulness of her detention could be decided speedily by a court as required by that article. There was, in his judgment, nothing even arguably to be found in the wording of Article 5 \u00a7 4 which entitled an applicant to be present at such proceedings in all instances. Where prosecution appeals against refusal of bail were concerned, Rule 19.17 (4) provided a Convention compatible procedure to ensure that no injustice was caused to an applicant in cases in which he or she was not permitted to be present.",

This must be done at the conclusion of the proceedings in which bail has been granted and before the release from custody of the person concerned. Section 1 (5) gives the prosecution two hours within which to serve written notice of appeal upon both the court which has granted bail and the defendant. If it fails to do so, the appeal is deemed to be disposed of (section 1 (7)). Section 1 (6) of the 1993 Act states that upon receipt of the prosecution's oral notice of appeal against the decision to grant bail, the magistrates' court shall remand the person concerned in custody, until the appeal is determined. Once the proper notice has been given, section 1 (8) of the 1993 Act provides that the hearing of the appeal must commence within two working days of the first instance proceedings at which oral notice of appeal is given.",

In these cases, as pointed out by the respondent Government, the Court identified special circumstances in which an applicant's personal attendance might be required under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 4 of the Convention, even though he or she was legally represented. Notably however, the Court finds these cases to be distinguishable, in that they all concerned applicants' appeals against their detention on remand and not, as in the present case, a prosecution appeal against the grant of bail, without which the applicant would have been entitled to be at liberty. Indeed, in Jankauskas, cited above, the Court was careful to note that the domestic courts had held hearings in the presence of both the applicant and his lawyer when making orders authorising and extending the term of his detention on remand. What was at issue in that case was whether the applicant had a right to be personally present at his subsequent appeal against the order for his detention.",

It follows that the applicant should have been afforded the same guarantees at the prosecution's appeal as at first instance. Though the Court is mindful of the inherent logistical difficulties involved in ensuring a detainee's personal attendance at a court hearing, it finds no evidence of any compelling reasons in the present case which might have rendered the applicant's presence undesirable or impracticable. To the contrary, it is accepted that the applicant's representatives had made arrangements for her to be present at the court building on the day of the prosecution appeal hearing, and that no inconvenience would have been caused in allowing her to attend.",

Furthermore, as the applicant herself asserts, a lengthy period of pre-trial detention was likely given the gravity of the charges against her (see paragraph 31 above).",

There, after a thorough examination of the relevant case-law, the Grand Chamber stated that it had found no persuasive authority for concluding that the first obligatory appearance before a judge must encompass the power to grant release on bail. Rather, it was stressed that the initial automatic review of arrest and detention \u201cmust be capable of examining lawfulness issues and whether or not there is a reasonable suspicion that the arrested person had committed an offence, in other words, that the detention falls within the permitted exception set out in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c). When the detention does not, or is unlawful, the judicial officer must then have the power to release\u201d (see McKay, cited above \u00a7 40). It further reiterates its conclusion at \u00a7 39 of McKay that: \u201cInsofar as it may be suggested that the power to grant bail was a power which the magistrates had to be able to exercise on the first court appearance of the detained person after arrest, the Grand Chamber is unable to agree with this interpretation.\u201d",

The Court further notes that, as was the case in McKay (cited above, see \u00a7\u00a7 49 and 50), the question of the applicant's bail was reconsidered shortly thereafter by a judicial officer who undisputedly did have the power to make a final decision in that respect.",

The case-law makes clear that, in order to comply with that paragraph, proceedings to extend a person's detention on remand or to review a decision ordering the person's detention or refusing bail must be adversarial in nature and must ensure equality of arms between the parties: in this regard, the Court has held that the possibility for a detainee to be heard in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see, for example, Kampanis v. Greece, judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 318-B, \u00a7 47). However, the Court has also held that, where an applicant is legally represented at a hearing in such proceedings, Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not additionally require the presence at the hearing of the applicant himself or herself in the absence of special reasons (Jankauskas v. Lithuania (dec.), no. 59304/00, 16 December 2003). Such reasons have been found to exist in cases where the hearing of the appeal took place many weeks after the original remand in custody and where the appeal court changed the original basis for the remand of the applicant, without any possibility of further appeal (Grau\u017einis v. Lithuania, no. 37975/97, 10 October 2000); where, in",

The applicant's lawyer arranged with the Prison Service for the applicant to be present in court for that hearing, and she was duly conveyed to the court building on the appointed day. Counsel for the applicant asked the court for his client to be present inside the courtroom, but Judge G., presiding, relying on very clear domestic law in force (see paragraph 22 of the judgment), refused permission.

The Court found that Judge G.'s denial of the applicant's request to be present at the hearing that would determine her provisional liberty violated the applicant's rights \u2013 but only because she had already been granted bail and now faced the danger of losing that provisional liberty. These considerations necessarily imply that in other circumstances \u2013 for example, had this been the first bail hearing, or had bail already been refused at first instance \u2013 the judge of the appeal court could legitimately have excluded the accused from the courtroom.",

At stake for the applicant at that hearing of 11 October were her freedom, her future, her incarceration. It strikes me as at least moderately weird that every person in the universe had a \u201cright\u201d to be present in the courtroom on 11 October \u2013 everybody, that is, except the person most immediately affected by the goings-on in that courtroom. Anyone can be there when imprisonment is being decided, provided it is not the person who is risking prison.

Whatever it stands for, surely that was the wrong test to apply. The presence of the accused in court cannot be judged exclusively by reference to its usefulness to the decision-making process, but rather by reference to the right of accused persons to follow, and, if need be, to participate in events which concern them more than they do anyone else. The functioning of the lawyer/accused tandem depends also on the ability of the accused person to give instructions to his or her lawyer in court on a continuous and impromptu basis.

It seems that in the  system the idle curiosity of a spectator in the courtroom attracts a higher degree of judicial favour and protection than the legitimate concerns of a person desiring to follow what is going on with regard to his or her immediate liberty or incarceration. What was at issue in the present case was hardly what the judge stood to gain or lose, but rather whether at any stage of the criminal trial the accused, if she so desired and requested, could have rightly been prevented from attending a public hearing regarding her liberty \u2013 a hearing everyone else, except her, was entitled to attend. For my part, I believe that those accused who wish to be present when their liberty is being determined deserve not to be looked upon by the whole justice system (including the law) as unwelcome nuisances to be hustled out by the court's bouncers. And this applies independently of whether it was a first or a second hearing, or whether bail had already been granted or refused.

When the accused's liberty is being determined, it is not for him to prove that he is entitled to be present, but rather for the authorities to furnish compelling reasons to exclude the accused from his own courtroom. It appears that, following this judgment, the onus of proving convincingly the right to be present in proceedings relating to provisional liberty has shifted to accused persons. It is now for them to succeed in proving that there exist weighty reasons why their right to liberty should not be determined behind their backs. This, to me, pulls inside out the logic of the criminal process and is manifestly wrong.",

However, the question may be asked as to whether the applicant would have complained if the judge's decision had been different, namely if she had been granted bail even without her being present at the hearing?
