There are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial: the first consists in seeking to determine a particular judge\u2019s personal conviction or interest in a given case (subjective test); and the second in ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (objective test). In the first test, the impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary. The second test determines whether there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to the impartiality of a body sitting as a bench. In this respect, even appearances may be of some importance, but what is decisive is whether the fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a075 - 77, ECHR 2007IV).",

When imposing the measure, the domestic court takes into account various circumstances, as provided for in Article\u00a072 of the Code (see paragraph 20 above). In examining the second applicant\u2019s appeal against the initial detention order, the appellate court relied heavily on his personality and his tendency to commit crimes. In this connection, the Court has stated that a reference to the particular circumstances of the charges, indicating the gravity of the offences and the applicant\u2019s previous convictions, could not be seen as going beyond what should be regarded as an objective and reasonable evaluation of the situation for the purposes of deciding the question of his pre-trial detention (see Jasi\u0144ski v.

In the instant case the domestic court also stated that \u201c[the second applicant] does not learn any lessons and is once again suspected of having committed an identical crime\u201d. The above assertion was directly followed by the statement, \u201cHe commits such acts regardless of the considerations included in his own appeal [for the review of the detention order]\u201d. The court made no reference in the wording quoted above to the existence of mere reasonable suspicions. The phrase \u201che commits such acts\u201d suggests that the court was referring to the criminal offence which the applicant was suspected of having committed in the criminal proceedings. The language used could be perceived as going beyond the examination of the existence of a suspicion against the applicant (compare with Hauschildt, cited above; see also Mironenko and Martenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a04785/02, \u00a7\u00a071, 10\u00a0December\u00a02009) and running counter to the requirement of the judicial authorities to abstain from taking a stance on the outcome of the case and to express any suggestions in that regard (see Lavents v. Latvia, no. 58442/00, \u00a7\u00a0119, 28\u00a0November\u00a02002).

The Court first observes that the panel examining the applicant\u2019s appeal in the criminal case was composed of the same three judges who took the decision on detention at the pre-trial stage. This gave the applicant legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality on the part of the whole bench of the appellate court (contrast with, for example, Garrido Guerrero v. Spain ((dec.) no.\u00a043715/98, ECHR\u00a02000-III), where only one judge of a five-judge bench was affected by the partiality plea).
