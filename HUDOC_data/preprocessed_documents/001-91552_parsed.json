However, restrictions which are of a purely financial nature and which, as in the present case, are completely unrelated to the merits of an appeal or its prospects of success, should be subject to a particularly rigorous scrutiny from the point of view of the interests of justice (Podbielski and PPU Polpure v.

The case concerned the applicant\u2019s request for the division of his late parents\u2019 marital property. There is no evidence to suggest that the domestic courts considered the applicant\u2019s action to be devoid of prospects of success or of a vexatious nature. Thus the money which the applicant was obliged to pay did not constitute a financial barrier designed to protect the system of justice against an unmeritorious appeal. Indeed, the principal aim seems to have been the State\u2019s interest in deriving income from court fees in civil cases (see Podbielski, cited above, \u00a7 66).",

His household included his unemployed wife and her handicapped brother who received PLN 450 in invalidity benefit. It is apparent from the domestic courts\u2019 decisions that the authorities were aware of the applicant\u2019s particularly difficult situation. Nevertheless, the courts assumed that the applicant should have saved money since the beginning of the proceedings in 1997 and that he should have envisaged that he would be required to pay court fees when bringing a civil action. The Court notes, however, that at the beginning of the proceedings the applicant was exempted from court fees in full. Since his financial situation did not improve thereafter he could reasonably expect that he would not be ordered to pay court fees at later stages of the proceedings. Moreover, the Court considers that the domestic court\u2019s assessment of the applicant\u2019s financial situation was based on a rather theoretical calculation of his ability to save money from a very modest income which had to be divided among three persons. It was established during the proceedings that the applicant\u2019s family\u2019s income had not been enough to cover their maintenance, medication, and other basic needs. There is nothing to suggest that the domestic authorities believed that the applicant had other sources of income or assets. While it is true that the applicant was partially exempted from court fees, nevertheless the remaining sum of PLN 600 could not be considered negligible for the applicant given that it was almost equivalent to his monthly income.",

The Court considers accordingly that in the course of the proceedings the applicant was asked to pay a sum, clearly outside his financial means, for proceeding with the preparation of the expert opinion which was ordered by the Wroc\u0142aw District Court of its own motion (see paragraph 9 above). Moreover, he was ordered to pay an additional PLN 150 for pursuing his appeal in which he had contested the fact that the expert opinion had not been prepared. Since his appeal was rejected because the applicant had not been able to pay court fees, the manner in which the District Court handled the evidence in his case could not have been brought to the attention of the second-instance court.",
