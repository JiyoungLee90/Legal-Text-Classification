In these submissions the applicant further stated that the second building was 408 square metres with a sleeping area of 288 square metres and accommodated an average of 250 to 300 persons without any ventilation or sufficient light. The applicant added that, during the two months following his transfer to the second building, there had been no beds at all and the occupants had had to sleep on an insufficient number of dirty blankets and mattresses placed on the floor. 90 bunk beds had gradually been brought into the accommodation centre. The building furthermore had no heating. There had been three toilets without a flush, scarce hot water and no working showers.

They maintained that the kitchen facility seen in the photographs submitted by the applicants was not in use and the food was supplied externally by a catering company. With regard to the tap water, the Government stated that the staff had been using the same water supply and that there had been no medical incident arising from its use. Additionally the Government provided photographs of various social events organised at the accommodation centre. Other photographs included those of a medical clinic in the centre, individuals playing volleyball and walking around in the garden, playing in the snow, a girl around the age of three riding a small bicycle outdoors, the distribution of meals, toilets and sinks, a prayer room, a football field, a television room and a table tennis facility. One of the rooms appears to have a toilet and shower. Other photographs indicate that there is a separate shower and toilet area as well as a washing machine for common use. Some of the photographs provide images of daily life, such as an individual painting on canvas or two individuals having tea in a room. Rooms seem to have natural light coming through large windows. Whether bunk beds or ordinary beds, all beds appear to have pillows, blankets and linen. Photographs show that the rooms are equipped with curtains, ceiling lights, large personal lockers and central heating radiators. They are decorated with detainees' personal belongings, such as carpets on floors or posters on walls. Some rooms seem to have plastic tables and chairs. In one of the photographs there is a computer, a ventilator and a small Christmas tree. The Government also presented photographs of the barbed-wire perimeter, empty rubbish containers, the collection of garbage by municipality staff and an official giving presents to occupants.",

In this connection the Government provided a number of receipts indicating payments to a catering company, bakery, market and a dairy products company. The Government also submitted the menu served at the accommodation centre between July and December 2008. The menu indicates that meals consisting of two to three courses were served every day of the week. The food varied between soup and vegetables, pasta and meat or meatballs and dried beans and yoghurt. Salad and fruit seem to be served occasionally.

In respect of the applicants in application no. 43616/08, a list drawn up by officials states that sixty-seven foreigners, including the applicants, were arrested on 11 September 2008 and could not be questioned due to the lack of a translator.
