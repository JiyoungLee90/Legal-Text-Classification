The case originated in an application (no. 26307/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mrs Rimma Vasilyevna Shirykalova (“the applicant”), on 11 June 2002.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, the former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 28 April 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaint about the alleged non-execution of the judgments of 23 December 1999 and 18 June 2003 to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in the Sverdlovsk Region.
In 1987 she took part in emergency operations at the site of the  nuclear plant disaster. As a result she suffered from extensive exposure to radioactive emissions.
In 1996 the applicant underwent medical examinations which established the link between her poor health and the involvement in the  events. She was awarded a monthly allowance, to be increased on a regular basis in line with the minimum subsistence amount.
In 1999 the applicant sued the local social security authority (Управление социальной защиты населения г. Заречного – “the defendant”) requesting to increase her monthly allowance and backdate the increase. The applicant considered that the amount of the allowance had been determined incorrectly.
On 23 December 1999 the Beloyarsk District Court of the Sverdlovsk Region granted the applicant’s claim and ruled that her monthly allowance had been wrongly calculated. The court did not specify the exact amount of the monthly allowance to be paid to the applicant form then on. However, it ordered the defendant to recalculate the allowance due to the applicant and gave instructions on the recalculation. The judgment was not appealed against and became final on 3 January 2000. The enforcement proceedings commenced.
On an unspecified date in the beginning on 2000 the defendant recalculated the applicant’s allowance and backdated the increase. According to the defendant’s calculations, the monthly allowance due to the applicant pursuant to the judgment of 23 December 1999 amounted to 4,175 Russian roubles (RUB) and the underpayments of the allowance for the period of July 1996-February 2000 amounted to RUB 149,173.25.
In March-August 2000 the applicant was receiving RUB 4,175 per month. However, starting form September the monthly allowance paid to the applicant was reduced to RUB 2,500.
On 10 July 2000 the bailiff notified the defendant that the judgment of 23 December 1999 was not enforced in full since the applicant had not yet received RUB 149,173.25 (the underpayments). In their reply of 25 July 2000 to the bailiff the defendant referred to the lack of funding.
According to the Government, in August 2002 RUB 202,611.27 were transferred to the local social security authority to make the payments to the  victims. In September 2002 the applicant received RUB 6,731.51 from the defendant.
In 2003 the applicant brought proceedings against the defendant complaining that the monthly allowance paid to her after September 2000 was lower than stipulated in the judgment of 23 December 1999. She also sought to increase the allowance in line with the minimum subsistence amount and to recover the arrears due to her.
On 18 June 2003 the Zarechniy District Court of the Sverdlovsk Region awarded the applicant RUB 302,655.77 as underpayments for the period of July 1996-May 2003. It also held that the allowance payable to the applicant starting form June 2003 should amount to RUB 13,144.56. On 30 September 2003 the judgment was upheld on appeal.
On 23 December 2004 the applicant received RUB 60,644.56 on account of the enforcement of the judgment of 18 June 2003. In June 2005 she started receiving monthly allowance in the amount indicated in the judgment. On 6 July 2005 the applicant received RUB 473,341.53. That amount covered the rest of the judgment debt and the underpayments of the allowance which was in January 2004-June 2005 lower than established in the judgement.
