In any event, and quite apart from the issue as to whether the domestic courts\u2019 findings were sufficient in terms of acknowledgement of a violation, the Court is of the opinion that the compensation of EUR 1,500 awarded to each applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage, in the present case, cannot be considered an appropriate redress for the violation complained of (see, mutatis mutandis, Cocchiarella v.

Such reasoning would disregard the fact that conducting an effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and prosecution of the perpetrator is required precisely because the perpetrator can then be punished.

That case-law does not tolerate situations in which criminal proceedings are conducted, the perpetrator is identified and it is established that the perpetrator carried out the act which breached the victim\u2019s rights under Article 2 or 3 of the Convention, but he or she is then allowed to escape punishment for various reasons. Thus, in cases where the execution of the perpetrators\u2019 prison sentences was suspended (see Okkal\u0131 v.

This is essential for maintaining public confidence, ensuring adherence to the rule of law and for preventing any appearance of tolerance or of collusion in unlawful acts (see, inter alia, Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 65, and T\u00fcrkmen v.

Although the Court should largely defer to the national courts\u2019 choice of appropriate sanctions for ill-treatment and homicide by State agents, it must exercise a certain power of review and intervene in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity of the act and the punishment imposed (see Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062).",

Such situations arise, for example, in the area of positive obligations under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. It is indeed for that reason that the Court expressly specifies in such cases that \u201cif the infringement of the right to life or to personal integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case\u201d (see Calvelli and Ciglio v.

In the light of what we set out above, it is apparent that the established case-law does not allow the dilution of State liability under the pretext of available civil remedies. This risk cannot be mitigated by the addition of sentences such as \u201ceven assuming that a compensation claim in civil proceedings may be regarded as an effective domestic remedy for complaints under the substantive aspect of Article 3 of the Convention\u201d (see \u00a7 74 of the present judgment). One wonders, for example, what the Court would have decided in this case had each of the applicants been awarded, not EUR 1,500, but EUR 20,000? Would it then have held that that sum was sufficient to amount to adequate redress? In any event, as it is, the present judgment seems to create a third line of case-law, by relying on the insufficiency of the sum awarded in civil proceedings. That clearly conflicts with what was stated in the Caraher decision, namely that \u201c[T]he Court is not persuaded that an applicant can still claim to be a victim on the basis that the amount of compensation is inadequate\u201d. We are convinced that these applicants can still claim to be victims of a substantive violation of Article 2, not because of the adequacy or inadequacy of the compensation, but in view of the fact that without consistent State responsibility for providing an adequate mechanism for criminal liability there can be no proper protection of the values enshrined in Article 2 or 3 of the Convention.",
