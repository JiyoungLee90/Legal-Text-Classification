They averred in that respect that the value of the property, as assessed by expert A.\u017b., amounted to PLN 125,130. Later, a month before the contract was concluded, the same expert had assessed the value of the same property at PLN 218,985. The prosecuting authorities, harbouring certain doubts as to the soundness of the estimates, had instituted investigations and appointed a new expert, who had estimated the value of the abandoned property at only PLN 90,953. Consequently, as the value of the house that the applicants\u2019 legal predecessors had abandoned in Trembowla was much lower than the price the applicants had paid for the property in Boles\u0142awiec, the State had sold them the latter property at a considerable loss. The plaintiff prosecuting authority further argued that the first expert, A.\u017b., had had regard to the market value of the Trembowla property, whereas under the relevant legislation he should have taken the technical value of the property into account. As the applicants had refused to comply with the Boles\u0142awiec District Office\u2019s demand to pay PLN 111,046, the prosecuting authorities claimed that the applicants should repay that amount to them.",
