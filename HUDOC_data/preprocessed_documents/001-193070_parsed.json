It was clear from the case file that the applicant had twice asked the prison administration to allow him to purchase and use a CPAP device. The refusal of permission by the Kaunas Remand Prison Administration had been unfounded because there had been a recommendation issued by a doctor. The court held that the applicant had a right to compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage suffered from 3 October 2013 (when his request was refused by the prison administration \u2013 see paragraph 9 below) until 20 October 2014 and thus decided to award the applicant EUR\u00a01,100 in this regard. The court also noted that there was no information in the case file to indicate that the applicant had not received appropriate healthcare in Kaunas Remand Prison. It stated that although the recommendation issued by the specialist contained a reference to possible complications, there was no information in the applicant\u2019s case file to show that the inability to use a CPAP device had had any negative consequences for his health.",

Italy (no. 1) ([GC], no. 36813/97, ECHR 2006-V). In that connection, the Court notes that a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not, in principle, sufficient to deprive him or her of his or her status as a \u201cvictim\u201d for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded sufficient redress for, the breach of the Convention. One of the characteristics of sufficient redress which may remove a litigant\u2019s victim status relates to the amount awarded as a result of using the domestic remedy. Thus, an applicant\u2019s victim status may depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 180 and 202).",

Moreover, although the domestic courts found that there had been a recommendation issued by a doctor that the applicant should continue using a CPAP device, they merely awarded him compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. Although the domestic courts relied on a report from a medical expert, in which it was stated that complications were possible if his sleep apnoea was not treated and that the applicant\u2019s condition was deteriorating (see paragraphs 7, 11 and 12 above), they considered that there were no indications that the applicant\u2019s condition had actually worsened during the period when he had not been able to use a CPAP device. The courts did not take into consideration the possible consequences had the applicant still not received a CPAP device after their decisions had been issued.

The Court is of the opinion that, taking into account the applicant\u2019s pathology and the risks connected to it, those feelings should have been sufficiently intense as to attain the level of severity required in order to bring Article 3 of the Convention into play (see the case-law quoted in paragraph 26 above).",
