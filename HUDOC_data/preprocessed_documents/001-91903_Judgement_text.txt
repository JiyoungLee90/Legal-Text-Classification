The case originated in an application (no. 49916/07) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Mr Šime Medić (“the applicant”), on 11 October 2007.
The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 17 June 2008 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Zadar.
On 3 June 1994 the applicant applied for the enforcement of a final judgment of the Omiš Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Omišu) ordering a certain N.B. to pay him a sum of money. An enforcement order to that effect was issued on 14 September 1994. The enforcement order was to be carried out by selling a real estate owned by N.B. at a public tender. On 26 March 1996 a certain M.B. objected to the enforcement proceedings claiming that she was the co-owner of the real estate in question. The Municipal Court instructed M.B. to institute civil proceedings whereby she would claim her ownership and consequently the Municipal Court stayed the enforcement proceedings pending the outcome of these civil proceedings.
On 9 May 1996 M.B. brought a civil action in the same Municipal Court against the applicant and some other persons, asking the court to disallow the enforcement proceedings.
On 9 December 1996 N.B. brought a separate civil action in the Omiš Municipal Court against the applicant and some other persons, also asking the court to disallow the enforcement proceedings.
In civil proceedings instituted by M.B. the Omiš Municipal Court adopted a judgment on 3 March 1999 which was quashed on 6 February 2004 by the Split County Court (Županijski sud u Splitu) and the case was remitted for retrial.
On 1 July 2004 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint about the length of the enforcement proceedings.
In civil proceedings instituted by M.B. the Municipal Court adopted a decision that the claim had been withdrawn on 18 May 2005. This decision became final on 10 June 2005.
In civil proceedings instituted by N.B. on 12 September 2005 the Municipal Court decided that the action had been withdrawn. N.B. lodged an appeal and the case was forwarded to the Split County Court as the appellate court.
On 29 March 2006 the  found a violation of the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time. It awarded him 7,800 Croatian kunas (HRK) in compensation, and also ordered the Split County Court to determine the civil dispute relating to the enforcement proceedings in question, instituted by N.B., in the shortest time possible but no later than six months after the publication of the decision of the  in the Official Gazette. It also ordered the Omiš Municipal Court to conclude the enforcement proceedings in the shortest time possible but no later than six months after the above decision of the Split County Court became final. The ’s decision was published in the Official Gazette of 19 April 2006.
In the civil proceedings instituted by N.B., on 26 May 2006 the  remitted the case to the Omiš Municipal Court with the instruction that the submission lodged by N.B. and entitled “appeal” had to be examined by the Municipal Court as a request to bring the proceedings to the status quo ante. The Municipal Court accepted this request and held hearings on 12 April, 22 May and 5 and 21 June 2007. On 29 June 2007 it dismissed the claim. This judgment became final on 8 January 2008.
On 5 May 2008 the applicant requested the Omiš Municipal Court to resume the enforcement proceedings. A hearing was held on 8 July 2008 and the first public tender was scheduled for 21 October 2008. It appears that these proceedings are still pending.
