During the period of his residence in the Russian Federation, the applicant had been convicted twice of criminal offences. In particular, on 18\u00a0November 1999 the Shuya Town Court of the Ivanovo Region had found him guilty of extortion committed by a group of persons (a serious crime) and theft of a passport (a minor offence) and sentenced him to three years and one month\u2019s imprisonment. On 26\u00a0April 2005 the Town Court had found him guilty of theft (an offence of medium gravity) and sentenced him to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The Government stressed that the fact that the applicant committed the theft shortly after having served his first prison sentence should not be overlooked, as it showed his firm propensity to commit crimes against property. Furthermore, on 19\u00a0June 2007 and 8\u00a0July 2010 the applicant had been held administratively liable for failing to have his residency in Russia duly authorised. According to the information from the police, the applicant was a member of an organised criminal gang, was actively involved in drug dealing and was a drug addict himself. He was unemployed and did not support his wife and children. Accordingly, his expulsion would not have any bearing on his family\u2019s financial situation. His wife had been aware of his convictions prior to marrying him. She had never met her parents-in-law in person. She maintained contact with them by telephone or via the internet.",

The couple has two daughters, born in 2008 and 2011 respectively. The applicant\u2019s wife and two daughters are Russian nationals. In this connection the Court notes that the family life at issue was developed during the period when the applicant and, obviously, Ms K. were aware that the applicant\u2019s migrant status in Russia was precarious. In March 2010 the decision confirming his uninterrupted residence in Russia was quashed and the applicant failed to pursue the proceedings. In April 2010 the applicant\u2019s Russian citizenship was terminated and his passport was invalidated. It appears that his presence in Russia at the time was merely tolerated, which cannot be equated with a lawful stay.",

There would, accordingly, be no violation of Article 8 of the Convention, should the applicant\u2019s expulsion to Georgia be carried out.",
