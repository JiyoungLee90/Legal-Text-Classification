Russia, no. 106/02, \u00a7 29, 10\u00a0May\u00a02007). If an applicant has been held in conditions in breach of Article\u00a03, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the on-going violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is of the greatest value. However, once the applicant has left the facility in which he or she has endured the inadequate conditions, what remains relevant is that he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred. Where the fundamental right to protection against torture, inhuman and degrading treatment is concerned, the preventive and compensatory remedies have to be complementary in order to be considered effective. The existence of a preventive remedy is indispensable for the effective protection of individuals against the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3. Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to this provision requires, in the Court\u2019s view, the States parties to establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to such treatment rapidly (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a7 98-99, 10 January 2012 and Torreggiani and Others v.\u00a0Italy, nos. 43517/09, 46882/09, 55400/09, 57875/09, 61535/09, 35315/10 and 37818/10, \u00a7 50, 8 January 2013). The need, however, to have both of these remedies does not imply that they should be available in the same judicial proceedings. Further, in the context of complaints that there was a lack of adequate care for prisoners suffering from serious illnesses the Court has held that a preventive remedy ought to have the potential to bring direct and timely relief (see Goginashvili v.\u00a0Georgia, no.47729/08, \u00a7 49, 4\u00a0October 2011, Makharadze and Sikharulidze v. Georgia, no.35254/07, \u00a7\u00a052, 22 November 2011 and \u010cuprakovs v. Latvia, no. 8543/04, \u00a7 50, 18\u00a0December 2012).",

Contrary to what was submitted by the Government, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, in the event of a breach of Articles 2 and 3, which rank as the most fundamental provisions of the Convention, compensation for the non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be available as part of the range of possible remedies (see Z and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2001-V; Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7 130, ECHR 2001-III; and Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7\u00a7 97-98, ECHR 2002-II). In Keenan, for example, the Court found that there had been significant defects in the medical care provided to a mentally-ill person known to be at risk of suicide, which amounted to a violation of Article 3. The Court concluded that the applicant should have been able to apply under Article 13 for compensation for her non-pecuniary damage and the damage suffered by her son before his death.",

It follows that an action in tort may not give rise to compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered (see, conversely, Nocha v Poland, (dec.) no. 21116/09, 27 September 2011). Neither is it a preventive remedy which could put an end to such treatment rapidly (see \u010cuprakovs, cited above, \u00a7 55).

In such proceedings, courts can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint, make findings of fact and order redress that is tailored to the nature and gravity of the violation. Such courts can also make an award of compensation for non-pecuniary damage and there is no limit on the amount which can be granted to an applicant for such a violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Gera de Petri Testaferrata Bonici Ghaxaq v. Malta, no. 26771/07, \u00a7 69, 5 April 2011, in relation to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and Zarb v. Malta, no. 16631/04, \u00a7 51, 4 July 2006, in relation to Article 6). The ensuing judicial decision will be binding on the defaulting authority and enforceable against it. The Court is therefore satisfied that the existing legal framework renders this remedy capable, at least in theory, of affording appropriate redress. The question that arises is whether it can be said that the proceedings are conducted speedily (see, by implication, Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 109). The Court observes that the speed of the procedure for remedial action may also be relevant to whether it is practically effective in the particular circumstances of a given case for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, McFarlane v.\u00a0Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, \u00a7 123, ECHR 2010).",

Russia, no. 59696/00, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2006-XII), that the diagnoses and care are prompt and accurate (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0115, and Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, \u00a7\u00a7 104-106, 28 March 2006), and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at curing the detainee\u2019s diseases or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 114; Sarban v.

The authorities must also show that the necessary conditions were created for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 116, and Holomiov v. Moldova, no.\u00a030649/05, \u00a7\u00a0117, 7 November 2006). Failure to provide proper medical aid to a detainee would not fall under Article 3 unless there was an actual detriment to his physical or mental condition, or avoidable suffering of a certain intensity, or an immediate risk of such detriment or suffering (see Lebedev v.

It notes that the applicant had a pre-existing medical condition at the time of his arrest and would naturally have suffered from its symptoms while in detention. In fact, he repeatedly suffered from headaches, and was taking some kind of medication in the form of paracetamol and later another type of analgesic, while stronger medication was later made available to him for purchase. However, despite the applicant\u2019s condition and his recurring headaches being brought to the authorities\u2019 attention at no point were the recommended brain scans carried out. The only action taken by the authorities during the two year period was to fix an appointment at the Neurology Department for March 2011, despite the fact that the applicant started complaining of headaches as early as January 2010, that is to say more than a year earlier.",

Although the applicant claimed that when he sought such help it was not forthcoming, he was unable to provide any record of his requests or refusals. In the light of this, some relevance must be attributed to the fact that the medical reports produced by the Government show that the applicant was reluctant to receive medical care from the prison doctors (see also Lebedev (dec.) cited above; contrast Sarban, cited above, \u00a7 90).",

The parties in fact disagreed only as to the amount of light in his cell, the quality of the drinking water provided free of charge and the need for appropriate heating. The Court considers that, even assuming that the tap water was undrinkable, the applicant could have made use of the hot potable water available nearly all day long or alternatively purchased his own bottled water (to which he had access) if he so wished. Moreover, the fact that only cold water was available in each cell cannot be considered treatment contrary to Article 3 (see Tellissi v. Italy, (dec.) no. 15434/11, 5\u00a0March\u00a02013). As to the amount of light, while no dimensions of the window were put forward by either of the parties, the Court notes that the applicant had free access to an external yard nearly all day long. Lastly, as to heating, the Court is uneasy about the fact that no heating whatsoever was available in the prison. Even acknowledging that Malta is graced with warm temperatures, the applicant\u2019s cell environment was very humid, as can be seen from photos submitted by him, showing rising damp on both walls adjacent to his bed. Nevertheless, while this situation was not addressed by the authorities, the Court notes that the applicant has not claimed that he was refused extra blankets or warm clothing.",

The Court takes note of the Lithuanian doctor\u2019s certificate of 2008, which anticipated possible complications and recommended annual scans. However, the applicant did not produce any evidence showing that such complications had indeed occurred, or that the conditions of detention exacerbated those risks. In fact, he did not even show what course of action he had taken to seek medical treatment once he had been released on bail. Furthermore, in his application the applicant admitted that he failed to attend the appointment fixed for him at the Neurology department of the hospital, preferring to wait and seek treatment once released, indicating that he was not particularly concerned about the urgency of his condition.",

Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7 100, 31 July 2000, ECHR 2000). In particular, the competent court should examine not only compliance with the procedural requirements set out in domestic law, but also the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention (see Garcia Alva v. Germany, no. 23541/94, \u00a7 39, 13 February 2001 and Bochev v. Bulgaria, no. 73481/01, \u00a7 64, 13 November 2008). The review, being intended to establish whether the deprivation of the individual\u2019s liberty is justified, must be sufficiently wide to encompass the various circumstances militating for or against detention (see Kadem v.\u00a0Malta, no. 55263/00, \u00a7 42, 9 January 2003). The notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention has the same meaning as in Article 5 \u00a7 1, so that the arrested or detained person is entitled to a review of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of his detention not only in the light of the requirements of domestic law, but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see E. v.\u00a0Norway, 29 August 1990, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 181 and Louled Massoud v.\u00a0Malta, no. 24340/08, \u00a7 39, 27 July 2010).",

The Government limited their observations to noting that the Court of Magistrates could examine all the grounds of lawfulness as accepted by the Court in Stephens (No. 2), cited above. However, the Court notes that in Stephens (No. 2) the Court solely found, in the specific circumstances of that case, namely after the Constitutional Court had already found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (precisely because of the Court of Magistrates\u2019 failure to assess the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention) and had remitted the case back to the Court of Magistrates for a fresh assessment, that the latter had speedily examined the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention (based on a plea of lack of jurisdiction).

It follows that the said remedy cannot be considered to be effective for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 in relation to the complaint in the present case, where an assessment was required of the decisions regarding bail under Article 5 \u00a7 3, and where his detention was in fact founded on a provision of the law.",

Moreover, it also appears that such applications must be listed for hearing with urgency therefore it is also possible that such a remedy could satisfy the speediness requirement. However, even accepting that this remedy was separate and distinct from bail applications, it remains to be determined whether the scope of the remedy was such as to satisfy the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for only in that case could this course of action be a potentially effective remedy capable of satisfying the said requirements.",

The Court observes that under Article 409A, cited by the Government as an available remedy (but which the Court found to be inapplicable to the applicant\u2019s case), the relevant courts entrusted with hearing applications under that Article had previously held that they were not competent to look into other circumstances which could render a person\u2019s detention unlawful, such as an incompatibility with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution or the Convention when there was a clear law authorising continued detention (see Louled Massoud, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

The Court starts by noting that it has not been proven that there is a difference in the length of such proceedings depending on whether they were made by way of a referral by another court or brought directly by an individual. Moreover, while it is clear that, unlike the above-mentioned remedies, such jurisdictions would be competent to look at the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention in the light of Article 5 \u00a7 3, the Court notes that it has held on numerous occasions that constitutional proceedings in Malta are rather cumbersome for Article 5 \u00a7 4 purposes, and that lodging a constitutional application could not ensure a speedy review of the lawfulness of an applicant\u2019s detention (see Sabeur Ben Ali v. Malta, no.\u00a035892/97, \u00a7 40, 29 June 2000; Kadem, cited above \u00a7 53; Stephens (No.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7 90; and Louled Massoud, cited above \u00a7 45). Where an individual\u2019s personal liberty is at stake, the Court has strict standards concerning the State\u2019s compliance with the requirement of a speedy review of the lawfulness of detention (see, for example, Kadem, cited above,\u00a7\u00a7\u00a04445; Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7 82-86, ECHR 2000XII, where the Court considered periods of seventeen and twenty-six days excessive for deciding on the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention; and Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 96, 1 June 2006, where the length of appeal proceedings lasting, inter alia, twenty-six days, was found to be in breach of the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement). The Court notes that the only case submitted by the Government, quite apart from the fact that it dealt with a different subject matter, took more than three-and-a-half months to be decided. Thus, the Government have not submitted any information or case-law capable of casting a new light on the matter. In these circumstances, the Court remains of the view that pursuing a constitutional application would not have provided the applicant with a speedy review of the lawfulness of his detention.",

In fact, the Court has already considered, at least by implication, that the remedy under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention is the remedy required for a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3, in that where an applicant complained of having no effective remedy to challenge the lawfulness of the length of his pre-trial detention, the complaint would be examined under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 (see, inter alia, Cahit Demirel v.

Austria, 27 June 1968, \u00a7 14, Series A no. 8). Since the issue at stake is the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 5, the authorities must take as much care in fixing appropriate bail as in deciding whether or not continued detention is indispensable. Furthermore, the amount set for bail must be duly justified in the decision fixing bail and must take into account the accused\u2019s means (see Mangouras, cited above, \u00a7 79). The domestic courts\u2019 failure to assess the applicant\u2019s capacity to pay the sum required may lead the Court to find a violation.

During this period, the courts examined his application for release at least six times. After the first three months of detention, the applicant\u2019s applications were refused by two decisions in December 2009 which the Court considers had given relevant and sufficient reasons justifying his detention, at least at those initial stages of the proceedings. However, despite the Criminal Court\u2019s warning of 28 December 2009 that its decision would be subject to review at a later date and its instruction that the proceedings should be continued with speed and diligence (see paragraph 16 above), the subsequent decisions over the following seven months refused the applicant\u2019s applications using the same formula. They each referred to the previous decisions refusing bail and failed to give details either of the grounds for the decision in view of the developing situation or of whether the original grounds remained valid despite the passage of time.",

The Court, however, observes that the flight risk posed by an accused necessarily decreases with the passage of time spent in detention (Neumeister, cited above, \u00a7 10). Similarly, the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses can be accepted at the initial stages of the proceedings (see Jarzy\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 15479/02, \u00a7 43, 4\u00a0October 2005). In the long term, however, the requirements of the investigation do not suffice to justify the detention of a suspect, as in the normal course of events the risks alleged diminish over time as inquiries are effected, statements are taken and verifications are carried out (see Clooth v.\u00a0Belgium, 12 December 1991, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 225.) Moreover, the risk of the accused hindering the proper conduct of the proceedings cannot be relied upon in abstracto; it has to be supported by factual evidence (see Becciev v. Moldova, no. 9190/03, \u00a7 59, 4 October 2005). In the present case, neither the domestic courts nor the Government have substantiated any such risk. It follows that the repeated extension of the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial cannot be said to have been based on relevant and sufficient reasons.",

Following two unsuccessful requests to have these sums lowered, upon his third request, on 22 February 2011 the deposit was reduced to EUR 40,000, but the personal guarantee increased to EUR 60,000. It took another two months (April 2011) for the deposit to be reduced to EUR 30,000 and the personal guarantee to EUR 15,000. The applicant finally managed to satisfy that condition and was eventually released only on 7 July 2011. The Court considers the fact that the applicant remained in custody for another twelve months after being granted bail as a strong indication that the domestic courts had not taken the necessary care in fixing appropriate bail. The Court, moreover, observes that none of the domestic courts\u2019 judgments refer to an inability to make a balanced decision on account of a lack of documentation.",

The Court observes that after three and a half years of inquiry, two of which he spent in detention, the bill of indictment in respect of the applicant has not yet been filed, despite the warnings by the domestic courts to the prosecution to proceed with speed and diligence (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). This has to be seen against the background of the domestic system, which provides that an inquiry shall be concluded within a month, and that such a period can be extended for two further periods of one month, upon good cause being shown. The timeline of the proceedings (at paragraph 28 above) reveals repeated hearings where only one witness was heard and repeated adjournments. It thus transpires that in the present case the authorities also failed to conduct the proceedings with the requisite diligence.",
