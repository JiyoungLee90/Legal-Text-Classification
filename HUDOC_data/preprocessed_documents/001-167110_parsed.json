The central problem in the present case is whether the above provision should be interpreted more broadly in favour of the applicants, so that the authorities would have to be flexible enough for any inactivity on their part not to be considered a hindrance. The criteria for examination would be the reasonability of the request for documents, and good governance (no excessive burden on the applicant).",

I am not sure that the Court should expect flexibility from the authorities in cases where the applicant has submitted a rigid request for a copy of the complete file without informing the post-sentencing judge about particular documents (that is to say decisions) requested by this Court. Otherwise the applicant would have had to substantiate his personal need for the complete file.

On the other hand, the national judge might take into consideration the applicant\u2019s vulnerable position, having been deprived of his liberty and being unable to engage a lawyer in order to obtain the documents, so the national judge, for the sake of a good governance, could ask the applicant for a copy of this Court\u2019s letter in order to clarify which particular documents were requested",
