Failure to comply with this rule entails unlawful composition under the aforesaid legal provision (ATF 118 II 359 at 3b). In order to determine whether an arbitral tribunal presents such guarantees, reference must be made to the constitutional principles developed with regard to national courts (ATF 125 I 389 at 4a; 118 II 359 at 3c p. 361). However, the specificities of arbitration and in particular those of international arbitration must be taken into account when examining the circumstances of a given case (ATF 129 III 445 at 3.3.3 p. 454). In this connection, sports arbitration as instituted by the CAS has some particularities which have already been outlined elsewhere (ATF 129 III 445 at 4.2.2.2), such as a closed list of arbitrators.

In his view, the alleged circumstance fell within paragraph 2.1.2 of the Guidelines, which concerns the situation where \u2018the arbitrator has previous involvement in the case\u2019, under the so-called \u2018waivable red list\u2019 covering instances in which the arbitrator must withdraw unless otherwise expressly agreed by the parties (paragraph 2 of Part II of the Guidelines). According to the appellant, that circumstance could also come under the \u2018orange list\u2019 (intermediate situations which must be disclosed but do not necessarily justify a challenge), and specifically paragraph 3.1.5, which applies to an arbitrator \u2018who currently serves or has served within the past three years as arbitrator in another arbitration on a related issue involving one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties\u2019. The appointment of [D.-R. M.] as arbitrator by the respondent was a reflection, in the appellant\u2019s view, of the appreciation of the party which had won the first case between the same parties (appeal n. 75 in fine).",

To decide that issue, the facts, the procedural specificities and the specific issues raised at the various stages of the proceedings must be taken into account (ATF 126 I 168 at 2 and the cases cited). The same applies in the field of arbitration. An arbitrator\u2019s behaviour during the arbitration proceedings may also cast doubt on his independence and impartiality. However, the Federal Court has shown itself to be demanding in assessing whether there is a risk of bias. Thus there is case-law to the effect that procedural measures, whether right or wrong, are not sufficient per se to justify an objective suspicion of bias on the part of the arbitrator who has taken them (ATF 111 Ia 259 at 3b/at p. 264 and cases cited).

The arbitrators\u2019 task was therefore only to interpret the words \u2018unilateral breach\u2019 in the English version of Article 21 of the 2001 Regulations. The panel decided that issue of principle by finding that the aforesaid wording referred to the breaking of an employment contract and not to its termination.

Moreover, it does not appear from the 15 December 2005 award that the panel prejudged in any way the issue of the amount of compensation due by the appellant. It must also be emphasised that we are talking here about three awards issued in the same matter, substantively speaking, which could if appropriate have been made by the same panel, the first two being interlocutory in relation to the third, namely the final award now under appeal. As a matter of principle, save in exceptional circumstances, it is not admissible to challenge a posteriori the lawfulness of the composition of the arbitral panel which made the final award simply because its members had already ruled on the matter by participating in interlocutory or partial awards. To admit this would be tantamount to a call for the abolition of such awards, whilst their usefulness is no longer in issue. The appellant invokes no such circumstances. Consequently, the doubts he casts retrospectively as to the independence and impartiality of arbitrator [M.] are not justified.",

Any arbitrator could be challenged if the circumstances gave rise to legitimate doubts over his independence. Challenges, in the exclusive power of the ICAS, had to be brought promptly as soon as the ground for the challenge became known (Article R34 of the Code). An arbitrator could be removed by the ICAS if he refused to carry out or was prevented from carrying out his duties or if he failed to fulfil his duties pursuant to the Code. The ICAS could exercise such power through its Board, giving \u201cbrief reasons for its decision\u201d (Article R35 of the Code). In the case of a panel of three arbitrators, unless otherwise agreed, each party would choose its arbitrator and the president of the panel was chosen by those two arbitrators, or, in the absence of an agreement, appointed by the president of the Division (Article R40.2 of the Code). Arbitrators chosen by the parties or by other arbitrators were deemed appointed only after confirmation by the Division president. Once the panel was formed, the file was transferred to the arbitrators for their examination of the case and their award.",

On a vertical axis, the relationship between the athletes and the organisations which deal with various sports can thus be distinguished from horizontal relationships between parties to a contractual relationship (ATF 129 III 445 point 3.3.3.2 p. 461). This structural difference between the two types of relationship is not without influence on the meeting of the minds which leads to the formation of any agreement. In principle, where two parties do business on an equal footing, each one expresses its intention without being bound to submit to the wishes of the other. This is generally the case in international commercial relations. The situation is very different in the field of sport. Leaving aside the case \u2013 which is rather academic \u2013 where a well-known athlete, on account of his or her fame, would be in a position to dictate conditions to the international federation governing the relevant sport, experience shows that, most of the time, a sportsperson will not have free rein in his or her dealings with the federation and will be required to submit, for better or for worse, to its desires. Thus an athlete wishing to take part in a competition organised under the auspices of a sports federation whose regulations prescribe arbitration would have no choice other than to accept the arbitration clause, in particular by signing up to the instrument of the sports federation in question in which the clause is to be found, all the more so in the case of a professional. He or she will be confronted with the following dilemma: to agree to arbitration or practise his or sport in a non-professional context ... Presented with the choice between abiding by arbitration or practising the sport \u2018in the garden\u2019 ... while watching competitions \u2018on the TV\u2019 ..., an athlete who wants to play against real competitors or who must do so because it is his/her sole source of income (monetary or in kind, advertising revenue, etc.) will be obliged in actual fact, nolens volens, to opt for the first of those alternatives.",

The agreement stemming from the concordance between the will thus displayed and that expressed by the sports organisation concerned will consequently be affected thereby ab ovo on account of the mandatory consent given by one of the parties. By accepting beforehand to abide by any future award, the athlete, as has been shown, deprives himself at the outset of the right to seek redress at a later stage for any violation of fundamental principles or of essential procedural safeguards that could be committed by the arbitral tribunal ruling in his case. In addition, as regards any disciplinary penalty that may be imposed, such as suspension, which does not require an enforcement procedure, he will not be able to submit his complaints on such grounds to the enforcements judge. Accordingly, having regard to its importance, the objection that the athlete has waived any right of appeal may not, in principle, be raised, even where such a waiver would satisfy the formal conditions laid down in section 192 (1) PILA ... That conclusion is strengthened by the consideration that any refusal to examine the appeal of an athlete who had no choice other than to accept a waiver of a right of appeal in order to be allowed to participate in competitions also appears questionable in terms of Article 6 \u00a7 1 ECHR ...\u201d",

Reviewing the facts and the law with a full power of examination and having complete freedom to give a new decision in the place of the body which ruled previously (REEB, Revue, ibid.), it is more like a judicial authority that is independent of the parties. In respect thereof, the system of the list of arbitrators does not therefore raise the same objections as those encountered when it is used by arbitral tribunals set up by associations. Moreover, it is not certain that the so-called \u2018open list\u2019 system \u2013 providing the parties (or one of them) with the possibility of choosing an arbitrator outside the list, unlike the system of closed lists applied by the CAS (see CLAY, op. cit., n. 478 p. 400) \u2013, which is preferred by certain authors (see esp.: BADDELEY, op. cit., p. 274; STEPHAN NETZLE, \u2018Das Internationale Sport-Schiedsgericht in Lausanne. Zusammensetzung, Zust\u00e4ndigkeit und Verfahren\u2019, in Sportgerichtsbarkeit, in Recht und Sport, vol. 22, p. 9 ff., 12), constitutes a panacea. On the contrary, from the perspective of the efficiency of the arbitral tribunal, this system carries the risk that there might be, within the tribunal, one or more arbitrators who are not specialised and who may be inclined to act as if they were the lawyers of the parties who appointed them (see, on this subject, SCHILLIG, op. cit., p. \u00a0160).\u201d",

It should not take on the role of Contracting States, whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is based on the assumption \u2013 reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity \u2013 that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged violation. The rule is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.

It should be emphasised that the Court is not a court of first instance; it does not have the capacity, nor is it appropriate to its function as an international court, to adjudicate on large numbers of cases which require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation \u2013 both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic courts (ibid., \u00a7 70).",

In view of the dimension of international sports events, it would not be acceptable for the question of arbitration to be negotiated individually with each of the participants in such events. The Government explained that those events were organised in different countries by organisations whose seats were situated in various States and that they were open to athletes from all over the world.

Similarly, the procedural public policy laid down in section 190(2)(a) of the PILA guaranteed the parties the right to an independent judgment on the submissions and statement of facts before the court in a manner consistent with the applicable procedure.

The phrase \u201cestablished by law\u201d covers not only the legal basis for the very existence of a \u201ctribunal\u201d but also the composition of the bench in each case (see Lavents v.

Austria, no.\u00a08790/79, \u00a7 36, 22 October 1984). A court or tribunal is characterised in that substantive sense by its judicial function, that is to say determining matters within its competence on the basis of legal rules, with full jurisdiction and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner (see ibid., and Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a025781/94, \u00a7 233, ECHR\u00a02001IV). A power of decision is inherent in the very notion of \u201ctribunal\u201d. The procedure before it must ensure the \u201cdetermination of the matters in dispute\u201d as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Benthem v. the Netherlands, 23\u00a0October 1985, \u00a7 40, Series A no.\u00a097). For the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1, a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated within the standard judicial machinery. It may be set up to deal with specific subject matter which can be appropriately administered outside the ordinary court system (see Rolf Gustafson v. Sweden, 1 July 1997, \u00a7\u00a045, Reports 1997IV). In addition, only an institution that has full jurisdiction and satisfies a number of requirements, such as independence from the executive and also from the parties, merits the designation \u201ctribunal\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Beaumartin v. France, 24\u00a0November 1994, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 296B, and Di Giovanni v. Italy, no.\u00a051160/06, \u00a7\u00a052, 9\u00a0July 2013).",

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2005\u2011XIII). Thus in cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of a judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports 1996-III).",

Only one fifth of the members of the CAS, at best, could thus be regarded as independent vis-\u00e0-vis those organisations, and the individuals making up that fifth were, moreover, chosen by the ICAS, a body under the influence of the above-mentioned organisations. This situation casts doubt on the impartiality and independence not only of the independent experts appointed by the ICAS, but also of those arbitrators who were chosen with a view to safeguarding the interests of the athletes. This mechanism of appointment by one fifths was in fact abolished in 2012 and replaced by a more general scheme: the ICAS must now \u201ccall upon personalities ... whose names and qualifications are brought to the attention of the ICAS, including by the IOC, the IFs and the NOCs\u201d (see paragraph 38 of the judgment).

In our view, to impose such a requirement goes beyond what the Court requires in cases concerning \u201cobjective impartiality\u201d and \u201cindependence\u201d.",

In determining whether a tribunal is \u201cindependent\u201d, the Court \u201chas ... regard to the manner of appointment of its members and the duration of their term of office ..., the existence of guarantees against outside pressures ... and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence ...\u201d (Campbell\u00a0and Fell v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 28 June 1984, nos. 7819/77 and 7878/77, \u00a7\u00a078, Series A no.\u00a080). When the Court carries out such an analysis, it need not therefore necessarily examine the question whether a particular judge was biased or lacking in independence. For instance, if it were called upon to analyse the composition of employment tribunals or lease and rent tribunals, it would always make sure that the composition is balanced. It would not accept an employment tribunal made up (almost) exclusively of employers\u2019 representatives, and this would be the case even if the representative in a given case were impartial. In our opinion, there is no reason why the Court should not apply this reasoning mutatis mutandis in the present case.",

However, we consider that this indirect influence of the organisations is considerable. Firstly, the ICAS supervises the stability of the CAS members, that is to say, even though those members are appointed for a four-year term, they may be removed at any time by the ICAS on the basis of a decision with \u201cbrief reasons\u201d (see paragraph 155 of the judgment). In addition, the presidents of the two divisions of the CAS are also members of the ICAS. Should the parties fail to reach agreement, they are responsible for appointing the presidents of the panels. Thirdly, the so-called \u201cclosed list\u201d system results in the athletes being obliged to choose their arbitrator from among the individuals selected by the ICAS. The argument put forward by the Federal Court that an open list \u201ccarries the risk that there might be, within the tribunal, one or more arbitrators who are not specialised and who may be inclined to act as if they were the lawyers of the parties who appointed them\u201d (see paragraph 44 of the judgment) is not convincing. In much more technical areas \u2013 such as in the pharmaceutical or aeronautical industry \u2013 the parties may choose their arbitrator freely without there being any problem.",

This lack of independence was in fact expressly acknowledged in the very text of Article S14 of the Code of Arbitration, as applicable at the relevant time, which emphasised that only \u201c1/5th of the arbitrators [were to be] chosen from among persons independent of the bodies responsible for proposing arbitrators in conformity with the present article\u201d, and constitutes a fundamental problem for this institution. In our view, the Court should have carried out a more in-depth analysis as to the legitimate fear of the athletes to be bound by the jurisdiction of a body which has no appearance of independence. As the Court has previously found in other cases, \u201cthe standpoint of the applicant is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified\u201d (see Pescador Valero v. Spain, 17 June 2003, no. 62435/00, \u00a7\u00a023, Report 2003-VII, and, in the same vein, De Cubber v. Belgian, 26\u00a0October 1984, no. 9186/80, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 86).
