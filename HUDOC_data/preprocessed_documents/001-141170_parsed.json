In particular, the applicant had not pursued a civil action for damages against the two police officers based on the general provisions concerning civil damages provided for in Articles 998-999 of the Civil Code, in force at the relevant time. They maintained that, since the criminal courts had left the applicant\u2019s request for damages unresolved, he could have brought a separate action in this respect before the civil courts. They also submitted that the intention to commit a crime was an element required only to establish criminal responsibility, while before the civil courts negligence was enough to establish a person\u2019s civil liability. The Government did not submit examples of relevant domestic case-law in this respect. They further contended that in the case Lazzarini and Ghiacci \nv. Italy ((dec.), no. 53749/00, 7 November 2002) the Court had held that the applicants had a civil remedy available, which, following the rejection of their criminal complaint, they had failed to pursue.",

However, the Court reiterates, as the Government also pointed out, that at the time of the events civil liability had a subjective character in Romanian law, requiring proof of negligence on the part of the person complained against (see Eugenia Laz\u0103r v. Romania, no.\u00a032146/05, \n\u00a7 90, 16 February 2010). Therefore, bearing in mind that the criminal courts excluded any type of intention or negligence on behalf of the police officers and decided that they had acted within their duties as provided for by law and that these judgments are binding on the civil courts, the Court considers that it is highly unlikely that an action for compensation under the Civil Code would have had any prospects of success in the current case.
