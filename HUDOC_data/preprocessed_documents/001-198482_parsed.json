The applicant had not demonstrated that the administrative proceedings against him had had any adverse effect on him. The issues raised in the application were subject to the Court\u2019s well-established caselaw (Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, 10 July 2012).

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant\u2019s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom (dec.) no. 300/11, \u00a7\u00a042, 6\u00a0September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v.

The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society (see, among other authorities, Navalnyy v.\u00a0Russia [GC], nos.\u00a029580/12 and 4 others, \u00a7 98, 15 November 2018). In cases concerning freedom of assembly the Court, when applying the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention, should take due account of the importance of this freedom and exercise a careful scrutiny (compare, in the context of Article 10, Sylka v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 19219/07, \u00a7\u00a028, 3 June 2014; see also, in the context of Article\u00a011, Berladir and Others v.

Considering that the applicant was subjected to administrative-offence proceedings for his participation in a peaceful assembly, the alleged violation of Article 11 of the Convention in the present case concerns, in the Court\u2019s view, \u201cimportant questions of principle\u201d. The Court is thus satisfied that the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the administrative-offence proceedings against him regardless of pecuniary interests and does not deem it necessary to consider in the context of its analysis of the Government\u2019s objection whether respect for human rights compels it to examine the case or whether it has been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v. San Marino, no. 28005/12, \u00a7 39, 7 July 2015).",

It has been the Court\u2019s constant approach to regard the notion of an assembly as an autonomous concept (ibid.). Given the format of the gathering that the applicant has described as a flash mob, the Court considers that it fell within the notion of \u201cpeaceful assembly\u201d contained in Article\u00a011. The applicant intended to take part in this assembly and never denied it; even if he did not consider it a \u201cpublic event\u201d or a \u201cstatic demonstration\u201d subject to notification under the applicable national law, he had been exercising his right to freedom of peaceful assembly under Article 11 of the Convention. In the Court\u2019s view, the dispersal of the assembly and the ensuing sanctions constituted \u201ca restriction\u201d, within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 11, and thus an interference with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly as protected by the first paragraph of this Article (ibid., \u00a7 108). It thus remains for the Court to be ascertained whether the interference was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d, pursued one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 of Article 11, and was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for the achievement of the aim or aims in question (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v.\u00a0Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a037553/05, \u00a7\u00a0102, ECHR 2015).",

The applicant stressed both at the national level and before the Court that the assembly he had taken part in could not be regarded as a static demonstration within the meaning of the Public Events Act.

Regardless of whether an assembly in the form of a flash mob falls within the scope of the Public Events Act, it is essential for the Court to establish whether the applicant\u2019s right to peaceful assembly has been respected. In view of its findings below it is unnecessary to decide whether the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of assembly was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d or pursued one or more legitimate aims (see, mutatis mutandis, M\u0103t\u0103saru v.\u00a0the Republic of Moldova, nos. 69714/16 and 71685/16, \u00a7 32, 15\u00a0January 2019).

While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public demonstrations, since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (ibid., \u00a7 150).",

What is salient to the Court is the fact that nothing in the actions of the applicant and the other participants in the flash mob could be described as incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles. They did not do anything capable of causing disorder or disruption to ordinary life. Indeed, seven people standing in silence with their mouths sealed with adhesive tape and holding blank sheets of paper hardly represent a threat to public order. However, the domestic authorities did not show the requisite degree of tolerance towards their peaceful gathering despite the absence of any risk of insecurity or disturbance, seemingly in disregard of what the Court has emphasised on numerous occasions, namely that the enforcement of rules governing public assemblies should not become an end in itself (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, \u00a7 155, and Navalnyy, \u00a7 144, both cited above).",

They merely observed that the applicant had failed to comply with the prior-notification requirement in respect of the social situation that, in their view, had doubtlessly amounted to a static demonstration (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). The Court reiterates that the proportionality principle demands that a balance be struck between the requirements of the purposes listed in Article 11 \u00a7 2 on the one hand, and those of the free expression of opinions by word, gesture or even silence by persons assembled on the streets or in other public places, on the other (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0144). It considers that the domestic judicial bodies in the course of the administrative-offence proceedings against the applicant did not seek to strike this balance giving the preponderant weight to the formal unlawfulness of the presumed static demonstration.",

Russia, no. 46998/08, \u00a7\u00a7 57-69, 19 November 2015, and Navalnyy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079). Accordingly, the applicant was subject to sanctions which, although classified as administrative under domestic law, were \u201ccriminal\u201d within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, thereby attracting the application of this provision under its \u201ccriminal\u201d head. However, a peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction and notably to deprivation of liberty. Where the sanctions imposed on a demonstrator are criminal in nature, they require particular justification. The freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subject to a sanction \u2013 even one at the lower end of the scale \u2013 for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as that person does not her or himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Navalnyy, cited above, \u00a7 145).",

The provision at hand may have an impact on the effective protection of human rights because the Convention is a shield of protection for any violation of the rights safeguarded by it. Therefore, the interpretation and application of the provision under discussion is very important. The fact that Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention has been interpreted as not giving a judge the right to deliver a separate opinion in the context of a decision, but only in that of a judgment, has prevented judicial dialogue on Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) from developing in inadmissibility decisions where complaints were dismissed on the basis of this new criterion.

In the present case the Court considers that once the first criterion of inadmissibility is not fulfilled, then there is no need to examine the others, but the holistic approach that I propose is not only a means of preventing an unjustified conclusion of inadmissibility, it is also a means of reinforcing any rejection of such a conclusion by ensuring effectiveness.

However, this is not the only test of a minimum level of severity applied by the Court. The attainment of a minimum level of severity (threshold of severity) test, a test not laid down anywhere in the Convention, but rather Court-made, was required by the Court as early as 1978 in the case of Ireland v. the United Kingdom for alleged ill-treatment to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. Since then, about thirty-two years before the entry into force of Protocol No. 14, there has been an abundance of case-law requiring such a minimum test for Article 3 complaints which has so far been extended also to Article 8 complaints and there is nothing to guarantee that it cannot be applied by the Court in relation to other Articles, though regarding every right different considerations of suffering may apply. Conversely, the \u201cno significant disadvantage\u201d admissibility criterion is not limited to any human right; consequently it can apply in theory and/or in practice in respect of any human right, including the rights guaranteed in Articles 3 and 8. The issue of seriousness or severity of an alleged violation in the above two contexts was acknowledged by the Court in Denisov v. Ukraine ([GC], no. 76639/11, \u00a7\u00a7 110-12, 25 September 2018):",

It has been used by the Court in order to find out whether an alleged violation falls within the scope of Article 3 or Article 8, as the case may be. And for the alleged violation to be so considered, it must attain a minimum level of severity. It seems that the Court has never defined what the \u201cscope\u201d of a right is. However, the term \u201cscope\u201d seems to mean the extent of the area or subject matter that a right deals with or to which it is relevant. It can also be said that the scope of a right, as used in the Court-made test of minimum severity, is the ratione materiae applicability of the right. In other words, it is \u201cthe subjective content of the rights that calls for effective protection\u201d. I also believe that the scope of a right is the scope of its protection in a wider sense, before being weighed against any limitations, also taking into account the aim of the relevant Convention provision as well as its text, by following the single integrated rule of interpretation of Article 31 \u00a7 1 of the VCLT. I humbly suggest, that, in determining the scope of a right (including its different dimensions), the \u201cintension\u201d and the \u201cextension\u201d of the relevant term in a Convention provision must also be taken into account. These dimensions of a term, \u201cintension\u201d and \u201cextension\u201d, I borrow from logic and I consider them extremely relevant and important also for the interpretation of legal terms concerning human rights. In logic \u201cintension\u201d consists of the essential qualities, properties or characteristics of the terms, while \u201cextension\u201d consists of the things to which the term refers.",

According to the case-law of the Court, however, when a measure falls short of Article 3 ill-treatment, it may nevertheless fall foul of Article 8. For instance, conditions of detention may give rise to an Article 8 violation where they do not attain the level of severity necessary for a violation of Article 3. In such cases, one cannot speak of one circle but of two circles, where the complaint falls outside the circle of protection of Article 3 but falls within the circle of protection of Article 8.",

In particular, there is caselaw where the Court examined the test: (a) at the merits stage, and found no violation of Article 3; (b) at the merits stage, and found a violation of Article 3 or Article 8; (c) at the merits stage, and rejected the complaint under Article 8 as manifestly ill founded; (d) at the admissibility stage and found no violation of Article 3; (e) at the admissibility stage and rejected the complaint under Article 8 as incompatible ratione materiae pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a); (f) at the admissibility stage and rejected the complaint under Article 3 as manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a).

In the same vein, it is one thing when applying the test to make a full examination of the case on the merits and find a violation or no violation of a right and another when applying the test to make only a prima facie examination of the case and to find that the complaint is ratione materiae inadmissible or even illfounded.",

This order or sequence of the application of the two tests of severity is supported by the approach of the Court in Denisov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 88-89, 94, 133-134), where the Court rejected the Article 8 complaint as being incompatible ratione materiae pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a), because it did not cross the threshold of seriousness for an issue to be raised under this provision.

And if the complaint is within the scope of the right, thus within the circle of its protection, the \u201cno significant disadvantage\u201d admissibility criterion\u2019s role is to assist the Court in determining whether the applicant has not suffered any significant disadvantage.

And, as has been said above, the means used by the two tests in their function is the same, i.e. the applicant\u2019s suffering: enough suffering to enter the circle of the right\u2019s protection (a sort of \u201cpassport\u201d to enter) and no significant suffering to stay in the circle.
