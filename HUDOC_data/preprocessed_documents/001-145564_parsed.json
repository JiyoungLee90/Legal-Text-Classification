In the two 1976 decisions the omission by a party to act in proceedings was due to the failure of a neighbour to transmit a notification to that party. In the two 1999 decisions the omission was due to: first, the delivery of a notification, intended for a refugee applicant, not to the latter but to the national authorities responsible for deciding on refugee claims, when those national authorities were a respondent in the same case (and the court concluded that it was in the respondent\u2019s interest to delay handing the notification to the refugee with a view to his missing the time-limit for appeal); and secondly, the inability of a party to appeal because of his being sent temporarily to serve his military duties outside the usual military station. In the 2000 case, the reason for allowing renewal of a time-limit was that a neighbor who had received the notification only handed it to the claimant after expiry of the statutory timelimit for appeal. In the 2003 decision the omission to appeal was due to a sudden serious illness of the party who had been taken to hospital during the time-limit.",

Ireland, 26 May 1994, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 290; Kroon\u00a0and Others v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1994, \u00a7 31, Series A no.\u00a0297C; R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski v.

For example, in the context of fair trial guarantees, it has found that the principle of equality of arms \u2013 in the sense of a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the parties \u2013 requires that each party should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis\u00e0vis his opponent (see, among other authorities, Dombo Beheer B.V. v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 274). This principle would be devoid of substance if a party to the case were not notified of the hearing in such a way as to have an opportunity to attend it, should he or she decide to exercise a right to appear established in domestic law (see Zagorodnikov v. Russia, no. 66941/01, \u00a7 30, 7 June 2007).

Finland, 23 September 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 299A; Shofman v. Russia, no. 74826/01, \u00a7 35, 24\u00a0November 2005; Kalacheva v. Russia, no. 3451/05, \u00a7 34, 7 May 2009; Mikuli\u0107 v.

It is true that the authorities\u2019 decision to proceed with the hearing in the case, as opposed to adjourning it until the applicant was located, may have pursued the legitimate aim of conducting the proceedings with the necessary speediness. However, their positive obligations under Article 8 required that they strike a fair balance between the interests and rights of all parties, including the applicant as the putative father, taking into account the best interests of the child (see X v. Latvia [GC], cited above, \u00a7 95). The Court notes in that connection that the applicant\u2019s \u201cpermanent address\u201d was known to the authorities who visited it once in April 2002 in order to summon him to the proceedings. The summons officer having noted on a single occasion that the applicant no longer lived there and, considering that the address at which he could be found was unknown, the authorities proceeded by summoning him via a publication in the State Gazette. According to Article 50, CCP 1952, the fact that the defendant\u2019s address was unknown, had to be established by an inquiry with the address registry office or otherwise (see paragraph 18 above). The Court notes that nothing in the case file shows that the authorities made inquiries with the address registry office so as to establish whether he had any other address registered with that office. Similarly, they did not seek to establish by other means, apart from accepting a summons officer\u2019s note about a neighbour\u2019s statement in April 2002, whether any other address was known to them in respect of the applicant. The Court also notes that they ultimately found him at that same \u201cpermanent address\u201d when the bailiff visited it in April 2004 and informed him of his outstanding obligation to pay child maintenance (see paragraph 13 above).",

The Court observes that it cannot be established on the basis of the information in the file whether the applicant was absent from his \u201cpermanent address\u201d for more than 30 consecutive days, so as to have been under the obligation according to national law to inform the authorities of his \u201ctemporary address\u201d (see paragraph 17 above). However, even assuming that he was away for longer than 30 days and failed to inform the authorities about it, the Court recalls that it is not its role to consider in the abstract whether national law conforms to the Convention (see, among other authorities, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7 153, Series A no. 324; Pham Hoang v.

Russia, no. 11751/03, \u00a7 39, 8 October 2009). It must confine its attention, as far as possible, to the particular circumstances of the case before it (see, among other authorities, Wettstein v. Switzerland, no.\u00a033958/96, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2000XII; Sommerfeld v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a031871/96, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2003VIII). The Court will therefore have regard primarily to the applicant\u2019s personal situation.",

In that context, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that a DNA test was the scientific method available at the time for accurately determining paternity of a child and its probative value substantially outweighed any other evidence presented by the parties to prove or disprove the biological paternity. Consequently, had the applicant been given an opportunity personally to participate in the court proceedings, he would have been able definitively to settle the matter of paternity by undergoing a DNA test. That would have been in the interest of all parties concerned.",

The national authorities are better placed than international judges to find the optimal solution in the circumstances (see, among many other authorities, Tolstoy\u00a0Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13 July 1995, \u00a7 48, Series A no.\u00a0316B). What is important, however, is to ensure effective respect for the applicant\u2019s right to private life. That, translated in practical terms, meant giving him an opportunity to present his position, including by providing DNA evidence. Given the subject matter in dispute, namely establishment of the applicant\u2019s biological paternity, the Court is of the view that the personal participation of the applicant in the proceedings was crucial for the reliability of the outcome. It is therefore not convinced that the participation of the applicant\u2019s ex officio lawyer was sufficient to secure the effective, proper and satisfactory presentation of the applicant\u2019s case. Only the applicant himself could, not only by testifying in person but also by providing DNA evidence, substantiate his position. In that connection the Court recalls that, in a series of cases in which it examined the question of personal participation of applicants in judicial proceedings as a \u201cfair trial\u201d issue under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Sokur v. Russia, no.\u00a023243/03, \u00a7 30 et seq., 15 October 2009; Kovalev v. Russia, no.\u00a078145/01, \u00a7 37, 10 May 2007; Gryaznov v. Russia, no. 19673/03, \u00a7 49, 12\u00a0June 2012; Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7\u00a7 53 et seq., 23\u00a0October 2008; Mokhov v. Russia, no. 28245/04, \u00a7\u00a7 41 et seq., 4 March 2010), it found a violation of that provision as a result of the applicants not having been given an opportunity to take part in hearings, when their participation would have been crucial as their claims had been largely based on their personal experience. In view of all the above, the Court finds that in the present case the applicant had not been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide him with the requisite protection of his interests (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Latvia, [GC], cited above, \u00a7 119, where the court found that the decision-making process under domestic law did not satisfy the procedural requirements inherent in Article 8 of the Convention; see, to the contrary, Sommerfeld v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 31871/96, \u00a7\u00a7 69 and 74, ECHR 2003VIII (extracts)).",
