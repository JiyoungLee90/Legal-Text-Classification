On 19 June 2000 it reopened the proceedings and scheduled a further hearing for 13 July 2000, as the expert had used documents in his report which had not yet been introduced in the proceedings. It granted the parties two weeks to make their comments. At the applicant's request, the Court postponed the hearing to 11 September 2000.

Thereafter a neurootologic expert report would be commissioned. It invited the parties to make their comments and to make suggestions as to the appointment of experts by 22 January 2002.
After an extension of this time-limit the defendants made their comments on 27 February 2002. On 16 April 2002 the  ordered an interdisciplinary expert report. On 4 July 2002 it appointed the experts agreed upon by the parties after the applicants had paid the court fees and exempted the expert from complying with his obligation of confidentiality (Schweigepflicht).

On 10 February 2006 the court declared that it would be too early to order an expert report on the applicability of French law, as the neurootologic expert had to supplement his report because he had not taken sufficiently into account the findings of a private expert report which the applicants had already submitted during the proceedings preceding the remittal.

On 4 May 2007 the court requested the applicants to pay a further advance on the fees for the preparation of a neuropsychological expert report and the expert report on French law. On 29 May 2007 the court appointed the experts. However, on 13 July 2007 the court had to appoint another neuropsychological expert as the other expert was ill.
On 5 September 2007 the report on French law was submitted.
On 9 November 2007 the neuropsychological expert submitted his report, after examining the applicants on 14 September 2007.
On 11 December 2007 the court held an oral hearing in which the parties agreed to stay the proceedings in view of pending extrajudicial friendly settlement negotiations between the parties.
