He submitted several documents to show that the lustration decision had been a result of mistaken identity. The documents were his birth certificate, which showed a date of birth that was different from the one in file no. 6825; an inheritance decision, certified by a notary public, attesting that the applicant had a sister rather than a brother; his notarised military card, which showed that in 1963 he had been doing military service in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and a death certificate showing that his father had died in 1962. He argued that he had never visited Sweden and had lived since 1955 in Skopje. He also challenged the veracity and authenticity of the documents in file no. 2599 and denied that he had ever collaborated with or provided any information about any colleague to the State security services, let alone that any such collaboration had met the criteria specified in section 18 of the Lustration Act (see paragraph 24 below). In that connection, he submitted that none of the documents in the file had been signed by him. Lastly, he complained about the fact that the decision on the Commission\u2019s website had included his father\u2019s name, despite the fact that the Lustration Act made no provision for the release of such information.

In Ivanovski, it found that the civil limb of Article 6 was applicable to the lustration proceedings in that case, which had been conducted under the 2008 Lustration Act (see Ivanovski, cited above, \u00a7 120). The Court notes that the main features of the lustration proceedings regulated under that Act (the administrative nature of the proceedings, the fact that judicial review was carried out by administrative courts on the basis of the rules of administrative and/or civil-law procedure, ibid., \u00a7 121 and paragraphs 6 and 30 above) also apply to the impugned proceedings in the present case. The key difference between the 2008 and 2012 Lustration Acts is that the latter did not oblige holders of public office or candidates for such office to submit a written declaration that they had not worked with the security services, but vested the Lustration Commission with the power to scrutinise the past of such people and, on the basis of documentary evidence, to issue a decision confirming such collaboration. The fact that under the 2012 Lustration Act former collaborators with the communist-era security services were not punished for submitting a false declaration is a further element that militates against the applicability of Article 6 under its criminal head to the lustration proceedings (see, by contrast, Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a038184/03, \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 53). Furthermore, the Court notes that criminal-law provisions concerning a \u201cprohibition on exercising a profession, activity or duty\u201d referred to by the applicant (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above), were not applied by the domestic authorities. For those reasons, it considers that the civil limb of Article 6 is applicable in the present case.",

They rejected the applicant\u2019s first argument (about mistaken identity), holding that the Commission had identified him by referring in its decision to his personal identification number, his place of birth and the positions he had held under the former regime. The Court observes that from the administrative courts\u2019 reasoning it cannot be readily inferred to what extent the courts substantively examined either the actual records about the applicant allegedly held by the security bodies or, importantly, the evidence adduced by the applicant himself. In these circumstances, Article 6 of the Convention required the domestic courts to provide a more substantial statement of their reasons rather than simply saying that \u201c[the applicant] had not submitted any evidence that led to different facts\u201d (see paragraph 14 above).",

The Court notes that the Administrative Court did not specify what kind of proceedings the applicant should have initiated. Furthermore, it finds it difficult to accept that he was supposed to institute those proceedings \u201cbefore the impugned decision [of the Commission] had been delivered\u201d. In that connection, there was nothing to suggest that the applicant had been aware before the Commission\u2019s decision was served on him on 4 June 2013 that the former regime\u2019s security services had held any information on him. In any event, the Court rejected a similar argument raised by the Government in Ivanovski (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 157-162), finding it decisive that the courts at two levels that had examined the applicant\u2019s action for judicial review had exercised full jurisdiction over the facts and law and had examined the case on the merits.

Furthermore, it was not alleged, in the domestic proceedings or before the Court, that he was a candidate for any such office at the time. The Court finds noteworthy that the Venice Commission in its amicus curiae brief on the 2012 Lustration Act also expressed the view that the publication of Lustration Commission findings prior to their review by a court was irreconcilable with Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 41 above).
