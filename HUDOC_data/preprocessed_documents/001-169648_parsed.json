After a period of custody in police stations, they were grouped together and taken by bus to a court, which summarily imposed administrative penalties on them and gave decisions ordering their administrative expulsion from Russian territory. Subsequently, after sometimes undergoing a medical visit and a blood test, they were taken to detention centres for foreigners where they were detained for varying periods of time, and then taken by bus to various airports in Moscow, and expelled to Georgia by aeroplane.

As to facts in dispute, the Court reiterates its jurisprudence requiring a standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d in its assessment of evidence. Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (Aslakhanova and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and 42509/10, \u00a7 95, 18\u00a0December 2012, with further references).",

Under certain circumstances the Court has borne in mind the difficulties associated with obtaining evidence and the fact that often little evidence can be submitted by the applicants in support of their applications (Saydulkhanova v. Russia, no. 25521/10, \u00a7\u00a056, 25\u00a0June 2015). According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, in these cases it is for the applicant to make only a prima facie case and to adduce appropriate evidence. If, in response to such allegations made by the applicants, the Government then fail to disclose crucial documents to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation, strong inferences may be drawn. The prima facie threshold is reached primarily on the basis of witness statements, including the applicants\u2019 submission to the Court and to domestic authorities, and other evidence (see Aslakhanova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97, 99, with further references). However, where the applicants fail to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof can not be reversed (see Saydulkhanova, cited above, \u00a7 56, with further references).",

In such circumstances, the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible and satisfactory explanation as to what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities, but left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that, again in the context of a complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, it has required proof in the form of concordant inferences before the burden of proof is shifted to the Government (see El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7 153, with further references).",

The Court also notes that the Kuzminskiy District Court did not order the applicant\u2019s subsequent detention in one of the Centres for Temporary Detention of Aliens, as the Russian courts did in other cases. Accordingly the Court considers the information submitted by the applicant insufficient to conclude that he has made a prima facie case.
