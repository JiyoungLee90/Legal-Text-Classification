It held that the record of the applicant\u2019s administrative offence had not contained specific reasons for his arrest, that those reasons had not been established in the course of the administrative proceedings, and that the record of the applicant\u2019s administrative arrest had not been in the case file; thus there had been no lawful grounds for arresting him. It stressed that an administrative arrest was a measure of restraint which could be applied only in the exceptional circumstances provided for by law and that those circumstances had not been present in the applicant\u2019s case. Therefore, there were no grounds for finding the applicant guilty of committing the administrative offence of disobeying a lawful order of the police under Article 19.3 \u00a7 1 of the CAO.

In cases of wilful ill-treatment by State agents, a breach of Article 3 cannot be remedied only by an award of compensation to the victim because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful ill-treatment by State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2010). Therefore, in such cases two measures are indispensable to provide sufficient redress. Firstly, the State authorities must have conducted a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Secondly, an award of compensation to the applicant is required where appropriate or, at least, the possibility of seeking and obtaining compensation for the damage which the applicant sustained as a result of the ill-treatment (ibid., \u00a7 116, and Razzakov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 57519/09, \u00a7 50, 5 February 2015).",

Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7\u00a7 88 and 100, ECHR 2015). In respect of recourse to physical force during an arrest, Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force for effecting a lawful arrest (see Annenkov and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a031475/10, \u00a7 79, 25 July 2017). However, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Ivan Vasilev v.
