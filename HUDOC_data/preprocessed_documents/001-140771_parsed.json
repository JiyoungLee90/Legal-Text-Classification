This restriction, however, had been in accordance with the applicable domestic law and had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others. The competent civil courts had also properly assessed the facts and adequately applied the relevant domestic legislation. The applicant\u2019s allegation to the effect that her lawyer, Mr NB, had deliberately failed to represent her properly in a pending civil case, had been a statement of fact in support of which no credible evidence had ever been offered. This statement had likewise not been given in any constructive social context, but merely as an expression of the applicant\u2019s personal dissatisfaction. Further, Mr NB, being a practising lawyer, could not have remained passive in the face of such serious allegations undermining his very livelihood. Finally, the Government argued that neither the sum which had been awarded to Mr NB by the civil courts, consistent with damages awarded in other similar cases, nor the manner of its subsequent enforcement could be deemed disproportionate. While, admittedly, the applicant\u2019s pension had been low this could not have absolved her from paying for the profound damage caused to Mr NB. In any event, approximately one third of the total principal sum due to be paid by the applicant consisted of the costs incurred by Mr NB in the course of the civil and enforcement proceedings.",

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, among many other authorities, Mouvement ra\u00eblien suisse v. Switzerland [GC], no. 16354/06, \u00a7\u00a048, ECHR 2012 (extracts)).

The said deductions began as of 8 August 2009, and by 30 June 2013 the applicant had paid a total of approximately EUR 4,350 (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). Nevertheless given the accrued and future interest, she will have to continue with the payments for approximately another two years (see paragraph 29 above). In May 2012 the applicant\u2019s monthly pension was some EUR 170. After deductions, she was hence left with approximately EUR 60 on which to live and buy her monthly medication (see paragraph 28 above). Since the latter would cost her approximately EUR 44, she maintained, and the Government never contested this assertion, that she can no longer afford to buy it (see paragraph 31 above). This is in the Court\u2019s opinion a particularly precarious situation for an elderly person suffering from a number of serious diseases (see paragraph 30 above).",

Croatia, no. 9143/08, \u00a7 35, 15 July 2010). It is further understood that its role of guardian of the Constitution makes it particularly necessary for a Constitutional Court sometimes to take into account considerations other than the mere chronological order in which cases are entered on the list, such as the nature of a case and its importance in political and social terms (see \u0160iki\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 9143/08, \u00a7 37, 15 July 2010). Turning to the matter at hand, the Court notes that the impugned proceedings had been instituted on 29 May 2009 (see paragraph 19 above). Some two and a half years later, on 21 December 2011, the applicant was informed of the adoption of the decision in her case, although the decision itself would seem to have been served by 23 April 2012 (see paragraph 24 above). Finally, the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint was of some complexity, and the applicant herself had repeatedly supplemented the original constitutional appeal with additional submissions (see paragraphs 19, 20 and 22 above). In such circumstances, the underlying civil defamation proceeding having themselves lasted for approximately two years and four months (see\u00a0paragraphs 14-17 above) and despite the applicant\u2019s advanced age and the seriousness of the issues at stake for her, the Court cannot but reject this complaint as manifestly ill-founded in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention (compare and contrast to, for example, Nikolac v. Croatia, no. 17117/06, \u00a7 17, 10 July 2008, Butkovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 32264/03, \u00a7 27, 24 May 2007, and \u0160iki\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 37, where the Court found violations of the reasonable time requirement contained in Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention in urgent cases involving labour-related and housing issues; the constitutional proceedings therein had lasted for approximately three years and four months, three years and six months, and three years and nine months, respectively, and considered together with the prior civil proceedings had lasted globally for approximately seven years, six and a half years, and five years within the Court\u2019s competence ratione temporis respectively).",

The limitation of her freedom of expression was found by the domestic courts to serve the legitimate goal of protecting reputation, in accordance with Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. I personally agree with the methodology which the Court applied in this case, namely that the limitation of freedom of expression is a matter to be considered within the four corners of Article 10 only, and an interference with freedom of expression is a matter of proportionality under that Article (see Karak\u00f3 v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 39311/05, 28 April 2009).

These are, among other factors, the position of the allegedly defamed person (public figure), the function of the speaker (social watchdog function), the nature of the discourse (speech on matters of public interest), the veracity of the statements made, and whether they were made in good faith (see, among other authorities, Axel Springer AG, cited above). None of these elements is present in this case: here, the applicant willingly and actively brought to the knowledge of the general public a factually untrue, defamatory statement which was likely to have severe consequences for the defamed person (that is, debarment). The Court\u2019s reference to the existence of an investigation following the complaints made by the applicant against the lawyer cannot be regarded as an indication that there was any truth in the allegations: where a matter is reported to the authorities they have to handle the matter seriously. The result of the investigation is what matters: in this case, given the interests of the defamed lawyer in protection of his reputation, the award was neither irrational nor disproportionate. The private interest in expressing personal discontent by disclosing false factual allegations to the general public is not a matter protected by the Convention. It is probable that the application should have been rejected as an abuse of the right of individual application.",

The Court brings a novel consideration into the analysis of proportionality, namely exclusive reliance on the alleged severity of the civil sanction imposed. In other words, Article 10 is applied in the total absence of an interest in freedom of expression. It is true that the Court asserts that the statement at issue cannot be held to be merely a gratuitous personal attack, seeing that the applicant\u2019s request to take over as a subsidiary prosecutor was not rejected for some time (see paragraph 66 of the judgment). Suffice it to say, however, that the complaint did not concern the disputed statement and was barred by the statute of limitations, and the delay cannot be held in any way to be an indication of the factual correctness of the allegation. Likewise, I have difficulties in following the second argument put forward by the Court, namely that there is a public-interest element present, given the role of lawyers in the proper administration of justice. This uncontroversial truth cannot be seen to be relevant here, as the statement related to a personal grievance. In the present case the activities of the lawyer cannot be attributed to the State; the lawyer acted within the traditional client-lawyer relationship without any impact on the public interest in the administration of justice.",

Freedom of expression entails responsibilities, and these responsibilities cannot be different on the grounds of existential difficulties affecting the speaker. Poverty cannot be an excuse for irresponsible private injury.

An individual will receive fair compensation only if there is a deep pocket to compensate that individual. This logic is hard to reconcile with the fundamentals of modern tort law, which is based on the assumption that the damage caused has to be undone, irrespective of the status of the parties involved. People are entitled on an equal footing to the protection of their reputation. The national law did allow for compensation in instalments, and therefore an element of \u201cclemency\u201d or flexibility reflecting the applicant\u2019s personal difficulties is present here. The domestic courts applied the discretion granted by law. It is not for an international court of human rights to review the equity of these lawful discretionary powers.",

The Court found in that case that under the Convention, an award of damages for defamation must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (ibid., \u00a7 49). This principle was not contested in the present judgment; considerations regarding the injury to reputation suffered are different from the alleged financial difficulties an award imposes on a person who defames someone else.",

It would not be appropriate to speculate in this dissent as to the existence of additional reasons for the finding of a violation in that case. Suffice it to say that the excessive sanctions imposed on a journalist had a clear chilling effect on news-gathering, and it was not the mere existential difficulty caused by the award made by the domestic courts that justified the finding of a violation.",

This might exceptionally fall within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, it seems to me that the deprivation of possessions was legitimate, that it served the public interest (enforcing civil liability for damage caused) and that it was not disproportionate to that goal.
