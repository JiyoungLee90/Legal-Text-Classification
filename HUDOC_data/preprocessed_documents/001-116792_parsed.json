It further notes that, as in the Flisar case, the offences in question were observed by police officers in person, who had then informed the Inspectorate of their findings. The applicant was invited to reply to the charges, which he did. Disputing the allegation that the bar had been operating at the time in question, he requested that he and two employees be heard. In both sets of proceedings complained of by the applicant, the Inspectorate, without taking the proposed evidence or explaining why they had refused to hear it, imposed a fine of EUR 1,200 on the applicant. The applicant challenged those decisions before the local court, which was required to examine the facts and the law in both cases. The applicant disputed the facts on which the imposition of the fine had been founded, requesting again that he and two witnesses be heard, this time before the court. The local court did not hear the evidence requested by the applicant. Like the Inspectorate, it based its judgments on the police\u2019s finding that the applicant\u2019s bar had been operating beyond 2 a.m. and the finding that the applicant had not had permission for extended opening hours. While the Court could accept that the latter point was verifiable on the basis of written evidence or the lack of it, the former point \u2013 that is the question whether the applicant\u2019s bar had actually been open at the time in question \u2013 concerned facts allegedly observed by the police but disputed by the applicant.",

Slovenia (dec.), no. 10390/09, 27\u00a0March 2012). The Court furthermore does not find persuasive the Government\u2019s argument that, in the second set of proceedings, the issue of whether the applicant\u2019s bar was operating in breach of the Rules was of a merely legal nature owing to the applicant\u2019s acknowledgement that a private party had been held there. It notes that the domestic court had given no explanation as to the significance of the applicant\u2019s statement to this effect and that the Government did not refer to any relevant legislation or courts\u2019 established practice indicating that the holding of a private party was, as a matter of principle, considered tantamount to operating the bar.",
