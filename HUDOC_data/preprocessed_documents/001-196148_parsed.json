Sitting as a bench of three judges, none of whom had been involved in the decision of 16 August 2013, it noted that bias complaints that were lodged after a decision to dismiss an appeal on points of law as ill-founded were, in principle, belated and thus inadmissible under Article 26a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. For a bias complaint to be admissible, it had to be lodged prior to the decision dismissing the appeal on points of law as illfounded. This would equally be true where the bias complaint was made in conjunction with an ill-founded motion to be heard. The purpose of Article 356a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which concerned breaches of the right to be heard in a decision on an appeal on points of law, was to provide the Court of Appeal with the opportunity to remedy a breach of a right to be heard by way of another assessment of the merits of the appeal on points of law. Its purpose was not, however, to enforce (Geltung verschaffen) a belated, and thus inadmissible, bias complaint through an impertinent claim that the right to be heard had been breached. However, in the present case, the decision of 16 August 2013 not only concerned the dismissal of the appeal on points of law as ill-founded, but also a bias complaint. In view of these particularities, it was not appropriate to adjudicate the applicant\u2019s subsequent bias complaint in accordance with Article 26a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as that provision was to be interpreted narrowly and was foreseen for exceptions, with its scope in principle limited to purely formal decisions.

The decisive standpoint was that of a reasonable defendant and the ideas that a party to the proceedings, who was mentally sound and in full possession of his reason (ein geistig gesunder, bei voller Vernunft befindlicher Prozessbeteiligter), may have when assessing the circumstances in a serene manner, which could reasonably be expected of him. As a rule, the participation of a judge in earlier decisions was not a ground for objecting to a judge (Ablehnungsgrund), because a reasonable defendant must assume that the judge did not, thereby, determine his position for future decisions. The situation was different where particularities of the prior involvement, such as grossly flawed or even arbitrary (wrong) decisions to the detriment of the person concerned, gave rise to a (well-founded) suspicion of partiality in an individual case.",

This also applied to a judge dealing with appeals on points of law. It was true that the applicant had additionally submitted that the very manner of the prior involvement proved the partiality of the challenged judges. However, specific circumstances which would justify such fear also from the perspective of a reasonable applicant were not apparent. The applicant\u2019s submission was, in substance, limited to complaining that the judges had not followed his line of reasoning and to alleging that the judges had thus \u201crepeatedly and intentionally\u201d breached his right to be heard and that they proceeded in an \u201cobjectively arbitrary\u201d manner.

Through the generally recognised rule of Parliamentary immunity (as a generic concept covering both aspects non-liability and inviolability) the States provide an increased level of protection to speech in Parliament, with the consequence that the need for the Court\u2019s intervention could nonetheless be expected to be rare.

That court found, however, that these parts of the applicant\u2019s speech could not mitigate, conceal or whitewash the qualified Holocaust denial that the applicant had uttered in a small part of the speech.

It clarified that large parts of his speech, in which he had referred to \u201cGerman\u201d victims in the Second World War, did not raise an issue under criminal law, and that he could rely on his right to freedom of expression in so far as he had criticised the remembrance of the victims of National Socialism and used very strong language to that end (see paragraph\u00a012 above). The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s statements concerning the remembrance of the victims of National Socialism were linked to an ongoing debate within Parliament, whereas the statements containing a qualified Holocaust denial, which led to the applicant\u2019s criminal conviction, were not. The latter aspect constitutes an important difference to the case of Kur\u0142owicz v.

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2005XIII K). To that end Article 6 requires a tribunal to be impartial (ibid.). Impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias, and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 must be determined according to a subjective test whereby regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is whether the judge in question held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality. In the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues the Court has focused on the objective test, which requires a determination of whether, quite apart from the judge\u2019s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other protagonists in the proceedings. It must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal. In this connection, even appearances may have a certain importance, or, in other words, \u201cjustice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done\u201d (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1 v.

As summarised in paragraph 55 of the judgment, the essence of the objective test is to ascertain whether the tribunal, including its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality. The major focus of the objective test is the existence of hierarchical or other links between the judge and other protagonists in the proceedings. It seeks to establish, in each individual case, whether the impugned relationship is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the competent judge or court. The Court has constantly reiterated that even appearances may have a certain importance, or, in other words, \u201cjustice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done\u201d. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public; therefore, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1 v.

The point of reference in the application of the objective test is whether the conduct of a judge may prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of an external observer (see, for example, Kyprianou v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2005-XIII).",

We would like to point out that the approach in the case of Dorozhko and Pozharskiy v. Estonia (nos. 14659/04 and 16855/04, 24 April 2008) is conceptually of relevance also to the present case (see, by contrast, paragraph 58 of the present judgment). It is true that in Dorozhko and Pozharskiy the objectively justified doubts arose from the fact that a trial judge was married to a party to the case \u2013 the head of the prosecution team. The underlying concern, however, is the same. Namely, a fear of a lack of impartiality arising from the intimately close relationship between spouses who take substantive decisions in the same case. It is of no relevance, for us, whether the spouses find themselves as different parties to the same case or as judges at different levels of the judicial review. What is at stake here is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the general public.",

The Schwerin Regional Court, sitting as a bench of three judges, reviewed the case as to the facts and the law and upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction and sentence for the same offences. While his appeal was pending before the Rostock Court of Appeal, the applicant submitted his complaint of bias against judge X, the husband of judge Y who had convicted him in the first instance. The Rostock Court of Appeal, sitting as a bench with judge X as Judge Rapporteur and two other judges, dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint of bias against judge X as having no merit and simultaneously dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law as ill-founded.",

It is our view that, at this stage, it was not merely that the domestic proceedings \u201cdid not help dissipate what doubts there may have been\u201d (see paragraph 63 of the judgment). By its outright denial of any legitimacy of the fear of bias because of the close family links between judges Y and X, and by allowing judge X to decide on the complaint of bias against himself, the Rostock Court of Appeal in fact reinforced the fear of bias rather than remedying it.",

It is at this point of its analysis that we part ways with the majority. As the judgment rightly points out in paragraph 65, a lack of impartiality can be remedied by a fresh examination of the case by a higher court whose impartiality cannot be called into question. This, however, did not happen in the present case, as the subsequent review by a different panel of the Rostock Court of Appeal did not carry out a fresh examination of the case against the applicant, but merely reviewed the bias complaint against the three judges of the same court.",

He also submitted a bias complaint against all three judges of the Rostock Court of Appeal. The same Rostock Court of Appeal sitting as a bench with three different judges took up the bias complaint against their three colleagues and dismissed it as illfounded. They mainly reasoned that the grounds justifying the objection were not present and that the prior involvement of a judge with the case in itself did not justify objecting to a judge\u2019s participation (see paragraphs\u00a02425 of the judgment).",
