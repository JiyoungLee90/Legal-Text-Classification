In \u0100damsons the Court has underlined that if a State is to adopt lustration measures, they must fulfil certain conditions in order to be compatible with the Convention. Firstly, the lustration law should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects, such conditions being inherent in the expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d within the meaning of the Convention. Secondly, lustration should not exclusively serve the purpose of retribution or revenge, as the punishment of offenders should be limited to the criminal law sphere. Thirdly, if domestic law allows restrictions on the rights guaranteed under the Convention, it must be precise enough to allow for the individualisation of the responsibility of each person affected thereby and contain adequate procedural safeguards. Finally, the national authorities should keep in mind that lustration measures are by their nature temporary and\u00a0that the\u00a0objective need to restrict individual rights\u00a0as a result of such proceedings diminishes\u00a0over time (see \u0100damsons, cited above, \u00a7 116).

This is because lustration proceedings are, by their very nature, oriented towards the establishment of facts dating back to the communist era and are not directly linked to the current functions and operations of the security services. Lustration proceedings inevitably depend on the examination of documents relating to the operations of the former communist security agencies. If the party to whom the classified materials relate is denied access to all or most of the materials in question, his or her possibilities of contradicting the security agency\u2019s version of the facts will be severely curtailed. Those considerations remain relevant to the instant case despite some differences with the lustration proceedings in  (see, Matyjek, \u00a7\u00a056; Luboch, \u00a7 61; Rasmussen, \u00a7 43; G\u00f3rny, \u00a7 33, all cited above).",
