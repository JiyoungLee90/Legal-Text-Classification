In his statements, he submitted that AIDS was a disease which could be detected with certainty by a special test but that, because it was very expensive, it was not employed. Bearing in mind that it was possible to detect HIV with sufficient certainty and that the K\u0131z\u0131lay did not employ the test in question, because it was costly, then it should be held responsible for the infection of [the child]. The K\u0131z\u0131lay has to bear the consequences of this [negligence]. It cannot escape this [responsibility]. Either it has to employ the test which determines with certainty AIDS, or it fails to do the test and assumes responsibility for providing blood which was infected with AIDS.",

He caught AIDS, which is, together with cancer, one of the most dangerous diseases of our age. It is unnecessary to explain how evil and fatal this disease is. It is highly unlikely that little Yi\u011fit will survive this disease; most probably he will lose his life. Even if he survives, he will live with this disease throughout his lifetime and everybody will avoid him. Strictly speaking, by having been infected with this disease, Yi\u011fit has become a social outcast. He should not have sexual intercourse and should not get married during his lifetime. It is impossible for a living person to endure this. Furthermore, Yi\u011fit should be taken care of very well. It is impossible to put into words how father Nazif Oyal and mother Ne\u015fe Oyal suffer from sorrow because of Yi\u011fit's infection with this disease. In view of the foregoing, the court considers that the award of TRL 10,000,000,000 for each plaintiff in respect of non-pecuniary damages appears to be low. In fact, the sorrow and pain suffered by the plaintiffs cannot be compensated even if quadrillions were awarded. As noted above, the amount of compensation awarded is an insignificant one and merely aims at lessening their pain to some extent. Having regard to the fact that today compensation of three to five billion Turkish liras is awarded in a defamation case and that the amount in question would not even suffice to buy a car by the current prices of the day, it is obvious that the increase of awards is inevitable. It is considered that today is the time to increase compensation to a satisfactory level. For this reason, the determination of the amount in this case, albeit insignificant, was in line with this view.",

However, it appeared that the blood obtained and used [in the present case] was unclean and so malignant that there was no possibility of purifying it. The fact that the [donor] was the bearer of the known virus cannot absolve the defendant from liability. The defendant should have subjected such an important and vital substance to all necessary tests and screening using the necessary technology in accordance with the purpose of its use and the importance of that substance. Nevertheless it appears that the blood in question was not subjected to the requisite tests available in today's technology. Furthermore, bearing in mind the particular circumstances of the case, witness statements have no bearing on the establishment of the lack of fault on the part of the defendant. In other words, it cannot be concluded by witness statements that the defendant was not at fault. In the instant case, it was not alleged that the defendant acted deliberately. Nor was it implied. The defendant did not wish such an outcome in the present case. However, the defendant did not display due attention and diligence in order to avoid the impugned result.",

However, if the infringement of the right to life or to personal integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article\u00a02 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence, the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (see Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, \u00a7 51; Lazarini and Giacci v.  (dec.), no. 53749/00, 7 November 2002; Vo v.

Both institutions had therefore been held liable for the damage caused to the applicants (see paragraphs 21, 22 and 31 above). Furthermore, the Ankara Civil Court of First Instance established that the HIV infected blood given to the first applicant had not been detected by the health personnel because they had not done the requisite test on the blood in question, considering that it would be too costly. The court found moreover that, prior to the impugned incident, there was no regulation requiring blood donors to give information about their sexual history which could help determine their eligibility to give blood. On account of these deficiencies, and the defendants' failure to comply with the already existing regulations, the civil and administrative courts awarded the applicants TRL 54,930,703,000 and 159,369.49\u00a0New Turkish Liras, respectively, to cover non-pecuniary damages and the statutory interest applied to those sums.",

The relevant Questions (3. and 4.) communicated to the Government concerned the promptness of the procedure. In the domestic proceedings the applicants asked for non-pecuniary damages and this is what they were awarded (without adequate promptness.) A remedy was provided in the domestic system as requested, and it must be held to be an adequate one, as the judgment has nothing to say in this regard. For the Court, the substantive violation of Article 2 consists in the fact that the material damage resulting from lack of treatment was not compensated, and in this regard the Court finds that a specific amount of material damage was caused, to be compensated by EUR 300,000.",

But to request a court order in the actual proceedings for the provision of lifelong treatment would not have caused additional delay. Even if one were to accept that it would have done, the applicants had ample opportunity to initiate separate proceedings, at least after 1999 when the responsibility of K\u0131z\u0131lay had been definitively established, and after June 2007, with regard to the Ministry of Health. As to the new development, namely, that the child was deprived of free medical treatment, they could have appealed against the revocation of the Green Card, or have initiated proceedings against the two defendants for provision of the treatment or payment of the cost thereof. They claimed that K\u0131z\u0131lay had promised it, which is again an allegation, and if it was a legally binding promise they could have asked for enforcement or execution. Although State liability had been clearly established, the specific remedy (of treatment) was never asked for, nor judicially recognized. Instead of making use of the available legal remedies, the applicants brought the treatment claim directly to the Court in the guise of a just-satisfaction claim.",
