Even though T. is capable of interaction with the children, also he finds it difficult to respond to the needs of the children\u2019s emotional life. K. is also incapable of creating an emotional relationship with the children. At an earlier stage, Dr J.H., a psychologist at the local health care centre, has reached the same conclusion in her statement given during the custody proceedings concerning K.\u2019s oldest child. In his expert statement Dr E.V., a child and youth psychiatrist, reached a similar conclusion. Already in the spring of 1992 Dr J.H. realised that K.\u2019s problem is related to the diminishment of the boundaries between her and her children. She stated that K. melts herself and her children into one entirety without being able to see the single and individual nature of the children. According to J.H., K. is also unable to take into account the children\u2019s needs in accordance with their age. Dr E.V. finds that the children do not seem to be independent objects to K. but that she sees them as so-called \u201cself-objects\u201d. She finds it difficult to realise that children are love- and care-needing individual human beings. Instead, she sees as if they were meant for her own use only.\u201d",

The authorities never gave the applicants a chance to work out their problems with the help of their relatives and by taking advantage of various support measures provided by the social and health care authorities. Such arrangements would, for instance, have enabled the children to stay with their relatives and the authorities could have avoided resorting to a public care order immediately. Instead, J. was placed in public care without having been given an opportunity to bond with the applicants and obtain her mother\u2019s milk and without entrusting to T. the responsibility for her care. The care order issued in respect of M. allegedly caused him serious mental trauma and unnecessary suffering. The Social Welfare Board and the courts failed to carry out a proper examination of the applicants\u2019 request for a reunification of their family. The access restrictions were excessive, thereby distancing J. and M. both from their parents and other relatives. The County Administrative Court\u2019s decision to uphold the access restriction issued on 17\u00a0May\u00a01994 was principally based on an opinion submitted by an expert approached by the Social Welfare Board, Dr E.V., who had not interviewed the applicants. Most recently, the care orders were upheld on account of K.\u2019s unstable state of health around the time when she gave birth to her fourth child in April 1995. In effect her state of health deteriorated because the social welfare officials had given her to understand that this baby might also be placed in public care.

However, consideration of what is in the best interest of the child is in every case of crucial importance. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned (see the Olsson v.

It follows from these considerations that the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself to the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities for the regulation of the public care of children and the rights of parents whose children have been taken into care, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see, for instance, the Hokkanen v.

As can be seen from the reasons of the decision, the very aim of taking into care was to protect the child, the mother being seriously mentally ill.

It is obvious that even in hospital conditions, it is not possible for the staff to supervise the patients all the time.

However, M. was already in a safe environment at the children\u2019s home, where he could be protected, and J. was at the hospital where she could be protected as well.

Thus she seems to have been in a relatively good mental condition at that moment. Moreover, the mother\u2019s psychotic behaviour only hours after having found out that she had been deprived of her new-born baby cannot serve as a reason supporting a decision already made. Nor can a possible threat of such behaviour, in the case of a forthcoming care order, justify such a decision.

The authorities seem to have firmly proceeded from a presumption of the need for long-lasting care and placement in a foster home. While this is not to suggest any bad faith on their part, the reunification of the family may by now have become very difficult, if not impossible. This development has no doubt been furthered by the restrictions on the applicants\u2019 right to visit the children. Since May\u00a01994 that right has been limited to one visit per month, sometimes by decisions which more reflect an intention to strengthen the ties between the children and the foster family than to reunite the family (see \u00a7\u00a071 above).",

The restrictions applied immediately after J. was born, which are very aptly described by the Court as \u201cnot conducive to facilitating a normal bond with the mother and the child\u201d (\u00a7 159), can thus be regarded as one sign of the firm attitude of the authorities against the reunification of the family.
