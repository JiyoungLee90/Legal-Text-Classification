When a medical doctor writes a report after examining a person who has alleged ill-treatment, it is important that the doctor states the degree of consistency with the story of ill-treatment. A conclusion indicating the degree of support for the alleged description of ill-treatment should be based on a discussion of different possible diagnoses (injuries not relating to ill-treatment, including self-inflicted injuries and diseases) \n(see Barabanshchikov v.
