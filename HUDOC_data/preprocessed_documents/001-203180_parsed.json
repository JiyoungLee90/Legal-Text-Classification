States frequently adopted anti-extremism laws that were so broad as to give authorities excessive discretion to restrict online expression, contrary to the lawfulness requirement. Such legislation prioritised restrictions on, rather than protection of, free expression as the primary State responsibility, and failed to define precisely limitations on online expression and justifications for those limitations.

The blocking of information about virtual private networks (VPN) and similar technologies could never be justified because such technologies were content-neutral and blocking interfered with access to all content which might be obtained using those technologies. Accordingly, the blocking of such technologies was inherently incapable of being defined by reference to categories of legitimately proscribed content. Even where blocking was permissible, the law should provide for the following minimum standards: (i) blocking should be ordered by a court or an independent adjudicatory body; (ii) interested parties should be given the opportunity to intervene in proceedings in which a blocking order was sought; (iii) all victims of blocking orders should have the right to challenge, after the fact, the blocking order; and (iv) anyone attempting to access the blocked website should be able to see the legal basis and reasons for the blocking order and information about avenues of appeal.",

The blocking measure was not actually implemented, since the applicant had removed the offending content upon receiving Roskomnadzor\u2019s request to that effect. The Court notes that the applicant was confronted with a choice between removing the allegedly illegal content and having access to his entire website blocked. The court\u2019s decision that the content of one of his webpages was illegal caused the applicant to take it down in order to avoid the blocking measure and also prevented visitors to the website from accessing that content. It amounted therefore to \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d with the right to receive and impart information, since Article 10 guarantees not only the right to impart information but also the right of the public to receive it (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 55, and Cengiz and Others v.

In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention, and indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v.

Unlike the first part of that subsection, which defined seven particular categories of online content susceptible to blocking, or the third part, which referred expressly to libellous content, the second part allowed websites to be blocked on the basis of a \u201cjudicial decision which identified particular Internet content as constituting information the dissemination of which should be prohibited in Russia\u201d.

It does not give the courts or website owners any indication as to the nature or categories of online content that is susceptible to be banned.

The Court finds that such a vague and overly broad legal provision fails to satisfy the foreseeability requirement.

None of these legitimate uses were considered by the Russian court before issuing the blocking order.",

They are a means of storing and accessing content and cannot be equated with content itself, whatever its legal status happens to be. Just as a printing press can be used to print anything from a school textbook to an extremist pamphlet, the Internet preserves and makes available a wealth of information, some portions of which may be proscribed for a variety of reasons particular to specific jurisdictions. Suppressing information about the technologies for accessing information online on the grounds they may incidentally facilitate access to extremist material is no different from seeking to restrict access to printers and photocopiers because they can be used for reproducing such material. The blocking of information about such technologies interferes with access to all content which might be accessed using those technologies. In the absence of a specific legal basis in domestic law, the Court finds that such a sweeping measure was arbitrary.",

In the light of its examination of the Russian legislation as applied in the instant case, the Court concludes that the interference resulted from the application of the procedure under subsection (5)(2) of section 15.1 of the Information Act which did not satisfy the foreseeability requirement under the Convention and did not afford the applicant the degree of protection from abuse to which he was entitled by the rule of law in a democratic society. Accordingly, the interference was not \u201cprescribed by law\u201d and it is not necessary to examine whether the other requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10 have been met.",
