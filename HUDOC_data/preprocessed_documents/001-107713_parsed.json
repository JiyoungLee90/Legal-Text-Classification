In respect of the applicant, it found that she was a bona fide buyer, within the meaning of Article 302 of the Civil Code. However, it found that the flat, having been fraudulently privatised, had left the possession of the City of , its lawful owner, without that body having the intention to divest itself of it. Thus, by application of Article 302 of the Civil Code and  ruling 6-P of 21 April 2003, the case fell under one of the two exceptions to the protection of a bona fide buyer\u2019s title, which required that precedence be given to the previous owner. The applicant\u2019s title to the flat was accordingly revoked and the City of  declared the flat\u2019s lawful owner. The court ordered the applicant\u2019s eviction without compensation or an offer of alternative housing. The applicant appealed.",

He considered the revocation of her ownership of the flat unlawful and unjustified. First, he argued that the rule contained in Article\u00a0302 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code ordering reinstatement of ownership of the property which was removed from its owner\u2019s possession without the owner\u2019s intention to divest itself of it was inapplicable in her case. He pointed out that the Moscow Housing Department was a party to the transaction in which the flat had been privatised and could not be unaware of it; the Department had never claimed that the official in charge of the privatisation had gone beyond her authority or acted contrary to instructions. Hence it could not be said that the flat had been privatised without the Department having that intention. Therefore, the applicant, as a bona fide buyer, should not have been required to return the flat to its earlier owner, the City of . Secondly, the Deputy Prosecutor General considered that the judicial decisions had not balanced the interests of the municipality against the lawful rights and interests of the applicant, whereas the protection of individual citizens should have taken priority, in accordance with the Constitution. As a result of a third-party fraud, a single mother and her child faced eviction without compensation and without an offer of alternative housing. He noted that she had no other housing and that all her savings had been put into the purchase of the flat and the costly litigation. Finally, he pointed out that the courts had exceeded their responsibility in applying Article 302 of the Civil Code, in lieu of Article\u00a0167 on which the plaintiff had relied, and had thereby granted the award beyond the scope of the claim.",

In his view, the incidents of fraudulent privatisation should not have been treated by courts as cases where property was removed from possession \u201cwithout the owner\u2019s intention to divest\u201d within the meaning of Article 302 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code. He pointed out that privatisations were transactions entered into by the State, represented by its public officials, whose duty was to make all the necessary checks and to ensure the procedural integrity of the transaction. The responsibility of the State was thus engaged wherever they failed in this task. In any event, failure to identify documents as forged could not in such circumstances be classified as passage of title without the owner\u2019s intention to divest. He referred to the applicant\u2019s case as one flagrant example of a wrong and unjust outcome of the erroneous interpretation adopted by  courts in such cases. On the same day he sent letters to the Moscow Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the head of the Moscow Department of the Interior, citing the applicant\u2019s case, calling for the thorough investigation of fraud cases of this type, and requesting that the applicant\u2019s victim status be reassessed in the relevant criminal proceedings.",

With so many regulatory authorities having granted clearance to Ye.\u2019s title it was not for the applicant, or any other third-party buyer of the flat, to assume the risk of ownership being revoked on account of defects which should have been eliminated in procedures specially designed to do so.

In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Gashi, cited above, \u00a7 40, and, mutatis mutandis, Radchikov v.

The Government essentially suggest that the applicant pass her excessive individual burden on to another bona fide individual buyer, and it is hard for the Court to see how that would improve the balance between the public interest and the need to protect individuals\u2019 rights.

In making this finding the Court has stressed the central importance of the right to home in the Convention hierarchy of rights (see paragraph 93 above), and has taken into account the applicant\u2019s attachment to this particular flat (see paragraph 95 above). It considers that there is a clear link between the violations found and the damage caused to the applicant.",

Belgium (Article\u00a050), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case, and in particular having noted the absence of a competing third-party interest or other obstacle to the restitution of the applicant\u2019s ownership, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore the applicant\u2019s title to the flat and to reverse the order for her eviction. Thus, the applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which she would have been had there not been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",

While the Court upholds the Government\u2019s argument that as the applicant\u2019s son is not a party to these proceedings no award may be made in his name, it considers that the applicant\u2019s status as the single parent of a minor is a relevant factor, aggravating her anxiety and fear of eviction. The resulting non-pecuniary damage would not be adequately compensated for by the mere finding of a violation.

The Court therefore finds that the part of the claims related to the service agreement on behalf of the applicant\u2019s son, which amounted to EUR 5,000 of her claims for costs and expenses, must be rejected.
