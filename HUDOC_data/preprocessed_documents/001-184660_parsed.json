On the basis of the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, the City Court characterised the murder as one committed by an organised group for a fee in connection with the victim\u2019s performance of her professional and civic duties. It also found that L.A.G., R.M. and D.M. were guilty of illegal arms operations. It refused to terminate the proceedings against R.M. regarding the events of 1996 under the statute of limitations, because the latter had been wanted in connection with those events since 1997, and found him guilty of kidnapping and extortion. The City Court sentenced L.A.G. \u2013 regarded as the organiser of the killing \u2013 and R.M. \u2013 regarded as the hitman \u2013 to life imprisonment. D.M. and I.M. were sentenced to fourteen and twelve years\u2019 imprisonment respectively. S.Kh. was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.

The essential purpose of an investigation is to \u201csecure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life\u201d and ensure the accountability of those responsible. In order to be effective, an investigation must firstly be adequate, that is, capable of leading to the establishment of the facts and, where appropriate, the identification and punishment of those responsible. The obligation to conduct an effective investigation is an obligation not of result but of means (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey ([GC], no.\u00a024014/05, \u00a7\u00a7 172-73, 14 April 2015). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the circumstances of the case or the person responsible will risk falling foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see Armani Da Silva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0233). In particular, the investigation\u2019s conclusions must be based on thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements. Failing to follow an obvious line of inquiry undermines to a decisive extent the investigation\u2019s ability to establish the circumstances of the case and the identity of those responsible. The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of the investigation\u2019s effectiveness depend on the circumstances of the particular case and must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (ibid., \u00a7 234). Where the official investigation has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law. It should in no way be inferred from the foregoing that Article 2 may entail the right for an applicant to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence. On the other hand, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow life-endangering offences to go unpunished (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, ECHR 2004XII).",

This person to whom the Government referred in the affirmative terms as \u201cthe organiser of the murder\u201d died in 2013 (see paragraph 45 above).

We understand that it must be frustrating for the applicants that those behind the killing have not been identified. However, we are not convinced that this in itself would suffice to conclude that the investigation into Anna Politkovskaya\u2019s killing did not meet the Convention standard. The fact that the investigation did not succeed in identifying those who commissioned the killing does not necessarily mean that it was ineffective (see, mutatis mutandis, Trivkanovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a012986/13, \u00a7 79, 6\u00a0July 2017). In our opinion there were no concrete pieces of evidence in the present case that could have led the investigation in the direction of any person in particular, nor were there any identifiable potential witnesses who, if interviewed, could have shed light on the identities of those who had commissioned the killing (see, by contrast, Enukidze and Girgvliani v. Georgia, no. 25091/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0254 and\u00a0261, 26\u00a0April 2011).",

A prosecution, particularly the prosecution of such a serious charge as involvement in a killing, should never be embarked upon lightly. Given the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, it can never be assumed that a particular person is so tainted with suspicion that the standard of evidence to be applied is an irrelevance. Speculation is a dangerous basis on which to base any steps that can potentially devastate a person\u2019s life (see, mutatis mutandis, Borojevi\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a070273/11, \u00a7 58, 4 April 2017).",

Initial investigative measures, such as the inspection of the scene of the incident and the collection of material evidence from it, as well as the collection of surveillance footage from the cameras in the vicinity, were taken without delay. Therefore we can accept that the authorities took sufficient measures to collect and secure evidence relating to the killing. As for the duration of the investigation in the present case, the period of almost ten years for an investigation and two subsequent sets of judicial proceedings over two levels of jurisdiction may be excessive according to the Court\u2019s standards under Article 6 of the Convention. However, the purpose of the Court\u2019s analysis under Article 2 is different. The requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition under Article 2 should not be examined in isolation and irrespective of the other parameters the combination of which makes an investigation effective (see, mutatis mutandis, SarbyanovaPashaliyska and Pashaliyska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041, and Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 24014/05, \u00a7 225, 14 April 2015).
