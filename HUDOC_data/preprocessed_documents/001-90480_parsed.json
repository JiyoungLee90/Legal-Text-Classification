The object of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any  (Article 1, sub-paragraph (a)). The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention (Article 3, sub-paragraph (a)). 'Rights of custody' include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child's place of residence (Article 5 (a)). In the present case it is not in dispute that the child's removal to  was wrongful, since the father retained, jointly with the respondent, the right of 'guardianship', which under Israeli law includes the right to decide on the child's residence. Moreover, since the request for return was presented within a period of one year after the removal, the respondent cannot deny either that, in principle, pursuant to Article 12 of the Hague Convention, the child's prompt return should be ordered. The only matter in dispute is therefore the question whether an exception to that return may be applied under Article 13, first paragraph, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention.",

The father, for his part, lived in a religious community where he was fed, and from his activity as a sports and art teacher he had a monthly income of only 300 [Swiss] francs. The custody of the child had been withdrawn from him on account of the atmosphere of fear that he had created at the family home. For the same reason, the Israeli courts ordered him to live separately and prohibited him from approaching the mother's flat. Before the child's removal to  he had only had a restricted right of visitation, limited to two hours twice a week, under the supervision of the Israeli social services. Concerning the conditions of a possible return of the child without his mother, according to the information provided by the Israeli Ministry of Justice on 12 March 2007, the father, who now shares a flat with one other tenant and still works in an institution for religious education, would be prepared to take care of the child. Taking into account the laconic and not very reassuring nature of this information, together with the expert's report by Dr [...], a psychiatrist, the  considered that a return to  involved a risk of psychological harm for the child and might place him in an intolerable situation, whether or not he was accompanied by his mother. The court added that, in view of the father's low income, the return to  of the respondent would also undermine the child's economic stability and the mother would have to find a job in order to provide for them both.",

He is of the opinion, however, that such a risk would not exist if the child's mother accompanied him to , as could be reasonably expected of her. As regards that latter hypothesis, the judgment of the  fails to adduce any evidence of such a grave risk of harm, or of any intolerable situation for the child. The expert psychiatrist failed, in particular, to address that question, simply explaining that the risk could not be assessed without ascertaining the conditions of a possible return. As to the appellant's aggressive behaviour towards the respondent, it does not appear from the 's judgment that the child would be threatened directly or indirectly as a result of witnessing such violence against his mother. She stated that the father had complied with the arrangements for his right of visitation and that the visits had gone well. The social worker appointed to supervise the right of visitation had described as marvellous the father-son relationship as established just before the child's abduction by his mother. She has not claimed that the appellant breached the judicial instructions which required him not to approach her flat or to disturb and/or harass her. As to the considerations relating to the father's low income and his ties with the religious community 'Lubavitch', as they stand they do not indicate a grave risk that the child would be exposed to harm within the meaning of Article 13, first paragraph, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention. Whilst such considerations may help to determine which of the two parents offers the best educational capacities for the purpose of deciding on the attribution of the right of custody \u2013 a matter that is decided by the judicial authorities of the place of habitual residence (Article 16 of the Hague Convention) \u2013 they are not pertinent, however, for a decision about the return of a child after a wrongful abduction (see recital 4.1 above).",

The Cantonal judges quoted the expert psychiatrist who had referred to the 'judicial risks' that would be incurred in the event of a return to , without any indication as to whether the respondent actually faced a prison sentence as a result of the abduction. Supposing that such a risk were proven, she could not be expected to return to Israel with the child \u2013 and that would accordingly rule out the return of [the child] in view of the major psychological harm that would be caused to him by the separation from his mother. She made no comment on that question in her reply to the Federal Court; in particular, she has not claimed that immediate imprisonment, or even any criminal sanction at all, would be imposed on her. Neither has she argued that in the event of her return to Israel it would be impossible or very difficult for her to integrate, or, in particular, to find a new job. Consequently, it cannot be said that the mother's return, and therefore that of the child, would be unbearable for economic reasons either. Therefore, as the respondent has failed to establish the existence of reasons that would objectively justify a refusal on her part to return to , it must be accepted that she could reasonably be expected to return to that State of origin accompanied by the child. In these circumstances, it is of no import that the information provided by the Israeli Central Authority (see recital 4.2 above) on which the Cantonal Court based, in particular, its justification of the exception to the child's return as provided for by Article 13, first paragraph, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention, was deemed not very reassuring, because that information was based only on the hypothesis of the child's return without his mother.",

If the said parent is not able to do so because, for example, he or she faces a prison sentence that would lead to separation from the child or because the parent has very close family ties in Switzerland (for example following remarriage or on account of a situation of hardship suffered by another family member living in Switzerland), the child's psychological and physical stability may be at stake, because the child would, after the return, be obliged to live apart from his or her parents.

It is not sufficient for the parent who wrongfully removed or retained the child to state that he or she refuses to return to that State. He or she would also have to be in a situation of hardship such that he or she could not reasonably be expected to return to his or her place of prior residence to await there, with the child, the court's final decision on the attribution of custody. In that context, we have in mind especially those cases in which the mother cannot be guaranteed safe or affordable accommodation outside the home of his or her former partner. One must further take into account those cases in which the parent who has requested the return of the child will not resume the exercise of the right of custody and will not obtain it by court order, whilst the abducting parent is clearly the child's primary carer. In such a case the child would only be taken to the State of origin to await the final attribution of the right of custody to the abducting parent, before coming back to  again with that parent. Such coming and going would ultimately only have served the purpose of bringing the case before the authorities of the former State of residence. Such a solution would be inadmissible according to the spirit and purpose of the Hague Convention, because it would be incompatible with the child's interest. But the situation would have to be beyond doubt for the Swiss court dealing with the request for return. Unless the circumstances can be established clearly, the court will have to rule that the return to the parent's State of origin is bearable and that, accordingly, the child will not be placed in an intolerable situation such as to justify a decision denying the return under Article 13, first paragraph, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention.",

However, such a solution should only be sought, with the resulting possibility for the competent Swiss court to order the child's return, if placement with a third party is not manifestly contrary to the child's interest. That third condition can be satisfied only if separation from the parent remaining in  is bearable for the child \u2013 which may be the case where he or she has an antagonistic relationship with that parent \u2013 and if the foster family receiving the child can provide proper guarantees as to the protection and normal upbringing of the child.

Thus, the parties, and in particular the parents, have a duty to participate in the establishment of the facts. The hearing of the parties in person by the court (section 9(1) and (2)) is therefore of great importance. The new provisions concerning the procedure and the cooperation with the competent authorities of the State of origin also play an essential role. The court must be able to verify whether, and in what manner, it is possible to ensure the child's return (section 10(2)). If it does not succeed in that task, or succeeds only partially, it will not be in a position to weigh up all the consequences that a return might have for the child. The same will be true if it does not succeed in obtaining from the local authorities any reliable assurances as to the conditions of the child's reception and protection, in particular when there is some doubt about the requesting parent's capacity to look after the child properly.

They claimed that, if he were to be separated from his mother as a result of her imprisonment, Noam would certainly not be entrusted to his father in view of the decisions previously given against him, unless they were overturned, and that would be equally as harmful for the child. In their view, Noam would thus probably be placed in care, which the mother refused categorically. The applicants' fears were strengthened by the fact that in their view they had not received any reliable assurance to the effect that the first applicant would definitely not face criminal sanctions or separation from her child, of whom she had custody, if she returned with him to Israel, neither on the part of the Israeli authorities nor in the letter produced by the Swiss Government in support of their observations of 15\u00a0February 2008.

The applicants argued that this Act ensured that the child's interest was paramount (section 5) and imposed measures of protection and representation for the child's benefit (section 6). They considered it appropriate and pertinent for the present case to quote a few passages from the Federal Council's dispatch concerning the Federal Decree of 21\u00a0December 2007 which dealt more specifically with the return of an abducted child. The Federal Council stated as follows: \u201cWhere the child's accommodation by the parent who requested the return is manifestly not to be taken into consideration, the problem of his or her return to the State of origin will be addressed differently, depending on whether the person who wrongfully removed or retained the child ... is or is not in a position to return to that State. If the said parent is not able to do so because, for example, he or she faces a prison sentence that would lead to separation from the child ..., the child's psychological and physical stability may be at stake, because the child would, after the return, be obliged to live apart from his or her parents. Such separation is tolerable only in exceptional cases and must constitute an ultima ratio ... The court must be able to verify whether, and in what manner, it is possible to ensure the child's return ... If it does not succeed in that task, or succeeds only partially, it will not be in a position to weigh up all the consequences that a return might have for the child. The same will be true if it does not succeed in obtaining from the local authorities any reliable assurances as to the conditions of the child's reception and protection, in particular when there is some doubt about the requesting parent's capacity to look after the child properly.\u201d (see the Federal Council's dispatch, paragraph 38 above).",

They argued that it was for the authorities of the requested State to decide on the arrangements for the child's possible return, not after deciding on the return but before, as if no such measures were taken by the court which ordered the child's return it could not be asserted that an unprepared return would not expose him to situations entailing psychological harm and would not place him in an intolerable situation within the meaning of Article 13, first paragraph, sub-paragraph (b) of the Hague Convention.",

The applicants pointed out in this connection that the father had not denied that he had joined the ultra-orthodox Jewish movement \u201cLubavitch\u201d, which they described as a mystical and ascetic branch of Orthodox Judaism whose members were Hasidic Jews known for their zealous proselytising. In the applicants' submission, the father had attempted to impose on his wife and child a radical lifestyle that required, for example, women to cover their hair and boys to be sent from the age of three to religious \u201cHeder\u201d schools. Moreover, he could not validly deny the fact that his sudden change of conduct and radical religious demands had caused a major conflict within the couple, leading to their divorce, and had brought him into serious trouble with his country's judicial authorities, which in particular had issued an arrest warrant against him for defaulting on maintenance payments. In view of the foregoing, the first applicant believed that it was her duty to remove her child from that environment, which she regarded as fanatical. She pointed out that no judicial guarantee had been forthcoming before her departure, nor was one envisaged in the event of her return, and that the Federal Court had not addressed this question. She added that she was herself Jewish and that she had no intention of cutting her son off from his roots. Thus, since late 2006, he had been attending a municipal secular day nursery one day a week and a private State-approved Jewish nursery school where he was being taught, in addition to the school curriculum of the Canton of Vaud, the basic principles of Judaism.",

They took the view that neither the draft law nor the related dispatch was pertinent for the settlement of the present dispute and that the Federal Court's judgment had by no means contradicted the principles therein. For whilst the draft law stated, in section 5(b), that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation in the event of return especially where the abducting parent, in the circumstances, would not be able to take care of the child in the State where he or she had been habitually resident at the time of the abduction, or that this could manifestly not be required of that parent, it was still necessary to establish that these conditions were met and there was no evidence of that in the present case. In this connection the Government referred to the following passage from the dispatch: \u201cIt is not sufficient for the parent who wrongfully removed or retained the child to state that he or she refuses to return to [the] State [of origin]. He or she would also have to be in a situation of hardship such that he or she could not reasonably be expected to return to his or her place of prior residence to await there, with the child, the court's final decision on the attribution of custody. In that context, we have in mind especially those cases in which the mother cannot be guaranteed safe and affordable accommodation outside the home of his or her former partner.\u201d (see the Federal Council's dispatch, paragraph 38 above).",

In that case, the domestic authorities, after carrying out an in-depth examination of the facts, had not detected any potential risk for the child. They had also pointed out that, contrary to her allegation, the mother would be able to accompany her child to the State of its habitual residence in order to assert her rights there.

When the case had come before the Guardianship Division (chambre des tutelles), it had ordered an additional act of investigation, namely an expert's report on the second applicant by a child psychiatrist, and it had requested from the Israeli authorities, through the Swiss Central Authority, information on the conditions in which Noam's possible return would take place.",

They were of the opinion that the statements she had made in the course of the domestic proceedings showed that the risk she alleged did not constitute the real reason for her refusal to return to Israel, and that it was simply her personal choice, stemming from her wish to live in . They noted that it was not until later, in her application to the Court of 25 September 2007, that the first applicant had indicated that she would not return to Israel on account of the intolerable situation that had precisely driven her to leave the country in June 2005. The Government also pointed out that the applicants' family situation had been closely monitored by the social services in Tel Aviv and by the Tel Aviv Family Court, which had in particular prohibited Noam's father from approaching the first applicant's flat or the child's nursery school, from disturbing or harassing the first applicant in any manner, including mentally, and in any place, from using the flat where she lived and from carrying or possessing a weapon (see the judgment of the Guardianship Division dated 22 May 2007, pp. 5 et seq.). It was not in dispute that Noam's father had complied with those measures (see the record of the hearing of 29 August 2006 before the Justice of the Peace, p. 2). In addition, the attitude of the Israeli authorities had shown a real concern for the applicants' safety and well-being (see in particular the letter of 10 January 2005 from two social workers, reproduced in the judgment of the Guardianship Division, p. 4), and there was thus no reason to fear that they would not react in an appropriate manner in the event of the applicants' return to Israel if the child's father attempted to bother them.",

The Government presumed that, having lived for six years in Israel, the first applicant must have built up a circle of acquaintances, especially as the expert's report by Dr.\u00a0B. mentioned that she had decided to settle in that country after staying with family there during the holidays, which seemed to prove that she had family ties in Israel.",

According to those guidelines, criminal proceedings were to be commenced only in very exceptional cases. The Central Authority had added that in the present case it would consider instructing the Israeli police to close the criminal file provided that the first applicant was willing to cooperate with the Israeli authorities, complied with the father's visitation rights and did not disappear again with the child (see the letter of 30\u00a0April\u00a02007 appended to the Government's observations). Based on those indications, the Government submitted that the first applicant would not face criminal sanctions and that, contrary to her allegation, the risk of being imprisoned remained unproven. Thus, having regard to the assurances given by the Israeli authorities, there was no cause to fear that in the event of the applicants' return the mother would be imprisoned and therefore separated from her son, because such imprisonment would be at odds with the attitude of the Israeli authorities, who on a number of occasions had shown understanding towards her and concern for the protection of Noam's interests.",

In the light of the above-mentioned considerations concerning the possibility of the first applicant's return, the Government, observing that Article 13, first paragraph, of the Hague Convention (\u201cif the person ... which opposes its return establishes that ...\u201d) placed the burden of proof on the first applicant, took the view that not only had she failed to establish the existence of a grave risk for the child in the event of his return, but also the Swiss authorities' additional investigative measures and other evidence in the file enabled such a risk to be ruled out to a very high degree of probability.",

The notion of \u201crights of custody\u201d within the meaning of the Hague Convention includes rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child's place of residence (Article 5, sub-paragraph (a)).\u00a0The Court takes the view that in the present case the child's removal to  was wrongful, since, in accordance with the decision of 27\u00a0June\u00a02004, the father exercised \u201cguardianship\u201d jointly with the mother and in the Israeli legal system this included the right to determine the child's place of residence.

On 10 January 2005 the Israeli social services ordered the parents to live apart, in the interest of the child. On 12 January 2005 the competent judge of the Tel Aviv Family Court prohibited the father from entering Noam's nursery school or the first applicant's flat, from disturbing or harassing her in any manner whatsoever and from carrying or possessing a weapon. Restrictions were also imposed on the father's right of access, after which he was only allowed to see his son under the supervision of the social services at a contact centre in Tel Aviv. Lastly, an arrest warrant was issued against him on 20 March 2005 for defaulting on maintenance payments. Moreover, as regards the alleged ineffectiveness of the criminal complaint against him, in respect of which proceedings were discontinued on 30 November 2006, the Court observes that the discontinuance was due to the first applicant's departure. In addition, it appears that Noam's father complied with the measures ordered by the domestic authorities. In conclusion, in view of the authorities' efforts it cannot be said that they were unable or unwilling to protect the applicants against potentially fanatical or aggressive conduct on the part of the father.

The Court agrees with the Government that there is no evidence to suggest that the first applicant would be unable to influence her son's religious education or that the Israeli authorities and courts would be unable to prevent the father from sending him to a religious \u201cHeder\u201d school.",

Lastly, the Court observes that the enforcement of the return was suspended following the request for interim measures dated 27\u00a0September 2007.

Thus, Article 6 affords a procedural safeguard, namely the \u201cright to a court\u201d, in the determination of one's \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 18); whereas not only does the procedural requirement inherent in Article 8 cover administrative and judicial proceedings, but it is ancillary to the wider purpose of ensuring proper respect for, inter alia, family life (see, for example, B. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, \u00a7\u00a7 63-65 and 68, Series A no. 121, and Bianchi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0112).

Lastly, the various decisions granting custody of the child to the mother were confirmed on 10 February 2005 with the parents' divorce, without there being any change in the attribution of guardianship, which thus continued to be exercised by the mother. There is no reason to question the merits of all these decisions, which attest to the existence of a real breakdown in the relationship between father and son. In addition, we learn that the father defaulted on maintenance payments to the first applicant and an arrest warrant was thus issued against him on 20 March 2005 (paragraph 18).

The interpretation by the Federal Court, which incorporated into its reasoning the notion of \u201cguardianship\u201d as provided for by Israeli law, leads to the absurd result of depriving the child's mother of one of the attributes of the right of custody, namely the possibility of living with the child at the place of residence she considers the most appropriate and where she has established her home. The possibility of living together at the chosen place of residence is in fact necessary if the obligation of care in the best interest of the child is to be fulfilled \u201ceffectively\u201d. It is also noteworthy that in the present case the Israeli social services had ordered the parents to live apart in the interest of the child (paragraph 15 of the judgment).",

An arrest warrant had been issued against him for defaulting on maintenance payments (paragraph 18 of the judgment). His right of access had been restricted (paragraph 16 of the judgment). The mother had even obtained a ne exeat order (paragraph 12 of the judgment), fearing that the father might leave the country with Noam to join a religious community abroad.

As Judge Kovler observes in his dissenting opinion, the Lausanne District Court and the Guardianship Division of the Vaud Cantonal Court had correctly considered that the child's return to his father would expose him to psychological and even physical harm (see also paragraphs 28 and 31 of the judgment).",
