Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

Italy [GC], no.\u00a016483/12, \u00a7 288, 15 December 2016).",
