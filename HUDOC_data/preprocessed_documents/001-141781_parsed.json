Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7\u00a0\u00a0118, ECHR 2005XIII). It adds that in this context even appearances may be of some importance. It follows that when deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular body lacks impartiality, the standpoint of those alleging such bias is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether such fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Gautrin and Others v.\u00a0France, 20 May 1998, \u00a7 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III). In this connection, the mere fact that a judge has already taken pre-trial decisions cannot in itself be regarded as justifying doubts as to his or her impartiality (see \u00d6kten v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a022347/07, 3\u00a0November 2011); what matters is the scope of the measures taken by the judge before the trial. Likewise, the fact that the judge has detailed knowledge of the case file does not entail any prejudice on his or her part that would prevent him or her from being regarded as impartial when the decision on the merits is taken. Nor does a preliminary analysis of the available information mean that the final assessment has been prejudged (see, for example, Morel v. France, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2000-VI).",

In a departure from its previous case-law, the Court now establishes an extremely strict new criterion under which the decisive point is not the number or proportion of the judges concerned by a possible lack of objective impartiality but whether or not there is a compelling reason making it absolutely necessary for those judges to be members of the bench with entitlement to vote.",

Furthermore, the majority explain neither the reasons why such a new concept is needed nor what is meant by \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d. While it is easy to imagine cases where the participation of a particular judge might be necessary, we find it difficult to conceive of situations in which this necessity would be absolute. It should be noted here that even our Court would find it difficult to comply with this criterion: where a case is referred to the Grand Chamber, the national judge is also part of the Grand Chamber, even though he or she has already pronounced on the case as a member of the Chamber. It could hardly be contended that his or her participation in the Grand Chamber is absolutely necessary.",

It is therefore unsurprising that all the senior judges who are members of the judicial divisions of the Supreme Administrative Court sit in the General Assembly in order to consolidate even further and more effectively the authority and legitimacy of this high judicial body\u2019s decisions. Moreover, the result of the voting (twenty-two votes to nine) makes it clear that the abstention of the three judges in question or their participation without entitlement to vote would not have altered the outcome of proceedings.",
