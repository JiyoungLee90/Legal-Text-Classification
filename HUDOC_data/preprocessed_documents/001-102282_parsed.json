According to the applicant, he spent an average of about fifteen hours in total per day in the van, convoy room and collection point. On several occasions, in particular on 4, 18 and 19\u00a0December 2003, he was left without food and water for the whole day.",

Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives...

The Court reiterates that in certain cases the lack of personal space afforded to detainees in Russian remand prisons has been found to be so extreme as to justify, in its own right, a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. In several previous cases against Russia where the applicants were held in cells with less than three square metres of personal space the Court found a violation of Article 3 on that account alone (see, for example, Kantyrev v. Russia, no. 37213/02, \u00a7\u00a7 50-51, 21 June 2007; Andrey Frolov v. Russia, no. 205/02, \u00a7\u00a7 47-49, 29 March 2007; Mayzit v.

Even though the period under consideration in the case at hand is shorter than in many of the cases cited above, in the Court's opinion it is still sufficient to conclude that the applicant was subjected to \u201cinhuman and degrading treatment\u201d within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",

It was a small concrete cabin, with roughly painted walls, with a \u201csquat toilet\u201d in one corner and a low platform in another. That platform apparently served as a bed. No other furniture can be seen on the photographs. The flushing system for the toilet consisted of a water tap above it. Apparently, this was the only source of water, so the applicant had to drink and wash himself from that very same tap above the toilet. The platform on which the applicant had to sleep adjoined the toilet area and was separated from it by a low partition, which was only slightly above the level of the platform. The only window was very small and was covered with a dense grille from the inside and thick metal bars from the outside. The only heating appliance consisted of two parallel metal pipes, passing through at the level of the platform. The Court observes that the cells in the Dmitrov detention centre were located in the semi-basement of the building. In such circumstances it is doubtful whether those two pipes were sufficient to give enough heat, especially in winter, unless they were extremely hot. In the latter case it is unclear how the applicant was able to sleep next to those pipes without burning himself. In sum, conditions in the Dmitrov detention centre were very harsh.",

First of all, the Government admitted that on some occasions the prison van used a longer route. Further, it is unclear how many stops the prison van usually made between remand prison no. IZ 77/1 and the final destination. The Court recalls that in the Starokadomskiy case, which concerned the same remand prison and the same period of time, the Government admitted that the applicant had been transported by a route which included other courts and remand centres (ibid., \u00a7 52). Further, the applicant in that case was woken up at 6 a.m. The vans normally left the remand centre between 9 and 10.40 a.m. and returned before 6.30 p.m. (ibid., \u00a7 26). As follows from the Government's submissions in the present case, the applicant was woken up at about the same time and arrived at the courthouse at 10 a.m. (on twenty-four occasions), at 11 a.m. (on fifty-four occasions), or even later. The Court notes that the Government did not produce any logbooks for the transfers. In their absence it is difficult to establish the average duration of the journeys to the courthouse. However, it is clear that, with all the intermediate stops and \u201calternative routes\u201d the average travel time was significantly longer than that indicated by the Government (see also the reply from the Ministry of Justice concerning the delays in transporting the detainees, cited in paragraph 59 above).",

In  detention orders are issued by the firstinstance court at the request of the prosecution and are subject to appeal. It is the \u201cspeediness\u201d of the review of the appeal which is at the heart of the applicant's complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 4. The question whether a person's right to a \u201cspeedy review\u201d of his applications for release has been respected will be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case; in complex cases the examination of an application for release may take more time than in simple ones. In Baranowski v. Poland (no. 28358/95, ECHR 2000-III), it took the domestic courts five months to examine an application for release. In that case the Government showed that the domestic court had commenced the examination of the first application for release as early as the day after it had been submitted and that, subsequently, it had on five occasions adjourned the examination of the relevant applications because evidence had to be taken from three experts. However, despite these arguments, the Court found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4. In Samy v. the Netherlands ((dec.), no. 36499/97, 4 December 2001), concerning the detention of aliens for the purposes of expulsion, the Court found that a period of twenty-five days was compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 4. By contrast, in Rehbock v. Slovenia (no. 29462/95, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2000-XII) the Court found that\u00a0the application for release had been examined twenty-three days after it had been lodged with the first-instance court, and that that was not a \u201cspeedy\u201d examination as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4. A delay of seventeen days has also been declared incompatible with this provision (see Kadem v. Malta, no. 55263/00, \u00a7 43, 9 January 2003). In Lebedev v. Russia (no.\u00a04493/04, \u00a7\u00a7 98 et seq., 25 October 2007) the Court held that delays of forty and sixty-seven days constituted a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 as far as the appeal proceedings were concerned.",

Indeed, the Supreme Court had to analyse various legal arguments submitted by the defence, which concerned the form and substance of the detention order of 1 December 2003. However, that is a normal task of any appellate court in such cases. The decision of the Supreme Court in the case at hand was fully based on the case file, no new evidence being produced by the parties or examined by the court; the decision was not very complicated and did not go beyond the examination of the issue of detention.

In other words, given the purpose of the detention proceedings, and the circumstances in which the courts have to take decisions, the procedural guarantees under Article 5 \u00a7 4 need not be the same as under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, Wassink v. the Netherlands, 27\u00a0September 1990, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 185A).

Norway, 19\u00a0February 1996, \u00a7 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I). Thus, provided that a public hearing has been held at first instance, a less strict standard applies to the appellate level, at which the absence of such a hearing may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue (see, for instance, Helmers v. Sweden, 29 October 1991, \u00a7 36, Series A no.\u00a0212-A; Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 115; and Fredin v.

Apparently, his main concern was the form of the hearing. He considered that his physical absence as such from the courtroom prevented him from presenting his case in an adequate manner and on an equal footing with the opposite party. However, the Court does not share the applicant's view. The Court reiterates that \u201cthe physical presence of an accused in the courtroom is highly desirable, but it is not an end in itself: it rather serves the greater goal of securing the fairness of the proceedings, taken as a whole\u201d (see Golubev v.

The Court observes that it has previously held that confidential communication with one's lawyer is protected by the Convention as an important safeguard of the rights of the defence (see, for instance, Campbell v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 233).",

In that case the Court found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 on account of a number of restrictions imposed on the defence lawyers (perusal of their notes, inability to consult the case file and their own notes on the case except in the court building or in a special department of the prison, requirement to obtain special permits to visit and confer with the applicant, and so on), combined with the applicant's inability to prepare properly for the hearings because of the appalling conditions in which he had been transported to the courthouse and confined there. Further, in a number of cases against Moldova the inability of the defence lawyers to exchange documents with the applicant, as well as the impediments created by the glass partition separating lawyers from their clients in the meeting room, has given rise to a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see, for example, Castravet v. , no. 23393/05, \u00a7\u00a7 37 et seq., 13 March 2007; see also Istratii and Others v.

The Government also denied the existence of any partitions separating the applicant from his lawyers, or any restrictions on the use of notes or on the exchange of documents between the applicant and his lawyers.

In the present case the Court is dealing with a \u201cborderline\u201d situation as the delay of thirty-five days in the examination of the appeal against the detention order could be regarded as not unreasonable.

In this case Article 374 of the CCP provides that the overall length of the examination of the appeal may not exceed one month from the date when the case file is received by the cassation court.
