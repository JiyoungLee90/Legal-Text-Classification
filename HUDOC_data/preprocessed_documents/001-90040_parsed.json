Subsequently, it took the District Court a further seven months to hold its first oral hearing on 27 March 2002. After the applicants\u2019 request of 11 February 2003 to continue the proceedings, the District Court held an oral hearing only some nine months later, on 5 November 2003. \nOn 23 December 2003 the District Court informed the applicants that it could schedule a further hearing only when the Court of Appeal had returned the case files. The Court thus notes that the delays in the proceedings were caused at least to some extent by the proceedings of the first applicant which were simultaneously pending before the District Court and which involved the reciprocal dispatch of the case files. In this connection, the Court has already held that the domestic courts should consider the possibility of having copies made in order to avoid delays caused by the dispatch of the case file (see Gisela M\u00fcller v. Germany,\nno. 69584/01, \u00a7\u00a085, 6 October 2005); the District Court apparently did not do this in the present case.",

Germany, 28782/04, 25 September 2007), and that the domestic authorities are under a duty to exercise exceptional diligence, since there is always the danger that any procedural delay will result in the de facto determination of the issue before the court \n(see H.\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a089-90, and Nanning, cited above, \u00a7 44). Given the specific circumstances and in particular the embittered relationship between the applicants and the child\u2019s mother, the courts were under a particular duty to avoid any unnecessary delays and to adhere to a tight time schedule.
