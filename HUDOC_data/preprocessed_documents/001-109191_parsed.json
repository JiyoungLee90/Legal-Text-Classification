No reference was made to the weight attached, if any, to the report drafted by the Department for Social Services and Child Protection. In any event, this report did not assess the implications of the second applicant\u2019s return to , or whether appropriate arrangements were in place to secure her protection upon return. The Court also notes that the domestic authorities did not take into consideration the expert report drafted in Austria and mentioned in the judgment of 25\u00a0November\u00a02008 (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a012 above). The Court finds that these factors, taken together, cast doubts as to the level of depths of the domestic court\u2019s assessment of the child\u2019s best interests (see \u0160neersone and Kampanella v. Italy, no.\u00a014737/09, \u00a7\u00a095, 12\u00a0July\u00a02011).",
