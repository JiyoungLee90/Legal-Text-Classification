The Working Group had found certain fishing restrictions necessary so as to enable the salmon to reach the northernmost rivers and thereby to safeguard the fish stocks. It had been of the further opinion that in order to be non-discriminatory in character the restrictions should apply equally to fishing in the open sea and to coastal fishing (within village boundaries) within the whole of the areas located between certain latitudes. The Ombudsman noted that the terms of the decree had differed from the opinion of the Working Group, without any convincing reasons having been given therefor. The resultant differential treatment, without any generally acceptable grounds, of certain water owners and fishermen who had contracted leases, was therefore in violation of section 5 of the Constitution.

In the instant case, however, the Court must limit its examination to the direct effect which the 1996 and the 1998 Decrees \u2013 issued on the basis of a law \u2013 had on the applicants' livelihood, that is to say the continued restriction on their fishing in certain State-owned waters allotted to them in their respective leases for the period 1995-99 and from 2000 to date. Considering the terms of those leases \u2013 which were directly related to their occupation as professional fishermen \u2013 as well as the domestic case-law preceding the 1996 and the 1998 Decrees, the Court finds it established that up to the end of 1999 the applicants could arguably claim a \u201ccivil right\u201d to fish for salmon and sea trout in the relevant waters to an extent exceeding the limits set out in the 1996 and the 1998 Decrees (see, for instance, Procola v.

The terms of the 1994 Decree had differed from the opinion of that Working Group, without any convincing reasons having been given therefor. The resultant differential treatment of certain water owners and lease holders without generally acceptable grounds had therefore been in violation of section 5 of the Constitution as in force at the time, which prescribed that everyone was to be equal before the law (see paragraph 15 above).
