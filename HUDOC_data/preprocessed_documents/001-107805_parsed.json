It first noted that, under the relevant provisions of the German-US Agreement, the property rights of Mrs E.F. had been transferred to the FRG. Given that Mrs E.F had been compensated in 1976, the JCC (Jewish Claims Conference), which had also filed a restitution claim, could not claim property rights. The Administrative Court then confirmed that the FRG had not filed a valid restitution claim before the time-limit of 31 December 1992 as provided for by section 30a(1), first sentence, of the Property Act. The law on the Agreement of 21 December 1992 had not provided for any specific provisions in that connection and the letter of 1 October 1992 from the Federal Office for the Resolution of Outstanding Property Issues (Bundesamt f\u00fcr die Regelung offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen \u2013 \u201cthe Federal Office\u201d) to the authorities of the L\u00e4nder could not be regarded as a valid claim because it was not sufficiently specific. Referring to its settled case-law, the  added that the fixing of this time-limit corresponded to a provision of substantive law, which meant that the rights of the FRG had lapsed with the expiry of the statutory time-limit. However, by amending section 30a(1) of the Property Act in 1998, the legislature had \u201cremedied\u201d the failure to file a claim within that time-limit. It was only from that date onwards that the property rights of Mrs E.F. could be considered to have been effectively transferred to the FRG, and not at the time of the complete payment of compensation as provided for in Article 3 \u00a7 9 of the German-US Agreement (see relevant domestic law and practice, paragraph 34 below). The aim of that legislative amendment had been to ensure the survival of the former property rights and to rectify that omission. In addition, again with reference to its settled case-law, the Administrative Court took the view that the applicants\u2019 rights to restitution under the Property Act did not benefit from the protection of Article 14 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Law, because those rights did not correspond to existing property rights but stemmed from the State\u2019s wish to provide redress for past injustice. Lastly, in accordance with the settled case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court, it was in this case a question of \u201cquasi-retrospective\u201d effect (unechte R\u00fcckwirkung); having regard to the confused and uncertain legal situation existing at the time, the applicants had not acquired any \u201cconfidence warranting protection\u201d (schutzw\u00fcrdiges Vertrauen) or any legal certainty that their position as \u201csubsequent\u201d injured party afforded them an entitlement to the restitution of the disputed property. Moreover, the JCC had also filed a restitution claim within the statutory time-limit, and its rights would have prevailed over those of the applicants if it had been successful.",

It observed in particular that section 30a(1), fourth sentence, of the Property Act was compatible with Article 14 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Law, even if it were presumed in the applicants\u2019 favour that their entitlement to restitution under the Property Act, or to the payment of the proceeds of the sale under section 16(1), first sentence, of the Investment Priority Act, enjoyed the protection of Article 14 \u00a7 1. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, section 30a (1), fourth sentence, of the Property Act had to be understood as a provision defining the content and limits (Inhalts- und Schrankenbestimmung) of the right to property within the meaning of Article 14 \u00a7 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law, and struck a fair balance between the interests at stake. Under section 3 (2) of the Property Act, taken together with section 1(2), first sentence, of the Law of 27 September 1994 on compensation in accordance with the Property Act \u2013 \u201cthe Compensation Act\u201d (Gesetz \u00fcber die Entsch\u00e4digung nach dem Gesetz zur Regelung offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen \u2013 Entsch\u00e4digungsgesetz \u2013 see domestic law and practice, paragraph 31 in fine, below), the applicants, being regarded as the \u201csubsequent\u201d injured party, were, from the outset, simply entitled to compensation. Under Article 3 \u00a7 9, second sentence, of the German-US Agreement, the FRG had succeeded to the rights of the \u201cinitial\u201d injured parties, who, having regard to the compensation that they had already received, could no longer claim any rights based on the Property Act. In\u00a0filing a claim concerning property rights based on the German-US Agreement, the FRG had thus sought to secure a property right equivalent to that of an \u201cinitial\u201d injured party that had already materially been \u201cclaimed\u201d and compensated for. The legislature had thus wished to clarify the situation for that kind of right.",

The property rights under the German-US Agreement had originally been provided for by the  law of 1976 and had already been compensated for in 1980 as regards the disputed property. At the time of the ratification of the German-US Agreement it had been presumed that the total amount to be paid in compensation could reach USD 190 million. The FRG could not have been expected ultimately to renounce its property rights for which it had had to pay compensation in such a high amount \u2013 even though the transfer had not become effective until the determination of the final transfer payment (nach Feststellung des endg\u00fcltigen \u00dcberweisungsbetrags).

Neither the  nor the JCC had competing rights. As Mrs E.F. had opted for the payment of compensation in 1976, she had lost her entitlement as \u201cinitial\u201d injured party (Erstberechtigte) which had then fallen to the applicants. The property rights of Mrs E.F. had not been transferred to the FRG until 1997, well after the expiry of the time-limit provided for in section 30a(1), first sentence, of the Property Act. No restitution claim had been filed within that time, so the FRG\u2019s property rights had lapsed, as the  had indicated. As a result, the applicants, having filed a proper request within the statutory time-limit, remained the sole entitled party. The amendment with retrospective effect in 1998 \u2013 six years after the expiry of the statutory time-limit \u2013 of section 30a(1) of the Property Act to the State\u2019s advantage could not therefore be regarded as a mere legislative clarification. Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, section 30a(1), first sentence, also applied to the rights of the FRG under the German-US Agreement; thus, in drafting the new law of 1998, the Bundesrat had clearly indicated that the new provision was intended to enable the Government to assert their property rights under the German-US Agreement despite any failure to file a claim within the statutory time-limit or to extend the time-limit under section 30a(1), first sentence, of the Property Act. As the German-US Agreement had been signed on 13 May 1992, the FRG would easily have had the opportunity to file a restitution claim, even by way of precaution, within the statutory time-limit.",

The applicants should have been aware that in such an eventuality they would only have had a right to compensation. The expiry of the 31 December 1992 deadline had had no automatic legal consequence, because it had been for the competent authorities to determine whether the applicants had a right to restitution or whether they were excluded on the basis of the applicable legislation. In a decision of 12 July 2001 the competent authority had rejected the applicants\u2019 claim to that effect and that decision had been upheld by all the domestic courts. Moreover, before the expiry of the time-limit in question, there had been two events which showed that no legitimate expectation could come into existence for the applicants: the registration of a claim by the JCC, which could under certain circumstances provided for by the Property Act assert the rights of the former Jewish owners, and the enactment of the law of 21 December 1992 by which the German-US Agreement was incorporated into domestic legislation. That law provided for the transfer of the rights of the former Jewish owners to the  if they had opted for the payment of compensation, which was the situation in the present case; the transfer had not become effective until 29\u00a0April 1997 with the determination of the final transfer payment. Moreover, the judgment of the Federal Administrative Court of 26 May 1999, before which the  had argued that it had a claim to the property despite the fact that the amendment to the time-limit for restitution claims had occurred after the decision of the competent authority, showed how unclear the legal situation had been during that period. Lastly, the introduction of special legislation in December 1993 with the aim of securing the State\u2019s rights, by making it possible for the competent authorities to register a special reservation in the land registry (according to which the property could be sold only with the State\u2019s consent), had shown that the State was of the opinion that the German-US Agreement did not require any registration of a restitution claim on its part.",

It was thus only on totally alternative and preventive grounds that the applicants had filed a request for compensation \u2013 filed, according to them, within the statutory time-limit \u2013 on 28 December 1992, but this was unrelated to the present application. Lastly, the applicants argued that the compensation provided for by the Compensation Act was not proportionate to the impugned interference.",
