In his reply, he pointed out that the other side was confusing \u201chandling\u201d with \u201cpublishing\u201d, submitting that Mr Calvet was concerned, not by the handling but by the publication \u2013 something which did not contravene any provision of the press laws, so that the prosecution had resorted to another, inappropriate, charge, that of handling.",

They argued that a journalist could not lawfully be convicted of \u201chandling information\u201d and submitted that the Court of Appeal had failed to demonstrate how the actus reus and mens rea of the offence with which they had been charged \u2013 namely possession or control of the thing in question and knowledge that it had been obtained unlawfully \u2013 were made out in their case. With regard to the fact that the Court of Appeal had deduced that Mr Roire must have known that the documents had been obtained unlawfully since, when he had received them, he had verified that they were indeed copies of tax assessments, Mr Roire submitted that he had \u201cmerely fulfilled his duty as a journalist: before publishing information, he had checked that it was genuine, as required by the obligation on all journalists to exercise caution and verify sources\u201d.",

That is particularly true in the instant case, as issues concerning employment and pay generally attract considerable attention.

In the present case the Court of Appeal held that in the light of the nature of the documents and of the checks which Mr Roire says he carried out, the defendants must have known that the documents came from a tax file (see paragraph 22 above) and were therefore confidential. While recognising the vital role played by the press in a democratic society, the Court stresses that journalists cannot, in principle, be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that Article 10 affords them protection. Indeed, paragraph 2 of Article 10 defines the boundaries of the exercise of freedom of expression. It falls to be decided whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, the interest in the public's being informed outweighed the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d the applicants had as a result of the suspect origin of the documents that were sent to them.",

In that connection, it must be noted that although the applicants' conviction was based solely on the reproduction in Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9 of documents in the possession of the tax authorities that were held to have been communicated to Mr Fressoz \nand Mr Roire in breach of professional confidence, it inevitably concerned the disclosure of information. The issue does however arise as to whether there was any need to prevent the disclosure of information that was already available to the public (see the Weber v. Switzerland judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 177, p. 23, \u00a7 51, and the Vereniging Weekblad Bluf! v. the Netherlands judgment of 9 February 1995, Series A no. 306-A, p. 15, \u00a7\u00a041) and might already have been known to a large number of people. As the Government accepted, a degree of transparency exists regarding earnings and pay rises. Thus local taxpayers may consult a list of the people liable for tax in their municipality, with details of each taxpayer's taxable income and tax liability (see paragraphs 26 and 48 above). While that information cannot be disseminated, it is thus accessible to a large number of people who may in turn pass it on to others. Although publication of the tax assessments in the present case was prohibited, the information they contained was not confidential. Indeed, the remuneration of people who, like Mr Calvet, run major companies is regularly published in financial reviews and the second applicant said, without it being disputed, that he had referred to information of that type in order to check roughly how much Mr\u00a0Calvet was earning (see paragraph 19 above). Accordingly, there was no overriding requirement for the information to be protected as confidential.",

It protects journalists' right to divulge information on issues of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide \u201creliable and precise\u201d information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, in particular, the Goodwin judgment cited above, p. 500, \u00a7 39; the Schwabe v.
