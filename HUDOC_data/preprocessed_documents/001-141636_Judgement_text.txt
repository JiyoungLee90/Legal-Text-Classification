The case originated in an application (no. 71578/11) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Andrey Olegovich Malyugin (“the applicant”), on 25 October 2011.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicant’s first letter, submitted on the abovementioned date, described the conditions of his detention in the temporary detention centre of St Petersburg and the Leningradskiy Region (hereafter – the IVS) between 19 May and 1 June 2006, and those of his stay in a remand prison from 1 June 2006 to 19 May 2011.
On 13 January 2012 the applicant lodged an application form which additionally presented complaints about the conditions of the applicant’s transport between the custodial facilities and the courthouse in the period up until 19 May 2011 and about an alleged lack of reasons for his pre-trial detention and its excessive length.
On 13 April 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in St Petersburg.
On 19 May 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of organising a criminal gang and placed in the IVS, which, according to the applicant, was in a poor sanitary condition.
On the following day the applicant’s detention was authorised by domestic courts. It was regularly prolonged until his release (see paragraph 11 below).
On 1 June 2006 the applicant was transferred from the IVS to remand prison IZ-47/1 of St Petersburg, where he stayed until 19 May 2011. The facility was overcrowded. Thus, cell 81 measuring 8 sq. m was equipped with six sleeping places and accommodated up to six inmates; cell 104 measuring 8 sq. m was designed for six detainees and housed up to six individuals; finally, cell 907 measuring 8 sq. m presented six sleeping places and up to six persons who occupied them.
On an unspecified date the St Petersburg City Court commenced the examination of the case. From that date, in order to take part in the hearings, the applicant was regularly transported by prison van between the remand prison and the court premises. While in the courthouse, he was placed in a confinement cell. The applicant alleged that both the van and the cell had been overcrowded.
On 19 May 2011 the St Petersburg City Court ordered to release the applicant and on 14 June 2011 it acquitted him of all charges.
