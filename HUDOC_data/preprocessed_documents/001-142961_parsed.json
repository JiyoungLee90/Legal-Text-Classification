Carter and Others [2006] EWCA Crim 416 (see relevant domestic law and practice below), the court was bound to reject the first ground of appeal, namely that the applicant\u2019s earnings were not a relevant \u201cbenefit\u201d. He therefore accepted that the issue on appeal was whether it was oppressive and therefore an abuse of process for the Crown to seek and the court to impose a confiscation order for what amounted to the applicant\u2019s entire savings over nearly four years of genuine work. In this regard, counsel submitted that there would be an abuse of process where, on a correct application of the law to the facts, the resulting \u201cbenefit\u201d figure yielded a disproportionate or oppressive result. He further noted that Parliament has intended the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to be applied in a manner compatible with the requirements of the Convention. Therefore, in light of Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1, in order to remain proportionate the application of the confiscation regime had to remain rationally connected to the public interest aims pursued and go no further than necessary to achieve them. It was therefore submitted that to seek the imposition of a confiscation order on the basis of a benefit figure which far exceeded the value of the defendant\u2019s crimes could properly be described as disproportionate \u2013 either in the traditional sense used in criminal sentencing (\u201cnot fitting the punishment to the crime\u201d) or in the language of the Convention \u2013 and was therefore an abusive exercise of jurisdiction.",

Although the court may, of its own initiative, invoke the confiscation process, the responsibility for deciding whether properly to seek a confiscation order is effectively vested in the Crown. When it does so, the court lacks any corresponding discretion to interfere with that decision if it has been made in accordance with the statute. The just result of these proceedings is the result produced by the proper application of the statutory provisions as interpreted in the House of Lords and in this court.

His earnings, of course, reflected the fact that he had done the necessary work, as we shall assume, to the satisfaction of his various employers.

If the employee worked to his employer\u2019s satisfaction, and he paid his tax and National Insurance contributions on his earnings, and his deception either lacked any significant wider public interest, or, perhaps because of the passage of time, but for whatever reason, had ceased to have any meaningful effect on his employers\u2019 decision to continue his employment, the resolution of the issue might well be different. As it is there was here a wider public interest. The appellant was deliberately circumventing the prohibition against him seeking remunerative employment in this country in any capacity. No basis for interfering with the order made in the Crown Court has been shown.

On 4 October 2007 his application was refused by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who found no objective evidence that the Dioula were targeted solely on account of their ethnicity, and that the delay in claiming asylum had adversely affected the credibility of the rest of the applicant\u2019s claim. A deportation order made by the Secretary of State was served on the applicant on 19 November 2007. On 24 April 2008 the applicant brought judicial review proceedings challenging the refusal of asylum and the decision to make a deportation order. This application was refused by the High Court on 16 May 2008 as the application had been lodged out of time and, in any event, the applicant had failed to avail himself of his statutory appeal rights by applying to the then Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. His renewed application for judicial review was rejected by the High Court on 27 June 2008. However, it appears that on 3 April 2008 the applicant submitted a notice of appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. This was rejected by the Tribunal on 29 April 2008 as out of time.",

The second was where the defendant had voluntarily paid full compensation to the victim or victims, or was ready, willing and able immediately to repay all of the victims to the full amount of their losses, and had not otherwise profited from his crime. The third was where a court might be compelled to find that property obtained in the most part legitimately by the defendant, and to which the defendant would have been entitled but for his criminal conduct, must be treated as \u201cbenefit\u201d. The\u00a0example was given of a case where the defendant was in fact entitled to the property which he had instead chosen to obtain by deception.",

Prior to the hearing he accepted that he could not succeed on the first ground in view of the court\u2019s decision in R v. Carter. In respect of the second ground, he submitted that in light of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, in order to remain proportionate the application of the confiscation scheme had to remain rationally connected to the public interest aims pursued and go no further than necessary to achieve them. Thus, a confiscation order would be oppressive or an abuse of process in accordance with domestic law where the benefit figure far exceeded the value of the defendant\u2019s crimes and could properly be described as disproportionate \u2013 either in the traditional sense used in criminal proceedings or in the language of the Convention (see paragraphs 13 \u2013 16 above).",

Therefore, at the time the applicant brought his complaint before the domestic courts, it was appropriate for him to argue his case in terms of \u201coppression\u201d or \u201cabuse of process\u201d (see, for example, R v. Mohammed Shabir, in which the appellant argued, inter alia, that the confiscation order was oppressive and/or a breach of his rights under Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention, and the domestic courts primarily considered whether or not the order was oppressive). The Court of Appeal in the applicant\u2019s case itself stated that \u201cabuses of the confiscation process may occur and, when they do, the appropriate remedy will normally be a stay of proceedings\u201d (see paragraph 18 above). In fact, in arguing that a confiscation order would be oppressive if it was disproportionate pursuant to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 the applicant gave the domestic courts an opportunity to align, in substance, the criteria for the application of the domestic-law test with the test stated in this Court\u2019s case-law for compliance with the Convention (see, for example, Hentrich v. France, 22 September 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 296A).

However, the three rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 106, Series A no. 102).",

Moreover, it is clear from Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2001VII, that confiscation orders fall within the scope of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which, inter\u00a0alia, allows the Contracting States to control the use of property to secure the payment of penalties. However, this provision must be construed in the light of the general principle set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph and there must, therefore, exist a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, among many examples, Allan Jacobsson v.

The striking of a fair balance depends on many factors (AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 108). Although the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirements, the Court must consider whether the proceedings as a whole afforded the applicant a reasonable opportunity for putting his case to the competent authorities with a view to enabling them to establish a fair balance between the conflicting interests at stake (AGOSI, cited above, \u00a7 55, and Jokela v.

Although the applicant sought to argue that \u201coppression\u201d should be interpreted in line with the proportionality test required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, such an analysis was not adopted by the Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 17 \u2013 19 above).

In the present case (which concerns the application of different domestic legislation), it has not been contested that, having entered the territory of the United Kingdom by using a false passport, the applicant used it to obtain employment and thus earn his income. Unlike in Phillips, however, it has not been submitted that such employment constituted itself a crime on the part of the applicant, or that the regulation of the domestic labour market went so far as to make any irregularly obtained employment criminal or punishable in any manner. Likewise, it has not been contended that the applicant\u2019s work caused any public or private harm rather than contributing to the public welfare. Notwithstanding this situation, the applicant\u2019s genuinely earned savings were defined and confiscated as the \u201cproceeds of the crime\u201d of using a false passport \u2013 an act for which the applicant was punished in separate proceedings. The difference between the reasonable assumption as to the criminal origin of the confiscated property in the case of Phillips and the remote or indeed non-existent link between the use of a false passport and the genuine earning of the confiscated amounts in the present case appears quite obvious.",

However, I find myself unable to agree that in the present case the confiscated amounts could be clearly and necessarily defined as the proceeds of crime. Such an assumption is apt to regard any irregular employment as criminal, with the result that any earnings from such employment would be subject to confiscation in the exercise of \u201cthe right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties\u201d within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. In my understanding, the Court has hitherto regarded the confiscation of the \u201cproceeds of crime\u201d as compatible with the Convention where a direct link between criminal conduct and the proceeds could be established or reasonably assumed.

The fair-balance test under Article 1 of Protocol No. I, as the Court expressed it in the landmark judgment of Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden (cited at paragraph 65 of the present judgment), requires determining whether the person who is the subject of a contested regulatory measure has had to bear \u201can individual and excessive burden\u201d.

The threshold of the restriction is lower. The intensity of the scrutiny that the national courts, and thereafter this Court, are called on to undertake in relation to the merits of fair balance and proportionality under Article 1 of Protocol 1 is, correspondingly, less than that under Articles 8 to 11.

It should be stressed in this context that once the general principle of confiscation of the proceeds of crime is accepted, there is little room for an assessment as to whether the confiscation was proportionate in a specific case. I agree, nonetheless, that in some specific circumstances it may be necessary to take into account some legitimate interests of the perpetrator and to mitigate the measures to be taken. The typical question, however, is not whether the proceeds of crime should be confiscated but to what extent the applicant is able to repay them. It would be preferable for this matter to be clearly addressed in the reasoning and for the different factors that should be taken into account to be clearly identified.",

In particular, it disagrees with the view that the British courts lack any discretion to interfere with the confiscation decision if it has been made in accordance with the law (see paragraph 67 in fine). The reasoning thus suggests that the decision to confiscate the proceeds of crime should not only be subject to review from the viewpoint of its conformity with the legal rules, but also that the second-instance court should be entitled to assess the necessity of the measure applied from the viewpoint of some unspecified extra-legal criteria, although the domestic law does not refer to any such standards and does not require the application of such standards by the firstinstance court.",
