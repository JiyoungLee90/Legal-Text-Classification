It appears, however, from the case file that at the stage of the proceedings at which the burglary took place most of the evidence had already been gathered \u2013 moreover, on 24 October 1994 the investigating judge ordered the removal of the seals placed on the applicant\u2019s house (see paragraph 60 above).",
