It relied, in particular, on the confessing statement made by V. after his arrest in July 1997, according to which he and the applicant had agreed, for remuneration, to help their friend Y. with settling a debt-related dispute with G. (assisted from his side by K.) or, if that had turned out to be impossible, to kill G. and K. As V. had explained in the course of his own trial in 1998, he, the applicant and Y. had taken the victims to a forest in the applicant\u2019s car, had killed them and had buried their bodies there. They had used a metal cable and a shovel, which had been in the car trunk. The Regional Court also referred to the report on the crime scene inspection conducted with V.\u2019s participation, in the course of which he had shown to the police where the bodies had been buried. Furthermore, it relied on the statements of several witnesses, according to which the victims had last been seen getting into the applicant\u2019s car driven by him, in the company of V. and Y. Some other witnesses confirmed the existence of a conflict between Y., V. and the applicant from one side, and G. and K. from the other side. In addition, the trial court referred to the post-mortem reports in respect of the victims\u2019 injuries, which had been found to confirm V.\u2019s account of the events. It also held, in general terms, that the applicant\u2019s guilt was confirmed by the findings of the verdict of 1 December 1998 (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a06 above). Although the applicant denied his involvement in the crimes imputed to him, the Regional Court considered that his behaviour had indicated the contrary. It observed in that connection that the applicant had been on the run for many years and that he had forged his identity documents by gluing his photograph into the passport of a different person. In determining the sentence, the Regional Court held that there were no aggravating circumstances. At the same time, it noted that the applicant had had no previous criminal record and that he had a minor child to take care of. The trial court considered those circumstances as mitigating. It further observed that the applicant had positive character references both at his place of residence and at his place of detention.",

The Supreme Court stated, in particular, that the Regional Court had wrongly relied on the statements made by V. during his own trial in 1998, without questioning him in the court hearing within the applicant\u2019s 2008 trial, which had been in breach of Article 323 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see\u00a0paragraph 21 below).

This time the applicant admitted in the court hearing having participated, together with V. and Y., in a fight with the victims, which had resulted in the death of the latter. He insisted, however, that they had had no intention of killing K. and G. The trial court questioned in the hearing V., who submitted that he, Y. and the applicant had taken G. and K. to a forest, in the applicant\u2019s car, in order to have a discussion concerning an ongoing conflict with them. He further stated that a fight had sparked in the course of that conversation and that G. and K. had been killed. Referring to the fact that many years had elapsed since the events in question, V. denied recalling any further details, but noted that he had given all the details at the material time. The Regional Court therefore also relied on his earlier statements as well (see paragraph 8 above). It heard a number of witnesses in the hearing, who confirmed their earlier statements (ibid.). Having regard to the undisputed existence of an ongoing conflict at the material time between Y., V. and the applicant from one side and G. and K. from the other side, as well as the fact that the applicant with his two friends had deliberately taken the victims to a remote and isolated area and that they had prepared in advance a metal cable and a shovel, the trial court dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that G. and K.\u2019s death had resulted from an unfortunate turn of events.",

Such rules manifest the national legislature\u2019s concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes of such concerns. In addition to ensuring the absence of actual bias, they are directed at removing any appearance of partiality and so serve to promote the confidence that the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public.

In that context, he argued that the Supreme Court had already taken an unfavourable stance concerning the sentence to be imposed (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above).",

He did not provide the Court with a copy of his cassation appeal (see paragraph 14 above). Be that as it may, the Supreme Court judges in question were in no way bound by their first cassation ruling delivered on 19 March 2009 by which they quashed the verdict of 8 December 2008 and remitted the case. In the above-mentioned ruling the Supreme Court\u2019s panel criticised the verdict in respect of several serious procedural failures, including the trial court\u2019s reliance on important witness evidence without having questioned those witnesses (in particular, V.) in the court hearing and therefore drawing unfounded conclusions on the applicant\u2019s character and the circumstances under which the crimes had been committed (see paragraph\u00a010 above). The Supreme Court panel found the sentence of fixed-term imprisonment to be too lenient under the circumstances, given the facts as then established by the Regional Court. However, given the nature and context of that finding, which was in the form of a cassation ruling, it remained open to the Regional Court to rehear the case and deliver a new verdict rectifying all the mentioned procedural shortcomings in accordance with national law and, consequently, providing better reasons for a fixed-term imprisonment sentence instead of imposing a life-imprisonment sentence on the applicant depending on the facts as newly established. While the trial court was bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s directions in relation to the requirements of national law (see paragraphs 2728 above), the latter had not strictly imposed the adoption of a harsher sentence and had not explicitly relied on Article 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 26 above). In other words, by the first ruling the panel of the Supreme Court simply fulfilled its legal task to assess the compliance of the verdict with domestic law. The fact that the judges sat twice in the same capacity in the criminal proceedings against the applicant was an integral part of the system of cassation review and did not as such cast doubts on their impartiality.",

Domestic law provided for adequate procedural safeguards with a view to ensure impartiality of judges (see paragraphs 1820 above). The applicant did not explain whether and if so, why he considered those safeguards to have been insufficient. Nor is it clear what prevented him from raising at the domestic level his concerns regarding the alleged lack of impartiality of judges R. and K. According to the applicant, he did not have the requisite knowledge of the applicable legislation (see paragraph 35 above). However, as confirmed by the case-file material and not contested by the applicant, during the hearing before the Supreme Court on 10 February 2011 he was assisted by a professional lawyer of his choice (compare Zahirovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a058590/11, \u00a7 31, 25\u00a0April 2013). The\u00a0Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case that court did not lack the guarantee of impartiality.",
