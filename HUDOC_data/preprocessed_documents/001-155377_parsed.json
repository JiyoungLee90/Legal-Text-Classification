In their decisions, the domestic courts mainly relied on the seriousness of the charges against the applicant, and her risk of absconding from or obstructing the investigation, without indicating why they considered these grounds relevant in the applicant\u2019s case. They failed to mention any case-specific facts relevant to those grounds, and did not substantiate them with relevant and sufficient reasons. The Court also notes that when extending the applicant\u2019s detention the courts repeatedly used the same stereotyped formula; their reasoning did not evolve with the passage of time to reflect the developing situation or to ascertain whether these grounds remained valid at the later stages of the proceedings (see Farhad\u00a0Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7 191, and Rafig Aliyev v.

Armenia, no.\u00a033376/07, \u00a7 98, 26 June 2012, and Allahverdiyev, cited above, \u00a7 60).
