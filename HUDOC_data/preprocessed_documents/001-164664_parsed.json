It notes that in the present case the applicant also claimed before the domestic courts that his pension should have been calculated in line with the requirements of Article 46 of the Constitution. However, as in Pronina and Bogatova, the domestic courts made no attempt to analyse the applicant\u2019s claim from this standpoint, despite the explicit reference to it before every judicial instance. It is not the task of the Court to decide what would have been the most appropriate way for the domestic courts to deal with this argument. Nevertheless, by mere ignoring the applicant\u2019s argument altogether, even though it was specific, pertinent and important, the domestic courts fell short of their obligations under Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
