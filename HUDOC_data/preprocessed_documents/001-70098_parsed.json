The Court notes that the Convention places a duty on the Contracting States to organise their legal systems so as to allow the courts to comply with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1, including that of determinations within a \"reasonable time\" (see, among many others, Deli\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 48771/99, \u00a7 106, 27 June 2002). Moreover, the Court observes that the Government were unable to give any example of a measure of either a methodological or structural character reflecting the State's willingness to tackle the problem (see Zimmermann and Steiner v. Switzerland, judgment of 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66, p. 12, \u00a7 31).",

It observes that, whilst the case cannot be said to involve issues of any particular complexity, it was considered by the courts on four occasions. Although the Court is not in a position to analyse the quality of the case-law of the domestic courts, it considers that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003).",
