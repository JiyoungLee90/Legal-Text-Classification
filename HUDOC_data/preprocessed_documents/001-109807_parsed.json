The restriction imposed on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court was justified by the principle of reciprocity: if equal treatment was codified under constitutional law, there would be no incentive for foreign States to provide German legal persons with the same legal standard. The court also held that, even if the applicant company were to be put on a par with a domestic legal person, the non-litigation of the applicant company\u2019s case did not run counter to the general interest. Relying on a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court of 3\u00a0July 1973 (no. 1 BvR 153/69, report BVerfGE 35, 356), it considered in this regard that even a domestic legal entity retained its right to exist under the legal order only if it was able to pursue its objectives by virtue of its own strength and means.",

As far as could be seen, there was no case-law on the granting or denying of legal aid to foreign legal persons in Peru which led to a conclusion that legal aid had so far either been granted to legal persons straight away or not asked for in view of the fact that the maximum amount to be paid when filing a lawsuit was low (approximately 120 euros).",

According to the Hamburg Court of Appeal, the unequal treatment of foreign legal persons was justified by the principle of reciprocity: if equal treatment was codified under constitutional law, there would be no incentive for foreign States to provide German legal persons with the same legal standards. Secondly, the Hamburg Court of Appeal held that, even if the applicant company was to be put on a par with a domestic legal person, legal aid had to be denied because the non-litigation of the applicant company\u2019s case did not run counter to the general interest. It considered in this regard that a legal entity retained its right to exist under the legal order only if it was able to pursue its objectives by virtue of its own strength and means.",

The Court further observes that the applicant company was unable to submit any case-law with respect to the granting of legal aid to foreign legal persons. Even though this might be due to the circumstance that foreign legal entities, having regard to the comparatively low court fees and to the fact that the Peruvian procedural law does not generally require the payment of an advance court fee, do not request legal aid in Peru, the Court is not convinced that a foreign legal person was eligible for legal aid before the Peruvian courts.",
