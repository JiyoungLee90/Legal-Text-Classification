He had written the said article in order to express his opinion on the Armenian issue in the context of freedom of the press. He pointed out that he was a professor of history who had been working on this subject for almost twenty years and that he had expressed his opinion several times in his books and articles.

Having examined the novel written by the accused, the court concluded that the statements contained in the book should be examined in the context of freedom of expression. The court, however, observed that the limits of the concept of \u201cTurkishness\u201d should be determined and based on a solid ground by the legislator.

On 14 September 2010 the Court delivered its judgment in the case of Dink\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey in which it found a violation of Article 10 ECHR on account of Hrant Dink\u2019s conviction based on Article\u00a0301. The Court held that Hrant Dink\u2019s conviction for denigrating Turkish identity prior to his murder did not correspond to any \u201cpressing social need\u201d which is one of the major conditions on which interference with one\u2019s freedom of expression may be warranted in a democratic society. The Commissioner considers that the amendment adopted in 2008, which subjects prosecution to a prior authorisation by the Ministry of Justice in each individual case, is not a lasting solution which can replace the integration of the relevant ECHR standards into the Turkish legal system and practice, in order to prevent similar violations of the Convention.\u201d",

It transpires from the statistical data provided by the Government that there are still significant number of investigations commenced by public prosecutors under Article\u00a0301 and that the Ministry of Justice grants authorisation in a large number of cases: according to the Government\u2019s contention, between 8\u00a0May 2008 and 30 November 2009 the Ministry of Justice received 1,025\u00a0requests for authorisation to institute criminal proceedings under Article 301 and granted prior authorisation in 80 cases (approximately 8% of the total requests). The Court notes that the Government did not explain the subject matter or nature of the cases in which the Ministry of Justice granted authorisation. However, the statistical information provided by the applicant indicates that the percentage of prior authorisations granted by the Ministry of Justice is much higher and that these cases mainly concern the prosecution of journalists in freedom of expression cases (see paragraphs\u00a03033 above). Moreover, as noted by the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, a system of prior authorisation by the Ministry of Justice in each individual case is not a lasting solution which can replace the integration of the relevant Convention standards into the Turkish legal system and practice, in order to prevent similar violations of the Convention (see paragraph 48 above).",
