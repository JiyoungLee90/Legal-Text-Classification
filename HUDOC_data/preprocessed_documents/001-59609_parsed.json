Relying on the freedom of the press and in particular the right to comment on current events, he submitted, among other arguments, that the reference to Caselli\u2019s political tendencies reflected the truth and that the District Court could have tested whether this was so by agreeing to take evidence from the complainant himself, that Caselli and Violante actually were friends and that in the proceedings against Andreotti Caselli actually had made use of the assistance of the pentito Buscetta and had paid him sums of money as the representative of the State, since all the pentiti were in receipt of money from the Italian State. He further described himself as a commentator (opinionista), arguing that his intention had not been to present a biography of Caselli but to express his critical opinions, in a figurative and effective way, on the basis of true and uncontested facts. Lastly, he insisted that the complainant, together with journalists and other well-known personalities on the Italian political stage who, like Caselli, had been militant Communists, should be required to give evidence. In particular, he asked for evidence to be taken from Mr S. Vertone and Mr G. Ferrara, both political comrades of the complainant during the 1970s in  and demanded that the Court of Appeal add to the file press articles relating interviews in which they had confirmed the complainant\u2019s active political militancy. In particular, in an interview published in the daily newpaper Corriere della Sera on 11 December 1994, extracts from which were quoted in the applicant\u2019s appeal, Mr Vertone had declared, among other statements, that the complainant was a courageous man of great integrity but that he was influenced by the Communist cultural and political model, that his links with the former Communist Party were very close and that Caselli had subsequently become all but a member of it. In an interview published by another daily newspaper, La Stampa, on 9 December 1994, also quoted in extract form in the applicant\u2019s appeal, Mr Ferrara had stated that in the 1970s he had participated in dozens of political meetings attended by Caselli and Violante, among others, held by the  federation of the former Communist Party. He had gone on to say that although Caselli, a man of integrity, had done good work in fighting terrorism and as a judicial officer, he was highly politicised and should therefore avoid making speeches like a tribune.",

The Court\u2019s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, the Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, \u00a7 50). In particular, \u201cas a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce... More specifically, Article 6 para. 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses\u201d (see the Vidal v.  judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, \u00a7 33). Consequently, it is not sufficient for an accused to complain that he was not permitted to examine certain witnesses; he must also support his request to call witnesses by explaining the importance of doing so and it must be necessary for the court to take evidence from the witnesses concerned in order to be able to establish the true facts (see Engel and others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, \u00a7 91, and Bricmont v. Belgium, 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, \u00a7 89, and Eur. Comm. HR, no.\u00a029420/95, Dec. 13.1.1997, DR 88-B, p. 148 at pp. 158 and 159). That principle also applies to the complainant in a defamation case where, as in the present case, it is requested that he be called as a witness of the facts asserted in the allegedly defamatory statements.",

But throughout the proceedings the Italian courts consistently held that his militancy had been established, and the same is true of the friendship between Caselli and Violante, Buscetta\u2019s co-operation with the judicial authorities and the fact that the latter, as a pentito, was paid by the State. In that connection, the Court attaches special importance to the fact that, in his appeal, the applicant mentioned above all the complainant\u2019s political militancy as a fact which could be corroborated by the witnesses he wished to call, whereas he did not name any other witness capable of giving evidence about the crucial facts alleged in his article, namely that there was a strategy of gaining control of the public prosecutors\u2019 offices in various cities and that Buscetta was being used to destroy Andreotti\u2019s political career. The Court therefore considers that the applicant has not explained how evidence from the witnesses he wished to call could have contributed any new information whatsoever to the proceedings. The same is true of the press articles which the applicant had asked to be added to the file and which also essentially referred to the complainant\u2019s political militancy.",

However, the relevance thus presumed a priori must be verified in the light of the actual circumstances of the case concerned. The applicant\u2019s article raised in substance two separate issues. Firstly, he questioned the complainant\u2019s independence and impartiality in general on account of his political militancy. Secondly, he accused him of the specific conduct mentioned above, that is the strategy of gaining control of the public prosecutors\u2019 offices and the use of the pentito Buscetta against Andreotti. The complainant\u2019s political militancy and his relations with Mr Buscetta, a pentito paid by the State, had been held by the Italian courts to have been established. A witness statement by the complainant would therefore have concerned mainly the allegations that he had participated in a plan to gain control of the public prosecutors\u2019 offices in various cities and that he had an ulterior motive for his use of Buscetta. These, however, were accusations which the complainant had contested in his complaint alleging defamation. Consequently, it is hard to see what evidence capable of helping the courts to establish the truth could have been provided by examination of the complainant, other than a repetition of his rejection of the allegations against him en bloc.",

The Court takes the view that the sentence in question was essentially symbolic in content and amounted to the expression of a critical opinion about Caselli\u2019s political militancy as a member of the former Communist Party. Moreover, the Court of Appeal itself accepted, in its judgment of 28\u00a0October 1997, that it was a sentence with a symbolic meaning. Admittedly, to repeat the terms used by the Court of Appeal, such an expression indicated dependence on the instructions of a political party. However, this was precisely the tenor of the criticism directed at the complainant. Consequently, the Court must verify whether such criticism, conveyed in a strongly-worded, symbolic form, was consistent with respect for the rules of the journalist\u2019s profession, to which exercise of the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 is subject.",

The Italian courts themselves consistently held that fact to have been established (see paragraph 28 above). While it is true that judicial officers must be protected against unfounded attacks, especially in view of the fact that they are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying (see the Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria judgment, cited above, \u00a7 34), the press nevertheless is one of the means by which politicians and public opinion can verify that judges are discharging their heavy responsibilities in a manner that is in conformity with the aim which is the basis of the task entrusted to them (ibid.). By acting as a militant member of a political party, of whatever tendency, a judicial officer imperils the image of impartiality and independence that justice must always show at all times (see, mutatis mutandis, Buscemi v. Italy, no. 29569/95, \u00a7 67, to be published in the official reports of the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions). Where a judicial officer is an active political militant, his unconditional protection against attacks in the press is scarcely justified by the need to maintain the public confidence which the judiciary needs in order to be able to function properly, seeing that it is precisely such political militancy which is likely to undermine that confidence. By such conduct, a judicial officer inevitably exposes himself to criticism in the press, which may rightly see the independence and impartiality of the State legal service as a major concern of public interest.",
