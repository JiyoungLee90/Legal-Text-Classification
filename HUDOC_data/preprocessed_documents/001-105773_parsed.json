In his submission, the provisions of the Law of 3 December 2001 should apply to the present case because his mother\u2019s succession had opened on the date of publication of the Law but had not yet given rise to division. The deed of inter vivos division of 1970 did not itself produce final and unalterable effects, since it contained a reserve clause retaining title to all the immovable property and a sum of FRF 130,000. He added that the deed had also contained a provision whereby the donors retained throughout their lives the possibility of revoking the terms of the deed and securing the return of the property.",

It thus observed that the provisions of section 14 of the Law of 3 January 1972, which had not been repealed by the Law of 3 December 2001, provided objective and reasonable justification as regards the legitimate aim pursued, namely, ensuring peaceful family relations by securing rights established in that context, sometimes long-standing ones. The Court of Cassation also based its decision on the fact that the estate had been divided between the two legitimate children on the mother\u2019s death before the Law of 3 December 2001 came into force, concluding that the provisions of that Law relating to the new inheritance rights of illegitimate children were not applicable in the present case. That interpretation of the relevant provisions by the domestic courts pursued a legitimate aim, namely ensuring the principle of legal security, \u201cwhich is necessarily inherent in the law of the Convention as in Community law\u201d (see Marckx v. Belgium, 13\u00a0June 1979, \u00a7\u00a058, Series A no. 31, and E.S. v.  (dec.), 10 February 2009, no.\u00a049714/06). Unlike the cases of Mazurek and Merger and Cros, cited above, in which there had not yet been division of the estate, the Court considers that the difference in treatment between Mr and Mrs M.\u2019s legitimate children and the applicant regarding their rights in respect of their mother\u2019s estate, was proportionate to that aim. In that connection the Court finds that the domestic courts struck a proper balance between the competing interests \u2013 namely, the long-established rights of Mr and Mrs\u00a0M.\u2019s legitimate children and the pecuniary interests of the applicant \u2013 by applying the transitional provisions of the Laws of 1972 and 2001 in that specific situation.",

We consider the principle of non-discrimination to be more important in law and equity than those of established rights and legal certainty. Moreover, it would be paradoxical for a Law that is supposed to draw the consequences from one of our judgments to apply that judgment only to successions that have not been opened. This is particularly true in that, between delivery of the judgment in Mazurek and the enactment of the Law of 2001 (and thus before the transitional provisions of that Law), a number of courts, starting with the Montpellier tribunal de grande instance, did apply our judgment and ceased applying the former Law (Article 760 of the Civil Code) in favour of the Convention as interpreted by the Court, in accordance with Article 55 of the French Constitution. Lastly, to conclude in the present case that there has been no violation is tantamount to allowing the legislature to disregard retroactively \u2013 for reasons that may, moreover, be valid \u2013 the binding force of judgments under Article 46 of the Convention. We would point out that in the case of Mazurek the State was ordered, under Article 41, to pay the applicant, in respect of pecuniary damage, a sum corresponding to the difference between the amount he should have received and the amount he actually received.

The Government, relying on the judgments of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation, considered that the division of the estate took effect in 1994 on the death of the applicant\u2019s mother, whilst the applicant considered that there had not been division of the estate on that date.",
