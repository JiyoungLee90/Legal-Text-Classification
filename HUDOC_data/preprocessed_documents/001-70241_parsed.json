The case had been examined in two instances and had reached an advanced stage in the proceedings. However, it took the domestic courts another five years, nine months and fifteen days to give a final answer to the applicant\u2019s case. Within this period the hearings were adjourned at the applicant\u2019s request or because of his failure to appear three times, for an overall period of six months and eight days.\u00a0\u00a0The rest of the length is attributable to the State authorities or the defendant\u2019s failure to appear at the hearings. Thus, the delay between 20 December 1999 and 20\u00a0June 2000 was due to the district court\u2019s failure to notify the defendant about the hearing. Further, the courts held no hearings between 12 January 1998 and 12\u00a0April 1999, and between 12\u00a0September 2000 and 2 October 2001. The Government did not present any plausible explanation for these periods of inactivity. In the following period the case was adjourned on three occasions due to the judges\u2019 participation in other proceedings and the absence of lay judges. In this respect the Court recalls that it is the States\u2019 duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet the requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Muti v. Italy, judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no. 281C, \u00a7\u00a015).
