Most of the investigative measures had been undertaken with substantial delays. There had been several major periods of total inactivity, notably between September 2011 and December 2012, April 2013 and May 2016, June 2016 and July 2017, and then September 2017 and April 2018, and the Government had not provided any arguments capable of explaining these gaps.

The applicant further alleged that, on top of these deficiencies, he had not been granted victim status in the relevant proceedings, which had prevented him from having access to the investigative file or even simply being informed of the progress of the investigation. The only information the applicant possessed about the ongoing proceedings in connection with his alleged ill-treatment, was the information that he had received from the Court, after notice of the application had been given to the parties. Lastly, the applicant criticised the fact that, despite his repeated requests, the investigation so far had been conducted under Article 333 of the Criminal Code (exceeding official authority) instead of Article 144 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (torture). In view of the passage of time, the above deficiencies cumulatively implied that the investigation, which had been ongoing for more than seven and a half years, was in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.",

Article 3 thus required the authorities to conduct an effective investigation. As to the investigation as such, it notes that while providing detailed information about the various investigative measures that the relevant authorities had undertaken throughout the ongoing investigation, which has already lasted almost eight years, the Government failed to provide any explanations for several major periods of inactivity. Thus, although the criminal proceedings started promptly, within only a couple of days of the alleged incident (see paragraph 20 above), it seems that the only investigative measure that was undertaken within the initial eighteen months of the investigation was the questioning of the applicant on 2 September 2011 (see paragraph 21 above). The investigating authorities did not arrange a medical examination of the applicant, despite his showing visible signs of injuries (see paragraphs 9, 10, and 19 above). Such an examination on the day of his arrest would not only have ensured that the applicant would have been fit for questioning in police custody but would also have enabled the Government to discharge their burden of providing a plausible explanation for those injuries (see, inter alia, Parnov v. Moldova, no. 35208/06, \u00a7 30, 13 July 2010, and T\u00fcrkan v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 33086/04, \u00a7 42, 18 September 2008). The only medical examination the applicant had within the relevant period of time was conducted at his own request outside the scope of the initiated criminal proceedings and at his own expense (see paragraph 13 above).",

The Government did not provide any reason for the three-year gap in the proceedings. In May 2016 the case was transferred to the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office, but this just resulted in the proceedings being stalled for yet another year.

Without going into the substance of each and every investigative measure undertaken by the respondent Government so far, the Court would note the following: almost eight years into the investigation, the relevant authorities have failed, according to the case file, to identify the unit of the Special Forces that had conducted the arrest operation of the applicant and his group. Thus, not a single officer who had participated in the Kintsvisi special operation has been questioned so far.

The unjustified delays in the current case coupled with a number of failings discussed above, have significantly prejudiced the effectiveness of the investigation (see Mikheyev, \u00a7 113, and Asllani, \u00a7 66, both cited above), which leads the Court to the conclusion that the investigation has been ineffective for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention. For these reasons, it does not consider that it was necessary for the applicant to wait for the completion of the criminal proceedings before filing his complaints with the Court, as their conclusion would not remedy the overall delay in any way. The Court accordingly dismisses the Government\u2019s objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and finds a violation of Article 3 of the Convention under its procedural aspect (see Asllani, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68, and Mikheyev, \u00a7 121, both cited above).",

The Government did not contest the findings of the visual examinations of the applicant. Moreover, they never argued that he had sustained those injuries prior to his arrest or that he had resisted the arrest or that use of force against him had otherwise been justified. On the contrary, in support of their observations, the Government submitted a copy of the prosecutorial decision on requalification of the investigation (dated 19 July 2017), according to which the prosecutor had concluded that there was sufficient evidence to show that the applicant had sustained those injuries during the arrest operation (see paragraph 30 above). Furthermore, as a part of their observations the Government submitted to the Court statements of various witnesses, who had corroborated, to a significant extent, the version of events as alleged by the applicant (see paragraphs 30, 31 and 33).",

Against this background, the Government\u2019s argument that there is no conclusive medical evidence showing the scale and gravity of the applicant\u2019s injuries appears to be irrelevant. In any event, as concluded above, the evidential situation in the case is the result of a deficient investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations, the responsibility for which lies entirely with the Government.",

Taken cumulatively with the evidence in the case file and the applicant\u2019s detailed and consistent description of the ill-treatment he complained of (see paragraphs 12, 15, 19, 21, and 24 above), the Court finds that those injuries were the result of illtreatment to which the applicant had been subjected on the day of his arrest.

His allegation was dismissed by a judge on 28 May 2011, which decision was confirmed on appeal by the Tbilisi Court of Appeal on 6 June 2011. The appeal court decision was served on the applicant on 9 June 2011. In such circumstances, it follows that on 9 June 2011, with the decision of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal confirming the official version of events, it should have become evident to the applicant that subsequent complaints in that regard would have been to no avail.",

The Court does not accept the applicant\u2019s argument. Leaving aside the question of whether, in the light of the unsuccessful habeas corpus proceedings, the applicant also needed to resort to a criminal remedy before applying to the Court, it notes that the applicant did not voice his grievances under Article 5 of the Convention in a sufficiently explicit way in any of his complaints to the prosecution authorities (see paragraphs 19, 21 and 23 above). Although he referred to the fact of his arrest at the Kintsvisi Monastery, he did not allege that it had been unlawful or that it had amounted to an unrecorded detention. The applicant, in the Court\u2019s view, had no basis to expect the prosecution authorities to investigate the allegations of initial unlawful detention on their own initiative.",

The current application was lodged with the Court on 21 June 2012.
