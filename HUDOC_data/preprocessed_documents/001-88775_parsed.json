It is to be observed in this connection that the official results of the elections had been made public on 4 May 2002, two months before the impugned demonstration, and that the outcome of those elections had been objectively established. To the extent that the demonstrators\u2019 aim was to express solidarity with the protestors at the , the Court is not persuaded that this matter would have become obsolete had the demonstrators respected the notification rule.",

Irrespective of whether the subsequent demonstration at  included partly or entirely the same participants, the declared objective of this latter gathering, in which the applicant participated, was to support those who had illegally demonstrated at the . The essentially disorderly character of this combination of events is therefore so manifest that the decision of the police to disband the gathering cannot be said to be at variance with the object and purpose of Article 11 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that those organising and participating in demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, should respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force (see Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

The protection of the expression of personal opinions, secured by Article 10, is one of the objectives of the freedom of peaceful assembly enshrined in Article 11 (see Ezelin v. France, 26\u00a0April 1991, \u00a7\u00a037, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0202). It observes in this connection that the demonstrators gathered at  at about 1 p.m. and the applicant joined them at about 7\u00a0p.m. However, the police did not break up the demonstration until about 9\u00a0p.m., with the result that the demonstrators had had several hours at their disposal to manifest their views.",
