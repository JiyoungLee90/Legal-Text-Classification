This means, in particular, that the detainee should have access to the documents in the investigation file which are essential for assessing the lawfulness of his detention (see Lamy v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 30 March 1989, Series A no. 151, \u00a7 29, and Sch\u00f6ps v. Germany, no. 25116/94, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2001-I). The detainee should also have an opportunity to comment on the arguments put forward by the prosecution (see Niedba\u0142a v. Poland, no. 27915/95, \u00a7 67, 4 July 2000). Some form of legal representation of the detainee may be required, namely when he is unable to defend himself properly or in other special circumstances (see Bouamar v. Belgium, judgment of 29 February 1988, Series A no. 129, \u00a7 62; Megyeri v. Germany, judgment of 12 May 1992, Series A no. 237A; and \u00d6calan v.

In that case the meetings between the applicants, who were detained, and their lawyer was arranged in a manner that precluded any confidential contact between them. The Court held that such a measure was not justified in the circumstances of the case (\u00a7 90) and that there was a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 on that account. The central issue in that case was not the positive duty of the State to secure legal assistance to a detainee, but the negative obligation of the State not to hinder effective assistance from lawyers in the context of detention proceedings (\u00a7 88).

The Court accepts that the lawyers might have arrived late, and it might have been acceptable to start the hearing without waiting for the lawyers.

At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, if the detention is confirmed by a court it must be considered to be lawful and not arbitrary, even where appeal is available. Subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention (see Tjin-a-Kwi and Van Den Heuvel v. the , no. 17297/90, Commission decision of 31 March 1993). Therefore, the Court would be less concerned with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and gave to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (see, mutatis mutandis, Vodeni\u010darov v. Slovakia, no. 24530/94, \u00a7 33, 21 December 2000).",

Turkey, no. 21893/93, Reports 1996IV, \u00a7 105). In this context, \u201cpressure\u201d includes not only direct coercion but also other improper indirect acts designed to discourage applicants from pursuing a Convention remedy, such as measures limiting the applicant\u2019s contacts with his lawyers (see \u00d6calan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 197 et seq.) or interfering with their professional activities in other ways. In examining whether or not a particular measure applied by the authorities was in compliance with Article\u00a034, the Court sometimes considered the practical effects of this measure on the applicant\u2019s ability to exercise his right of petition (see Ahmet \u00d6zkan and Others v. Turkey, no. 21689/93, \u00a7\u00a7 416 and 417, 6 April 2004). However, in certain cases the Court has found a violation of this provision even in the absence of any visible negative effects of the measure complained of (see McShane v. the United Kingdom, no. 43290/98, \u00a7 151, 28 May 2002).",

In principle, excessive formalities in such matters may de facto prevent a prospective applicant from effectively enjoying his right of individual petition. However, it appears that in the present case it was quite simple to comply with the domestic formalities and that the problem was resolved easily. Furthermore, within the period under consideration the applicant had several meetings with his other lawyers, in particular, with Mr Baru, who also represented him in the proceedings before the Court. The limitation complained of lasted less than three weeks, and nothing suggests that it had any negative effects, theoretical or practical, on the proceedings before the Court. In such circumstances the Court concludes that there has been no breach of Article 34.",

The \u201cpreliminary appeal\u201d against the decision of 26 December 2003 was introduced by the defence lawyer on 29 December 2003. However it did not contain the detailed reasoning since the hearing record has not been yet made available to the defence. The hearing record was signed on 5\u00a0January 2004 but it was not until 14 January that the applicant\u2019s lawyer obtained a copy of it. The comments of the defence had reached the court only on 22 January 2004 and were examined on the same day. Thus, about ten days out of this period can be imputable to the authorities. On 23\u00a0January the defence lawyers submitted a full version of the grounds of appeal. On 5 February 2004 the applicant himself had submitted additional arguments which were received by the court on 6 February 2004. On 9\u00a0February 2004 the Moscow City Court had examined both sets of submissions and dismissed the appeal. Therefore, between 23 January and 9\u00a0February only four days can be attributed to the authorities.",

The Court observed in this connection that in certain instances \u201cthe complexity of ... issues involved in a determination of whether a person should be detained or released can be a factor which may be taken into account when assessing compliance with the Article 5 \u00a7 4 requirements (see, mutatis mutandis, Baranovsky v. Poland [GC], no.28358/95, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2000-III, and Musia\u0142 v. Poland [GC], no.24557/94, \u00a7 43, ECHR 1999-II).",

The court of appeal was supposed to examine the detention order issued by the first-instance court within a procedure of a judicial character. In our view, the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement under Article 5 \u00a7 4 should not apply to the appeal proceedings with the same rigour as to the proceedings before the first instance court. In the circumstances the two weeks which elapsed before the appeal hearing took place did not amount to a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4.",
