In the event of a repetition of the same events, such as an applicant\u2019s placement in convoy cells during transport, even though the applicant was detained there on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions to which he had been routinely subjected also created, in the Court\u2019s view, a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d which brought the entire period complained of within the Court\u2019s competence (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 75-78, with further references). In this respect, the Court finds that the applicants\u2019 detention in cases nos. 36240/08, 16078/10 and 54313/11, as described in the appended table, constituted a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d.",
