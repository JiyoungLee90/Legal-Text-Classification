It is undoubted that the causal link between disputed medical treatment and damage sustained cannot be established by a court unaided. The court must call upon a field of knowledge which is not its own, i.e. \"medical science\", which can only assist the court by means of an expert opinion, and if necessary a second opinion, the process being attended by safeguards provided for in the rules of procedure. It was unfair and even illogical to refuse the applicant an expert opinion, which was the only means of proving the relationship of cause and effect, and to reject his request on the precise ground that he had not established this causal link. It was the more important to appoint an expert as the treatment administered was not the one that had been prescribed and was carried out without the patient\u2019s consent (see paragraph 11 of the judgment).",

However, having regard to the important part played in the Convention system by the right to a fair trial (see, among other authorities, the Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo judgment of 6 December 1988, Series A no. 146, p. 31, para. 68), it is not open to a national court not to order a measure without which the person seeking it would be put at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the opposing party, such that the balance which must prevail in the taking of evidence would be upset. In the instant case the applicant was contending alone against the administrative authorities, despite the requirements of the adversarial principle, so that the only way of restoring the balance was precisely to appoint an expert. Since such a balance was not ensured in the proceedings, there was a breach of the principle of a fair trial under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.",
