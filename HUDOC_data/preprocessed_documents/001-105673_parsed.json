The record of the above examination, which was not made available to the Court, had been considered and relied upon by the domestic court. The applicant was further examined on 19 March 1999 at the medical department of the remand prison upon his admission (see paragraph 27 above) and observed as having large bruises on the back surface of his shoulder and his left thigh. The results of the forensic medical examination subsequently conducted on an unspecified date indicated that the applicant\u2019s injuries had been caused approximately one to one and a half\u00a0weeks prior to his medical examination on 19 March 1999 (that is, between 9 and 12\u00a0March 1999) (see paragraph 33 above).",

It is not surprising that the applicant did not disclose the real cause of his injuries to the doctors of the local trauma unit while still in the presence of the alleged culprits. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that the applicant felt intimidated by the persons he had accused of having ill-treated him (see Nadrosov v. Russia, no.\u00a09297/02, \u00a7 33, 31 July 2008, with further references). The Court must also have regard to the fact that the applicant, in his complaints to the prosecution authorities and later to the domestic courts, was unequivocal in his account that he had been ill-treated by police officers of the Bezhitskiy District police station during his arrest and while in custody. Furthermore, as it appears from the applicant\u2019s submissions, at some point during the criminal proceedings against him, the domestic court questioned his co-workers Mr Zh. and Mr L., who submitted that no exercise had been performed at the fire station on 11 March 1999, so the applicant could not have fallen down a fire escape, and that no traces of injuries had been seen by them on the applicant when he was changing into his uniform before starting his work that day. The Court notes that the Government did not contest that the above persons were questioned by the trial court and made these submissions (see paragraph 32 above).",

The Court, nevertheless, considers it necessary to stress that it has never been argued that the applicant resisted arrest, attempted to escape or did not comply with the lawful orders of the police officers. Furthermore, there is no indication that at any point during his arrest or subsequent detention at the police station he threatened the police officers, for example by openly carrying a weapon or by attacking them (see, by contrast, Necdet Bulut v. Turkey, no. 77092/01, \u00a7 25, 20 November 2007, and Berli\u0144ski v. Poland, nos. 27715/95 and 30209/96, \u00a7 62, 20 June 2002). The Court therefore does not discern any necessity which might have prompted the use of violence against the applicant. It appears that the use of force was retaliatory in nature and was aimed at debasing the applicant and driving him into submission. In addition, the treatment to which the applicant was subjected must have caused him mental and physical suffering, even though it did not apparently result in any long-term damage to his health.",
