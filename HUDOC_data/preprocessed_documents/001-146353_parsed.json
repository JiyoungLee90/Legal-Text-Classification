Citing Gast and Popp v. Germany (no. 29357/95, ECHR 2000II), as well as Klein v. Germany (no. 33379/96, 27 July 2000), the Federal Constitutional Court noted that a chronic backlog of cases in the constitutional courts could not justify the excessive length of proceedings. However, when assessing whether the duration of proceedings was excessive, the Federal Constitutional Court had to consider its special function and position. Unlike the ordinary courts, the capacity and structure of a Constitutional Court were laid down in the Constitution and it served further purposes beyond the administration of individual justice. The scope for adaptation and for the acceleration of proceedings was therefore limited. Furthermore, decisions and judgments of the Federal Constitutional Court had binding inter omnes legal effect and for this reason had to be drafted with the utmost diligence. The court further explained that it was in the nature of constitutional court proceedings that chronological case management was of subordinate importance. Concerning the applicant\u2019s case, the court noted that the actual duration of the proceedings \u2013 four and a half years \u2013 was unusually long, but not excessive. For the purposes of its examination the Federal Constitutional Court noted that three phases could be distinguished: (a) the phase of over one year between the lodging of the constitutional complaint and the decision to await the outcome of the 2007 case; (b) the phase of two years until a decision had been given in the 2007 case; and (c) the phase of eleven months until the constitutional complaint at issue had been determined. A new judge rapporteur had stepped in at the end of his predecessor\u2019s term of office and his predecessor had had to finish cases of higher priority than that of the applicant. The court maintained that the twelve-month wait in accordance with section 97b \u00a71 of the Federal Constitutional Court Act had not been excessive considering that the Federal Constitutional Court had opted to rule on a similar case concerning the pension rights of surviving partners in a civil union (the 2007 case) before the applicant\u2019s case. The court pointed out that, although in hindsight the present case could have been decided without reference to the \u201cpilot case\u201d, the two cases shared sufficient similarities to justify the decision of the former judge rapporteur. Nothing indicated that the decision to postpone the applicant\u2019s case pending a decision on the 2007 case had been based on arbitrary considerations. The court noted that the applicant had never claimed that the sum of money at issue was of extraordinary financial importance to him. In conclusion, the Federal Constitutional Court argued that after the decision in the 2007 case the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint had been determined in due time, without any delay.",

They referred mainly to the reasons given by the Federal Constitutional Court as to why the duration of the proceedings before that court had been unusually long, but not excessive.

They emphasised that the decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court had an impact over and above the individual case and sometimes had the force of law, which required precise drafting for a range of possible situations. Organisational measures to shorten the length of proceedings were moreover subject to structural limitations, because the structure of the Federal Constitutional Court was defined in the Constitution and was difficult to adapt to variable caseloads. The Federal Constitutional Court had taken a sensible approach in the particular case by deciding to designate pilot cases to which priority was given. In the majority of cases this would lead to an earlier decision in the deferred case; in this particular case it had not been obvious that the decision in the pilot case did not cover all the essential aspects. Finally, the Government drew particular attention to the fact that the applicant had not contacted the Federal Constitutional Court between January 2006 and December 2009, when he had pointed to the judgment regarding the pilot case. According to the Government the applicant had waited for nearly four years before showing an interest in his case again.",

The Court further reiterates that the obligation of the courts to proceed with cases in a reasonable time stems directly from the Convention; consequently, the parties to legal proceedings are not obliged to remind the relevant courts of their duties. Before most courts, in particular the highest courts, the parties are usually invited to submit further observations and otherwise are asked to refrain from making submissions unless some circumstances relevant to the case have changed.",

The fact that the case which was given priority later on proved to be irrelevant to the applicant\u2019s case does not change the generally appropriate character of the proceedings.
