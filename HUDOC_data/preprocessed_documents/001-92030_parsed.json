When I was walking between the trees [in one corner of ] I was pushed from behind by people who were running past me and fell to the ground. ... I asked an approaching policeman, who was dressed in a helmet and black uniform and was holding a truncheon and a shield, to help me stand up. Instead of helping me, the policeman hit me over my right eye with the truncheon. I held my eye crying, and when I said to him: \u201cWhat have I done to you that you hit me?\u201d, I saw him raising his arm to hit me again. At this point I felt that some other policemen standing nearby said something to him, and then all of them went away from me. I could not see any rank insignia on their shoulders. I would not be able to recognise the policeman who hit me and the policemen who were near him. It is possible that some of the civilians who were nearby saw [this incident], but I do not know specifically who witnessed it. I stood up by myself and while I was hobbling in the direction of Pharmacy no. 259, an unknown old man took me by the arm and accompanied me to the pharmacy so that I could get medical aid. That man left after we arrived at the pharmacy. The pharmacy was all covered with blood, [and] there were several injured civilians inside. At this point some soldiers approached the pharmacy and started knocking on the window, and a grey-haired old woman who was an employee of the pharmacy [admonished them]. At the same time, when I.G., whom I recognised because he used to be a television journalist, tried to open the door of the pharmacy [from inside], one of the soldiers [who was standing outside] tried to hit him with a truncheon but missed. The reason [I.G. wanted to open the door and go outside] was that he wanted to call an ambulance for the injured... After a while an ambulance took us to a hospital... In the hospital, I received stitches on my wounded eyebrow, and the next day I was transferred to the  Diseases... There I underwent an operation which lasted about 3 hours... However, the surgery did not help and my right eye became completely blind...\u201d",

In particular, her medical records of 16 and 17 October 2003 confirm the allegation that she sustained serious injuries on 16 October 2003 in the course of the disorder at . She also produced two witness statements which directly corroborated her allegation that the injury had resulted from a blow by a police truncheon (see paragraphs 51-52 above), and another statement which indirectly corroborated her allegation and was consistent with her version of the incident (see paragraph 50 above). The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that the statements of A.A. and G.G. were inconsistent with each other and with the applicant\u2019s allegations. Specifically, both of these witnesses clearly and repeatedly stated that they had seen a police officer hit the applicant in her face with a truncheon. In this respect, the Court does not see any contradiction or inconsistency with the main thrust of the applicant\u2019s allegation \u2013 namely, that the injury was inflicted by the police. Even if there are some variations in the witnesses\u2019 recollection of the part of the events that followed the alleged blow by the truncheon, they are not mutually exclusive and are so insignificant that, on their own, they are incapable of rendering these testimonies unreliable and should not affect the overall assessment of evidence. Taking into account the fact that these witnesses testified before the domestic authorities several months after the incident, the Court notes that the passage of time inevitably takes a toll on a witness\u2019s capacity to recall events with great detail and accuracy (compare with \u0130pek v. Turkey, no.\u00a025760/94, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2004II (extracts)). In any event, at no time have these witnesses\u2019 independence and credibility been questioned at the domestic level and it has never been established that any of these witnesses committed perjury in court (see also paragraph 122 below). In such circumstances, the Court finds no reasons why their testimonies should not have been accepted.",

In this connection, the Court notes that Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force in certain well-defined circumstances. However, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Kurnaz and Others, cited above, \u00a7 52, and Ivan Vasilev v. , no. 48130/99, \u00a7 63, 12\u00a0April 2007).

However, certain facts can be discerned to the extent sufficient for the purposes of the analysis in the present case. In particular, it appears that a number of protesters had indeed vandalised public and private property and attacked those police units which had already been deployed in the area. The Court accepts that such behaviour may well quickly degenerate into a riot, necessitating an intervention by the security forces. Nevertheless, it also appears that a number of protesters were uninvolved in the hostilities and did not resist the authorities or engage in other acts of violence. The latter observation is supported by the reports that, out of the estimated thousands of protesters, around 600 were arrested and ultimately around 125 were brought to trial on criminal charges in connection with the violence (see paragraphs 72 and 76-77 above).",

Thus, when the authorities resorted to the use of force, their operation was essentially confined to this limited area of the city. The Court also observes that the operation involved not only riot police, but also military forces. All of them were fully equipped with helmets, shields, truncheons and other special equipment. The authorities were able to deploy them in large numbers (several thousands, according to various reports) within a fairly short period of time. The Court considers that the authorities\u2019 ability to intervene in such a manner required a certain degree of preparation. Moreover, having regard to the fact that some protests and skirmishes between the protesters and the police had already begun on the night before the events of 16 October, the authorities must have had some prior warning of impending difficulties and a possible escalation of violence. It therefore does not appear that the authorities were called upon to react in a completely random and unprepared manner (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2000XII) and should have been able to anticipate any developments and take at least some measures to evaluate and avoid unnecessary risks and to refrain from applying force in an indiscriminate and disorderly manner.",

Therefore, the situation called for a particularly thorough scrutiny of the actions of not only those protesters who acted violently, but also of the law-enforcement authorities. However, in their observations the Government merely stated that force had to be used against the protesters, without providing any explanation or documentation which could shed light on the exact nature and scale of the force used.

In particular, as to the cause of injury, the report stated that it was due to a \u201ctrauma suffered by her\u201d, without explaining the cause of such trauma.

However, the report offered no substantiation for such an answer and left it unsupported by any analysis or argumentation based on forensic science. In the Court\u2019s opinion, such lack of substantiation defeated the very purpose of the forensic examination and rendered its conclusions arbitrary. For these reasons, the Court considers that the Second Forensic Report cannot be regarded as reliable evidence providing a convincing explanation for the applicant\u2019s injuries.",

Moreover, following the initial interrogation by the investigator, the applicant was allegedly unable to participate effectively in the criminal investigation and to submit additional evidence (see also paragraphs 130-31 below). The Court also notes that, as in cases under Article 2 of the Convention, whatever mode or form of investigation is employed at the domestic level in respect of Article 3 complaints, once the matter has come to the attention of the authorities, they must act of their own motion and cannot leave it to the applicant to take responsibility for the conduct of investigatory procedure (see, mutatis mutatis, Gongadze v. , no.\u00a034056/02, \u00a7 175, ECHR 2005XI). In the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that, once the applicant was able to produce additional evidence during the civil proceedings, she brought this matter to the attention of the State. The Court observes that, as admitted by the Goverment, Article 254.1.4 of the CCP required that a civil court must suspend the proceedings if it was impossible to examine the claim prior to completion of the criminal proceedings precluding such examination. Nevertheless, in the present case, the court in fact proceeded with the examination of the claim and delivered a judgment on the merits. Under Article 265.4 of the CCP, if on examination of a civil claim a court disclosed an appearance of criminal elements in the actions of the parties to the case or other persons, it was to deliver a special ruling (x\u00fcsusi q\u0259rardad) informing a public prosecutor thereof. Yet, although the applicant\u2019s civil claim clearly implied that she had been a victim of a criminal offence and whereas the civil court was actually informed that a criminal investigation was pending in connection with the same incident, it failed to comply with its obligations under Articles 254.1.4 and 265.4 of the CCP. No explanation was offered by the Government as to why the civil court had not issued a special ruling in the present case, by means of which the investigation authorities could have been informed, inter alia, about the existence of new witnesses in the case.",

Also, the investigation was dilatory. The State forensic experts took inexplicably lengthy periods of time to conduct the forensic examinations requested by the investigation authorities. Whereas, as shown above, no effective steps had been taken to investigate the circumstances of the incident, it took around nine months before the investigator decided to discontinue the investigation.",

The Court therefore finds that the applicant was not duly informed of this decision. In such circumstances, she was deprived of the possibility to request a court to review the lawfulness of this decision, a means by which she could have challenged, inter alia, the reliability of the two forensic reports and complained about other shortcomings committed by the investigation authorities, including their failure to obtain crucial witness statements.",

Having regard to the applicant\u2019s allegations, corroborated by sufficiently strong and concordant evidence, and in view of the absence of a plausible explanation by the Government, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s injuries resulted from the use of force by the police and, specifically, from her being struck by a truncheon wielded by an unidentified police officer.",

However, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court is solely concerned with whether the force used against the applicant was excessive. In this connection, the Court notes that the Government have not furnished any arguments which would provide a basis to explain or justify the degree of force used against the applicant. There is no evidence showing that the applicant was somehow engaged in any violent behaviour during the demonstration. She was never arrested or prosecuted for resistance to the authorities during the events of 16 October 2003. At the time of the incident, she was trying to leave , in an apparent attempt to avoid danger. There is nothing to indicate that her conduct somehow provoked or made it necessary for the police to use force on her. Accordingly, the force used against the applicant was unnecessary and excessive.",
