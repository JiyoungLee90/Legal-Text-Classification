The case originated in an application (no. 34503/97) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Kemal Demir and Ms Vicdan Baykara, the latter in her capacity as president of the trade union Tüm Bel Sen, (“the applicants”), on 8 October 1996.
The applicants were represented by Mr Ayhan Kızılöz, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
The applicants complained, under Article 11 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 14, that the domestic courts had denied them the right to form a trade union and to enter into collective agreements.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
By a decision of 23 September 2004 the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.
The applicants and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1).
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicants, Kemal Demir and Vicdan Baykara, were born in 1951 and 1958 and live in Gaziantep and  respectively. The first applicant was a member of the trade union Tüm Bel Sen and the second applicant was its president.
The trade union Tüm Bel Sen was founded in 1990 by civil servants from various localities under the Civil Servants Act (Law no. 657). Under Article 2 of its constitution its objective is to promote democratic trade unionism to further the aspirations and claims of its members. Its head office is located in .
On 27 February 1993 Tüm Bel Sen entered into a collective agreement with Gaziantep Municipal Council for a period of two years from 1 January 1993. The agreement concerned all aspects of the working conditions of Gaziantep Municipal Council’s employees, including salaries, allowances and welfare services.
As the Municipal Council had defaulted on certain of its obligations under the agreement, in particular those of a financial nature, the first applicant, as a representative of the union, brought civil proceedings against it in the Gaziantep District Court (the “District Court”) on 18 June 1993.
In a judgment of 22 June 1994 the District Court found in favour of Tüm Bel Sen. Gaziantep Municipal Council appealed on points of law.
On 13 December 1994 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the court below. It found that, even though there was no legal bar preventing civil servants from forming unions, they were not, as the law stood, authorised to enter into collective agreements.
In a judgment of 28 March 1995 the District Court confirmed its earlier judgment on the ground that, despite the fact that the domestic statute contained no express provision affording unions formed by civil servants the right to enter into collective agreements, this omission had to be remedied in the light of international treaties such as the relevant convention of the International Labour Organisation, which had already been ratified by Turkey.
On 6 December 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the court below. It ruled that, at the time the union was formed, the applicable law did not permit civil servants to form trade unions. The union Tüm Bel Sen could not rely on the international labour conventions that dealt with such matters as they had not yet been incorporated into domestic law and no implementing legislation had been enacted. The Court of Cassation concluded that the union did not have legal personality or the capacity to enter into a collective agreement.
An application for rectification lodged by representatives of the union was dismissed by the Court of Cassation on 10 April 1996.
Following an audit of Gaziantep Municipal Council’s accounts by the , the State asked the members of the union Tüm Bel Sen to reimburse the additional income they had purportedly received as a result of the defunct collective agreement.
