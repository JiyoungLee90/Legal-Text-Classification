The case originated in an application (no. 49185/13) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Portuguese national, Mr Abílio Correia Mendes (“the applicant”), on 30 July 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Alves, a lawyer practising in Braga (Portugal). The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. F. da Graça Carvalho, Deputy-Attorney General.
On 1 October 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Barcelos (Portugal).
On 21 September 2007 the applicant lodged a request to be granted permanent disability with respect to work before the Public Prosecutor of the Barcelos Labour Court as a consequence of a labour accident that he had suffered (domestic proceedings no. 697/07.0TTBCL).
Following the applicant’s request, the Public Prosecutor initiated the conciliatory stage of the proceedings with a view to an agreement between the parties.
On 12 February 2008 the applicant was submitted to a medical examination in accordance with a Public Prosecutor’s order. After the examination, other medical specialty exams were requested by the Public Prosecutor.
The hearing with a view to the agreement took place on 19 January and continued on 26 February 2009. On this date the conciliatory stage ended without an agreement between the parties.
On 18 March 2009 the applicant requested the Barcelos Labour Court to continue with the judicial stage of the proceedings against the insurance company and his employer.
Between 12 May 2009 and 18 April 2010 several procedural steps took place, mostly notifications, a preliminary hearing, medical examinations and provision of information from the parties and others to the Labour Court.
The hearing started on 7 May 2010 and continued on 11 and 18 October 2010.
On 16 November 2010 the Barcelos Labour Court delivered its decision, which was challenged by the applicant’s employer.
On 30 January 2012 the Court of Appeal adopted its decision. The applicant appealed against it.
On 30 January 2013 the proceedings ended with the judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice.
At the material time, Article 26 of the Code of Labour Procedure provided:
 “Actions emerging from labour accidents and from occupational diseases are of an urgent nature (...)”
