Turkey, 22 October 1997, \u00a7 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI). Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling the suspicions which provide the grounds for the detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300A). However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. The fact that a suspicion is held in good faith is insufficient. The words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d mean the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 182, and Cebotari v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 35615/06, \u00a7 48, 13 November 2007).",

In particular, the first-instance court relied on the applicant\u2019s failure to comply with the investigator\u2019s requests without any good reason (see paragraph 17 above). Although the applicant disputed that finding, stating that he had always cooperated with the investigation, it appears from the facts of the case that the applicant did fail to comply with some of the investigator\u2019s requests (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 13 above). In these circumstances, the Court accepts that the existence of a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed serious criminal offences and the fact that he had failed to comply with some of the investigator\u2019s requests may have initially sufficed to warrant his detention. However, with the passage of time those grounds inevitably became less and less relevant and his continued detention had to be justified by other relevant reasons, taking into account his personal situation.",

The applicant was not charged with new criminal offences until 15 April 2005, almost four months after the extension order. Moreover, the Court does not see how the need to decide the issue of the involvement of other persons in the crimes could be considered a relevant reason for the continuation of the applicant\u2019s detention. Therefore, the reasons provided by the first-instance court in its decision of 23 December 2004 for the applicant\u2019s continued detention for a period of two months were irrelevant, as they justified his detention with reference to criminal offences with which he had not even been charged, and suspected criminal offences involving other persons (see Muradverdiyev, cited above, \u00a7 88).",

It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints, and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Akdivar and Others v.

In such circumstances, the Court concludes that the applicant availed himself of all the available domestic remedies in respect of his complaint concerning the absence of his lawyer at the hearing of 23 December 2004 and therefore the Government\u2019s objection must be dismissed.",

This means that the competent court has to examine not only compliance with the procedural requirements of domestic law but also the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest, and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention (see Brogan and Others, cited above, \u00a7 65). Although it is not always necessary for the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 to be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 162). The possibility for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see Kampanis v. Greece, 13\u00a0July 1995, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 318B).",

As to court decisions ordering or extending detention, Article 5 \u00a7 4 guarantees no right, as such, to an appeal against those decisions, but the intervention of a judicial body at least at one level of jurisdiction must comply with the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see, mutatis mutandis, J\u0117\u010dius v.

The Court wishes in this regard to draw attention to the decision of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of 3\u00a0November 2009, which clearly established that the examination of requests for the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody or for the extension of the detention period in the absence of the accused was allowed only in exceptional circumstances, and the presence of the person whose rights were affected was compulsory at the hearing (see paragraph 37 above). However, there is nothing in the material before the Court to suggest that either the Khatai District Court or the Court of Appeal considered the question whether the applicant had been summoned to the hearing and whether his personal participation was required for the effective review of the lawfulness of his continued detention (see Idalov v.

However, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the presence of the applicant\u2019s lawyers at that hearing remedied any shortcomings in the proceedings before the first-instance court. While the Court usually examines the proceedings as a whole, this rule is not without exceptions, especially in the case of pre-trial detention. Thus, the Court notes that the detention order of 23 December 2004 became effective immediately and it was the only legal basis for the applicant\u2019s continued detention after 28\u00a0December 2004. Therefore, even if the Court of Appeal ultimately heard the applicant\u2019s lawyers on 6 January 2005, by that time the applicant had already spent nine days in detention since 28 December 2004. Given that lapse of time, the Court cannot accept such a retroactive validation of the procedurally flawed detention order issued by the Khatai District Court. The Court concludes that the presence of the defence lawyers before the Court of Appeal did not remedy the defects of the procedure before the Khatai District Court (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 90, 25 October 2007).",
