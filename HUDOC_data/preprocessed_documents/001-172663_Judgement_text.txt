The case originated in ten applications (nos. 36821/11, 37656/11, 37661/11, 37740/11, 37866/11, 38636/11, 38885/11, 41066/11, 42345/11 and 42360/11) against the Republic of Azerbaijan lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by ten Azerbaijani nationals, Mr Arzu Habib oglu Samadbayli, Mr Yagub Mahammad oglu Babali, Ms Leyla Ilgar qizi Mustafayeva, Mr Soltanhamid Hilal oglu Malikov, Mr Ali Amirhuseyn oglu Kerimli, Mr Giyas Boyukaga oglu Sadigov, Ms Sitara Mehdi qizi Zeynalova, Mr Panah Chodar oglu Huseyn, Mr Adil Abulfat oglu Geybulla, and Mr Isa Yunis oglu Gambar (“the applicants”), on various dates in 2011.
The applicants were represented by Mr I. Aliyev, a lawyer practising in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Asgarov.
On 15 October 2013 (application no. 36821/11), on 18 November 2013 (applications nos. 37656/11, 37661/11, 37740/11, 37866/11, 38636/11 and 38885/11) and on 9 December 2013 (applications nos. 41066/11, 42345/11 and 42360/11) the applications were communicated to the Government. The applicants and the Government each submitted written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case. Observations were also received from the International Commission of Jurists (the ICJ), to whom the President had given leave to intervene as a third party in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3 of the Rules of Court).
The applicants’ years of birth and places of residence are listed in the Appendix.
The circumstances of the case are similar to those in Gahramanli and Others v. Azerbaijan (no. 36503/11, §§ 6-32, 8 October 2015).
The applicants were independent self-nominated or opposition candidates in the parliamentary elections of 7 November 2010 (see Appendix). All the applicants lost the elections in their respective constituencies.
After election day, the applicants lodged complaints with the Central Electoral Commission (“the CEC”) concerning a number of irregularities in their respective constituencies that had allegedly taken place during and/or before election day. Some of them also lodged identical complaints with the respective Constituency Electoral Commissions (“the ConECs”). They complained about various types of irregularities, including interference by public officials, illegal campaigning, obstruction and intimidation of election observers, ballot-box stuffing, repeated voting by the same individuals, irregularities in applying election ink, incorrect vote-counting procedures, inconsistencies in precinct election results records indicating a falsely inflated voter turnout, and so on. In support of their allegations, the applicants submitted various types of evidence documenting specific instances of the irregularities complained of, including statements made by election observers, video recordings and photographs.
The applicants who lodged a complaint with the respective ConECs did not receive any reply from them (except in applications nos. 36821/11, 37656/11, 37740/11, 41066/11 and 42360/11). All of the applicants’ complaints were examined by the CEC which, on various dates (see Appendix), issued decisions rejecting the applicants’ claims, providing reasoning similar to that in the CEC decision in Gahramanli and Others (cited above, §§ 21-26).
The applicants lodged further complaints with the Baku Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court which, on various dates (see Appendix), dismissed the applicants’ appeals, providing reasoning similar to that in their respective decisions in Gahramanli and Others (cited above, §§ 2732).
In the meantime, however ‒ and before the Supreme Court delivered its final decision concerning each complaint (except in application no. 42345/11) ‒ on 29 November 2010 the Constitutional Court confirmed the countrywide election results, including the election results in the applicants’ constituencies, as final (ibid., § 30).
At the material time Mr Intigam Aliyev was representing not only the applicants in the present cases, but a total of twentyseven other applicants in cases concerning the 2010 parliamentary elections and a number of applicants in other cases before the Court.
On 8 August 2014 criminal proceedings were instituted against Mr I. Aliyev, these being the subject of a separate application brought by him before the Court (application no. 68762/14). On 8 and 9 August 2014 the investigation authorities seized a large number of documents from Mr I. Aliyev’s office, including all the case files relating to the proceedings pending before the Court which were in Mr Aliyev’s possession, comprising over 100 applications in total. The files relating to the present applications were also seized in their entirety. The facts relating to the seizure and the relevant proceedings are described in more detail in Annagi Hajibeyli v. Azerbaijan (no. 2204/11, §§ 21-28, 22 October 2015).
On 25 October 2014 the investigation authorities returned a number of the case files concerning the applications lodged before the Court, including the files relating to the present applications, to Mr Aliyev’s lawyer.
The relevant domestic law and international documents concerning inter alia the system of electoral commissions and procedures for examination of electoral disputes, as well as observations made during the 2010 parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan, are summarised in Gahramanli and Others (cited above, §§ 33-50).
