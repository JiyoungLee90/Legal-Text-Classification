This was followed up by the 1963 Act on the Exploration and Exploitation of Sub-Sea Natural Resources \u2013 the Continental Shelf Act 1963 (kontinentalsokkelloven). Drilling in the North Sea area started in June 1966. In this connection diving operations were carried out in part in sheltered waters from barges and smaller boats, for example in relation to the construction and equipment of drilling platforms, and in part in the open sea. During the first years the depths involved were not particularly great. In the Ekofisk oilfield the sea was approximately seventy metres deep, and in the Statfjord oilfield it was approximately 150 metres. To begin with, diving took place from oil rigs, supply ships, drilling ships or pipe-laying ships. From the mid-1970s specially built diving support vessels, operational regardless of weather conditions, were used, and after a while became the usual means.",

The diving bell would be lowered into the water and down to the work location on the seabed.

When the job had been completed the diver would return to the diving bell. Then the diving bell would be lifted to the surface and connected to a decompression chamber, where the divers would complete their decompression. Heliox would normally be replaced by air when the diving bell pressure was similar to the water pressure, at fifty metres. Generally, bounce diving was perceived as stressful, because divers had little time to do the job on the seabed and felt thermal unease (first the increased temperature when the diving bell was put under pressure, and then hypothermia when entering the water, which was five to seven degrees Celsius).",

The divers and the diving bell would be supplied by gas from the surface. The divers would normally wear warm water suits supplied with warm water from the surface. It normally took several hours from the time the diving bell left the chamber at the surface until it was reconnected. Subsequently, the divers were locked back into the chamber. This way of diving ensured continuous work on the seabed, while the divers could rest, sleep and eat in the chamber. After a period of work of several days or weeks, the divers were decompressed.",

On 13 June 2000 Parliament requested the Government to set up an independent commission of inquiry to assess all matters related to diving in connection with oil activities in the North Sea during the pioneer period. The Commission of Inquiry, which the Government had appointed on 2\u00a0March 2001, was led by High Court Justice Mr P.A. Lossius. On 31\u00a0December 2002 it presented its report, entitled `The Pioneer Divers in the North Sea (Pionerdykkerne i Nordsj\u00f8en), Norges Offentlige Utredninger (\u201cNOU\u201d Official Norwegian Report) 2003:5\u2019. The Commission considered that the State had strict legal liability, and should therefore bear the financial responsibility for compensation for injuries sustained by divers as a result of diving in the North Sea and for disorders that they might develop. It recommended the establishment of a State-funded compensation scheme to cover their financial losses, and that licensees and operators should be invited to participate in funding the scheme.

After an average of about 14 years in the North Sea, the majority are in a satisfactory state of health based on the information they have supplied. However, a relatively high proportion have acquired appreciable health problems, illustrated by the fact that almost one-fifth are disabled, and that a number of divers complain of concentration, memory and hearing impairments. The same symptoms are documented in Norwegian and foreign investigations alike. It seems probable that the extreme stress to which many North Sea divers have been exposed at work has been a significant factor behind the disorders that a number of them have developed. \u201c",

The main issue here is the ascent speeds indicated in the tables and the use of increased O2 content in the breathing gas in order to reduce the ascent time. The time factor is important since the purpose of the table is to bring the diver up to normal pressure without injuries, while prolonged decompression can be very uncomfortable for the diver. In the case of commercial diving in the North Sea, the time factor was moreover a competition factor between the diving companies. Diving contracts were often awarded to the company with the most rapid tables. Regard for the health of the divers thus ran counter to strong commercial interests. This issue [problemstilling] was well known to the oil companies, the diving companies, the divers themselves, diving doctors and the Norwegian authorities.",

The situation was not helped by persistent rumours that divers had suffered serious and permanent memory impairment and personality changes as a result of their employment as divers.

It was therefore unnecessary to point to which parts of the activity had led to unfortunate consequences for each plaintiff.",

He maintained that, regardless of whether there had been any negligence, the State was liable to pay him compensation on the ground that these acts or failure to act had been in breach of the applicable rules requiring that diving take place in a safe manner (Article 121 of the Royal Decree of 25\u00a0August 1967). As an alternative, he submitted that regardless of whether the said acts or failure to act had been unlawful, they had involved a failure on the part of the State to comply with its obligations under Articles 2, 3, 8, and 14 of the Convention. As a further alternative, Mr Vilnes argued that the legal framework as such had entailed a violation of the Convention. In a further submission he stated that the State had been liable as an employer under section 2-1 of the 1969 Damage Compensation Act. Also in this context he cited the Convention. Finally, he argued that the State had been responsible on grounds of strict liability for the damage he had sustained from the diving operations. In his grounds of appeal he put forward a number of arguments, including \u201clack of information from the State\u201d while referring to the arguments he had put before the High Court.",

In 1983 the Norwegian authorities had taken the initiative to hold a conference in Stavanger in order to discuss the existence of undesirable medical consequences of deep sea diving. American, British and French specialists in diving medicine had held that diving in accordance with the regulations was safe, whilst others, including Norwegian researchers, had not been convinced of this. At a consensus conference held ten years later in God\u00f8ysund the position had been largely the same, with a leaning towards the possibility that it might cause neurological and psychiatric after-effects. In 2002 the Lossius Commission had concluded that there was no clear evidence that could answer the question. On the evidence, the High Court had found it established that it was widely believed that diving did not have serious long-term effects in the absence of decompression sickness. Where such illness had only involved temporary pain, notably after treatment in a compression chamber, the condition had also been regarded as relatively risk-free. It appeared that decompression sickness had been regarded as a part of diving, an inconvenience to be avoided but one which had to be accepted. It had been treated with recompression and this treatment had been regarded as all that was necessary (NOU 2003:5, p. 76).",

According to the regulations, all applications for dispensation had to include a statement from the divers\u2019 representative and diving physician that the proposal had been considered and found to be in order.

When drilling for oil in the North Sea started, bounce diving tables developed by the US Navy were utilised. The Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority did not have access to tables for saturation diving, and in late 1972 took the initiative to develop their own, Norwegian tables. A German research institution was contacted, but the work was difficult, see in more detail NOU 2003:5, pages 74-76. In 1984, the Petroleum Directorate expressed concern regarding the variations in the tables and announced a revision.

Adequate measures would have included the harmonising of decompression tables, the provision of on-the-spot medical assistance during diving operations, requirements for diving competence and other professional competence and technical expertise, the availability of real means of evacuation, proper maintenance of equipment, fewer dispensations being given and further legislative and licensing measures being taken.

The case under consideration differed significantly from previous cases concerning the existence of a duty on the part of the State to provide information. Whilst McGinley and Egan and Roche (both cited above), had concerned the duty to provide information after the occurrence of health hazards, the instant case concerned a claim that the information should have been provided to individuals prior to their agreeing to carry out the professional activities in question. A further distinguishing feature was that the State\u2019s involvement in the relevant activities had been confined to being a regulator and supervisor on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The divers had not been in the employment of the Norwegian Government but had been employed, or had engaged themselves, in private ventures. To establish a duty for the authorities to actively ensure that an occupational group, prior to undertaking its work tasks, be informed about factors that could be relevant for assessing the health risks potentially involved in their private enterprise, would be to stretch the extent of positive obligations under the Convention way too far. The existing standard on access to information enunciated in Roche (cited above, \u00a7 160), requiring the establishment of \u201can effective and accessible procedure\u201d enabling the persons concerned \u201cto seek all relevant and appropriate information\u201d had clearly been complied with in the applicants\u2019 case.",

When the diving had taken place, uncertainty had prevailed as to the injuries that later materialised. The view that many deep sea dives could lead to neurological injuries had emerged gradually. Even when the Lossius Commission had produced its report at the end of 2002, it concluded that well controlled research on later and delayed effects was missing (NOU\u00a02003:5, p. 43). Under these circumstances, the divers could not be regarded as having accepted the risk of after-effects that were unknown to them. (see paragraph 145 above). The Supreme Court also stated that since under the applicable regulations it had been the task of the authorities to consider whether the diving could be carried out in a safe manner, they had been actively involved in the matter and had been in a position to prevent a given diving operation from taking place (see paragraph 147 (b) above). At the same time, regard ought to be had to the knowledge possessed at the material time \u2013 an assessment of liability ought not to be based on hindsight \u2013 and the fact that, as already mentioned, diving was in itself a risky activity, especially deep-sea diving related to the development of oilfields (see paragraph 147 (c) above).",

It observes that the High Court found that Mr Vilnes\u2019 decompression sickness in 1977 had most likely been caused by the facts that the diving company had used too rapid a decompression table and there was no medical doctor who could assist him. This incident had probably been a strong contributory cause of his brain and spinal injuries (see paragraph 139 above). Mr Muledal, Mr Lindahl, Mr\u00a0Sigurdur\u00a0P.\u00a0Hafsteinsson, Mr Nesdal and Mr Jakobsen all submitted specialist medical statements indicating that they had suffered from various forms of bends (see paragraphs 39, 40, 43, 48, 51, 65 And 71 above). Mr\u00a0Nyg\u00e5rd, whose grievances mainly focussed on accidents and nearaccidents, as did the relevant medical expert statement, also described experiences of decompression sickness when seeking compensation at the national level (see paragraph 62 above), and the Court accepts his account. All seven applicants furnished evidence of disability, including medical evidence and the grant of disability pensions (see paragraphs 41, 46, 51, 53, 57, 62, 68, 70, 75 above). The Court, having regard to the parties\u2019 arguments in the light of the material submitted, finds a strong likelihood that the applicants\u2019 health had significantly deteriorated as a result of decompression sickness, amongst other factors. This state of affairs had presumably been caused by the use of too-rapid decompression tables. In this regard it cannot but note that, as observed by the Supreme Court, standardised tables had not been achieved until 1990, following a project financed by the Petroleum Directorate, and that decompression sickness had since then become an extremely rare occurrence. Thus, with hindsight at least, it seems probable that had the authorities intervened to forestall the use of rapid decompression tables earlier, they would have succeeded in removing more rapidly what appears to have been a major cause of excessive risk to the applicants\u2019 safety and health in the present case.",

In the Court\u2019s view, this obligation may in certain circumstances also encompass a duty to provide such information, as can be inferred from the concluding paragraph 60 (concerning Article 8) in Guerra and Others, (cited above) and the affirmation of the \u201cpublic\u2019s right to information\u201d with reference to the latter in the context of Article 2 (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7 90, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 132). It does not follow from the foregoing that this right ought to be confined, as suggested by the Government, to information concerning risks that have already materialised.

Thus, the question arises whether, in view of the practices related to the use of rapid decompression tables, the divers received the essential information needed to be able to assess the risk to their health (see Guerra and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57 to 60, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7 90, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 132) and whether they had given informed consent to the taking of such risks.

As observed by the Supreme Court (while making reference to pp. 74-76 (section 5.7.4) of the Lossius Report), \u201cthe Labour Inspection Authority did not have access to tables for saturation diving and in late 1972 took the initiative to develop their own Norwegian tables\u201d (see paragraph 147 (h) above). Moreover, in section 5.7.4 of the said report it was stated that \u201cthe Norwegian authorities gradually gained access to decompression tables for saturation diving [emphasis added]\u201d (see paragraph 83 [14] above). The High Court noted that under certain provisions of the 1978 Regulation (Article 3.4 (1) in conjunction with Article 3(k) of its Appendix), the Petroleum Directorate could demand the production of the diving table used in a given diving operation (see paragraphs 128 and 168 above). The High\u00a0Court commented in response to this that whether it was safe to use a table should have formed part of the basis for authorising a diving operation, and that it did not seem reassuring that tables had not been reviewed because employees of the Petroleum Directorate had not understood them (see paragraph 128 above).",

It seems that the diving companies were left with little accountability vis-\u00e0-vis the authorities, and were allowed to deal with the tables as their business secrets and thus enjoyed for a considerable period a wide latitude in opting for decompression tables that offered competitive advantages serving their own business interests. According to the Lossius Report (section 5.7.4), regard for divers\u2019 health thus ran counter to strong commercial interests, and this issue was well known to the oil companies, the diving companies, divers themselves, diving doctors and the Norwegian authorities (see paragraphs 83 above). The relevant supervisory authorities were aware that the diving companies kept the tables confidential for competitive reasons (see paragraphs 111 to 112 of the Supreme Court judgment quoted at paragraph 147 (k) above).",

As regards the effects of diving, the Supreme Court reiterated that it had been known that sudden changes in pressure could have a great impact on the body (and, as pointed out by the High Court, those effects could in the worst cases be life-threatening) but there had been less knowledge about the long-term effects. At a consensus conference in  in 1983, American, British and French specialists in diving medicine had held that diving in accordance with the regulations had been safe. Others, including Norwegian researchers, had not been convinced of this (see paragraph 147 (f) above). At the consensus conference held ten years later at God\u00f8ysund the position was largely the same, with a leaning towards the possibility that diving under these conditions might have neurological and psychiatric after-effects. In 2002 the Lossius Commission had concluded that there was no clear evidence that could answer the question (ibid.). The Supreme Court noted that on the evidence the High Court had found it established that it was widely believed that diving did not have serious long-term effects in the absence of decompression sickness. Where such illness only involved temporary pain, notably after treatment in a compression chamber, the condition had also been regarded as relatively risk-free. It appeared that decompression sickness had been regarded as a part of diving, an inconvenience to be avoided but one which had to be accepted. It had been treated with recompression and this treatment had been regarded as final (NOU 2003:5, p. 76) (ibid.). The Court sees no reason to call this assessment into doubt. In similar vein, it appreciates that scientific research into the matter not only required considerable investment but was also very complex and timeconsuming (see paragraphs 85 to 88 above).",

This the authorities could have done when, for example, granting authorisation of diving operations and upon inspections. Had they done so they might conceivably have helped to eliminate sooner the use of rapid tables as a means for companies to promote their own commercial interests, potentially adding to the risks to divers\u2019 health and safety.

The anxiety and stress caused by the uncertainty as to what he had been exposed to had such an impact on his present private life that Article 8 was applicable. A violation of the procedural aspect of that provision was found as the State had failed to provide an effective and accessible procedure enabling him to have access to all relevant and appropriate information which would allow him to assess any risk to which he had been exposed (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 161 to 162).

It follows from the case-law of the Court that when the authorities know or ought to have known of a real and immediate risk to life, they have a positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to take such preventive measures as are necessary and sufficient to protect those individuals whose lives are endangered (see, among other authorities, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7 101). In a number of judgments the term \u201creal and immediate risk\u201d is used when considering the scope of the State\u2019s obligations under Article 2 in different circumstances (see, among other authorities, Osman v.

The circumstances in those cases were similar in that they concerned disastrous events; a methane gas explosion on a waste collection site, a mudslide and a flood, respectively. As a common denominator the authorities had remained passive and failed to do anything to protect exposed individuals, not even to inform them about the imminent risk to their lives. In all those cases it was evident from the assessments made of the authorities\u2019 passivity that they had been aware of the inherent risks and that they were much to blame.",

In brief, that case concerned the operation of a chemical factory classified by the authorities as \u201chigh risk\u201d according to the criteria set out in the \u201cSeveso\u201d directive. In the course of its production cycle, the factory had released large amounts of flammable gas and other toxic substances, including arsenic trioxide. The emissions had often been channelled towards the applicants\u2019 village nearby. Moreover, in 1976 150 people had been hospitalised on account of acute arsenic poisoning caused by an explosion in the factory (ibid., \u00a7 57). The direct effect of the toxic emissions on the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private and family life meant that Article 8 was applicable and a violation was found. The Court in particular emphasised that \u201cthe applicants waited, right up until the production of fertilisers ceased in 1994, for essential information that would have enabled them to assess the risks they and their families might run if they continued to live at Manfredonia, a town particularly exposed to danger in the event of an accident in the factory\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 60).",

Access to the tables therefore would probably have been of limited use for the divers (see in this respect paragraph 184).
