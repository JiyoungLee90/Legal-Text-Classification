It recalls in this connection that questions relating to the applicability of Article 10 and the existence of interferences, the latter forming part of the merits of the relevant complaints, are often inextricably linked (see Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, \u00a7\u00a7 71 and 117, 8 November 2016, and also, as regards the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention, see Denisov v.\u00a0Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, \u00a7 92, 25 September 2018). As it has previously explained in the latter case concerning Article 8, since the question of applicability is an issue of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction ratione materiae, as a general rule the relevant analysis should be carried out at the admissibility stage, unless there is a particular reason to join this question to the merits (ibid., \u00a7 93). In the present case, the Court considers that the significance of the fact that the first and second applicants were able to finalise their journalistic investigation for the purposes of which they had requested access to certain court decisions is closely linked with the question of whether there has been an interference with their rights under Article 10 of the Convention. More importantly, the present case raises a novel issue at domestic level and is one of the first cases following the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g to test the limits to the right of access to information recognized in that judgment in certain circumstances and the applicability of Article 10 of the Convention in that regard. Accordingly, the Court decides to join the Government\u2019s objection to the merits of application no. 44920/09. Furthermore, it decides to examine the question of applicability of Article 10 of the Convention together with that pertaining to the existence of interference under this provision on the merits of the present cases. That decision, however, does not detract from the general rule, referenced above, according to which issues relating to the applicability of Article 10 will normally fall to be examined in most cases at the admissibility stage.",

Hungary ([GC], no. 18030/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0156170, 8\u00a0November 2016), first argued that their inability to have access to the relevant court decisions had constituted an interference with the exercise of their right to freedom of expression. They explained that they had sought access to the criminal case material because they believed that the person who had come forward as the victim in those criminal proceedings had, in actual fact, been an agent provocateur, and they had, at the material time, been working on a documentary exposing police misconduct. Acknowledging the fact that they had been able to finalise their journalistic investigation even in the absence of the solicited information (see paragraph\u00a013 above and paragraph 36 below), the two applicants argued that the disclosure of that information would have allowed them to deliver an even better journalistic product. The first and second applicants argued that the relevant judicial authority\u2019s refusal to grant them access to information of interest to them had been unlawful because the criminal case material had related not to an ongoing criminal case but one which had already been terminated. They claimed that since the Special Investigative Activities Act did not apply to closed criminal cases, section 5 should not have been relied on as the legal basis for withholding public information from them. The two applicants further argued that the interference with their right to receive information had not pursued any legitimate aim and had been disproportionate. Thus, with respect to those elements, the applicants argued, among other things, that since the criminal case material had already been examined openly and publicly in court, its non-disclosure could not possibly serve the interests of protecting either a State secret or personal data about the parties to the proceedings.",

He stated that he had not deemed it necessary to indicate to the domestic judicial authority the purpose of his request for access to the relevant court decisions because it was his understanding that the right enshrined in Article 37 \u00a7 1 of the General Administrative Code meant that public authorities were under an absolute obligation to divulge information held in their possession. He further stated that since all six of the criminal cases about which he had requested information had been directed against former high-ranking State officials, who had all been wellknown public figures, prosecuted for various corruption offences, the public had had the right to know all the details about those high-profile criminal proceedings. The third applicant further claimed that, generally speaking, full access to decisions issued by domestic courts promoted the general principles of transparency and accountability. Lastly, he claimed, in line with the first and second applicants\u2019 submissions, that the interference with his right to receive information under Article 10 of the Convection had been unlawful and disproportionate.",

Referring the Court to the web address of the video in question, the Government noted that it had already had more than thirty-seven thousand views, which could be taken as proof that the applicants had been successful in their investigation and that, consequently, there could be no room for suspecting that the State had interfered with their freedom of expression. Furthermore, the Government emphasised that the reply of the Khashuri District Court\u2019s registry had not been absolute but conditional.

Whether and to what extent the denial of access to information constitutes an interference with an applicant\u2019s freedomofexpression rights must be assessed in each individual case and in the light of its particular circumstances (see Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0156-57). In order to determine whether Article 10 can be said to apply to a public authority\u2019s refusal to disclose information, the situation must be assessed in the light of the following criteria: (a)\u00a0the purpose of the information request; (b)\u00a0the nature of the information sought; (c)\u00a0the particular role of the seeker of the information in \u201creceiving and imparting\u201d it to the public; and (d)\u00a0whether the information was ready and available (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015770).",

This is because they failed to specify, in the relevant domestic proceedings, the purpose of their request for permission to consult the criminal case file. They never explained to the relevant court registry why the documents were necessary for the exercise of their freedom to receive and impart information to others\u00a0(see paragraph\u00a06 above, and contrast Cang\u0131 v. Turkey, no.\u00a024973/15, \u00a7\u00a032, 29\u00a0January 2019). Noting that omission, the domestic authority explicitly invited the applicants to address that gap by clarifying the purpose of their request. What is more, the authority expressed its readiness to reconsider its initial refusal upon receipt of the requisite information from the applicants. The latter, however, ignored that opportunity and instead decided to sue the authority for breaching their alleged right to have unrestricted access to State-held information of public interest (see paragraphs 7 and 8\u00a0above, and compare Sioutis v. Greece (dec.), no. 16393/14, \u00a7 27, 29 August 2017, and also, mutatis mutandis, Bubon v. Russia, no. 63898/09, \u00a7\u00a047, 7\u00a0February 2017). However, it should be restated in this connection that Article 10 of the Convention does not confer on individuals an absolute right to access Stateheld information (see Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0156).",

Thus, even without waiting for the outcome of the relevant proceedings which they themselves had initiated against the domestic judicial authority, they finalised the investigation and made its results accessible to the public (see paragraphs 13, 29 and 36 above). In other words, it can be inferred from the particular circumstances of the case at hand that the access sought by the first and second applicants to the relevant criminal case material was not instrumental for the effective exercise of their freedom-of-expression rights (see Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0159, and contrast Cang\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 34). Indeed, the second applicant acknowledged herself before the domestic court that she, as a journalist, had not needed the information for the purposes of her journalistic activities and that it had been merely a matter of principle for her to obtain judicial acknowledgement of what she considered to be her unfettered right to have access to State-held public information (see again paragraph\u00a013\u00a0above). As regards the first and second applicants\u2019 argument regarding the correlation between the disclosure of the information of interest to them and the quality of their ultimate journalistic product (see paragraph 34 above), the Court observes that they have never voiced any similar argument before the domestic courts.",

                                                "content": "42.\u00a0\u00a0As regards application no. 8942/10, it should be noted that the third applicant, like the first and second applicants, did not take the trouble to explain to the relevant court registry the purpose of his request to obtain a full copy of the relevant court decisions (see paragraph 16 above), which makes it impossible for the Court to accept that the information sought was instrumental for the exercise of his freedom-of-expression rights (contrast Cang\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 34). Most importantly, it is unclear how the third applicant\u2019s role in society was supposed to satisfy the relevant criterion under Article 10 of the Convention. Thus, the Court observes that the third applicant was neither a journalist nor a representative of a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 35). He did not clarify in the proceedings before the Court how he could enhance, by receiving a copy of detention orders in six criminal cases totally unrelated to him, the public\u2019s access to news or facilitate the dissemination of information in the interest of public governance (compare Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016468, and Sioutis, cited above, \u00a7 31). Nor is the Court persuaded that the information solicited from the domestic judicial authority by the third applicant met the relevant publicinterest test under Article 10 of the Convention (see Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g, cited above, \u00a7 161). While acknowledging the significance of the principle that court decisions are to be pronounced publicly and should be, in some form, made accessible to the public in the interest of the good administration of justice and transparency (see, for instance, Fazliyski v. Bulgaria, no. 40908/05, \u00a7 64-66, 16\u00a0April 2013), the Court restates that the requirement that the information sought meet a public-interest test in order to prompt a need for disclosure under Article 10 of the Convention is different, as it refers to the specific subjectmatter of the document, in this case of the judicial orders (compare Sioutis, the decision cited above, \u00a7 29, and \u00d6sterreichische Vereinigung zur Erhaltung, St\u00e4rkung und Schaffung v. Austria, no. 39534/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03536 and\u00a046, 28 November 2013). In that connection, that is as regards the question of whether or not the specific subject-matter of the solicited documents involved public-interest considerations, the applicant limited his arguments to mentioning that the solicited judicial decisions concerned high-profile criminal cases instituted against former high-ranking State officials for corruption offences (see paragraph 35 above). However, the Court considers that the fact that the accused in those cases were wellknown public figures was not in itself sufficient to justify, under Article\u00a010, disclosure of a full copy of the relevant judicial orders concerning the ongoing criminal proceedings, including the parts which did not constitute public information according to the domestic law applicable at the material time (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above), to a third party acting in a purely private capacity (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Sioutis, the decision cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 29 and 30). Indeed, the public interest is hardly the same as an audience\u2019s curiosity (compare, mutatis mutandis, Magyar\u00a0Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0162).",
