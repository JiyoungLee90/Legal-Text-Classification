It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Selmouni v.

There is no suggestion that it was inefficiency of the bailiff\u2019s service which prevented the enforcement of the judgment at issue. In fact, the Government conceded that the delays in enforcement of the judgment concerned had been caused by circumstances beyond the bailiff\u2019s control. Apparently, the reason for the delay was the lack of funds. The Court therefore finds that an action against the bailiff\u2019s service would not have enhanced the applicant\u2019s prospects of receiving her award. The Court considers that in the present case it could not be said to have constituted an effective remedy against nonenforcement (see Plotnikovy v.
