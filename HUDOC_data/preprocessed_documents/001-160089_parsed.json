The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v.

The interference did not amount to control of the use of property either since it did not pursue such an aim. The Court considers therefore that the applicant\u2019s complaint falls to be dealt with under the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Pialopoulos and Others v.

It follows that the issue whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary (see Iatridis, cited above, \u00a7 58). However, the Court has limited power to review compliance with domestic law since it is a matter which primarily lies within the competence of domestic courts (see H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v.

Such agreements may show, if they are legally enforceable, that the sums claimed are actually payable by the applicant (see Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2000XI; and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 115, Series A no.\u00a0168).",

The Court further notes that contingency agreements are enforceable under Armenian law. In particular, the Advocacy Act does not set out any limitations on the type of agreement an advocate may enter into with his client, such agreements being regulated by the general provisions of the Civil Code. The Court, therefore, recognises the lawfulness of the arrangement entered into between the applicant and her representative, Mr\u00a0Alumyan (contrast with Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom (Article 50), 24\u00a0February 1983, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 59).",
