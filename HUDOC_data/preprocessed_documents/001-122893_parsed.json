The application was based on Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Regulation\u00a011(10) of the Common Standards and Procedures for Returning Illegally Staying Third-Country Nationals Regulations (Legal Notice 81 of 2011, hereinafter \u201cLN 81\u201d) (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below). In his application the applicant argued that the decision to detain him, as well as his ongoing detention, were contrary to the law. With regard to the original decision to detain him, the applicant argued that, contrary to the requirements of Regulation 11(8) of LN 81, when he was presented with the Return Decision and Removal Order no assessment had been made as to the possibility of exploring \u201cother sufficient and less coercive measures\u201d. Furthermore, in deciding to detain him, the responsible authorities had decided a priori and without an individual assessment of his situation that he presented a risk of absconding and that he was avoiding or hindering the return or removal procedure. Moreover, the decision was taken without the applicant having had an opportunity to make a request for voluntary departure. The applicant further argued that his ongoing detention was also contrary to the law because once he had presented his asylum application in April 2011, return procedures could not be commenced or continued in his regard under Regulation 12 of the Procedural Standards in Examining Applications for Refugee Status Regulations (Legal Notice 243 of 2008, hereinafter \u201cLN 243\u201d) (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below).",

It noted that, despite the fact that, according to Regulation 11(1) of LN 81, Part IV of those Regulations did not apply to persons who were apprehended or intercepted by the competent authorities in connection with the irregular crossing by sea or air of the external border of Malta and who did not subsequently obtain an authorisation or a right to stay in Malta, the applicant had obtained the right to stay (\u201cjoqg\u0127od\u201d) in Malta on lodging his application for asylum. Indeed it had been correct to rely on Regulation 12(1) of LN 243, which stated that an individual had the right to enter or remain on the island pending a decision on his asylum request. In the present case, that situation had applied to the applicant when he instituted his challenge before the IAB. In the applicant\u2019s case, had the asylum request still been pending, Section IV of LN 81 would in fact have been applicable, in particular in so far as an individual could not be kept in detention unless return proceedings were under way or he or she presented a risk of absconding. However, the situation had changed, given that on 2\u00a0April 2012 the applicant\u2019s asylum request had been rejected by a final decision. The latter implied that Section IV of LN 81 was no longer applicable to the applicant and thus the IAB could no longer decide on the request in terms of Regulation 11(8) of LN 81. Moreover, the applicant was not arguing the illegality of his detention on the basis of its length. In any event the IAB was not competent to decide whether there had been a breach of Article 5 of the Convention.",

Moreover, the Hague Convention explicitly mentioned a six week time-limit within which the courts must reach a decision. The applicant considered that it was uncertain whether such a request for hearing with urgency would be effective in other circumstances. He made reference to the application in the case of Tafarra Besabe vs Commissioner of Police et al (27/2007), which had been lodged in 2007 with a request to be treated with urgency and in April 2013 (the date of writing) was still pending. According to the applicant, despite the rules regarding court practice and procedure mentioned by the Government, it transpired from the Maltese judgments database that constitutional applications which ended with a judgment on the merits (as opposed to those struck out or withdrawn) generally required over a year to be concluded. The applicant submitted that in 2011 approximately eighty applications had been lodged before the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction and only fourteen had been decided at first instance in that same year; a further thirty-three were still pending at first instance at the time of writing. One case had been decided on appeal in that same year, nine had been decided on appeal in 2012, ten in 2013, and eight were still pending on appeal. The statistics (submitted to the Court) were even worse for applications lodged in 2012. These clearly showed that as a rule constitutional redress proceedings were not determined within days. Indeed, according to the 2013 EU Justice Scoreboard, the Maltese judicial system was one of the systems with the longest delays among the Member States. The two cases mentioned by the Government underlined the limited applicability of the urgent procedure before the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction, which were the final level of judicial proceedings. Moreover, given that the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction reviewed points of law, they rarely entered into a detailed examination of the facts, which would have been done by the courts below; thus, it could not be said that the whole judicial process was determined during the period of weeks when the case was being heard before them under the urgent procedure.",

In any event the granting of bail was subject to conditions such as the deposit of an amount usually in the region of EUR 1,000 and a guarantor who would provide subsistence and accommodation, conditions which were hardly ever met by immigrants reaching Malta by boat. Moreover, IAB practice showed that such bail was granted exclusively to persons having overstayed their visa to remain in Malta. Furthermore, a bail application was not intended to assess the legality of detention or to provide a remedy in the event that a violation was upheld.",

As to the length of such proceedings the Government submitted that a mechanism was in place for such proceedings to be treated expeditiously. They firstly made reference to subsidiary legislation 12.09 namely, the Court Practice and Procedure and Good Order Rules, which emphasised the need for speedy resolution of such matters (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d above). Secondly, they noted that it was possible for an applicant to request that a case be treated, heard and concluded with urgency.

In their further observations at a later stage in the case, the Government submitted a further two examples, namely Stacy Chircop vs\u00a0Attorney General (4/2013) concerning a breach of fair-trial rights in ongoing criminal proceedings, which had been lodged on 22 January 2013 and decided at first instance on 8 February 2013 (no appeal lodged), and Jonathan Attard vs the Commisioner of Police and the Attorney General in representation of the Government (13/2013), concerning complaints under Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention, which had been lodged on 14\u00a0February\u00a02013, had been decided at first instance on 1 April 2013 and was (in May\u00a02013) pending on appeal before the Constitutional Court.",

The Government considered that delays were exceptional and not the rule, and that the EU Justice Scoreboard should be ignored by the Court as there were no guarantees of its accuracy; moreover, it had not referred to constitutional cases. It was also wrong to consider that constitutional proceedings did not assess the facts as this was often the case, given that the complaints differed from those debated before the ordinary courts.",

Norway, 29 August 1990, \u00a7\u00a050, Series A no. 181, Louled Massoud v. Malta, no. 24340/08, \u00a7 39, 27\u00a0July 2010; and Rahmani and Dineva v. , no. 20116/08, \u00a7 75, 10\u00a0May 2012). Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not guarantee a right to judicial review of such breadth as to empower the court, on all aspects of the case including questions of pure expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority. The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the lawful detention of a person according to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see S.D. v. Greece, no. 53541/07, \u00a7 72, 11 June 2009; and Popov v. France, nos. 39472/07 and 39474/07, \u00a7 94, 19\u00a0January 2012).",

The remedies must be made available during a person\u2019s detention with a view to that person obtaining a speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of his or her detention capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release (see Kadem v. Malta, no.\u00a055263/00, \u00a7\u00a041, 9 January 2003 and Raza v. Bulgaria, no. 31465/08, \u00a7\u00a076, 11 February 2010). Indeed, Article 5 \u00a7 4, in guaranteeing arrested or detained persons a right to bring proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of their detention, also proclaims their right, following the institution of such proceedings, to a speedy judicial decision concerning the lawfulness of that detention (see Musial v. Poland [GC], no. 24557/94, \u00a7 43, ECHR 1999-II).",

One of them can be said to have been dealt with speedily, although it is unclear for what reason this was so, but in any case the Court notes that in that case no appeal had been lodged. On the other hand the second case (concerning Article 5 \u00a7 3) was still pending on appeal three months after it was lodged.

The Government did not deny this, limiting themselves to considering that there was no distinction between such temporary release and a finding that the person\u2019s detention was not lawful. The Court cannot agree. It suffices to mention two basic notions: (a) if that were the case, in a criminal context there would be no purpose in having two separate provisions in the Convention, namely Article 5 \u00a7 3 and Article 5 \u00a7 4; and (b) while a finding that a period of detention was unlawful allows an applicant to raise a claim under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 5, a decision granting bail does not, given that it is granted or refused irrespective of the legality of the detention.",

Indeed, in Louled Massoud (cited above, \u00a7 44), the Court held that proceedings under Article 25 are limited in scope and offer no prospects of success for someone in the applicant\u2019s situation (namely where the identity of the detainee, including his nationality, has yet to be verified). It is inconsistent for the Government to argue that despite the exceptions in subarticle (11) the applicant\u2019s release could not be excluded, given that the Government\u2019s arguments under Article 5 \u00a7 1 revolve around the lack of cooperation by the applicant, his voluntarily misleading the authorities as to his identity and the threat he posed to national security and public order, all exceptions under the said sub-article. Moreover, in Louled Massoud the Court also held that such proceedings could not be considered to determine requests speedily as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. The Government submitted no new examples capable of altering that conclusion, nor did they substantiate their argument that such proceedings could be heard with urgency. Indeed, the proceedings undertaken by the applicant to contest the lawfulness of his detention (albeit under Regulation 11(10) of LN 81 and not Article 25A of the Act) were also duly lodged before the same Board, and it took the IAB more than a year to determine the claim, only to find that the provision no longer applied at that stage and that it was not competent to assess any violation of Article 5. In the light of all this, the Court cannot but reiterate that, as they stand, proceedings before the IAB cannot be considered to determine requests speedily as required by Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

The Court notes the apparent lack of a proper system enabling immigration detainees to have access to effective legal aid. Indeed, the fact that the Government were able to supply only one example of a detainee under the Immigration Act making use of legal aid \u2013 despite the thousands of immigrants who have reached Maltese shores and have subsequently been detained in the past decade and who, as submitted by the Government, have no means of subsistence \u2013 appears merely to highlight this deficiency. The Court notes that, although the authorities are not obliged to provide free legal aid in the context of detention proceedings (see Lebedev v. Russia, no.\u00a04493/04, \u00a7 84, 25 October 2007), the lack thereof, particularly where legal representation is required in the domestic context for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4, may raise an issue as to the accessibility of such a remedy (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v.

The applicant recalled Malta\u2019s obligations under Article 31 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and particularly the prohibition of refoulement. The applicant argued that the Court\u2019s statement in Saadi v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 13229/03, ECHR 2008), to the effect that temporary admission to enter a country after applying for asylum did not amount to a lawful entry, had been confined to situations where a State had not authorised entry. In his view it was not a universally applicable principle that no asylum seeker could be considered to have been granted lawful entry, an assertion which would be contrary to the sovereign right of States to regulate entry into their territories. The applicant considered that he had received explicit authorisation under Regulation 12 of LN 243. Moreover, the applicant made reference to the European Union\u2019s Return Directive (Preamble, recital 9) which, albeit not legally binding, provided that a third-country national who had applied for asylum in a Member State should not be regarded as staying illegally on the territory of that Member State until a negative decision on the application, or a decision ending his or her right of stay as an asylum seeker, had entered into force.",

The applicant submitted that he had at no point directly or indirectly hindered his deportation.

Furthermore, the applicant pointed to the Court\u2019s statements in Louled Massoud (\u00a7 68) highlighting the possibility for the authorities to seek effective alternatives to detention in order to ensure that the applicant remained in Malta.",

Despite the Court\u2019s conclusions in that case, no changes to Maltese legislation or administrative practice had been made to address the matter. The applicant submitted that, significantly, the legal basis for his detention had been insufficiently clear and precise. The length of his detention had been based on a Government policy that had not had the force of law. In exacerbation of this lack of clarity and legal basis, the Government policy stated that if a detained migrant was imprisoned in Corradino Correctional Facility for any number of days (167 in the applicant\u2019s case), this duration was deemed not to form part of the period of mandatory detention for that specific migrant, despite the fact that the asylum application would still be processed during that time.",

He underlined that at no stage had an individual assessment been conducted in his regard in order to ascertain whether he did in fact present a threat to national security or otherwise, his detention being an automatic decision. The Maltese authorities had repeatedly stated that detention was necessary to safeguard national security, to ensure the smooth provision of services and to guarantee an efficient asylum procedure. In the light of that, the applicant opined that they could easily have applied reception arrangements that did not involve deprivation of his liberty. In his view, the provision of medical assistance, shelter, sustenance and other basic needs could certainly be carried out in an environment that was more conducive to a person\u2019s physical and psychological well-being than Malta\u2019s detention centres. Moreover, the nature and material conditions of the detention centres certainly did not conform to the Maltese Government\u2019s stated intention of securing orderly and efficient procedures. The applicant stressed that the place and conditions of his detention had been inappropriate for the purpose pursued (whatever this may have been). He referred to several expert reports that not only highlighted the military nature of Malta\u2019s detention centres but also commented on the low standard of the material conditions in those centres (see the relevant extracts under \u201cRelevant international reports\u201d above, and the report relied on by the third party intervener). He noted that Safi BBlock was an apartment-style building entirely closed off by chicken wire and constantly guarded by soldiers or security officers, where no provision was made for the special situation of asylum seekers highlighted by the Court (he cited, for example, M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no.\u00a030696/09, ECHR 2011, and Louled Massoud, cited above) and by UNHCR (see paragraph 33 above). In fact, the applicant noted that the building was not originally intended as asylum-seeker accommodation, but was part of a larger military barracks; only in 2002 had the premises been converted to their present use.",

The State had attempted other entertainment measures such as installing sports equipment, which had been vandalised and turned into weapons after a few days. The detainees were allowed to move freely on the floor where they were accommodated and were allowed daily visits by NGOs (open door policy). Immigrants could also join two EU-funded projects.

The Government further considered that the present case was different from that of Louled Massoud (cited above).

However, \u201cattempts in order to prepare\u201d for the applicant\u2019s deportation had been made once the criminal proceedings had been finally determined.

They considered that the ICJ had portrayed a very negative picture of a small country which had been doing its best to cope with a totally disproportionate influx of prohibited immigrants. The Court therefore had to take this into consideration. The Government considered that the limitations referred to in Article 25A (11) of the Immigration Act were in line with the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers\u2019 Recommendation to member states on measures of detention of asylum seekers (Recommendation Rec(2003)5) (see paragraph 33 above). Detention was consequent to breaches of domestic law and as such protected immigrants by giving them shelter, medical assistance, food and clothing, without which they would be homeless and without means of subsistence. In that light there was no point in deciding cases on a case-by-case basis. They further considered that the Return Directive did not apply to the applicant given that he had crossed irregularly by sea and had not subsequently obtained authorisation or a right to stay. Moreover, the twelve or eighteen months\u2019 detention periods were maximum periods justified by the need to prevent individuals from absconding and avoiding deportation. Such absconding was common, as evidenced by the various immigrants returned to Malta under the Dublin II Regulation. Indeed, the authorities made constant efforts to repatriate immigrants in the shortest possible time even though they faced all sorts of tricks and deceit by immigrants.

In the light of international refugee law, as well as the relevant European standards, the circumstances in which it was permissible to detain an asylum seeker on the grounds of unauthorised entry had to be narrowly drawn. They noted that the recently revised UNHCR Guidelines (mentioned above at paragraph 33) and the Conclusions adopted by the Executive Committee on the International Protection of Refugees, established a presumption against detention. Those provisions stipulated that detention could only be resorted to where necessary on specified grounds prescribed by law (guidelines 4.1 and 4.2). They stipulated that the detention of asylum seekers for other purposes, such as to deter future asylum seekers, or to dissuade asylum seekers from pursuing their claims, or for punitive or disciplinary reasons, was contrary to the norms of refugee law. The ICJ considered that inconsistency of national laws or practices with these norms would be an indicator of arbitrariness under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f). Moreover, EU legislation clearly considered asylum seekers as \u201clawfully staying\u201d in a Member State during the process of their asylum application. As a consequence, their detention on grounds of unauthorised entry could not be provided for except for very short periods and in exceptional circumstances. The ICJ submitted that European Union law in the field of asylum should be interpreted as constituting \u201cnational law\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 of the European Convention, unless domestic law provided for higher standards, since the Common European Asylum System was directly applicable in EU Member States as a minimum standard.",

Guideline 6 (see paragraph 33 above) had been held by the Court of Justice of the European Union to be an authoritative instrument of interpretation of EU asylum law, alongside the European Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law. Similarly, the said UNHCR Guidelines clearly spelt out the pre-eminence of alternative measures over detention (Guideline 4.3). In a series of cases, this Court had found the measure of detention not to have been carried out in good faith, as, despite the situation of vulnerability, the authorities had not considered less severe measures (the third-party intervener made reference to Yoh-Ekale Mwanje, cited above). Even the UN Human Rights Committee, in C v Australia (Communication No. 900/1999, 28 October 2002) had found a violation of the right to liberty because the respondent State had not demonstrated that there were no less invasive means of achieving the same ends. However, in Malta, any prohibited immigrant subject to a removal order had to \u201cbe detained until he [was] removed from Malta\u201d. This meant that the detention of undocumented migrants was the rule and not the exception; it was not applied on a casebycase basis or where necessary as a last resort. The EU Return Directive excluded arrivals by sea from the further protection contained in it. Whether this exclusion also referred to persons authorised under national law (Article 12 of LN 243 of 2008) to stay in Malta pending the resolution of their application was unclear.",

It considered that until a State had \u201cauthorised\u201d entry to the country, any entry was \u201cunauthorised\u201d and the detention of a person who wished to effect entry and who needed but did not yet have authorisation to do so, could be, without any distortion of language, to \u201cprevent his effecting an unauthorised entry\u201d. It did not accept that, as soon as an asylum seeker had surrendered himself to the immigration authorities, he was seeking to effect an \u201cauthorised\u201d entry, with the result that detention could not be justified under the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (\u00a7 65). It considered that to interpret the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) as permitting detention only of a person who was shown to be trying to evade entry restrictions would be to place too narrow a construction on the terms of the provision and on the power of the State to exercise its undeniable right of control referred to above. Such an interpretation would, moreover, be inconsistent with Conclusion No. 44 of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\u2019 Programme, the UNHCR\u2019s Guidelines and the Committee of Ministers\u2019 Recommendation (see \u00a7\u00a7 34-35 and \u00a7 37 of the Saadi judgment), all of which envisaged the detention of asylum seekers in certain circumstances, for example while identity checks were taking place or when elements on which the asylum claim was based had to be determined. However, detention had to be compatible with the overall purpose of Article\u00a05, which was to safeguard the right to liberty and ensure that no-one should be dispossessed of his or her liberty in an arbitrary fashion (ibid., \u00a7\u00a066).",

Indeed, where a State which has gone beyond its obligations in creating further rights or a more favourable position \u2013 a possibility open to it under Article 53 of the Convention \u2013 enacts legislation (of its own motion or pursuant to European Union law) explicitly authorising the entry or stay of immigrants pending an asylum application (see for example, Kanagaratnam, cited above, \u00a7 35 in fine, in relation to Belgian law), an ensuing detention for the purpose of preventing an unauthorised entry may raise an issue as to the lawfulness of detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). Indeed, in such circumstances it would be hard to consider the measure as being closely connected to the purpose of the detention and to regard the situation as being in accordance with domestic law. In fact, it would be arbitrary and thus run counter to the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention to interpret clear and precise domestic law provisions in a manner contrary to their meaning (see Longa Yonkeu v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 57229/09, \u00a7 125, 15 November 2011). The Court notes that in Saadi the national law (albeit allowing temporary admission) did not provide for the applicant to be granted formal authorisation to stay or to enter the territory, and therefore no such issue arose. The Court therefore considers that the question as to when the first limb of Article 5 ceases to apply, because the individual has been granted formal authorisation to enter or stay, is largely dependent on national law.",

On the one hand, the Government asserted that the provision did not grant any right to stay; on the other hand, the IAB\u2019s decision held that the applicant had been correct to rely on it in order to challenge his detention, given that it provided that an individual had the right to enter and to remain on the island pending a decision on his asylum request. It is not for the Court to interpret the intention of the legislature one way or another. However, it may well be that what was intended was for the provision to reflect international standards to the effect that an asylum seeker may not be expelled pending an asylum claim (see for example, S.D. v. Greece, no.\u00a053541/07, \u00a7 62, 11 June 2009), without necessarily requiring that an individual be granted formal authorisation to stay or to enter the territory. The fact that the provision, while establishing the conditions to be met by the asylum seeker, does not provide for any formal authorisation procedure or for the issuance of any relevant documentation (as per Article 9 of the Immigration Act) lends support to this interpretation. In this situation the Court considers that the first issue that arises concerns the quality of domestic law. The Court reiterates that the words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. Quality in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible and precise in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2001-II, citing Amuur v. France, \u00a7 50, cited above).",

However, the Court notes that, for more than five months during this period (from 16\u00a0August\u00a02011 to 29 January 2012), the applicant was remanded in custody in connection with criminal charges. Therefore the Court must only examine for the purposes of this complaint the period, amounting to more than six months in total, during which he was detained for the purposes of the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). Nevertheless, the Court has already considered periods of three months\u2019 detention pending a determination of an asylum claim to be unreasonably lengthy, when coupled with inappropriate conditions (see Kanagaratnam, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 94-95). Hence, it cannot consider a period of six months to be reasonable, particularly in the light of the conditions of detention described by various independent entities (see, a contrario, Saadi, cited above, where it took the authorities seven days, during which the applicant was detained in suitable conditions, to determine the applicant\u2019s asylum application despite the difficult administrative problems with which the United Kingdom was confronted during the period in question, with an escalating flow of huge numbers of asylum seekers).",

The Court reiterates that detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) will be justified only for as long as deportation proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (see Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 113). However, the Government admitted that the applicant\u2019s deportation had been stalled because of the criminal proceedings pending against him and that in view of those proceedings the authorities could not deport him (see paragraph 77 above). It is unclear when those proceedings were terminated; however, it was only in January 2013 that attempts to prepare the applicant for deportation were initiated. In consequence, it cannot be said that the period of detention of ten months between 2 April 2012 and January 2013 was for the purposes of deportation. As to the subsequent two months, the Government have not indicated any steps taken by the authorities, apart from an interview with the Consul of Sierra Leone, as a result of which they considered that the applicant could not be repatriated. The Court notes, however, that the applicant remained in detention until March 2013 despite the fact that the authorities had known since 11 February 2013 that there was no prospect of deporting him.",

The booklet was made available in various languages. In practice, when irregular immigrants were intercepted coming ashore, the immigration police would place them on a bus, where they were informed of the removal order and of their rights. The removal order contained information relative to the timelimit for appealing (three working days) and the fact that the appeal had to be lodged with the registry of the IAB, Fort St. Elmo, Valletta. Moreover, there were no particular formalities required in order to lodge an appeal, and most applicants lodged their appeals by writing in person to the IAB objecting to their removal. In any event further information could have been provided by the detention centre staff or a legal-aid lawyer had the applicant so requested, as explained in the booklet provided.

The Return Decision and Removal Order were of limited quality in both content and form. The document consisted of a standard text provided exclusively in English (see paragraph 27 above), and no interpretation or further explanation was provided to ensure that it was made comprehensible. In the Return Decision and Removal Order no reference was made to the applicant\u2019s detention, the possible reasons for it or the possibility of challenging the legality of his detention. Similarly, the information booklet mentioned by the Government contained absolutely no information on the reasons for detention, either in a general manner or in a manner specifically relating to the applicant. The applicant noted that Regulation 12 of the said document provided information \u2013 albeit of an extremely basic nature \u2013 on the possibility of applying to the IAB if an individual felt that his detention was no longer reasonable. Furthermore, the document referred to the possibility of applying to the Board merely on grounds of the possible unreasonableness of the person\u2019s detention and not on grounds of its unlawfulness. In addition, while stating that an appeal was possible the documentation did not provide any explanation as to how to lodge such an appeal or on what grounds, nor did it indicate the address of the Board or any other means of contacting the IAB, legal representatives or NGOs. Thus, the applicant submitted that he had at no point been informed promptly, in a language that he understood, of the reasons for his arrest, in violation of his rights under Convention Article 5 \u00a7 2. Even assuming that the reasons of the detention were self-evident given the circumstances, the applicant submitted that at some point in time the grounds for his detention had changed from the first limb to the second limb of Article 5 without any explanation being forthcoming. He further noted that according to the Court\u2019s case-law such information had to give the real reason for detention, in order to enable the detention to be challenged under Article 5 \u00a7 4, and that different grounds of detention required different levels of information as well as different timeframes (the applicant cited, for example, Kaboulov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a041015/04, 19 November 2009, and Saadi, cited above).",

This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5: by virtue of paragraph 2 any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 4. Whilst this information must be conveyed \u201cpromptly\u201d (in French: \u201cdans le plus court d\u00e9lai\u201d), it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7 50, with further references). It also reiterates that paragraph 2 of Article 5, like paragraph 4, is applicable both to persons deprived of their liberty by arrest and to those deprived of it by detention (see, by implication, Shamayev and Others v.

The Court observes that, contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertion, the RDRO also informed him that he could appeal against this decision/order/entry ban to the IAB within three working days at the Board\u2019s Registry, Fort St Elmo, Valletta. However, the applicant stressed that nowhere in the RDRO was any reference made to the fact that as a consequence of such a situation he had to be detained, or to the legal basis for such detention, namely Article 14 of the Act. Nevertheless, the booklet, which listed the entitlements, responsibilities and obligations of the persons concerned while in detention (and which was also given to the applicant on his arrival) explained that a prohibited immigrant could apply for refugee status and that pending the determination of that application \u201cyou will be placed in detention for a period up to 18 months\u201d (which could be extended in certain circumstances). The booklet also informed the applicant, amongst other things, that any person detained under the Immigration Act could apply to the IAB if he felt that his detention was no longer reasonable. However, the Court observes that this information \u2013 which, moreover, explained solely that the applicant would be detained pending any asylum claim he might wish to lodge \u2013 again failed to give the legal basis for his detention, or even a part thereof (referring to the periods before, during or after the asylum procedure).",

It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a breach of the Convention or the Protocols thereto imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress as far as possible the effects (see Mente\u015f and Others v. Turkey (Article 50), 24\u00a0July\u00a01998, \u00a7 24, Reports 1998IV; Scozzari and Giunta, [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 249, ECHR 2000-VIII; and Maestri v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a039748/98, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2004-I). In principle it is not for the Court to determine what may be the appropriate measures of redress for a respondent State to perform in accordance with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention (see Scozzari and Giunta, cited above; Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a028342/95, \u00a7 20, ECHR 2001-I; and \u00d6calan v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7 210, ECHR 2005IV). With a view, however, to helping the respondent State fulfil its obligations under Article\u00a046, the Court may seek to indicate the type of individual and/or general measures that might be taken in order to put an end to the situation it has found to exist (see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a031443/96, \u00a7 194, ECHR\u00a02004-V; Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a010249/03, \u00a7 148, ECHR\u00a02009; and Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 255, 17 January 2012).",

Albania, no.\u00a033771/02, \u00a7\u00a0122, ECHR 2007... (extracts)).The Court\u2019s concern is to facilitate the rapid and effective suppression of a defective national system hindering human-rights protection. In that connection, and having regard to the situation which it has identified above (see paragraphs 59-60 above and also Louled Massoud, cited above, \u00a7 47), the Court considers that general measures at national level are undoubtedly called for in execution of the present judgment.",

It observes that it has found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 on account of the fact that none of the remedies available in Malta could be considered speedy for the purposes of that provision. Thus, the Court considers that the respondent State must above all, through appropriate legal and/or other measures, secure in its domestic legal order a mechanism which allows individuals taking proceedings to determine the lawfulness of their detention to obtain a determination of their claim within Convention-compatible time-limits, but which nevertheless maintains the relevant procedural safeguards. The Court reiterates that although it is not always necessary that an Article 5 \u00a7 4 procedure be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the type of deprivation of liberty in question (see A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 203, and Idalov v. Russia [GC], no. 5826/03, \u00a7 161, 22 May 2012).",
