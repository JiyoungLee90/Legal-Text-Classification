It added that for the public authorities to be said to have failed in their obligation, it was necessary to establish that they had either not performed their duties at all, or had failed to perform them in a timely manner, or had performed them in an unsatisfactory fashion. The Supreme Administrative Court further held that the lack of the above-mentioned causal link also prevented the courts from awarding compensation to the family on the basis of the public authorities\u2019 \u201cabsolute liability\u201d because the sole fact that the deceased had been a \u201cmember of society\u201d was not sufficient.

The fact that some eight years after the killing the perpetrators had still not been identified was an indication that the public authorities had failed in their duties. The applicants maintained that the authorities had failed to take the necessary steps to prevent the attack on their relative and to find the perpetrators.

Therefore, although \u2013\u00a0as held above\u00a0\u2013 the compensation proceedings brought by them could have served as a judicial fact-finding forum by means of which they could have established whether the national authorities had acted negligently and failed to protect the life of their relative and thus obtained compensation for the damage they had incurred, those compensation proceedings did not in fact involve the identification or punishment of the alleged perpetrators. As such, although it was a relevant remedy in respect of the respondent State\u2019s alleged failure to comply with its obligation to take steps to protect the right to life of the applicants\u2019 relative, it cannot be taken into account when assessing the respondent Government\u2019s compliance with its procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation to identify and punish the perpetrators (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a028883/95, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2001III). The Court therefore finds that the administrative proceedings by which the applicants sought to obtain compensation do not affect the running of the six-month period (see Alk\u0131n v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 75588/01, \u00a7 33, 13 October 2009; and Erkan v.

Its primary purpose is to maintain legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are examined within a reasonable time, and to prevent the authorities and other persons concerned from being kept in a state of uncertainty for a long period of time. That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible. As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant. Article 35 \u00a7 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level, otherwise the principle of subsidiarity would be breached. Where an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances. The Court has already held that, in cases concerning an investigation into the suspicious death of a relative, as in those concerning an investigation into ill-treatment, applicants are expected to take steps to keep track of the investigation\u2019s progress, or lack thereof, and to lodge their applications with due expedition once they are, or should have become, aware of the lack of any effective criminal investigation. It follows that the obligation of diligence incumbent on applicants contains two distinct but closely linked aspects: on the one hand, the applicants must contact the domestic authorities promptly concerning progress in the investigation \u2013 which implies the need to apply to them with diligence, since any delay risks compromising the effectiveness of the investigation \u2013 and, on the other, they must lodge their application promptly with the Court as soon as they become aware or should have become aware that the investigation is not effective (Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, \u00a7\u00a7 258-260 and 263-264, ECHR 2014 (extracts) and the cases cited therein).",

Pursuant to the standing search order issued on 14 August 2003, a number of gendarmes in 2010 and 2011 visited the place where the body had been found in 1993 and notified the prosecutor in the form of \u201cinformation notes\u201d that they had been unable to find any evidence there (see paragraph\u00a022 above).

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by a law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports 1998VIII).",
