Instead, as noted above, those authorities sought to evade responsibility, by referring the applicant to private entities, and otherwise adopted a mostly passive attitude, leaving the applicant in a state of uncertainty as to whether and when he would receive the compensation to which he was entitled. To this must be added the lack of effective domestic remedies for rectifying the situation (see Kirilova and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 123, Antonovi, \u00a7 30, and Dichev, \u00a7 30, all cited above).
