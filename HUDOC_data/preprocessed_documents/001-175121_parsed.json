That court considered that Verop\u00f6rssi had a journalistic purpose and that it was also in the public interest to publish such data. It emphasised, in particular, that the published data were already accessible to the general public. The journalism derogation thus applied in the circumstances of the present case.

Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy, EU:C:2008:727). It found, first of all, that the activities in question constituted \u201cprocessing of personal data\u201d within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46. According to the CJEU, activities involving the processing of personal data such as those relating to personal data files which contained solely, and in unaltered form, material that had already been published in the media, also fell within the scope of the Directive (see paragraphs 37 and 49 of the judgment). The object of the derogation in Article 9 of the Directive for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes was to reconcile the protection of privacy with freedom of expression. In order to take account of the importance of the latter in every democratic society, it was necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly. However, in order to achieve a balance between those two fundamental rights, the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data had to apply only in so far as were strictly necessary (see paragraphs 54 and 56 of the judgment). Journalistic activities were not limited to media undertakings and could be undertaken for profit-making purposes (see paragraph 61). Furthermore, when interpreting the journalistic purposes derogation, account must be taken of the evolution and proliferation of methods of communication and the dissemination of information. Activities such as those involved in the domestic proceedings, relating to data from documents which were in the public domain under domestic legislation, could be classified as \u201cjournalistic activities\u201d if their sole object was the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas, irrespective of the medium which was used to transmit them. Whether or not that was the case, was for the national court to determine (see paragraphs 60-62 of the judgment).",

Thus, for example, public access to court records does not in itself make it lawful for a person accessing such information to publish or disseminate it further, if such publication or dissemination would interfere with the privacy rights of the persons concerned (see Government Bill to Parliament HE\u00a013/2006 vp., p. 15).",

The purpose of the collection and publication of the information was to exert pressure on public bodies to keep salaries within reasonable limits. The CJEU held that, while the mere recording by an employer of data by name relating to the remuneration paid to his employees cannot as such constitute an interference with private life, the communication of that data to third parties, in the present case a public authority, infringes the right of the persons concerned to respect for private life, whatever the subsequent use of the information thus communicated, and constitutes an interference within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. Citing Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR\u00a02000II, it also held that to establish the existence of such an interference, it did not matter whether the information communicated was of a sensitive character or whether the persons concerned had been inconvenienced in any way (paragraphs 74-75). Finally, the CJEU held that the interference resulting from the application of the Austrian legislation may be justified under Article 8(2) of the Convention only in so far as the wide disclosure not merely of the amounts of the annual income above a certain threshold of persons employed by the bodies subject to control by the Court of Audit but also of the names of the recipients of that income was both necessary for and appropriate to the aim of keeping salaries within reasonable limits, that being a matter for the national courts to examine (paragraph 90). It emphasised, as regards the proportionality of the interference and the seriousness of the latter, that it was not impossible that the persons affected might suffer harm as a result of the negative effects of the publicity attached to their income from employment (paragraph 89).",

Noting that the directive seeks to ensure not only the free flow of such data between Member States but also the safeguarding of the fundamental rights of individuals and that those objectives may be inconsistent with one another, the CJEU held that the mechanisms allowing those different rights and interests to be balanced are contained, first, in the Directive itself, and, second, result from the adoption, by the Member States, of national provisions implementing that directive and their application by the national authorities (paragraphs 79-82). The provisions of the Directive do not, in themselves, bring about a restriction which conflicts with the general principles of freedom of expression or other freedoms and rights which are applicable within the EU and are enshrined inter alia in Article 10 of the Convention. It is, according to the CJEU, for the national authorities and courts responsible for applying the national legislation implementing the Directive to ensure a fair balance between the rights and interests in question, including the fundamental rights protected by the EU legal order (paragraphs 83-90).",

Referring to Amann, cited above, and Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a028341/95, ECHR 2000V, it pointed out that the professional nature of the activities to which the data referred did not imply the absence of a right to privacy. The fact that the beneficiaries of aid had been informed that the data might be made public was not sufficient to establish that they had given their consent to its publication. As regards the proportionality of the interference with privacy rights, the CJEU held that it did not appear that the EU institutions had properly balanced the public interest objective in the transparent use of public funds against the rights which natural persons are recognised as having under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Regard being had to the fact that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary, and that it was possible to envisage measures which would have affected less adversely that fundamental right of natural persons and which would still have contributed effectively to the objectives of the European Union rules in question, the CJEU held that the EU regulations in question exceeded the limits which compliance with the principle of proportionality imposes and struck them down.",

As regards the derogation in Article\u00a09 of the Directive, while the CJEU did not exclude that processing by the publisher of a web page may, in some circumstances, be carried out \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019 and thus benefit from that derogation, the same did not appear to be the case as regards processing carried out by the operator of a search engine.

According to the applicant companies, public access to tax data enabled the public to observe the results of tax policies and how differences in income and wealth developed, for example, between different regions, occupations and sexes. It also enabled supervision by the Finnish tax administration as people reported their suspicions of tax evasion directly to the tax administration. In 2015 alone, the tax administration had received 15,000 such reports. The applicant companies thus argued that a balance between the public and publishable tax records, on the one hand, and the protection of privacy, on the other hand, had already been struck by the Finnish legislator. Therefore, no margin of appreciation, or at least a very narrow one, was left to the domestic authorities. There was thus no need for any re-balancing. Contrary to Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, ECHR 1999-I, the taxation information in the present case had been obtained lawfully by the applicant companies from public tax records, in the same manner as any other member of the public. The effect on a person\u2019s privacy could not in any significant way be different depending on whether the information had been received from the applicant companies, other media or through a phone-in service operated by the tax administration itself.

The Court should therefore not set the standard of protection under Article 10 any lower than mentioned above.",

As regards the latter, it is noteworthy that the CJEU has held that the guarantee of the independence of national supervisory authorities was established in order to strengthen the protection of individuals and bodies affected by the decisions of those authorities. In order to guarantee that protection, the national supervisory authorities must, in particular, ensure a fair balance between, on the one hand, observance of the fundamental right to privacy and, on the other hand, the interests requiring free movement of personal data (see the CJEU judgment in the Schrems case, cited in paragraph 76 above).

The margin of appreciation left to the national authorities in assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.

However, the existence of a public interest in providing access to, and allowing the collection of, large amounts of taxation data did not necessarily or automatically mean that there was also a public interest in disseminating en masse such raw data in unaltered form without any analytical input. It had been made clear in the preparatory work on the domestic legislation (see paragraph 36 above) that databases established for journalistic purposes were not intended to be made available to persons not engaged in journalistic activities, thus underlining that the journalistic privilege in question related to the processing of data for internal purposes.

In so doing, the Supreme Administrative Court attached particular weight to its finding that the publication of the taxation data in the manner and to the extent described did not contribute to a debate of public interest and that the applicants could not in substance claim that it had been done solely for a journalistic purpose within the meaning of domestic and EU law. The Court discerns no strong reasons which would require it to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts and to set aside the balancing done by them (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 107; and Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0198). It is satisfied that the reasons relied upon were both relevant and sufficient to show that the interference complained of was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d and that the authorities of the respondent State acted within their margin of appreciation in striking a fair balance between the competing interests at stake.",

The request was dismissed on the grounds that the applicant companies were engaged in journalism and so were entitled to a derogation from restrictions provided by law on data processing. In February 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court, examining the case, sought a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the interpretation of the EU Data Protection Directive, which also governed the impugned data processing. In December 2008 the CJEU ruled that activities related to data processing from documents in the public domain could be classified as \u201cjournalistic activities\u201d if their object was to disclose to the public information, opinions or ideas, irrespective of the medium used to transmit them. In September 2009 the Supreme Administrative Court concluded that the publication of the whole database could not be regarded as journalistic activity, and directed the Data Protection Board to forbid the applicant companies from publishing such data.",

We find this reasoning strained, for the obvious reason that Finnish legislative policy has seen fit to render taxation data publicly accessible. This is all the more salient given, as the majority notes, that in so doing Finland is part of a small minority of Convention States, thus placing all the greater weight on the public interest in publicity and transparency concerning taxation data (see \u00a7\u00a7 81, 120-121 of the judgment).",

Further, the Court has decided that the publication of a \u201ccertain\u201d quantity of data does not enjoy the protection of the law, although the law nowhere specifies any threshold of this sort. The very fact that Finnish law made such data publicly available proves that its dissemination was not only lawful but also a matter of serious public interest in the Finnish context. In fact, the Act on the Public Disclosure and Confidentiality of Tax Information, which makes such data public, stipulates that its provisions should take precedence over the Act on the Openness of Government Activities and the Personal Data Act (section 2; see also \u00a7 15 of the applicants\u2019 23\u00a0April\u00a02014 submissions and \u00a7 26 of their 17 March 2016 submissions).",

Furthermore, two prior applications of the Personal Data Act had held, respectively, that public taxation data could be provided to media in mass deliveries in electronic format, and that a media organisation that had published data on a group of 10,000 people considered to be the wealthiest people in Finland had processed data for journalistic purposes (see \u00a7 38 of the judgment).",

This Court has previously attached great importance to the quality of parliamentary review of the necessity of legislation restricting rights (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). In this case, the majority considers the parliamentary review conducted by the Finnish Parliament to be \u201cexacting and pertinent\u201d (\u00a7 193 of the judgment). However, it is contradictory to grant a wide margin of appreciation to the Finnish authorities to pass a law because of its democratic legitimacy while also granting that margin of appreciation to domestic courts to limit the scope of what has been democratically debated and passed. Where a balance between competing interests has already been struck by the legislature, this Court would contradict its own position expressed in the Animal Defenders doctrine by encouraging the disregard of national democratic choices, especially if the sole reason for granting the margin of appreciation in the first place was the quality of parliamentary review.",

It even appears to say that restrictions on Article\u00a010 (allegedly based on the Personal Data Act) should have a wide margin of appreciation, but restrictions on Article 8 (based on the Act on Public Disclosure and Confidentiality of Tax Information Act) do not. The language is tentative at best, and no reason is given for the Court\u2019s preference other than its desire to side with a national court against legislation. Today\u2019s judgment clearly illustrates, once again, that there is no objective principle to apply the doctrine of margin of appreciation, especially after its application in Animal Defenders. While the Court claims to be granting a wide margin of appreciation to the authorities of the respondent State to strike a balance between the rights involved, it wishes also to allow domestic Courts not only to judicially repeal what has been democratically passed, but also to redefine the meanings of \u201cjournalistic activity\u201d and \u201cjournalistic purpose\u201d.",

It then follows that domestic authorities cannot be granted a margin of appreciation to make such a decision. A similar approach is being taken with regard to the concept of \u201cresponsible journalism\u201d, which has been used, albeit not explicitly, to allow a less strict analysis of the balancing performed by the State and the proportionality of the measure adopted (see, respectively, Pentik\u00e4inen v.

Romania, no. 25721/04, \u00a7\u00a024, 8 March 2016, where Pentik\u00e4inen was reinterpreted and extensively applied; B\u00e9dat v.

Allowing States to determine the boundaries of these concepts is to implicitly endorse a position, which is emerging in some member States, that journalistic activity that critical of the State is not journalistic but plainly illegal as a form of terrorism or a threat to national security.

In the present case, the applicants, who were media professionals, were denied journalistic protection by this Court, which applied a wide margin of appreciation in handling the position of the domestic court on the basis of several criteria that must be considered arbitrary: the amount of information published, the format used for its publication, and the alleged lack of a \u201cpublic interest\u201d involved in the dissemination of taxpayer data. To accept these as valid criteria for restricting journalistic expression would mean that authorities would, in the name of the \u201cgeneral interest\u201d, be able to censor publications that they deemed not to promote discussion of a topic of public interest. Under the terms of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention, there are several legitimate aims liable to justify interference in an individual\u2019s manifestation of his or her freedom of expression. This enumeration of legitimate aims is strictly exhaustive and necessarily restrictive (see Leyla \u015eahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7 154, ECHR 2005XI). The aforementioned \u201cgeneral interest\u201d is not included among these aims. Moreover, under the pretext of using a lenient balancing test, the Court omitted to conduct a proper review of the existence or absence of a public interest in the publication, which was deemed as voyeuristic without explanation.",

What is worse, this restriction was not examined under the level of stricter scrutiny required by Article 10 (2). We lament the consequent curtailment of the right of journalists to communicate accurate information of important public significance, and we therefore dissent.",
