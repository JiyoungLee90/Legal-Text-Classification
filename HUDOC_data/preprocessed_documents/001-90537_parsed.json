This decision, however, was final and there were no further sufficiently accessible and effective remedies to exhaust, including the extraordinary remedies which could be initiated under Article\u00a0294 of the CAO with a prosecutor or the president of a higher court (see Galstyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42). The applicant nevertheless tried one of these avenues for review by submitting a request for review to the President of the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal (see paragraph 12 above). On 1 March 2003 the President of the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal decided to review the final decision of the District Court of 26\u00a0February 2003, on the basis of the applicant\u2019s extraordinary appeal. The applicant lodged his application with the Court on 30 October 2003, which is more than six months from the date of the District Court\u2019s decision but less than six months from the date on which the applicant alleged that he became aware of the decision of the Court of Appeal. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the decision of the Court of Appeal taken on the basis of the applicant\u2019s extraordinary appeal restarted the running of the six-month period as far as the final decision of the District Court is concerned.",

The Court, however, does not consider that the mere fact of reopening proceedings will restart the running of the six month period. It cannot be excluded that a case may be reopened on grounds unrelated to the Convention complaints which an applicant may later lodge with the Court and the Court doubts that such a reopening will affect the calculation of the six month period. Since Article 35 \u00a7 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court before his position in connection with his complaint has been finally settled at the domestic level (see Petrie and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 29703/05, 6\u00a0February 2007), it means that an applicant is required under that Article to\u00a0seize the Court once his position in connection with his complaint has finally been settled and the reopening of a case on unrelated grounds will not affect the finality of the settlement in respect of that particular issue. The Court therefore considers that, in cases where proceedings are reopened or a final decision is reviewed, the running of the six month period in respect of the initial set of proceedings or the final decision will be interrupted only in relation to those Convention issues which served as a ground for such a review or reopening and were the object of examination before the extraordinary appeal body. A different approach would also be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, on which the Convention machinery is founded and which requires that the complaints intended to be made at the international level should first be aired in substance before the domestic courts (see Azinas v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a056679/00, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2004III).",

It further notes that the Court of Appeal did not address of its own motion any of those issues either, apart from upholding the applicant\u2019s conviction under Article 172 of the CAO and modifying the penalty imposed by the District Court. Thus, the complaints raised by the applicant before the Court in connection with the decision of the District Court were not the object of examination before the Court of Appeal and the grounds on which the Court of Appeal decided to review the final decision of the District Court cannot be seen as being in any way related to those complaints.

It further observes that it is for the Government pleading non-respect of the six-month rule to demonstrate the date on which the applicant became aware of the final decision (see Ali Sahmo v. Turkey (dec.), no. 37415/97, 1 April 2003). In the present case, the Government argued that the applicant became aware of the decision of 1 March 2003 on that very day, because that decision resulted in his release from detention. The Court, however, is not convinced by this argument. It is true that the applicant was released from detention before the expiry of his ten-day sentence. However, the Government have failed to produce any evidence that the applicant was ever informed \u2013 through service of a copy of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision or in any other manner \u2013 about the Court of Appeal examining and rendering a decision on his request for review of 1 March 2003 before he was asked in June 2003 by the DEJA to comply with the terms of that decision. The fact of the applicant\u2019s release alone is not sufficient to conclude that he was unequivocally aware of the existence of the decision of 1 March 2003, especially in view of the fact that the review proceedings before the Court of Appeal were not a part of normal procedure (see Galstyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041). Indeed, the fact that the applicant continued, upon his release, to make attempts seeking to review that decision suggests that he was probably not aware that a review had already taken place. None of the replies received by the applicant in that period contained any mention of the decision of 1 March 2003. Moreover, and quite surprisingly, the President of the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal himself, when refusing by his letter of 16 April 2003 to examine the applicant\u2019s application for review of 26 March 2003, did so on the ground that this application had been submitted out of time and not on the ground that an appeal had already been examined by him on 1 March 2003. In view of all the above factors, the Court does not find the Government\u2019s position to be convincing and their objection as to the applicant\u2019s failure to comply with the six-month rule must be rejected.",

No other material before the Court contains any such details either. Furthermore, it is not clear on what grounds the Court of Appeal stated that the applicant had participated in an unauthorised demonstration, taking into account that at the material time there was no legal act applicable in Armenia containing rules for organising and holding rallies and street marches, including the rules for authorising such events (see Mkrtchyan v. Armenia, no. 6562/03, \u00a7\u00a043, 11\u00a0January\u00a02007). The Court has already found in the above cases of Galstyan and Ashughyan that the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly would be impaired, if the State chose not to prohibit a demonstration but subsequently imposed sanctions on its participants for the mere fact of attending it, without committing any reprehensible acts, and concluded that such interferences were not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (see Galstyan, cited above, \u00a7 117, and Ashughyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a093).
