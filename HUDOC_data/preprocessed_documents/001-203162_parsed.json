The Court in particular reiterates that the persistence of a reasonable suspicion is a condition sine qua non for the validity of continued detention, but, after a certain lapse of time, it no longer suffices: the Court must then establish (1) whether other grounds cited by the judicial authorities continue to justify the deprivation of liberty and (2), where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, whether the national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings.
