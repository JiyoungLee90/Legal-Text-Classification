It further notes that the rights guaranteed by this Article are crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations of an effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law. In addition, the right to vote is not a privilege. In the twenty-first century, the presumption in a democratic State must be in favour of inclusion and universal suffrage has become the guiding principle. As the Court has already noted, the same rights are enshrined in Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (see Scoppola v. Italy (no.\u00a03) [GC], no.\u00a0126/05, \u00a7\u00a7 81-82, 22 May 2012).",
