These precedents had been pending for nine years before the Court of Appeal rendered its decisions. This duration of the proceedings casts doubts as to whether the domestic courts had dealt with the precedents expeditiously (see, by contrast, Klasen, cited above, \n\u00a7 35) However, given that the applicant and his predecessor equally failed to further the proceedings during that period (see paragraph 40 above), the Court considers that the domestic courts cannot alone be held responsible for the delays occurred.

In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers that the applicant has not established that the costs and expenses claimed for the proceedings before the domestic courts were incurred by him in order to seek prevention or rectification of the specific violation caused by the excessive length of the proceedings. However, seeing that in length of proceedings cases the protracted examination of a case beyond a \u201creasonable time\u201d involves an increase in the applicants' costs (see, among other authorities, \nS\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a075529/01, \u00a7\u00a0148, ECHR 2006...), it does not find it unreasonable to award the applicant EUR\u00a0500.",
