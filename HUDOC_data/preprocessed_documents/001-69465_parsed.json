In reality, the sentence imposed by the trial court, i.e. two and a half years' imprisonment (see paragraph 31 above), was at the lower end of the applicable scale. Moreover, upon the applicant's appeal, that sentence was reduced to two years' imprisonment suspended for four years (see paragraph\u00a032 above).

The impugned delay can, in part, be arguably attributed to the fact that the applicant was hospitalised in May 1997 and that in June of that year he was granted access to the case-file for an unspecified period. However, the Court notes that the delays in organising the trial after the bill of indictment had been lodged were also acknowledged by the Cracow Court of Appeal in its decision of 30 October 1997. Having regard to the above, the Court does not find it established that the authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings against the applicant.",
