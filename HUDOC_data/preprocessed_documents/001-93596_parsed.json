The Court reiterates that the State has a duty to organise its legal system in such a way that its courts can meet the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7 129, 8 June 2006). In particular, the Court considers that there was a substantial delay between the date when the claim was lodged (27 April 2000) and when it was first assigned to a judge, which was, according to the Government, on 3\u00a0May 2001.",

As acknowledged by the District Court in its decision of 12 October 2006, the decision of 29\u00a0December 2003 did not contain sufficient detail, which would enable the applicant to understand the appropriate procedure to be followed for challenging the above decision (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). At the same time, the Court considers that the applicant displayed sufficient diligence when he enquired about the state of proceedings on his appeal against the decision of 29 December 2003. Thus, even though the applicant was mistaken as to the procedure to be followed, it was incumbent on the national courts to inform him that his appeal would not be examined since it was not required by national law in the circumstances of the case. The Government produced no evidence that any such effective notification had been made to the applicant.",
