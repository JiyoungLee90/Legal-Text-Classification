The case originated in thirteen applications (nos. 26401/06, 29258/06, 12149/07, 37061/07, 35903/08, 4874/09, 20343/09, 28877/09, 29514/09, 31466/09, 32934/10, 70306/11 and 59413/12) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by thirteen Russian nationals whose names and the dates on which they introduced their applications are set out in Appendix I.
Some of the applicants were represented by lawyers whose names are listed in Appendix I. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants complained, in particular, that they had been denied an opportunity to appear in person or that had not been represented before the appellate court in the criminal proceedings against them.
The applicants were convicted in Russia of various crimes. The applicants and their lawyers, except for Mr Yakupov, whose lawyer was present, were refused leave to attend the appeal hearings on the ground that their presence was unnecessary or without addressing this issue at all.
Following communication of the cases, the supervisory-review courts quashed the appeal judgments at the prosecutor’s request and remitted the cases for fresh examinations before the appellate courts. In most of the cases the applicants and their lawyers were present at the new appeal hearings. Mr Trifonov and Mr Sidelnikov did not ask for leave to appear and did not attend the new hearings, but they were represented by lawyers.
Detailed information about the applicants’ attendance and dates of the hearings is set out in Appendix II.
On 12 November 2002 criminal proceedings were initiated against Mr Zakhodyakin. Since then the criminal proceedings were suspended and reopened several times.
On 26 June 2007 the Vuktyl Town Court of the Komi Republic found the applicant guilty of abuse of office and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment. On 24 August 2007 the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic upheld that judgment on appeal.
On 8 October 2008 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic quashed the judgment of 24 August 2007 and remitted the case for a fresh examination. On 7 November 2008 the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic upheld the judgment of 26 June 2007.
On 3 October 2012 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic quashed the judgment of 7 November 2008 and remitted the case for a fresh examination. On 18 December 2012 the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic upheld the judgment of 26 June 2007.
If a convicted person wishes to take part in appeal hearing, he or she must indicate this request in his or her statement of appeal (Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, Article 375 § 2).
The failure of a party, who has been duly notified of the date, time and place of the appeal hearing, to attend the hearing should not preclude the court from proceeding with the examination of the case (Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 376 § 4).
If the court is unable to proceed owing to the absence of a party summoned to court, it must adjourn the hearing (Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 253 § 1).
