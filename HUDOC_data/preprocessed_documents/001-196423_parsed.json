They also reiterated that they had asked for the court proceedings to be dealt with urgently, anticipating that the respondent would obstruct any kind of contact between the applicant and their children. As regards the applicant\u2019s conduct, they considered that she had been primarily focused on defending herself from the respondent\u2019s violence rather than protecting her children from poor living conditions. That is to say, when the interim custody order had come into force, there had been no legal impediment to her taking the children. However, in the efforts to enforce her rights, when she could have been expected to protect the children by taking them to her house regardless of the risk to her from the respondent, she showed a lack of efficiency and emotional engagement, relying on \u201ca unrealistic expectation that she would be protected from the respondent\u2019s violence if the State institution helped her in the execution of the custody transfer\u201d. As the children had been alienated from the applicant, and branded a bad mother by the respondent, the children had a perception about their father as the only parent interested in raising them. The RSCC considered that disrupting the children\u2019s current living arrangements with the respondent would not be in their best interests.",

[GC], nos. 71916/01 et seq., \u00a7\u00a7 131-33, ECHR 2005V); rather, the applicant\u2019s case was not terminated earlier owing to the excessive caseload of the Constitutional Court. In this connection, the Court has repeatedly held that Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on Contracting States a duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time. Although this obligation cannot be construed in the same way for a constitutional court with its role as guardian of the Constitution as for an ordinary court, this role also makes it particularly necessary for a Constitutional Court sometimes to take into account considerations other than the mere chronological order in which cases are entered on the list, such as the nature of a case and its importance in political and social terms (see S\u00fc\u00dfmann, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 55-57; Gast and Popp v. Germany, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000II and \u0160iki\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 9143/08, \u00a7 37, 15 July 2010). The Court emphasises that, according to its established case-law, a chronic overload, like the one in the present case, cannot justify excessively long proceedings before the Constitutional Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Pammel v. Germany and Probstmeier v. Germany, 1\u00a0July 1997, \u00a7 69 and \u00a7 64 respectively, Reports 1997IV; contrast, as regards the temporary backlog of court business and prompt remedial action, Uni\u00f3n Alimentaria Sanders S.A. v. Spain, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 157). Moreover, while what was at stake for the applicant in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court was of considerable importance, the Constitutional Court, according to the Government, was not in position to adopt and implement any priority policy in dealing with constitutional appeals and did not consider doing so, including in child custody-related cases (see paragraph 88 above). Hence, the Government have not submitted any factors which could justify the protracted length of the proceedings.",

Depending of the nature of an interim measure and of complaints before the Court, it may be appropriate in certain situations to distinguish between various sets of proceedings and examine them separately. The Court adopted such an approach in the Leonov case (see Leonov v. Russia, no. 77180/11, \u00a7 55, 10 April 2018), in which the applicant complained that the domestic authorities had not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons for granting a residence order in favour of his son\u2019s mother and, previously, for the interim order prohibiting him from contacting his son or picking him up from his nursery pending the residence order proceedings. In the present case, and unlike in the case of Leonov, the interim decision concerned precisely the same issue, that is care and custody of the children, and both decisions were in the applicant\u2019s favour. In the context of continuous non-enforcement of custody/contact-related rights under Article 8, an applicant cannot be expected to make a separate complaint to the Constitutional Court or this Court about the non-enforcement of each and every interim order, of which may be a large number, within the main proceedings. The Court will therefore adopt a global approach when considering the domestic proceedings and have regard to the overall facts which may be important for the context and merits of the main proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 6 and ratione materiae compatibility, Micallef v. Malta [GC], no.\u00a017056/06, \u00a7\u00a7 77, ECHR 2009 and, in the context of Article 10, Editions Plon v.

The school psychologist had neither been authorised nor had she done so.

Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR\u00a02000-I; Nuutinen v.\u00a0Finland, no. 32842/96, \u00a7\u00a0127, ECHR\u00a02000-VIII; and Iglesias Gil and A.U.I. v. Spain, no. 56673/00, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR\u00a02003-V). The obligation of the national authorities to take measures to facilitate a reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with a child who has lived for some time with other persons may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken to this effect. The nature and extent of that preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child. Although coercive measures against children are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the children live (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). In cases concerning the enforcement of decisions in the sphere of family law, the Court has repeatedly found that what is decisive is whether the national authorities have taken all necessary steps to facilitate the execution, in so far as can reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of each case (see, among other authorities, Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058; Nuutinen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0127-28; Glaser, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066; Sylvester v.\u00a0Austria, nos.\u00a036812/97 and 40104/98, \u00a7\u00a059, 24\u00a0April\u00a02003; Hansen v.

Following the first interim order of June 2002 which was quashed quickly thereafter, on 27 February 2003 the competent court ordered the respondent to hand over the children to the applicant within twenty-four hours, pending the final outcome of the ongoing custody proceedings (see paragraph 15 above). This interim custody order had been set aside by the custody judgment rendered in October 2005, which was served on the respondent in November 2006 (see paragraphs 16-17 above). By that final judgment, the court, referring to the respondent\u2019s negative behaviour, appalling living conditions and the need for the children\u2019s immediate removal, granted sole custody of the children to the applicant, determined the respondent\u2019s access rights and prohibited his contact with the children for three months to enable the children to restore emotional ties with the applicant. The new custody decision of June 2010 in the respondent\u2019s favour in the course of fresh custody proceedings was soon after quashed and the proceedings terminated following the respondent\u2019s ultimate withdrawal (see paragraphs 19-20 above). Both interim and final decisions remained unenforced (see paragraphs 40, 63 and 64 above). It appears that as of January 2002 the applicant was seeing her children only sporadically during the school breaks on weekdays and was unable to exercise the sole custody granted to her or even establish more regular and better quality contact with them until late 2009. The children turned eighteen in 2014. In the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds it appropriate to examine under Article 8 the overall length of and the conduct of the competent national authorities in both sets of enforcement proceedings which had had the same objective and had in any event been intertwined (see \u0160obota-Gaji\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045, and, mutatis mutandis, Glaser, cited above, \u00a7 86; see also paragraph 106 above).",

The Court is mindful of the fact that custody and contact-related disputes are by their very nature extremely sensitive for all the parties concerned, and it is not necessarily an easy task for the domestic authorities to ensure enforcement of a court order where one or both parents\u2019 behaviour is far from constructive (see Krasicki v. Poland, no.\u00a017254/11, \u00a7 90, 15 April 2014). However, a lack of intention to co-operate by one parent rather imposes on the authorities an obligation to take measures that would reconcile the conflicting interests of the parties, keeping in mind the paramount interests of the children to have contact with both parents and be in the custody of the parent who was determined as the custodial parent (see Z. v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a034694/06, \u00a7 75, 20 April 2010).",

The custody transfer fixed for 2 December 2003 also failed as the respondent had apparently hidden with the children. Those initial steps date back prior to 3\u00a0March 2004, the date of ratification of the Convention by Serbia, and are noted only for reasons of context whilst examining the situation complained of as a whole.",

There is no information in the case file as to whether the court attempted to collect the imposed fine, which in any event had proved to be an ineffective measure earlier as it could not be enforced or provide any incentive for the respondent to alter his conduct. The custody transfer fixed by the court for 30 November 2004 failed, as no one could be found at the respondent\u2019s address (see paragraph 26 above). It took the court another five months to fix another reunion for 9 May 2005, which failed owing to the failure to duly summon the parties, social services and police officers (see paragraph 27 above). The Court observes that no procedural steps were taken in the meantime in the enforcement proceedings, nor was any attempt made to locate the respondent and make use of a more coercive measure in spite of his clearly uncooperative attitude, or to contact him or the children in order to offer counselling, mediation and prepare for the custody transfer in an adequate manner (compare and contrast C\u00e2rstoiu v. Romania (dec.), no.\u00a020660/10, \u00a7\u00a042, 7 May 2013). The Government have not provided an explanation for any of these periods of inactivity. The Court notes, however, that the Public Prosecutor charged the respondent with child abduction on 27\u00a0May 2005 (see paragraph 69 above).",

No measures were taken or even considered by the authorities to provide expert assistance to the children over a number of motivation sessions and encourage them to meet the applicant, which could have prepared them for the re-establishment of contact and especially precautious swift of child custody in these circumstances.",

It reiterated its earlier assessment of the applicant\u2019s ability to have custody in comparison to that of the respondent, but noted that disrupting the children\u2019s living arrangements with the respondent would not at that time have been in their best interests. The applicant was also criticised for being primarily focused on defending herself from the respondent\u2019s violence rather than taking the children from him after the interim measure had been adopted and protecting them from poor living conditions regardless of the risk of violence for her, relying on \u201can unrealistic expectation that she would be protected from the respondent\u2019s violence if the State institution helped her in the execution of the custody transfer\u201d.

Slovakia, no.\u00a08227/04, 15 September 2009), were focused on the respondent\u2019s negative attitude towards the custody transfer and were ultimately not enforced in any event (see paragraph 34 above).",

Referring to the instructions given by the second-instance court, on 19 June 2006 the enforcement court invited the RSCC to consult the court\u2019s case file in order to facilitate the protection of the best interests of the children (see paragraph 36 above). The RSCC\u2019s lawyer and social worker consulted the court\u2019s case file a year later and reported on 6 August 2007 that it would be in the best interests of the children to have the interim custody order enforced (see paragraph 37 above).
