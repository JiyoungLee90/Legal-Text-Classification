The fact that his father was a politician did not make him a public figure either. Even the , which had dismissed his claim at first instance, had acknowledged that the article had created the impression that he was suspected of having committed the offence of embezzlement in respect of a huge sum of money. In its judgment of 14\u00a0February 2007, the Vienna Court of Appeal set out convincing reasons for its conclusion that Mr Rauscher\u2019s interest in the protection of his identity and the presumption of innocence outweighed the applicant company\u2019s interest in disclosing his name.

In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.
