The Court is not convinced by this argument. It appears from the relevant domestic law as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Russia that such obligation is indeed transferred to the owner, but only once the former landlord performs its obligation to conduct the major overhaul of the living premises and the common property (see paragraph\u00a019 above) It is not disputed by the parties that the need for a major overhaul of both the flat and the common property was established by the domestic court on the basis of the expert reports and had not been discharged by the landlord by the time of privatisation (see paragraphs\u00a08, 12 and 14 above). Further, it appears that the initial judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour ordering major overhaul of both the common property and the flat has never been modified and remains in force as issued in 2008. In the absence of any relevant domestic proceedings or further clarifications from the parties, the Court cannot accept that the scope of the initial judgment had been affected by the privatisation of the flat, and considers that the State has remained under obligation to comply with the judgment in favour of Ms\u00a0Konstantinova in full. In any event, the Court cannot but note that by April 2015 the judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour had already remained unenforced for seven years.",
