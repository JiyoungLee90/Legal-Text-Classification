However, the Court would reiterate that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of detention on remand (see, for instance, Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).

In this regard, the Court reiterates that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (see, G\u00f3rski v. , no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4\u00a0October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see, Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high. In this respect, the Court accepts that certain delays during the trial were caused by the defendants' obstructiveness and the abuse of the rights of the defence (see paragraphs 19-20 above).",

This is clearly shown, inter alia, by the number of defendants and the volume of evidence obtained during the proceedings. During the investigation the prosecuting authorities gathered extensive documentary evidence. Numerous witnesses had to be interviewed. Even before the trial had commenced, the case file numbered 114 volumes, and the number reached 204 volumes by April 2006.",

It further notes that the defendants in the present case, including the applicant, certainly contributed to the length of the proceedings by having made frequent applications on procedural matters which, inevitably, led to delays in the examination of the case. The defendants' obstructiveness and the abuse of the rights of the defence were referred to expressly on a few occasions by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 19-20 above). While the applicant's conduct must have generated delays at the trial and cast doubt on his intention to have the proceedings concluded speedily, the Court cannot subscribe to the view that this factor could justify the entire length of the proceedings.",

On 13 March 2002 the Court of Appeal directed the trial court to increase that number to five per month. The Court notes that otherwise hearings were held regularly and when they were adjourned it was normally for reasons not attributable to the court. Furthermore, the trial court took measures to ensure the presence of defence counsel and witnesses at the hearings. On the other hand, the Court cannot but note that following the judge rapporteur's illness and the subsequent change in the composition of the trial court some time after 21\u00a0September 2005 the trial had to commence de novo.",

The Court of Appeal concluded that there had been no delays caused by the trial court's inactivity. The Court considers that the Court of Appeal in examining the applicant's complaint generally applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in the Court's case-law. The Court discerns only one shortcoming in the review carried out by the Court of Appeal, namely that the latter did not regard the fact of the applicant's detention as a relevant factor for directing the trial court to conduct the proceedings with particular diligence.",

Notwithstanding the significant difficulties which they faced in the present case, the domestic authorities were required to organise the trial efficiently and ensure that the Convention guarantees were fully respected in the proceedings.
