As is clear from the Hungarian courts\u2019 relevant jurisprudence (see, e.g., BH2001.173, a review judgment of the Supreme Court), the establishment of criminal and civil liability, respectively, requires different factual elements to be proved. Whereas in criminal proceedings facts not proved beyond reasonable doubt may not serve as a basis for establishing criminal liability, in civil proceedings judges are free to assess evidence, to accept plausible statements as proven, to draw inferences from the presence or absence of any evidence, and to establish civil liability on the basis of the \u201cco-existence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences\u201d (cf. Selmouni v. France, op. cit., \u00a7\u00a088). While it is true that in civil proceedings the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the occurrence of an unlawful act, the damage and the causal link, the required level of certainty is lower than in criminal proceedings. In sum, the non-indictment of the police officers did not have any decisive negative repercussions on the prospects of a civil claim by the applicant. ",

In my view, it is not for the Government to provide an explanation for an injury which the applicant could have suffered at any time between his release and his first medical examination. Immediately following his release, the applicant should have reported his injuries to the authorities and obtained a medical opinion without delay. By failing, or delaying, to do so, it must be accepted that an individual considerably diminishes his chances of substantiating that he was ill-treated in custody and makes it very difficult, even impossible, for independent investigating authorities to discover the real facts at issue.",

There were no eye-witnesses to the alleged ill-treatment, and notwithstanding a subsequent rigorous and thorough domestic investigation (see judgment, paragraphs 64 to 66) it was not possible to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been ill-treated by the police. The judgment in the present case requires the Government to establish to the Court\u2019s satisfaction the cause of the applicant\u2019s injuries, even though the injuries could have been sustained after his release. By doing so, I feel that the Court unjustifiably extends the much stricter liability rule for injuries sustained in custody to the post-custody period, a period about which the authorities have limited information and in respect of which they have a more limited responsibility. This extended liability and reversed burden of proof",
