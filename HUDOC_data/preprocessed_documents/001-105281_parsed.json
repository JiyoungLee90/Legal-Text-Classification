The remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred (see McFarlane v.\u00a0Ireland [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 107-108 and Kud\u0142a v.

Consequently, if the Court required exhaustion of domestic remedies regarding Article 13 complaints then Article 13 of the Convention would have to guarantee also effective remedies for alleged violations of Article 13 itself.
