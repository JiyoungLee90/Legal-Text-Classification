Under these provisions, the investigating judge, in addition to conducting the investigation, is also authorised to order the defendant\u2019s detention. The defendant whose detention was so ordered in his absence shall be served with this order upon arrest or, at the latest, within 24 hours thereafter. The defendant shall then have the right to lodge an appeal against this order, which appeal must be filed within 24 hours and considered by a three-judge panel of the same court within another 48 hours. The defendant and his counsel have no right to be heard in person on this occasion but the three-judge panel, if it so decides, may invite them to appear and state their views orally (see, also, Article 262). The investigating judge can order detention for up to one month. Throughout the judicial investigation stage of the proceedings, the defendant is not explicitly entitled to request his release, but the investigating judge may release the defendant with the consent of the competent public prosecutor. If there is disagreement between the two, the issue shall be resolved by a three-judge panel of the same court, within 48 hours. The defendant and his counsel have no right to be heard in person on this occasion (ibid.). The three-judge panel may also extend the defendant\u2019s pre-indictment detention for another two months, without having heard him or his counsel in person (ibid.).

Poland, no.\u00a027785/95, \u00a7\u00a090, ECHR 2000-XI). Secondly, even assuming that all of these remedies can be considered relevant, the Government have failed to provide any domestic jurisprudence indicating that, in a case such as the applicant\u2019s, it was indeed possible to obtain any other detention-related redress under Article 199 of the Obligations Act, Article 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or, for that matter, on the basis of legislation described at paragraphs 31-34 above. Thirdly, the Court finds that it was only the public prosecutor who could have filed a Request for the Protection of Legality on behalf of the applicant and, moreover, the former had full discretion in respect of whether to do so. This remedy was thus also ineffective as understood by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Lepoji\u0107 v. , no. 13909/05, \u00a7 54, 6 November 2007).
