This period is considerable, but it appears that the delay was caused by the applicant\u2019s opposition to the enforcement. In compliance with the judgment the Town Council several times offered to the applicant the housing voucher provided for in the judgment, but he refused it and instead sought alternatives modes of enforcement. In these circumstances, the Court sees no fault on the part of the authorities in the non-enforcement of the judgment.",

On 12 May 2003 the Tsentralnyi District Court of Kemerovo ordered the Town Council to provide the applicant\u2019s family with a dwelling (\u201czhiloe pomeschenie\u201d in Russian) in strict conformity with the provisions of section 15(14) of the Law on the Status of Servicemen: to provide retired servicemen who have served in the army for more than ten years with a dwelling within three months. Taking into account the fact that the Town Council did not provide the applicant with a dwelling \u201cfor a long time\u201d, the District Court specified that enforcement could be secured \u201cby way, among other means, of State housing vouchers ... and also by way of off-budget financial sources\u201d (paragraph 7). To my mind, the proposed alternative did not deprive the applicant of his right to have a council flat within the time fixed by the above-mentioned Law, as its purpose was to find a solution to that end.",

The Government did not show that the voucher was an effective mode of enforcement of the District Court\u2019s judgment, nor did it give any example of this means of enforcement, at least in the  region. I regret the lack of any concrete information regarding the implementation of the Federal Programme on \u201cState Housing Vouchers\u201d of 20 January 1998. Unfortunately, there are several examples of non-enforcement of national courts\u2019 judgments ordering the provision of citizens with flats (see, among other authorities, Sypchenko v. , no. 38368/04, 1\u00a0March 2007) in which the Court has held that the enforcement of these judgments should be secured by appropriate means.",
