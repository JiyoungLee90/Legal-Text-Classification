The case originated in an application (no. 50124/13) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Momčilo Milenković (“the applicant”), on 12 June 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr Z. Đušić, a lawyer practising in Leskovac. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs V. Rodić.
The applicant alleged that his right not to be tried twice had been violated.
On 15 January 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Leskovac.
On 17 October 2006 the Leskovac police informed the local minor-offence judge and the public prosecutor’s office about a violent incident between the applicant and a certain R.C. that had occurred on 12 October 2006 in a neighbourhood of Leskovac.
By a decision of 6 November 2007 the misdemeanour court judge in Leskovac (sudija Opštinskog organa za prekršaje u Leskovcu) found that at about 5.30 p.m. on 12 October 2006 in Leskovac R.C. had verbally insulted the applicant’s children, and the applicant had then punched him several times on the head and injured him. The judge concluded that these actions had been in breach of public order and peace and had thus been contrary to Article 6(3) of the Public Order Act 1992 (see paragraph 21 below under Relevant domestic law and practice). The relevant part of the decision reads:
“Defendant[s] R.C. ... and Momčilo Milenković are guilty in that at about 5.30 p.m. on 12 October 2006, in Subotička street in Leskovac, [the former first swore and insulted the applicant’s children], while the latter punched R.C. several times on the head and injured him ...”
Each of them was ordered to pay a fine in the amount of 4,000 Serbian dinars (RSD) plus RSD 700 for costs (at that time equivalent to approximately 60 euros (EUR) in total), which in the event of non-compliance would be converted into a prison term of eight days.
After an investigation had been conducted, on 4 April 2007 the Leskovac Public Prosecutor’s Office (“the LPPO”) charged the applicant with the criminal offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm on R.C. in connection with the above incident, contrary to Article 121 § 2 of the Criminal Code 1998. The LPPO, as well as the applicant and his family in the capacity of private prosecutors, lodged separate indictments against R.C. for several offences. All the indictments were joined in the same proceedings before the Leskovac Municipal Court.
In a judgment of 13 April 2011 the Leskovac Municipal Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment. R.C. was found guilty and fined for insulting the applicant’s family and causing minor bodily injuries to the applicant’s mother. The court ordered the applicant to pay RSD 14,739 in court costs, while each party was to cover its own costs and expenses.
The relevant part of the decision reads:
“Defendant Milenković Momčilo ... is guilty in that
at about 4.00 and 4.30 p.m on 12 October 2006 in Subotička Street ... he punched [R.C.] on the left side of the face and, after knocking R.C. down, he continued punching him in the head, thereby causing him a number of grievous bodily injuries dangerous for life, such as: bruising of both eyelids (black eye), bruising of the left cornea, and nose abrasions ...”
The applicant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that he had already been punished in respect of the same incident by the Leskovac misdemeanour judge, with the result that the principle of ne bis in idem had been violated (see paragraph 18 below).
On 20 March 2012 the Niš Appeals Court upheld the judgment in respect of the applicant and dismissed the charges against R.C. as statute-barred. As regards the principle of ne bis in idem, the court held that the applicant had been found guilty of a misdemeanour against public order and peace in the misdemeanour proceedings, whereas he had been convicted of the criminal offence of grievous bodily harm in the criminal proceedings. According to the court, the descriptions of the acts sanctioned therefore clearly differed.
On 19 September 2012, the Leskovac Basic Court converted the prison sentence to house arrest without electronic monitoring.
On 29 November 2012 the Leskovac Basic Court amnestied the applicant at his request, finding that the conditions for a statutory amnesty were applicable (see paragraph 22 below).
In a subsequent constitutional appeal lodged on 25 May 2012 the applicant reiterated that he had been tried and punished twice for the same offence, in breach of Article 34 § 4 of the Constitution (see paragraph 13 below).
On 20 May 2013 the Constitutional Court, referring to the reasoning of the Niš Appeals Court as “fully acceptable from the constitutional point of view” (see paragraph 12 above), dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded. The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant’s representative on 29 May 2013.
The Constitution of the Republic of Serbia (published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia - OG RS – no. 98/06) guarantees, under Article 34 § 4, that no person may be prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence for which he has been acquitted or convicted by a final judgment, for which the charges have been dropped or criminal proceedings have been discontinued by a final decision. The same prohibitions should be applicable to all other proceedings conducted for any other act punishable by law.
The language of Article 6 § 1 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Zakon o krivičnom postupku, published in the Official Gazette of the SRY, nos. 70/01 and 68/02 and OG RS nos. 58/04, 85/05, 115/05, 46/06, 49/07 and 122/08), corresponds to Article 34 § 4 of the Constitution 2006 referred to above.
According to Article 8 of the Misdemeanours Act 2005 (Zakon o prekršajima, published in OG RS nos. 101/05, 116/08 and 111/09) no one shall be sanctioned in minor offences proceedings two or more times for the same misdemeanour, nor may a person be punished for a misdemeanour if he or she has been convicted by a final decision in criminal or commercial proceedings of an offence which has the same essential elements as the misdemeanour in question.
Article 121 § 2 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Serbia 2005 (Krivični zakonik Republike Srbije, published in OG RS, nos. 85/2005, 88/2005, 107/2005, 72/2009, 111/2009, 121/2012 and 104/2013) provides that “whoever inflicts bodily injury on another or impairs another’s health shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year and not exceeding eight years.” Under Article 50 § 3 the competent court could impose a sanction below the prescribed minimum in the event that there were mitigating circumstances.
Article 6(3) of the Public Order Act (Zakon o javnom redu i miru, published in OG RS nos. 851/92, 53/93, 67/93, 48/94, 85/05 and 101/05) provides that anyone who disturbs the peace in a public place by verbally or physically attacking another person, or by inciting or participating in a fight, is committing a misdemeanour against public order and shall be fined in an amount up to RSD 30,000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding sixty days.
The Amnesty Act (Zakon o amnestiji, published in OG RS no. 107/12, came into force on 17 November 2012), stipulated, inter alia, that all first offenders who received a prison sentence of up to three months shall be exempted from serving their prison sentence.
On 26 March 2014 and 12 June 2014, the Constitutional Court, sitting in chambers of eight judges, examined complaints concerning the ne bis in idem principle in two cases similar to the present one (see Už. 1207/2011 and Už. 1285/2012). In its reasoning the court directly relied on this Court’s case-law established in Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22; Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia ([GC], no. 14939/03, ECHR 2009, Maresti v. Croatia, no. 55759/07, 25 June 2009; and Muslija v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 32042/11, 14 January 2014.
