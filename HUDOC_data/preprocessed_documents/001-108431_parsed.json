The adequacy of the measures taken is to be judged by the swiftness of their implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for the relationship between the child and the parent who does not live with him or her; at the same time the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the children live, even though coercive measures against the children are not desirable in this sensitive area (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 106).",
