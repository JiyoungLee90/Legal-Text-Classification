The Disciplinary Council took reasoned decisions on the applicant\u2019s dismissal, which were then reviewed by the Supreme Court of Georgia, sitting as an ordinary final court of cassation (see paragraphs 8-12 above). Given therefore that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant were conducted by bodies which clearly performed a judicial function, with the Disciplinary Council clearly representing \u201ca tribunal\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, it cannot be concluded that domestic law \u201cexpressly excluded access to court\u201d in the applicant\u2019s case (see, mutatis mutandis, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89-91; H. v.

Impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias and its existence can be tested in various ways. The Court has thus distinguished between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction of a given judge in a given case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, amongst many other authorities, Piersack v. Belgium, 1st\u00a0October 1982, \u00a7\u00a030, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a053). Under the latter approach, what is decisive is whether the fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality can be held, irrespective of the judge\u2019s real personal standpoint, to be objectively justified (see Wettstein v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a033958/96, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR\u00a02000XII). Indeed, whilst it may often be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the personal impartiality of a judge, the requirement of objective impartiality provides, in this respect, a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10\u00a0June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III). In other words, the Court has recognised the difficulty of establishing a breach of Article\u00a06 on account of subjective partiality and for this reason has in the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between the two notions, since a judge\u2019s conduct may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test), but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR\u00a02005XIII; and Oluji\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058).",

The Panel conducted a hearing, examined all the evidence and then delivered a reasoned decision on 23 December 2004 finding the applicant guilty of a disciplinary offence and punishing him with dismissal (see paragraph 8 above). The judicial decision contained an interpretation and application of the relevant legal provisions to the facts of the case.",

In other words, on appeal, the same four judges were called upon to reconsider their own decision in the same case in its entirety, to review whether or not they themselves had committed any error in their assessment of the facts or of legal interpretation (compare with San Leonard Band Club v. Malta, no. 77562/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06166, ECHR\u00a02004IX; Indra v. Slovakia, no. 46845/99, \u00a7\u00a7 51-55, 1\u00a0February 2005; and HIT d.d. Nova Gorica v. Slovenia, no. 50996/08, \u00a7\u00a7 37-42, 5\u00a0June 2014; contrast with Warsicka v.\u00a0Poland, no. 2065/03, \u00a7\u00a7 43-47, 16\u00a0January 2007, and Central Mediterranean Development Corporation Limited v.\u00a0Malta (no. 2), no. 18544/08, \u00a7\u00a7 35-38, 22 November 2011). The Court also notes that the eight-member plenary of the Disciplinary Council took, at the material time, appellate decisions by a simple majority, with its President possessing the casting vote in the event of a tie (see section\u00a068(1) of the Disciplinary Proceedings Act, cited at paragraph 17 above). That meant that half of the bench, including its President, had been previously involved in examining the case at first instance (see, mutatis mutandis, Perote Pellon v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a045238/99, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52, 25\u00a0July 2002; Cardona Serrat v. Spain, no.\u00a038715/06, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 38, 26\u00a0October 2010; and Fazl\u0131 Aslaner v. Turkey, no.\u00a036073/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39, 4\u00a0March 2014). Furthermore, given that the Supreme Court\u2019s review of the disciplinary proceedings was clearly limited to the assessment of the questions of law (see paragraphs\u00a012 and 18 above), the Court has certain misgivings about the cassation instance\u2019s ability to handle the matter effectively (compare with, mutatis mutandis, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 126-128, and contrast with A.\u00a0Menarini Diagnostics S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 43509/08, \u00a7 64, 27\u00a0September 2011). In the eyes of the Court, those circumstances are sufficient to allow it to hold that the applicant\u2019s fears as to a lack of impartiality on the part of the Disciplinary Council were objectively justified.",
