While the publicity requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 served to protect litigants against the administration of justice in secret and to maintain confidence in the courts, Article 5 \u00a7 4 was aimed in particular at protecting the individual against arbitrary deprivation of liberty by guaranteeing a speedy review of the lawfulness of his detention. A general requirement to give the public access to such hearings risked jeopardising the speediness of the review. In this context, the Government submitted that the Code of Criminal Procedure provided short time-limits within which the court had to review the lawfulness of pre-trial detention of its own motion until the indictment was preferred. In addition, the detainee could at any time request his release. In the present case, the applicant had been taken into pre-trial detention on 6\u00a0May 2000.

Public scrutiny of hearings on pre-trial detention would help to verify the independence of the court and to ensure the absence of arbitrariness.

However, this application is limited to certain aspects. It flows from the autonomous meaning to be given to the notion of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d and concerns, apart from the starting-point of the proceedings for the purpose of assessing their reasonable length, procedural guarantees which, if not observed at the pre-trial stage, would prejudice the fairness of the proceedings taken as a whole (see Imbrioscia, loc. cit.). This has been found to be the case, for example, when a detained person has been denied access to a lawyer during the initial police interrogation where the rights of the defence may be irretrievably prejudiced (see John Murray, cited above, p. 55, \u00a7 66).

In the latter case it provides for the right to be brought promptly before a judge or other judicial officer and the right to a reasonable duration of pre-trial detention (Article 5 \u00a7 3) and, as for other types of detention, the right to a speedy review of its lawfulness (Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04).
