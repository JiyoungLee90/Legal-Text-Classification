Article 13 states that any individual whose Convention rights and freedoms 'are violated' is to have an effective remedy before a national authority even where 'the violation has been committed' by persons in an official capacity. This provision, read literally, seems to say that a person is entitled to a national remedy only if a 'violation' has occurred. However, a person cannot establish a 'violation' before a national authority unless he is first able to lodge with such an authority a complaint to that effect. Consequently,.... it cannot be a prerequisite for the application of Article\u00a013 that the Convention be in fact violated. In the Court's view, Article 13 requires that where an individual considers himself to have been prejudiced by a measure allegedly in breach of the Convention, he should have a remedy before a national authority in order both to have his claim decided and, if appropriate, to obtain redress. Thus Article 13 must be interpreted as guaranteeing an 'effective remedy before a national authority' to everyone who claims that his rights and freedoms under the Convention have been violated.\u201d",

At the same time, relying on Article 13 of the Convention, the applicant argued that he had been unable to obtain sufficient compensation for the damage resulting from the inhuman treatment inflicted by a State agent. In this regard the Court reiterates that the nature of the right guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention, being one of the most fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, has implications for the nature of the remedies which must be guaranteed to the applicant. In particular, the Court has already held on a number of occasions that where the applicant has an arguable claim that he was ill-treated by agents of the State, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article\u00a013 entails the payment of compensation where appropriate, in addition to a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 98, Reports 1996-VI, and Ayd\u0131n v. Turkey, 25 September 1997, \u00a7 103, Reports 1997VI).

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The Court has already noted that the scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095, and Mente\u015f and Others v. Turkey, 28 November 1997, \u00a7 89, Reports 1997VIII).

Furthermore, in the case of a breach of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be available as part of the range of redress (see Z and Others v. the  [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7\u00a0109, ECHR 2001V).",

Russia, no. 41461/02, \u00a7 79, 24 July 2008). The applicant submitted that he had attempted to obtain redress for the ill-treatment suffered by bringing two tort actions. However, he argued that the remedy was not sufficiently effective to comply with Article 13 of the Convention, as it did not provide adequate redress. It is apparent from the above that the Court must examine whether the judicial avenue for obtaining compensation for the damage sustained by the applicant represented an effective, adequate and accessible remedy capable of satisfying the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention.",

The domestic courts partly allowed the action, awarding the applicant RUB 10,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, and instructed him to bring a separate action for compensation in respect of the injuries suffered to his person (see paragraph 19 above). The award was never enforced as Mr N. did not have the requisite funds. Subsequently, the applicant brought an action against a number of State agencies, including the Yemelyanovskiy district police department which had employed officer N., arguing that the amount of compensation awarded was inadequate and had not in fact been paid to him. He further argued that the courts should hold the State accountable and punish it for the outrageous conduct of its agent, in order to act as a deterrent to future offences, and should thus award him sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. On 3 April 2003 the Sverdlovskiy District Court dismissed the action, holding that the situation in which the applicant had found himself was not covered by the legal provisions abrogating the State's immunity from tort liability and establishing the conditions for suits and claims against the State for damage caused by unlawful acts or omissions of its agencies and officials. In addition, the District Court found that the applicant had already made use of his right to obtain redress by successfully introducing the tort action against the direct tortfeasor, Mr N. (see paragraph 24 above). On 16 July 2003 the , having examined the applicant's appeal, confirmed the overall correctness of the District Court's decision to dismiss the action. However, the  amended the District Court's reasoning by setting aside its conclusion as to the inapplicability of the legal provisions on the State's liability, while endorsing the finding that the applicant had already benefited from the right to claim reparation of the damage from the perpetrator of the injury (see paragraph 25 above).",

The domestic courts awarded him RUB 10,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage to be paid by Mr N. The applicant's dissatisfaction with the amount of the award does not in itself demonstrate that a tort action was an ineffective remedy for airing such complaints. In this connection the Court notes that the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see \u010conka v.

However, the Court is mindful of the fact that in the sphere of enforcement of judgments of a civil character the State's positive obligation under the Convention is limited to organising a system for enforcement of judgments which is effective both in law and in practice, and ensuring their enforcement without undue delay (see Sanglier v.

There was nothing to stop the applicant bringing such an action at the appropriate moment and arguing that the State should be held liable for Mr N.'s actions and should pay compensation for the injury sustained. The Court is of the opinion that, had the applicant chosen that avenue instead of introducing an action against Mr N. within the criminal case, he could have excluded the risk of obtaining an award against an insolvent defendant.

The applicant's allegations, which were detailed and consistent throughout the domestic proceedings and before this Court, were, at least to some extent, corroborated by a medical certificate recording an injury to the left side of his chest.

In the present case the applicant brought his allegations of ill-treatment to the attention of the authorities by making a complaint to the Sverdlovskiy district prosecutor (see paragraph 33 above). The prosecutor did not launch an investigation after being notified of the alleged beatings. Instead he remitted the applicant's complaint to the Sverdlovskiy district police department, a State authority whose employees were implicated in the events which were to be looked into, with an order to conduct an official police inquiry (see paragraph 34 above). While the Court acknowledges the necessity of internal inquiries by the police with a view to possible disciplinary sanctions in cases of alleged police abuse, it finds it striking that in the present case the initial investigative steps, which usually prove to be crucial for the establishment of the truth in cases of police brutality, were conducted by the police force itself (see, for similar reasoning, Vladimir Fedorov v. Russia, no. 19223/04, \u00a7 69, 30 July 2009). In this connection the Court reiterates its finding made on a number of occasions that the investigation should be carried out by competent, qualified and impartial experts who are independent of the suspected perpetrators and the agency they serve (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR 2007..., and O\u011fur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, ECHR 1999III). Furthermore, although the thoroughness of the investigation into the applicant's ill-treatment complaints will be examined below, the Court would already stress at this juncture that it is not convinced that, despite relying on the police officers' statements in the decision of 18 February 2002, the assistant prosecutor had heard evidence from them in person. It appears that he merely recounted the officers' statements made during the internal inquiry. The Court, however, is mindful of the important role which investigative interviews play in obtaining accurate and reliable information from suspects, witnesses and victims and, in the end, the discovery of the truth about the matter under investigation. Observing the suspects', witnesses' and victims' demeanour during questioning and assessing the probative value of their testimony forms a substantial part of the investigative process.",

The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. , nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a055 and 118, ECHR 2000X). The Court observes that an expeditious expert medical examination of the applicant was particularly crucial in the circumstances of the present case in the absence of conclusive medical evidence of the physical violence alleged by the applicant. In addition, having regard to the psychological effects which physical violence usually produces, the Court considers that evidence of psychological symptoms or trauma could also have been collected and assessed. A combination of physical and psychological evidence could, accordingly, have been used to corroborate or disprove the applicant's allegations. In this connection the Court notes with concern that the lack of objective evidence\u00a0\u2013 such as medical expert examinations could have provided \u2013 was subsequently relied on as a ground for refusing to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers.",

Although excerpts from the applicant's testimony were included in the decision not to institute criminal proceedings, the prosecution authorities did not consider that testimony to be credible, apparently because it reflected a personal opinion and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant. However, the investigator did regard the police officers' testimonies as credible, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics and have been aimed at damaging the applicant's credibility. In the Court's view, the prosecution investigation applied different standards when assessing the testimonies, as that given by the applicant was deemed to be subjective, but not those given by the police officers. The credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation was supposed to establish whether the officers were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a046317/99, \u00a7\u00a099, 23\u00a0February 2006).",

While the investigating authorities may not have been provided with the names of individuals who might have seen the applicant at the police station or might have witnessed his alleged beating, they were expected to take steps on their own initiative to identify possible eyewitnesses. Furthermore, the Court considers it odd that it took the investigator almost a year to question the former police trainee, Ms I. (see paragraph 41 above). By the time of the first interview in September 2002 Ms I. was already a serving police officer within a system which requires loyalty and submission to certain constraints. The Court considers that the change in Ms I.'s status could have influenced the content of the statements she made.",

Instead the authorities concentrated on finding an explanation for the applicant's arrest and detention in the police station and on disproving his allegations of forgery of the records. The Court would stress once again the odd nature of the prosecution authorities' actions when in the first days of the investigation they commissioned an expert examination of the signatures on the arrest report but omitted to request a medical examination of the applicant (see paragraph 36 above). An interview with the head of the trauma unit is another example of the authorities' unorthodox investigative technique (see paragraph 41 above). The Court finds it striking that the deputy prosecutor devoted that interview to verifying the allegations of the applicant's drunkenness rather than to soliciting a medical opinion as to the nature and cause of the applicant's injury.",

Furthermore, the Court is mindful of the fact that while both the district and regional courts supported the deputy prosecutor's decision of 20 September 2002 to close the investigation, finding it to be well-founded and correct, the very same decision was quashed by a higher-ranking prosecutor two months later on the ground that the investigation was incomplete and the decision had been premature (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above).",

Russia, no.\u00a041461/02, \u00a7 79, 24 July 2008). The applicant submitted that he had attempted to obtain redress for the ill-treatment suffered by bringing two tort actions. However, he argued that the remedy was not sufficiently effective to comply with Article 13 of the Convention, as it did not provide adequate redress. It is apparent from the above that the Court must examine whether the judicial avenue for obtaining compensation for the damage sustained by the applicant represented an effective, adequate and accessible remedy capable of satisfying the requirements of Article 13.",

The domestic courts partly allowed the action, awarding the applicant RUB 10,000 (approximately EUR 340) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, and instructed him to bring a separate action for compensation in respect of the injuries suffered to his person (see paragraph 19 of the judgment). The award was never enforced as Mr N. did not have the requisite funds. Subsequently, the applicant brought an action against a number of State agencies, including the Yemelyanovskiy district police department which had employed officer N., arguing that the amount of compensation awarded was inadequate and had not in fact been paid to him. He further argued that the courts should hold the State accountable and punish it for the outrageous conduct of its agent, in order to act as a deterrent to future offences, and should thus award him sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. On 3 April 2003 the Sverdlovskiy District Court dismissed the action, holding that the situation in which the applicant had found himself was not covered by the legal provisions abrogating the State's immunity from tort liability and establishing the conditions for suits and claims against the State for damage caused by unlawful acts or omissions of its agencies and officials. In addition, the District Court found that the applicant had already made use of his right to obtain redress by successfully introducing the tort action against the direct tortfeasor, Mr N. (see paragraph 24 of the judgment). On 16 July 2003 the , having examined the applicant's appeal, confirmed the overall correctness of the District Court's decision to dismiss the action. However, the Regional Court amended the District Court's reasoning by setting aside its conclusion as to the inapplicability of the legal provisions concerning the State's liability, while endorsing the finding that the applicant had already benefited from the right to claim reparation of the damage from the perpetrator of the injury (see paragraph\u00a025 of the judgment).",

The applicant availed himself of that possibility by lodging an action against the direct tortfeasor (see paragraph 19 of the judgment) and subsequently by bringing a claim against various State agencies seeking compensation for the damage he had sustained on account of the ill-treatment (see paragraph 23 of the judgment). It follows that in the present case it is absolutely necessary to verify whether the way in which the domestic law was interpreted and applied by the domestic courts in the process of implementation of the compensatory remedy produced consequences that are consistent with the Convention principles, as interpreted in the light of the Court's case-law (see Scordino v. Italy (no.\u00a01) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0187-191, ECHR 2006V).",

In this connection we note that the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see \u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2002I). At the same time, the Convention must be interpreted in such a way as to guarantee rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory (see, among other authorities, Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 37; Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 87, Series A no. 161; and Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden, 20 March 1991, \u00a7 99, Series\u00a0A no. 201). That also applies to the right enshrined in Article 13 of the Convention. The Court has already held on a number of occasions that the notion of an effective remedy under Article 13 requires that the remedy should be capable of resulting in an award of fair and reasonable damages proportionate to the loss suffered (see Vdovina v. , no. 13458/07, \u00a7\u00a029, 18 June 2009; Wasserman v. Russia (no. 2), no. 21071/05, \u00a7 49, 10\u00a0April 2008; and, mutatis mutandis, Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2006V, with further references).",

We are mindful of the fact that the task of estimating damages to be awarded is a difficult one. It is especially difficult in a case where personal suffering, whether physical or mental, is the subject of the claim. There is no standard by which pain and suffering, physical discomfort and mental distress and anguish can be measured in terms of money. However, we cannot overlook the fact that the amount of RUB 10,000 awarded in the circumstances of the case appears to be disproportionately low, particularly if compared to what the Court generally awards in similar Russian cases (see, for example, Barabanshchikov v. , no. 36220/02, \u00a7 70, 8\u00a0January 2009, and Nadrosov v.

In this connection we reiterate that, while emphasising the importance of a reasonable amount of just satisfaction being offered by the domestic system for the remedy in question to be considered effective under the Convention, the Court has held on a number of occasions that a wider margin of appreciation is left to the domestic courts in assessing the amount of compensation to be paid in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and consonant with the standard of living in the country concerned, even if that results in awards of amounts that are lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases (see Cocchiarella, cited above, \u00a7 80). The Court has also accepted that, in some cases, the alleged violation of the Convention right may result in minimal non-pecuniary damage or no non-pecuniary damage at all. However, in such cases the domestic courts will have to justify their decision by giving sufficient reasons (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 203-204). One of the purposes of a reasoned decision is to demonstrate to the parties that their claims have been given due consideration (see, mutatis mutandis, Suominen v. , no. 37801/97, \u00a7 37, 1 July 2003). The importance of Article 13 for preserving the subsidiary nature of the Convention system must be stressed in that individuals' complaints must be adequately addressed in the first place within the national legal system (see \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7 84, and Kud\u0142a v.

In this regard we observe that the district and regional courts did not rely on any reasons justifying the amount of compensation awarded to the applicant. It is not apparent from the domestic judgments what issues the courts took into account, what domestic standards on compensation they used or what method of calculation they employed for determining the amount of compensation. The Government did not provide the Court with any evidence demonstrating the nature of the test applied by the domestic courts in assessing the applicant's claims and showing that it was based on Convention principles and coincided with the Court's own approach. There was also no explanation for the domestic courts' refusal to examine the merits of the applicant's claim for compensation for health damage resulting from his ill-treatment. We are mindful of the fact that the lack of reasoning by the domestic courts may demonstrate the existence of a substantial degree of uncertainty and ambiguity as to the exact status, scope and content of the right to obtain redress for a violation of Article 3 guarantees and the manner in which this right operated in practice. In these circumstances we harbour doubts as to whether the applicant had an effective opportunity to make before the domestic courts his Convention points regarding his rights not to be subjected to ill-treatment and to obtain full reparation for it.",

Given the complete lack of reasoning behind the disproportionately low amount of compensation awarded to the applicant by the domestic courts, we strongly believe that the courts did not give due consideration to the applicant's claims and failed to act on the principle that the wrong should be adequately and effectively remedied. We are not convinced that the domestic courts in the present case, acting out of a genuine desire to be just and eminently reasonable, attempted to assess the effect which the instance of ill-treatment had had on the applicant's well-being (see, mutatis mutandis, Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2001-II) and to determine the level of physical suffering, emotional distress, anxiety or other harmful effects sustained by the applicant (see Nardone v. Italy (dec.), no. 34368/02, 25 November 2004). Having regard to this finding and taking into account the fact that Article 13 gives direct expression to the States' obligation to protect human rights first and foremost within their own legal system, establishing an additional guarantee for an individual in order to ensure that he or she effectively enjoys those rights (see Al-Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, \u00a7 132, 20 June 2002), we are therefore bound to conclude that the Russian authorities did not comply with their obligation to secure the applicant's right guaranteed by that Convention provision.",

While accepting that he had had a choice of legal avenues to pursue in his attempt to obtain compensation for the ill-treatment suffered, the applicant stressed that there was no clear indication in Russian law as to what remedy could have provided him with a more tangible result or, if only an aggregate of remedies could have been effective in his case, what would have been the correct order in which to pursue them. In this respect the applicant's argument goes to the heart of the Convention principle that even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 152, and T.P. and K.M., cited above, \u00a7 107).

Russia, no. 7188/03, \u00a7 71, 3 July 2008).

As to the second avenue we reiterate that, as is clear from the domestic courts' interpretation of the provisions of the Russian Civil Code on State liability, by obtaining a judicial award against police officer N. the applicant lost the right to claim compensation from the State (see paragraph 25 of the judgment). Having found that this remedy was no longer open to the applicant after he had obtained the judgment award against Mr N., we do not need to proceed with the analysis any further. However, we do not lose sight of the Government's implied argument that the applicant was responsible for the legal choices he made, in so far as he could have introduced an action jointly against Mr N. and the State after the latter's conviction instead of opting to become a civil party to the criminal case.",

Firstly, we are not convinced that the provisions of the Russian Civil Code, in particular Articles 150, 151, 1069 and 1070, which the domestic courts cited in dismissing the applicant's action (see paragraph 24 of the judgment above), afforded the applicant sufficient safeguards to prevent a misunderstanding as to the procedures for making use of the available remedies and the restrictions stemming from the simultaneous use of them. In that connection we consider that neither the wording of those provisions nor their legislative history could have given the applicant any idea what legal inferences the domestic courts would draw from his legal choice to introduce an action against Mr N. first. In other words, they gave him no reason to think that his action against Mr N. might result in his being deprived of standing to bring proceedings against the State in order to obtain a higher sum in compensation than he had been already awarded against Mr N. We note that neither the Government nor the domestic courts relied on any legal provision making clear the type of liability (subsidiary, joint and several, and so on) which the State bore for the actions of its officials in circumstances similar to those under examination. In particular, the courts did not substantiate their position that the applicant did not have the right in law to bring a civil claim against the State subject to the condition that in the new proceedings the compensation already awarded to him would be taken into account in order to determine whether he had received full and adequate redress. Therefore, we consider that the applicant could reasonably believe that it was possible to pursue an action in the domestic courts to claim compensation from the State even after he had been awarded damages to be paid by Mr N.",

In view of the applicant's situation at that time, he cannot be criticised for pursuing the avenue which met his most urgent needs, that is, a civil claim within the criminal proceedings against Mr N., since he was entitled to think that if he were to introduce an action against Mr N. and be dissatisfied with the outcome he would not be deprived of his right to bring proceedings against the State.",
