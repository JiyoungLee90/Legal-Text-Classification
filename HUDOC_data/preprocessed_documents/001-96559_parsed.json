The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 162, Series\u00a0A no. 25). In the context of deprivation of liberty the Court has consistently stressed that to fall under Article 3 the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with the detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, 25 April 1978, \u00a7 30, Series A no.\u00a026, and Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 100, Series A no.\u00a0161). The Court often faces allegations of insufficient or inadequate medical care in places of detention. In exceptional circumstances, Article 3 may go as far as requiring the conditional liberation of a prisoner who is seriously ill or disabled. Thus, in Farbtuhs v. Latvia, (no. 4672/02, 2\u00a0December 2004), the Court concluded that the detention of a disabled seventy-nine-year-old applicant was in breach of Article 3 on account of \u201chis age, infirmity and health situation\u201d (see also Papon v.

This test was further developed in the case of Gelfmann v. France (no.\u00a025875/03, 14 December 2004), where the Court took into account, among other relevant factors, the dynamics of the applicant\u2019s health condition, the possibility of conditional release or parole for a seriously ill detainee if his health deteriorated, and the applicant\u2019s own attitude (namely his persistent refusal to cooperate with the doctors).\u00a0In the cases of Henaf\u00a0v.\u00a0France (no. 65436/01, \u00a7\u00a7 49 et seq., ECHR 2003XI) and Mouisel (cited above) the Court also analysed whether the application of handcuffs or the shackling of a seriously ill detainee to his bed was justified by any security risks.

Thus, on the basis of the information before it, the Court is unable to assess whether the lack of treatment of the applicant\u2019s angiopathy amounted to a lack of provision of requisite medical assistance. As to the applicant\u2019s claim of a possible link between the lack of treatment of the angiopathy and the subsequent stroke, the Court once again notes that no medical evidence or expert opinion was presented to that effect other than the applicant\u2019s assertions. Thus, it would be pure speculation on the part of the Court to conclude one way or another as to a possible causal link, if any, between the two conditions.",

In particular, within weeks of the discovery of the encephalomacic lesion and the conclusion that the applicant could not be adequately treated in prison facilities a proposal had been made to the competent courts which eventually led to the applicant\u2019s release on bail. As to the delay in acting on the said proposals, the Court notes that during this period the applicant continued to be at  where medical assistance was available and specialised assistance could be provided in case of need while the applicant had difficulties in following the required course of treatment after release due to financial constraints. Therefore, the Court does not consider that the length of the delay can in itself be considered to have amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in contravention of Article 3 of the Convention.",
