In the context of searches and seizures, the domestic law must provide some protection to the individual against arbitrary interference with Article\u00a08 rights. Thus, the domestic law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances and conditions under which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures. Moreover, search and seizure represent a serious interference with private life, home and correspondence and must accordingly be based on a \u201claw\u201d that is particularly precise. It is essential to have clear, detailed rules on the subject (see Sallinen and Others v.\u00a0Finland, no.\u00a050882/99, \u00a7\u00a7 82 and 90, 27 September 2005).",

It has emphasised that professional secrecy is the basis of the relationship of trust existing between a lawyer and his client and that the safeguarding of professional secrecy is in particular the corollary of the right of a lawyer\u2019s client not to incriminate himself, which presupposes that the authorities seek to prove their case without resorting to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the \u201cperson charged\u201d (see, for example, Andr\u00e9 and Another v. France, no. 18603/03, \u00a7 41, 24 July 2008). However, in its case-law, the Court has distinguished between the question of whether Article\u00a08 has been violated in respect of investigative measures and the question of possible ramifications of a finding to that effect on rights guaranteed under Article 6 (see, for example, among many other authorities, Drago\u0219 Ioan Rusu v. Romania, no. 22767/08, \u00a7 52, 31 October 2017; and Dumitru Popescu v. Romania (no. 2), no. 71525/01, \u00a7 106, 26 April 2007, with further references). Moreover, the Court has stressed that it is clearly in the general interest that any person who wishes to consult a lawyer should be free to do so under conditions which favour full and uninhibited discussion and that it is for that reason that the lawyer-client relationship is, in principle, privileged. It has not limited that consideration to matters relating to pending litigation only and has emphasised that, whether in the context of assistance for civil or criminal litigation or in the context of seeking general legal advice, individuals who consult a lawyer can reasonably expect that their communication is private and confidential (see, for example, Altay v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 11236/06, \u00a7\u00a7 49-51, 9 April 2019, and the references therein).",

It also observes that the Code of Criminal Procedure did not include any express provisions originally designed to prescribe the procedure for such situations in which LPP could be at stake. There was however initial common ground between the police and the applicant that in order to ensure that LPP was not compromised, the data on the mirror image copy had to be sifted out by the City Court and any LPP data removed before the police could search the remainder. The legal basis for that procedure would be an application by analogy of Article 205 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 6 and 29 above). The City Court appears to have shared this understanding and proceeded accordingly in order to have the filtering carried out (see paragraphs 6-7 above). Nonetheless, there was, in the absence of any express and specific rules on the matter, subsequent disagreement as to how the City Court could go about it in practical terms, including whether it could seek assistance from the police (see paragraphs 8-11 above).",

After obtaining the views of the persons involved in the applicant\u2019s case concerning that new decision, the City Court concluded that owing to the Supreme Court\u2019s fresh directions it should abandon its filtering procedure and send the mirror image copy back to the police.

Secondly, the actual form of the proceedings could hardly be foreseeable to the applicant \u2013 notwithstanding that he was allowed to object (see paragraph 12 above) \u2013 given that they were effectively reorganised following that decision. Thirdly, and most importantly, the Court finds that the Government have not rebutted the applicant\u2019s contention that subsequently to the Supreme Court\u2019s finding in its decision of 16 January 2017 that the police should themselves examine the data carriers in cases such as the present one, the decision to apply that instruction to the applicant\u2019s ongoing case, which became final with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 30 June 2017 (see paragraph 26 above), meant that no clear and specific procedural guarantees were in place to prevent LPP from being compromised by the search of the mirror image copy of his phone. The Supreme Court had not given any instructions as to how the police were to carry out the task of filtering LPP, apart from indicating that search words should be decided upon in consultation with counsel; even though the claim lodged for LPP in the instant case was as such undisputedly valid, the mirror image copy was effectively just returned to the police for examination without any practical procedural scheme in place for that purpose. As to the report of 9 November 2017 (see paragraph\u00a027 above), it described the deletion of data in the applicant\u2019s case, but did not describe any clear basis or form for the procedure either.",

On that point, the Court observes in passing that the Supreme Court, in its decision of 16 January 2017 in fine, also pointed to the lack of provisions suited to situations where LPP data form part of batches of digitally stored data, and indicated that it would be natural to regulate the exact issue that arose in the instant case by way of formal provisions of law (see paragraph 40 above). The Court thus notes that the issue that arose in the instant case was not as such owing to the Supreme Court\u2019s findings in that case, rather it originated in the lack of appropriate regulation as pointed out by that court.",
