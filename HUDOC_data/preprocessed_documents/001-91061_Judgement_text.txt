The case originated in an application (no. 41220/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Süleyman Kalyoncu, Mr Ali Kalyoncu and Mr Mustafa Kalyoncu (“the applicants”), on 19 September 2007. The applicants were represented by Mr Y. Demirci, E. Uslu and E. Günay, lawyers practising in İstanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. On 30 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government and to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants owned 3,223 square metres of land near the coast in Rize and a cafeteria situated thereon that measured 140 sq m. On 3 October 2006 the Rize Court of First Instance decided to annul the title to 104.36 sq m. of the land and to order the demolition of 17.35 sq m. of the cafeteria area on the ground that they were situated on the coastline which could not be subject to private ownership. On 12 March 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision.
