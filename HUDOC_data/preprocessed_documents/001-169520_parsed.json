After the end of the Second World War, the property was once again confiscated, in 1945, by the Czechoslovak State under the Bene\u0161 decrees as he was considered to be of German nationality. That expropriation was quashed on appeal by the National Council in Prague (zemsk\u00fd n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor) on 21 January 1947 after it had been established that the applicant\u2019s predecessor was of Czechoslovak nationality and had been loyal to the Czechoslovak State.

An applicant can allege a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 only in so far as the impugned decisions related to his \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of this provision. \u201cPossessions\u201d can be either \u201cexisting possessions\u201d or assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he or she has at least a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right. By way of contrast, the hope of recognition of a property right which it has been impossible to exercise effectively cannot be considered a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, nor can a conditional claim which lapses as a result of the non-fulfilment of the condition (see Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v.

Nor does Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 impose any restrictions on the Contracting States\u2019 freedom to determine the scope of property restitution and to choose the conditions under which they agree to restore property rights of former owners (see Jantner v. Slovakia, no. 39050/97, \u00a7\u00a034, 4 March 2003). On the other hand, once a Contracting State, having ratified the Convention including Protocol No. 1, enacts legislation providing for the full or partial restoration of property confiscated under a previous regime, such legislation may be regarded as generating a new property right protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying the requirements for entitlement. The same may apply in respect of arrangements for restitution or compensation established under pre-ratification legislation, if such legislation remained in force after the Contracting State\u2019s ratification of Protocol No. 1 (see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2004V).",

The Act provided for the restitution, subject to certain conditions, of properties that had been transferred to the State during the said period. Thus, the question of whether the applicant could rely on a restitution claim under the national law, and consequently, whether he can be considered to have a right protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, depends inter alia on whether the movable property in question had passed to the State before or after the critical date of 25 February 1948.",

The present applications concern only the second and third sets of proceedings. In 2006, in the course of the second proceedings, the District Court considered the applicant\u2019s claim well-founded and ordered to the State to return a large set of items to him.

The Court reiterates that its jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited and that it is not its function to take the place of the national courts, its role being rather to ensure that the decisions of those courts are not flawed by arbitrariness or otherwise manifestly unreasonable. This is particularly true when, as in this instance, the case turns upon difficult questions of interpretation of domestic law (see Glaser v. the Czech Republic, no. 55179/00, \u00a7 58, 14 February 2008).",
