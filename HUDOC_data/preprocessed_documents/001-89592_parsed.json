The report had further attested a traumatic amputation of Amkhad Gekhayev\u2019s lower limbs as a result of the explosion of some explosive device.

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. It is incumbent on the respondent Government claiming non-exhaustion to indicate to the Court with sufficient clarity the remedies to which the applicants have not had recourse and to satisfy the Court that the remedies were effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that they were accessible, were capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Aksoy v.

A civil court is unable to pursue any independent investigation and is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings as to the identity of the perpetrators of fatal assaults, still less of attributing responsibility. Furthermore, a Contracting State\u2019s obligation under Articles\u00a02 and 13 of the Convention to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible in cases of fatal assaults might be rendered illusory if, in respect of complaints under those Articles, an applicant were to be required to pursue an action leading only to an award of damages (see Ya\u015fa v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998VI, p.\u00a02431, \u00a7\u00a074, and Khatsiyeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 112).

It further notes that the legal instrument referred to by the Government became operative on 1 July 2002 and that the applicants were clearly unable to have recourse to the remedy invoked by the Government prior to that date. As regards the period thereafter, the Court considers that this limb of the Government\u2019s preliminary objection raises issues which are closely linked to the question of the effectiveness of the investigation, and it would therefore be appropriate to address the matter in the examination of the substance of the applicants\u2019 complaints under Article 2 of the Convention.",

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0324, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a014650; Andronicou and Constantinou v.

In particular, law enforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the pre-eminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97).",

Thirdly, as regards the Government\u2019s allegation that the car had suddenly driven off when the servicemen had been at a distance of 10\u00a0metres from it, which had provoked the use of lethal fire by them, the Government did not provide any details concerning the weather that day and the visibility in the area, nor did they indicate from which side of the car the servicemen had approached it, or whether they had, or could have clearly seen through its windows to be able to assess the danger emanating from the applicants\u2019 relatives.

The Court notes first of all an apparent discrepancy between this assertion by the Government and the applicants\u2019 submission to the effect that their relatives\u2019 bodies had been taken for a forensic examination to  and then returned to them on the same date, namely on 30 October 2001 (see paragraphs 24-25 above). The Court considers it highly unlikely that the two bodies were, indeed, being examined by medical experts for a period of over three months and finds it reasonable to assume that the examination, as such, was carried out on the former date, and that it was on the latter date that the reports on its results were drawn up. The Court further notes that, as can be ascertained from the report adduced by the Government, the results of the examination were only received by the investigating authorities on 29\u00a0June 2004 (see paragraphs 63-64 above). The Government provided no explanations regarding the length of the examination, or regarding a delay of more than two years between the date on which it had been completed and the date on which its results had been received by the investigators. Moreover, in spite of the Court\u2019s specific request, the Government did not submit copies of any documents regarding the outcome of the examination. Instead, they provided very succinct and fragmentary information on the findings of the reports on the forensic examination drawn up in respect of each of the bodies (see paragraph 64 above). The Court notes that the information provided does not clarify whether the cause of death of Zalina Mezhidova had at all been established, or whether any findings had been made as regards the alleged mutilation of Zalina Mezhidova\u2019s body, given the applicants\u2019 allegation that its upper half had been missing.",

In the absence of copies of any relevant procedural decisions or any explanation by the Government, it remains unclear what the grounds for those decisions, and more specifically for the application of the amnesty act, were, whether all the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the applicants\u2019 relatives were duly established, and whether the actions of the servicemen involved in the incident of 27\u00a0October 2001 were adequately assessed, given that those actions included not only killing the applicants\u2019 two relatives but also taking their bodies away from the scene of the incident and mutilating them by exploding them, this latter fact being confirmed at least in respect of Amkhad Gekhayev\u2019s body by the Government\u2019s submission on the result of the forensic medical examination (see paragraph 64 above).

It is furthermore clear from the materials in the Court\u2019s possession that the applicants were informed of the developments in the investigation only fragmentarily and occasionally, and that they were not given a realistic opportunity to have access to the case file despite their numerous attempts.

In the absence of any information as to the outcome of the proceedings against the officials brought by the applicants, the Court considers that, in any event, in a situation where the investigation was repeatedly suspended and reopened, where the applicants were unable to consult the case file at any stage and were in fact excluded from the criminal proceedings, and where they were only informed of the conduct of the investigation occasionally, it is highly doubtful that the remedy invoked by the Government would have had any prospect of success. Moreover, the Government have not demonstrated that this remedy would have been capable of providing redress in the applicants\u2019 situation \u2013 in other words, that it would have rectified the shortcomings in the investigation and would have led to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the deaths of their relatives. The Court thus considers that in the circumstances of the case it has not been established with sufficient certainty that the remedy advanced by the Government would have been effective within the meaning of the Convention. It finds that the applicants were not obliged to pursue that remedy, and that this limb of the Government\u2019s preliminary objection should therefore be dismissed.",

It seems highly unlikely that already at that stage they had established the circumstances of the incident in sufficient detail to be able to claim with any certainty that the applicants\u2019 relatives had been alive when taken by the servicemen from the scene of the incident, and therefore the fact that it was the alleged kidnapping that was the ground for the institution of criminal proceedings cannot serve as objective proof of the applicants\u2019 allegation. As regards their argument that the death certificates issued by a civil registration office indicated that Zalina Mezhidova and Amkhad Gekhayev had died on 1 and 27 November 2001 respectively, the Court notes that this argument contradicts the applicants\u2019 own statement to the effect that their relatives\u2019 dead bodies had been delivered to them on 29\u00a0October 2001 and were buried on 30\u00a0October\u00a02001.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, in a situation where the car in which the applicants\u2019 relatives were sitting was strafed by several servicemen with machine-guns, inflicting multiple gunshot wounds which were later attested by forensic medical experts (see paragraph 64 above), it is more than likely that Amkhad Gekhayev and Zalina Mezhidova died immediately, or in the aftermath of the incident.

This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. Failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a0\u00a03531/94, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2000-VI).

The Court further notes that the provisions of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the Government referred, do not preclude the disclosure of documents from the file of an ongoing investigation, but rather set out the procedure for and limits to such disclosure. The Court also notes that in a number of comparable cases that have been reviewed by the Court, the Government submitted documents from the investigation files without reference to Article\u00a0161 (see, for example, Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7\u00a046, 24 February 2005, or Magomadov and Magomadov v. , no.\u00a068004/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a036 and 82, 12\u00a0July 2007), or agreed to produce documents from the investigation files even though they initially invoked Article 161 (see Khatsiyeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 62-63).

The Court has also found a violation of Article\u00a038 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention on account of the Government\u2019s failure to submit the materials requested by the Court. The applicants must have suffered anguish and distress as a result of all these circumstances, which cannot be compensated by a mere finding of a violation. Having regard to these considerations, the Court awards, on an equitable basis, EUR 5,000 to the first applicant, EUR 20,000 to the second and third applicants jointly, EUR 40,000 to the fourth and fifth applicants jointly, and EUR 45,000 to the sixth, seventh and eighth applicants jointly, plus any tax that may be chargeable on these amounts.",
