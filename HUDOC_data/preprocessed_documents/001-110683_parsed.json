The CPT has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when, as is frequently the case, the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions ... Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.",

Even if the second applicant, who at the relevant time was still in detention pending trial, had been successful, it is unclear how a claim for damages could have afforded him immediate and effective redress. In the absence of such evidence, and having regard to the relevant principles, the Court finds that the Government have not substantiated their claim that the remedy or remedies the applicant allegedly failed to exhaust were effective ones (see, among other authorities, Kranz v.

It further notes that his grievances about the detention facility in issue all concern the same problem, namely overcrowding and the general lack of living space. In view of this, the Court finds that the said period of detention should be regarded as a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d for the purposes of the calculation of the six-month time\u00adlimit (see Aleksandr Matveyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14797/02, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68, 8 July 2010; Igor Ivanov v.

Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 76, 25 October 2007). The Court has also previously ruled that the proceedings should be adversarial and ensure equality of arms (see, as a recent authority, Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 124, 9 July 2009). Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see Reinprecht v. Austria, no. 67175/01, \u00a7 31, ECHR 2005-...). However, the requirement of procedural fairness under Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not impose a uniform, unvarying standard to be applied irrespective of the context, facts and circumstances (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a03455/05, \u00a7 203, 19 February 2009).",

Greece, 13\u00a0July 1995, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 318B, and Allen v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a018837/06, \u00a7 38, 30 March 2010).

Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a031195/96, \u00a7\u00a058, ECHR 1999-II). In some cases the Court has stated that where detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention, as a general rule a detainee should have a right to participate in person in a hearing where his detention is discussed (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0113, and Sorokin v.

The hearing therefore involved a discussion of the first applicant\u2019s personality and his current conduct. These questions had been raised for the first time in the prosecutor\u2019s application made on the same day, and it is clear from the case file that the parties had never addressed them previously (see, by contrast, Sorokin, cited above, \u00a7 82).

The Court is aware of substantial periods of inactivity attributable to the domestic authorities for which the Government have not submitted any satisfactory explanation. The Court notes that on 1 February 1999 the District Court received the case for trial. However, it took the presiding judge approximately one year and nine months to schedule and to hold the first trial hearing (see paragraph 13 above). The Government did not cite any reasons for that delay. Moreover, there were repeated delays in the proceedings between 28 November 2001 and 27 May 2002 (see paragraph\u00a041 above), which resulted in six more months of unjustified delay. The Court also observes that on 27 May 2002 the District Court remitted the case for further investigation to enable the prosecution to correct certain defects. However, that decision was quashed on 21\u00a0August 2002 and the case was sent back to the District Court. This resulted in further unjustified delay of almost three months, attributable to the State (see paragraphs 48-51 above). Finally, from the case file it is also clear there were delays in the proceedings unaccounted for by the Government between 26 March 2003 and 25 June 2003 (see paragraphs 71 and 74 above).",
