The Audiencia Provincial revoked the investigating judge\u2019s decision of 1\u00a0December 2014 (who had considered a new and essential fact in the CIAIAC\u2019s Final Report, see paragraph 29 above) and referred back to the Audiencia Provincial decision of 7 November 2013 (see paragraph 19 above), which had confirmed the discontinuation of the proceedings. The Audiencia Provincial recalled that once the proceedings had been provisionally discontinued, the decision could not be modified in the absence of new evidence enabling the person criminally responsible to be identified, or new objective facts. It held that the decision to continue the investigation (after a discontinuation decision) cannot be used to correct procedural mistakes made during the judicial investigation in interpreting reports or documents, without violating the defence rights of every party to the proceedings. This was particularly clear when the reopening of the investigation occurred after a decision to confirm the discontinuation of proceedings under Article 779 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and where the person criminally responsible has not been identified.",

France [GC], no. 47287/99, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2004\u2011I; Gorou v. Greece (no. 2) [GC], no. 12686/03, \u00a7 24, 20 March 2009; Mustafa\u00a0Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no. 24014/05, \u00a7 218, 14 April 2015 and Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase v. Romania [GC], no. 41720/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0194 and 207, 25 June 2019), domestic law can provide for a right for the victim of an offence to claim reparation for the damage caused by that offence by means of civil\u2011party proceedings, that is by allowing the victim to join criminal proceedings as a civil party. This is one possible way of providing for a civil action to obtain compensation for damage (see Perez, cited above, \u00a7 62). Article 6 \u00a7 1 is then applicable in its civil limb to a civil-party claim in criminal proceedings except in the case of a civil action brought purely to obtain private vengeance or for punitive purposes (see Sigalas v. Greece, no.\u00a019754/02, \u00a7 29, 22 September 2005), or when he or she has unequivocally waived the right to reparation. Article 6 applies from the moment the victim has joined as a civil party, even during the preliminary investigation stage taken on its own (see Nicolae Virgiliu Ta\u0306nase, cited above, \u00a7 207), and as long as the criminal proceedings are decisive for the civil right to compensation that is being asserted (see Alexandrescu and Others v. Romania (revision), nos. 56842/08 and\u00a07\u00a0others, \u00a7 22, 28 March 2017). To fall within the scope of the Convention, such a right must be indissociable from the victim\u2019s exercise of a right to bring civil proceedings in domestic law (see Nicolae Virgiliu Ta\u0306nase, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 188 and 194), even if only to secure symbolic reparation or to protect a civil right such as the right to a \u201cgood reputation\u201d (see Perez, cited above, \u00a7 70).",

Furthermore, the outcome of the proceedings in question must be decisive for obtaining redress for the damage (see Arnoldi v. Italy, no. 35637/04, \u00a7\u00a7 31-36, 7 December 2017).

Only the Professional Pilots\u2019 Association lodged an appeal before the Audiencia Provincial, demanding the extension of the reopened investigation into the potential criminal liability of the owner and operator of the aircraft. The investigating judge gave the parties to the proceedings the opportunity to make submissions concerning the Professional Pilots\u2019 Association\u2019s appeal, so that they could challenge or adhere to the appeal as they wished. The Public Prosecutor challenged the above-mentioned appeal of the Professional Pilots\u2019 Association, referring to her previous submissions of 10\u00a0July 2014 and 21\u00a0December 2014, in which she had requested the complete discontinuation of the proceedings.",

Such an opportunity may be essential, since the right to\u00a0adversarial proceedings\u00a0means that each party must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed or evidence adduced by the other party (see Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, \u00a7 63, Series A no. 262). The Court has previously insisted that a court should not surprise the parties with arguments which have not been discussed by them (cf. Clinique des Acacias and Others v. France, nos. 65399/01 and 3 others, 13\u00a0October 2005; \u010cepek v. the Czech Republic, no. 9815/10, 5\u00a0September 2013; Alexe v. Romania, no.\u00a066522/09, 3 May 2016; and Liga Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 4687/11, 17\u00a0May 2016). The Court notes that the present case raises the question whether the dismissal on 4\u00a0May 2015 of the Professional Pilots\u2019 Association\u2019s appeal upholding the allegations submitted by the Public Prosecutor (see paragraph 36 above) infringed the applicant\u2019s right to adversarial proceedings as guaranteed under Article 6 of the Convention, by preventing her from putting forward any arguments against the Prosecutor\u2019s request (compare, mutatis mutandis, Clinique des Acacias and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 39\u201140, and Prikyan and Angelova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 44624/98, \u00a7\u00a7 43-47, 16 February 2006).",

                                                "content": "73.\u00a0\u00a0While the Court is not competent to consider whether or not the CIAIAC\u2019s Final Report introduced essential facts which were new and relevant for the continuation of the investigation, it can be assumed that the applicant had a legitimate interest in reacting to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s request to discontinue the proceedings. The Court does not need to determine whether the failure to communicate the appeal document caused the applicant a prejudice; the existence of a violation is conceivable even in the absence of injury (see Adolf v. Austria, 26 March 1982, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 49). It was up to the applicant to decide whether or not that document called for her comments (compare Nider\u00f6st-Huber v. Switzerland, 18\u00a0February 1997, \u00a7 29, Reports 1997I, and Ferreira Alves v.\u00a0Portugal\u00a0(no.\u00a03), no.\u00a025053/05, \u00a7\u00a040-41, 21 June 2007). The extent to which those submissions influenced the court\u2019s assessment is not decisive from the point of view of the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing (see Kuopila v. Finland, no.\u00a027752/95, \u00a7 35, 27 April 2000; see also Milatov\u00e1 and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2005V, and Nider\u00f6st-Huber, \u00a7\u00a027, cited above). What is particularly at stake here is litigants\u2019 confidence in the workings of justice, which is based, inter alia, on the knowledge that they have had the opportunity to express their views on every document in the file (see Ferreira Alves\u00a0(no.\u00a03), cited above, \u00a7\u00a041). In the present case, the mere fact that the applicant was unable to respond meant that she was placed at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the Public Prosecutor in the appeal proceedings, in a manner at variance with the fair hearing guarantee in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
