The applicant submitted that P. had lived in his parents\u2019 house from the time of her birth until her departure with I. and that, by taking her away, I. had changed P.\u2019s habitual place of residence without the consent of the other parent (that is to say the applicant). He submitted that those unilateral actions had amounted to abuse of parental rights and that the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court had legitimised that abuse. The applicant furthermore argued that his daughter, from the time of her birth until her departure with I., had lived not only with her mother but also with her father (the applicant) and that disrupting her emotional bond with either of the parents would cause her equal distress; thus, I. should not have been treated more favourably simply because she was the child\u2019s mother. The applicant also reiterated the arguments made in his initial claim as to why P. should live with him (see paragraph 16 above). He lastly asked the court to amend the contact schedule and to allow him to see P. every weekend.",

The court dismissed the part of the appeal concerning P.\u2019s temporary residence. It stated that the applicant had not proved that P.\u2019s residing with I. was contrary to the child\u2019s interests; it also referred to the authorities\u2019 findings that the conditions in I.\u2019s apartment were suitable for the child (see paragraph 17 above). The court emphasised that at that stage of the proceedings it was determining only the child\u2019s temporary place of residence, and that her permanent place of residence would be determined when it examined the merits of the divorce claim; only at that stage would it be decided to which parent the child was more attached or which place of residence was more suited to her needs. Referring to the reports of the psychologists who had examined P. (see paragraphs 36 and 38 above), the court considered that at that stage the psychologists had not reached a final conclusion as to which parent the child was more attached to, and that they had found that because of her young age P. was unable to express her preference regarding with which parent she wished to live and was likely to be influenced by her parents\u2019 views. However, the court extended the applicant\u2019s contact rights, giving him the right to see P. every other weekend, from Friday evening until Sunday evening.",

The Ombudsperson observed that on 3\u00a0March 2014 I. had addressed the Kai\u0161iadorys psychological service on her own initiative, and that after the Ombudsperson had begun the present inquiry, in August 2014 the service had informed the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court that it had not assessed the degree of P.\u2019s attachment to her parents because it did not have the authority to do so (see paragraph 42 above). The Ombudsperson found that the Kai\u0161iadorys childcare authority had not informed the Kai\u0161iadorys psychological service in due time of the court\u2019s decisions ordering I. to take P. to see psychologists (see paragraphs 34 and\u00a035 above). The Ombudsperson furthermore observed that, according to the relevant legal instruments, the Kai\u0161iadorys psychological service did not have the authority to assess with which parent a child should live in the event of a divorce, and that the Kai\u0161iadorys childcare authority should thus not have referred I. and P. to that service. In the Ombudsperson\u2019s view, when adopting its decision of 26 February 2014 (see paragraph 35 above), the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court had been misled about the scope of the authority of the Kai\u0161iadorys psychological service. The Ombudsperson therefore considered that the service\u2019s conclusions of 10 March 2014 (see paragraph 36 above) should not have been accepted as evidence by the court. The Ombudsperson\u2019s opinion was forwarded to the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court.",

On 3\u00a0November 2014 representatives of the Kai\u0161iadorys childcare authority visited I.\u2019s home; on 10 November 2014 they held a meeting with the applicant and I. in its office, during which I. denied the applicant\u2019s allegations.

The Kai\u0161iadorys childcare authority expressed its regret that the applicant and I. were unable to resolve their disagreements, because such a situation was harmful to the child. It recommended to I. that if P. fell ill on a weekend that she was supposed to spend with the applicant and the illness was not serious, the applicant could still collect the child; it furthermore recommended that if the applicant had to miss a weekend with P. because of her illness, I. should allow him to spend a different weekend with the child.",

On 13 November 2014 the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court refused that request on the grounds that the applicant\u2019s proposal would require changing P.\u2019s place of residence often and that such a lack of stability might be harmful to her. The court also referred to the conclusions of the Kai\u0161iadorys psychological service that during the divorce proceedings and at least half a year after they ended, it was essential to fulfil P.\u2019s need to live with her mother in a stable physical, emotional and social environment and that children of P.\u2019s age were likely to suffer anxiety if separated from their mothers (see paragraph 36 above).

The court also referred to the findings of the court-appointed psychologist, who had found that P. was equally attached to both parents but was too young to express an independent opinion as to which of them she preferred to live with; the girl had adapted to her new place of residence with her mother and to the kindergarten that she was attending, and the psychologist had recommended that it not be changed again, as stability was very important for a child of her age (see paragraph\u00a053 above). Taking those findings into account, the court held that it was \u201can especially important circumstance\u201d (itin svarbi aplinkyb\u0117) that for two years the child had been living with I., and emphasised that changing her place of residence might cause her social and psychological harm (see paragraphs 75 and 76 below).

He submitted that his parents\u2019 house, in which P. had lived from the time of her birth until her departure with I., had remained her habitual place of residence and that she had been removed from that house only because of I.\u2019s unilateral actions, which had constituted abuse of parental rights (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). He contended that the first-instance court had made a residence order in I.\u2019s favour essentially because P. had already been living with I. as the result of an earlier decision ordering interim measures (see paragraphs 18-20 above) and that the interim measures had become de facto permanent. The applicant also submitted that the court had not addressed any of his arguments as to why the child should live with him (see paragraph 16 above). He argued that the findings of the psychologists and the testimony of the witnesses had shown that P. felt a stronger attachment to him than to I. and that she wanted to live with him. He furthermore submitted that the court had not taken into account I.\u2019s personality and behaviour, such as her refusal to let the applicant see the child and the fact that I.\u2019s daughter from her previous marriage did not live with her. The applicant also asked for his contact rights to be extended and the amount in maintenance that he was required to pay to be reduced.",

The Supreme Court\u2019s case-law does not specifically define what change of circumstances can be regarded as material \u2013 that is to say giving sufficient grounds to consider changing the child\u2019s place of residence \u2013 but some examples have been given, such as: a change in the behaviour or financial situation of the parent with whom the child lives, a deterioration in the child\u2019s upbringing, an improvement of the other parent\u2019s financial situation, ... a change of the child\u2019s wishes (taking into account the child\u2019s age and maturity), ... and other circumstances which have to be assessed in each individual case. It is emphasised that when it is requested that a residence order be made in favour of the parent with whom the child did not live before the lodging of that request, it must be established that the current place of residence has become unsafe for the child and no longer meets the requirements of his or her normal and healthy development, and that changing the child\u2019s place of residence and making a residence order in favour of the other parent would create [an appropriate] environment ... The stability of the child\u2019s living environment is important for the child\u2019s psychological state; thus, when the child has lived in a certain environment for more than a year, the possibility of changing it must be considered with particular care ...",

Changing the living environment can cause a child emotional distress and certain social [or] psychological harm. International and national legal instruments guarantee the protection of a child\u2019s family environment and, without a pressing need and clear and sufficient grounds, do not provide for the changing of that environment.

In the present case, the applicant complained about the decisions adopted by the domestic courts that had determined his daughter\u2019s place of residence. His complaint did not concern compliance with the contact schedule set by a court or any actions or omissions on the part of the childcare authorities. Accordingly, the Court considers it immaterial whether the applicant lodged any complaints with the domestic authorities concerning those matters. Furthermore, the Court is of the view that a civil claim for damages, as a remedy of a purely compensatory nature, was not capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint that his daughter\u2019s place of residence had been determined by the duration of court proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Z.J. v.

Furthermore, the courts had ensured the applicant\u2019s right to see his daughter \u2013 the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court had established a contact schedule and the Kaunas Regional Court had further extended the applicant\u2019s contact rights (see paragraphs 20 and 39 above).

He submitted that her habitual place of residence was his parents\u2019 house, where she had lived from the time of her birth until her departure with I., and that I. had abused her parental rights by changing that place of residence unilaterally (see paragraphs 16 and 21 above); I. did not dispute that the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 house had been P.\u2019s habitual place of residence before 9 November 2013 (see paragraph 22 above). The applicant also stated that on 9 November 2013 he had allowed I. to take P. with her because he had been misled by the police and because he and I. had agreed that P. would live with each of them in turn (see paragraphs 11, 16 and 21 above), whereas I. denied the existence of such an agreement (see paragraph\u00a022 above). The Court observes that neither the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court nor the Kaunas Regional Court adequately addressed those arguments in their decisions. The courts did not provide any explanation as to why they considered that P.\u2019s habitual place of residence was I.\u2019s apartment, where at that time the girl had been living for only a few months after being taken from her previous home by her mother, and not in the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 house, where she had lived for several years from her birth until 9\u00a0November 2013. Furthermore, the courts did not examine the circumstances in which I. had taken P. away on 9 November 2013 and whether there had been any agreement between the applicant and I. concerning P.\u2019s future living arrangements. In particular, they did not take any statements from the applicant, I. or the police officers who had been called to the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 house on that day and might have been able to elucidate the relevant facts, especially as the applicant claimed to have been misled by the police. In that connection, the Court notes that the Lithuanian Code of Civil Procedure allows courts examining family cases to obtain evidence on their own initiative (see paragraph 73 above). It furthermore notes that although, as indicated by the Government, the Code of Civil Procedure provides that decisions on interim measures are to be taken in written proceedings, it also provides that decisions in family cases cannot be taken in the parties\u2019 absence (see paragraphs 71 and 72 above), and the applicant in his complaint to the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court asked the court to apply the latter provision (see paragraph 16 above).",

When deciding whether to change P.\u2019s place of residence, which at that time was with her mother, the courts relied on the assessment of the conditions in I.\u2019s and the applicant\u2019s homes carried out by the childcare authorities, as well as on the conclusions provided by the court-appointed psychologist concerning the degree of P.\u2019s attachment to her parents.",

Although it appears that I.\u2019s apartment was modest and in need of some renovation (see paragraph 14 above) and the applicant argued that his home was better suited to his daughter\u2019s needs (see paragraph 16 above), the Court is able to share the view of the Lithuanian Supreme Court (see paragraph 74 above) that superior material conditions at the home of one of a child\u2019s parents cannot be decisive when the other parent is also capable of providing adequate conditions.",

While it was clear that P. missed the applicant, the psychologist stated that the girl had become used to living with her mother in her apartment, and recommended that her place of residence not be changed again, as that would undermine her feelings of stability and safety (see paragraph\u00a053 above). The applicant did not challenge the credibility or impartiality of the court-appointed psychologist; however, he argued that the courts should also have taken into account a previous psychological assessment that had shown that P. felt a stronger attachment to him than to I. (see paragraphs 38, 61 and 84 above). In this connection, the Court reiterates that as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them, including the means used to ascertain the relevant facts (see Sahin, \u00a7 73, and Sommerfeld, \u00a7 71, both cited above). In the present case, although the courts did not explicitly indicate their reasons for not relying on the findings of the psychological assessment referred to by the applicant, the Court is prepared to accept that it was not arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable for them to rely on a more recent assessment carried out by a court-appointed psychologist which, moreover, had been ordered at the applicant\u2019s request and the credibility or impartiality of which the applicant had not challenged.",

It observes that when making the residence order in I.\u2019s favour, the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court found that P. had been living with I. for two years; the court considered that to be \u201can especially important circumstance\u201d and held that there were \u201cno imperative and imminent reasons\u201d to change P.\u2019s place of residence (see paragraph 58 above). The Court notes that in the decisions on interim measures, P.\u2019s place of residence was determined as temporarily being with I.; those decisions, as it has already found, were adopted without providing the applicant with adequate procedural safeguards (see paragraph 103 above). Furthermore, the above-mentioned period of two years after the start of P.\u2019s residence with I. (9\u00a0November 2013) resulted from the duration of the proceedings before the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court \u2013 that court\u2019s decision on the merits of the divorce case was only delivered on 18\u00a0November 2015 (see paragraph 57 above).",

It observes that, on average, no more than one court hearing was scheduled per month (see paragraphs 49-56 above) and that on several occasions the breaks between the hearings lasted for two or three months (for example, between 7 March and 6 May 2014, between 17 July and 3\u00a0September 2014, and between 25 June and 10 September 2015 \u2013 see paragraphs 49, 50 and 54 above). In addition, more than four months passed after the court forwarded questions to the psychologist until that psychologist examined P., despite the fact that the examination required only one visit (see paragraphs\u00a052 and 53 above). Furthermore, while it appears that the first hearing, scheduled on 7\u00a0March 2014, had to be postponed because neither the applicant nor I. appeared (see paragraph 49 above), there is no indication that any of the other delays were imputable to the applicant (compare and contrast Leonov, cited above, \u00a7 75). The Government did not allege that during the proceedings the applicant had lodged unreasonable requests or abused his procedural rights in any other way (see paragraph\u00a091 above), and nor did the domestic courts make any findings to that effect. The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s argument that the divorce case was complex, as it involved multiple legal and factual questions (see paragraph\u00a091 above), as well as the applicant\u2019s argument that the courts could have decided on the residence order separately from the other questions in order to speed up the proceedings (see paragraph 85 above). It reiterates that it is for the State to organise its judicial system in such a way as to enable its institutions to comply with the requirements of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Mardosai v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a042434/15, \u00a7\u00a055, 11\u00a0July 2017, and the cases cited therein).

The courts that made the decisions on interim measures refused to examine the substance of those arguments, stating that P.\u2019s attachment to her parents and the suitability of their homes would be assessed later (see paragraph 39 above). However, at the stage of the issuance of the residence order, the courts held that both parents were capable of ensuring adequate conditions and that there were thus no grounds to change P.\u2019s habitual place of residence, which at that time was with I. (see paragraphs 58 and 63 above). It is not for the Court to determine what weight the applicant\u2019s arguments should have had, or what would have been the most appropriate stage of the proceedings at which to examine them. It reiterates, however, that in such cases Article 8 of the Convention requires the domestic courts to conduct an in-depth examination of the entire family situation and of a whole series of relevant factors (see the references in paragraph 96 above). In the present case, the applicant found himself in a situation in which an interim decision was made without an examination of the merits of his arguments, and with the passage of time that interim decision determined the final outcome of the case, as a result of which his arguments were no longer relevant. The Court therefore considers that the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s and I.\u2019s divorce case, taken as a whole, were incompatible with his right to respect for his family life under Article 8 of the Convention.",

A dispute concerning a child\u2019s place of residence must be decided in accordance with the child\u2019s best interests (see paragraphs 70 and 74 above). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has explicitly held that a court\u2019s decision on a child\u2019s place of residence cannot be determined by the parents\u2019 gender \u2013 when deciding with which parent the child should live, the court cannot show favouritism towards the father or the mother (see paragraph 76 above).",

The courts which determined first the temporary and later the permanent place of residence of the applicant\u2019s daughter emphasised the need to ensure safety and stability for a young child and not to change her habitual place of residence without important reasons (see paragraphs 20, 39, 58 and 63 above). The Court takes note of the conclusions adopted by the Kai\u0161iadorys psychological centre which stated that P. was \u201clikely to suffer anxiety when separated from [her] mother\u201d and that it was \u201cunquestionably essential to fulfil [P.\u2019s] need to live with her mother\u201d and about which the applicant complained to the Equal Opportunities Ombudsperson (see paragraphs 36 and 37 above). However, none of the courts which determined P.\u2019s place of residence relied on those conclusions or made any statements implying that the mother was more important to the child than the father (see paragraphs 18-20, 39, 57-60 and 63 above). Therefore, although the Court has criticised the proceedings in which those decisions were adopted, it is unable to discern any difference of treatment on account of gender in the decisions adopted by the domestic authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Petrov and X, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0127-29).",
