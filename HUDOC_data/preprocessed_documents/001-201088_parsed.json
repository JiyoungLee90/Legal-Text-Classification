Sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds on which persons may be deprived of their liberty and no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds (see Navalnyy v.

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness. What is at stake here is not only the \u201cright to liberty\u201d but also the \u201cright to security of person\u201d (see, among other authorities, Bozano v. France, 18 December 1986, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 111, Wassink v. the Netherlands, 27 September 1990, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 185-A, and Emin Huseynov v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a059135/09, \u00a7 84, 7 May 2015). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2008).",

However, the Government have not argued that in the circumstances of the case this was impossible, and no obstacles to drawing up the report on the spot may be discerned from the documents in the case file or from any domestic decisions (see, for similar reasoning, Navalnyy and Yashin v. Russia, no. 76204/11, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 93, 4\u00a0December 2014, and Lashmankin and Others v. Russia, nos. 57818/09 and\u00a014 others, \u00a7 489, 7\u00a0February 2017).",

The absence of a record of such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Aleksandr Sokolov v.

The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see, among other authorities, Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, \u00a7 31, Series A no.\u00a0260-A; Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, \u00a7 34, ECHR 1999-I; S.A.S. v.

This aspect of the right set out in the first paragraph of Article\u00a09, to hold any religious belief and to change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However, as further set out in Article 9 \u00a7 1, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one\u2019s belief alone and in private but also to practise in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Kokkinakis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031, and Leyla \u015eahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7 105, ECHR\u00a02005XI). Since the manifestation by one person of his or her religious belief may have an impact on others, the drafters of the Convention qualified this aspect of freedom of religion in the manner set out in Article 9 \u00a7 2. This second paragraph provides that any limitation placed on a person\u2019s freedom to manifest religion or belief must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of one or more of the legitimate aims set out therein (see Eweida and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).",
