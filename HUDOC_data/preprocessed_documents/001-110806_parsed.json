In Shestakov the central issue was the State\u2019s failure to discharge its positive obligations to assist in enforcement of a domestic judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour against a private debtor.

Indeed, the Court\u2019s finding that the State has done what it could and should to assist in enforcement of a final judgment in favour of one creditor as in Shestakov (cited above), did not lead it to conclude that the quashing of another final judgment in favour of another creditor by way of supervisory review complied with the legal certainty requirement (see Kravchenko, cited above). The Court observes that the issue raised by the present case is similar to the latter as the applicants\u2019 reliance on a final judgment was allegedly frustrated by its quashing, which they found to be abusive. This issue must be considered by the Court on its merits and cannot be discarded on account of the findings made in the context of the enforcement proceedings in the Shestakov case.",

Furthermore, the Court has considered it appropriate to follow the same logic when this fundamental principle was undermined through other procedural mechanisms, such as the extension of the time-limit for an appeal. Thus, the Court found a violation of Article\u00a06 in a case against Ukraine as the time-limit for an appeal was extended after a considerable lapse of time without any need for correction of serious judicial errors, but merely for the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the case (see Ponomaryov v.

This attitude is also in line with the Court\u2019s constant view that the closure of a respondent State organ does not, in principle, absolve the State of the obligation to pay its debts under a binding and enforceable judgment, especially taking into account that changing needs force the State to make frequent changes in its organisational structure, including by forming new organs and closing old ones (mutatis mutandis, Nikitina v. Russia, no.\u00a047486/07, \u00a7 19, 15\u00a0July 2010).
