However, as soon as the State Attorney is no longer a party (if he drops the charges) the injured party can act as a subsidiary prosecutor in the proceedings. In other words, when the State Attorney does not appear [as a prosecutor] in the proceedings, the [injured] party is (or can be) the subsidiary prosecutor. This should be, mutatis mutandis, applied in respect of a constitutional complaint. Since the State Attorney cannot lodge a constitutional complaint ... the injured party can represent himself.

The Court attaches importance to the fact that the applicant, a thirteen-year old boy at the time, was attacked by a grown-up man and that it occurred over a trivial dispute at a school\u2019s playground in presence of other children. The Court considers that the applicant, owing to his age, may be considered to fall within the group of \u201cvulnerable individuals\u201d entitled to State protection (see A. v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 22, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI; and \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 v. , no. 52442/09, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2011 (extracts)).

The Court also notes that violent behaviour must take place in public, namely in presence of other people, to constitute the offence of violent behaviour under Article 331 of the Croatian Criminal Code. Therefore, the fact that the above-mentioned three witnesses were not called to give evidence appears incompatible with the requirements of an effective examination of the applicant\u2019s allegations. However, even though the Deputy State Attorney must have been aware of the records of the police interviews with these witnesses, he decided to abandon the further prosecution of I.\u0160. without making any reference as to why he did not consider it necessary to call those witnesses before the court. H.K., D.D. and D.B.L. only gave evidence before the Dubrovnik Municipal Court two years later, which created an unnecessary delay in the course of the proceedings.",

The Deputy State Attorney, in dismissing the charges of violent behaviour against I.\u0160., expressly noted that he did not consider that I.\u0160.\u2019s actions had constituted any other criminal offence which should be publicly prosecuted, although he later on took over the prosecution from the applicant\u2019s father against I.\u0160. for the same offence.
