The City Court held that since the judgment of the Vantaa District Court of 23 December 2014 \u2012 which had determined V.\u2019s residence as being with the applicant in Finland \u2012 had not yet entered into force, I.K.\u2019s actions in bringing V. to Russia had not been unlawful. The circumstances of the removal of the child, a national of the Russian Federation, to Russia had not violated the applicant\u2019s parental rights. The City Court noted that at the time of the child\u2019s removal, as well as the time of the examination of the appeal, she had not had a valid Finnish residence permit. The City Court also took into account the following facts: that since February 2015 V. had been permanently resident in St Petersburg \u2012 at the address where I.K. was registered \u2012 where suitable conditions had been created for her life and development; that both parties had registered places of residence in Russia; that at the time of her removal V. had been aged two years and one month, of which she had spent several months (from July to October 2013) in Norway, where she had been taken by the applicant without I.K.\u2019s consent; and finally that V. did not speak Finnish and since February 2015 had been attending various medical facilities and nursery school in Russia. In view of the foregoing, the City Court came to the conclusion that Finland was not the State in which V. was habitually resident. Since February 2015 V. had integrated well into the Russian social and family environment and her retention in Russia was therefore not unlawful within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention. V.\u2019s attendance at a kindergarten in Finland for a short period of time between November 2014 and January 2015 did not constitute sufficient proof of integration into the social environment in Finland such that Finland could be considered as the child\u2019s habitual place of residence. Lastly, the City Court noted that the report of the Ombudsman for Children in St\u00a0Petersburg stated that both parents had parental authority in respect of V., that the applicant\u2019s rights were not diminished on the territory of the Russian Federation, and that the removal of the child from her mother in Russia to her father in Finland for the purposes of permanent residence in Finland could, on account of her numerous medical conditions, cause her physical harm. The court further noted that medical documents contained in the case file confirmed that the child had a number of medical conditions. It concluded that this circumstance \u2012 which under Article\u00a013\u00a0(b) of the Hague Convention constituted an exception to immediate return \u2012 also led to the conclusion that there were no grounds for granting the applicant\u2019s request.",

Therefore, she needed to be monitored by medical specialists, as well as to follow a special diet, take medicines, undergo massages, wear orthopedic shoes for preventive purposes, swim, develop fine motor skills and general motor skills, engage in constructive activity, do articular gymnastics and undergo vestibular stimulation. The Government relied on a report by a medical psychologist of the St Petersburg\u2019s Centre for Complex Rehabilitation and Development of the Child dated 8\u00a0September 2015, which stated that due to her neurotic state, V. was regularly seeing a child psychologist to alleviate emotional tension and anxiety, as well as a speech therapist. The medical psychologist expressed the opinion that V. should remain with the mother, as she was the only person who could provide the required care, and that a change of place of residence would be harmful to V.\u2019s mental development. The fact that the City Court had not examined the availability of the equivalent therapy in Finland did not as such undermine the validity of its decision. The Government therefore concluded that the judgment of the City Court refusing the application for V.\u2019s return to Finland had been based on law.",

The City Court noted that the parties were Russian nationals and had their registered place of residence in the Russian Federation. Apart from the parties\u2019 stable bonds with the Russian Federation, the City Court also had due regard to the fact that V. had spent a considerable part of her life outside of Finland, had not integrated into the linguistic and social environment of that country, and did not understand the Finnish language but spoke Russian, which was her mother tongue. She had attended a nursery school in Finland and been exposed to a Finnish-speaking environment for a very limited period of time, and had lived in Norway for several months. The domestic court had objectively and comprehensively examined all of the above-mentioned pieces of evidence, and had taken due account of the fact that V. had spent a significant part of her life in St Petersburg and had successfully integrated into a new environment, and that her tender age required the constant presence of her mother.

The Government also relied on a report by a medical psychologist of the St\u00a0Petersburg\u2019s Centre for Complex Rehabilitation and Development of the Child, stating that V. had been regularly seeing a child psychologist, who considered that V.\u2019s mother was the only person who could provide V. with the required care, and that any change of place of residence would be harmful to V.\u2019s mental development (see paragraph 58 above).",

In X v.

In the present case the mother provided the court of first instance with a report by a medical psychologist from the St\u00a0Petersburg Centre for Complex Rehabilitation and Development of the Child dated 8\u00a0September 2015, which stated that due to her neurotic state, V. was regularly seeing a child psychologist to alleviate emotional tension and anxiety, as well as a speech therapist. The medical psychologist expressed the opinion that V. should remain with the mother, as she was the only person who could provide the required care, and that a change of place of residence would be harmful to V.\u2019s mental development. According to paragraph 58 of the judgment, the report was referred to by the Government in their submissions, but the report was in the case file of the national courts from the very beginning (as is apparent from the date of the report). However, the District Court disregarded the report, saying that \u201cthe argument concerning the risk of V. suffering psychological harm in the event of her return to Finland and the allegation that the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder were found unsubstantiated\u201d (see paragraph 33 of the judgment).",

The St\u00a0Petersburg City Court demonstrated the same reaction in the present case by quashing on appeal the decision of the District Court concerning the immediate return of the child. However, the Court criticised the City Court for not providing any details of the child\u2019s medical conditions. Yet the details were in the report. Again, paragraphs 100 and 101 of the judgment create the impression that the report was available to the Government alone and not to the national courts and to the parties, which is not true. As is apparent from the case file, the report was submitted to the District Court by the mother. There is no doubt that the adversarial proceedings were impeded and that the applicant did not have the opportunity to exercise his procedural rights. The Appeal Court and the City Court dismissed the father\u2019s request for his daughter\u2019s return to Finland on numerous grounds based on the documents provided by the parties in the case file, including the young age of the child, her close attachment to her mother, her integration into Russian society, and the necessary measures taken by the mother as her custodian relating to her medical rehabilitation. The Appeal Court referred to the numerous documents contained in the case file.",

I am a judge; I am not a doctor in a position to draw conclusions about \u201crather common medical conditions\u201d. But, as is clear from the case file, the child underwent a complex medical rehabilitation programme under the supervision of medical specialists in Russia to resolve her problems. This was organised by the mother only after the child\u2019s removal to Russia. The mother did not have the opportunity to organise the child\u2019s rehabilitation in Finland because the child\u2019s father would not agree to it. It appears from the decisions of 23 December 2012 of the Vantaa District Court in Finland, available in the case file of both the Court and the Russian courts, that the parents had different views about the medical care that should be provided to the child, and that the father preferred to visit the doctor from time to time \u201cwhen it was necessary\u201d. As a judge, I can conclude that if the child were returned to the father, the rehabilitation programme would be terminated. I am sure that this is not in the best interests of the child. In this connection I cannot understand the majority\u2019s argument in paragraph 101 of the judgment that the national court failed to examine the availability of the equivalent treatment in Finland. No doubt such treatment is available, but the problem is that the father never agreed to make use of that possibility. Moreover, it is confirmed by the case file and not disputed by the parties that the father worked a lot and did not have the opportunity to care for the child himself. That is why he sent the child to his parents and to a kindergarten.",

I am sorry to have to point this out, but the City Court decided in favour of the mother; therefore, it did evaluate all the possible consequences, including the mother\u2019s own difficult situation due to her state of health and the lack of possibilities for her to live in Finland independently. By contrast, the father\u2019s mobility is much greater, taking into account the fact that it takes just three hours to get to St Petersburg from Helsinki by train.",

Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 104-106), the assessment of the child\u2019s best interests is considerably limited by the purposes of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The national courts are required to examine only those factors capable of constituting an exception to the child\u2019s immediate return. The analysis should cover the entire family situation, the separation from one of the parents and the best interests of the child in general. That is why the Court was not impressed in the present case by the findings of the City Court that the child socialised in Russia and did not speak Finnish, and that it would be difficult for her to integrate into society in Finland. Because, seen from this perspective, even if it would not be in the best interests of the child, she should be returned to her father.",

Croatia (no. 22643/14, 12 March 2015), the Hague Convention has systemic deficiencies. It does not take into account the young age of the child and his or her close relationship with the mother after birth, the vulnerability of the mother, who usually does not have any income in a foreign country or any place to live, who is completely dependent on her husband, having only a temporary residence permit, and for whom the only purpose of moving to another country is to enjoy family life with her husband. There are hundreds or even thousands of such clone cases. This case is no exception: the Finnish courts decided that the child should reside with her father and that the mother could visit her two days per week. In all such cases the divorced mothers have no chance to have the place of residence determined in their favour. Therefore, it is obvious that, in the event of the child\u2019s return, the mother would be deprived of her own custodial rights.",

This provision is vague and controversial for several reasons. The Hague Convention focuses on the determination of custody rather than on the best interests of the child. But the best interests of the child are not limited to the issue of custody. The Russian courts discussed the issue of the child\u2019s habitual residence and established that she was not integrated into Finnish society, having been placed in a Russian-speaking environment from birth up to the time of her removal to St Petersburg. However, this issue does not make any sense in terms of the Hague Convention because the latter\u2019s primary purpose is to protect the right to custody. Finally, the Hague Convention does not regulate situations, such as that in the present case, where the parents were granted joint custody. The Russian courts demonstrated that the quality of care provided by the mother was better, but that is not what the Hague Convention requires.",

Today the Hague Convention predominates entirely over Article 8 of the Convention because no comprehensive analysis of the best interests of the child is possible for either the national courts or for the European Court of Human Rights. The Court, in my humble view, is therefore placed in a position that runs counter to its role to protect vulnerable persons and to fight against discrimination. The whole reasoning in the judgment gives the impression that the Court is analysing the respondent State\u2019s compliance with the Hague Convention. Instead, greater emphasis should be placed on the Court\u2019s primary role, namely to decide whether the respondent State complied with its positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention.",
