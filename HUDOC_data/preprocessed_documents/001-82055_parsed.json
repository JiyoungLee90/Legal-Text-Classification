Thus, the absence of such a hearing may be compatible with the requirements of Article 6 when the issue which is to be decided raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties' written observations (see, mutatis mutandis, Fredin v.\u00a0Sweden (no.\u00a02), judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no.\u00a0283A, pp.\u00a01011, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a021-22; Fischer v.

However, an appellant could still challenge the established facts by raising \u201can additional and well-founded cassation argument\u201d that they had been determined by the lower courts in breach of procedural norms (see paragraphs 16-18 and 30-32 above).",

Reviewing the validity of the appellate court's legal reasoning only (Article 404 \u00a7 1 of the CCP), the cassation court ruled on the applicability and mode of calculation of the limitation period in accordance with Article 204 \u00a7 1 of the LC.",
