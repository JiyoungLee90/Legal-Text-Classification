In the morning of 13\u00a0March 2003, during a change of duty shifts, he had repeatedly hit his head against the metal bars of the cell door. The police officers had intervened to prevent the applicant from further injuring himself. While one of the police officers had stuck his arms through the metal bars in an attempt to cover the applicant's head, the other two had opened the door, entered the cell and tried to restrain him. The latter had actively resisted the police officers, trying to hurl himself against the metal bars. He had been subdued and placed on a bunk. A pillow had been placed under his head and he had been covered by soft items. According to the Government, the force applied by the police officers did not exceed what was reasonable and necessary in the circumstances of the case.",

However, when questioned by the assistant prosecutor, the applicant asserted that he had sustained the head injury when the police officers had lifted him up and had thrown him against the metal bars (see paragraph 33 above). Furthermore, at no point in the proceedings before the Court did the applicant give a detailed account of the events, recounting his side of the story day by day.

The Court reiterates that on the applicant's admission to the hospital on 14 March 2003 a number of injuries were discovered on his body in addition to the head injury. As regards the head injury, the Court cannot overlook the findings of the medical expert that this had been self-inflicted and not the result of any \u201cexternal action\u201d (see paragraph 26 above). In this connection, the Court attributes particular weight to the fact that the applicant did not challenge the impartiality and competence of the medical expert who had been entrusted with the duty of performing the examination. The expert's findings are also supported by the statements of the applicant's fellow inmates, who claimed that they had not seen the police officers hitting the applicant and insisted that the latter had repeatedly hit his head against the wall. The veracity of those statements was also not contested by the applicant. The Court's conclusion that the Government's version of events is the more plausible one is further strengthened by the findings made during the crime-scene examination performed on 15 March 2003. The Court is mindful of the fact that during the examination of the cells bloodstains were discovered on the wall near the bunk in cell no. 1 and on the metal bars and the cell door in the cell for administrative detainees (see paragraph 18 above). That discovery sits ill with the applicant's versions of events, namely, that he had either been hit with a plastic bottle or lifted up and thrown against the wall. It rather supports the Government's account, which is that the applicant, while lying on the bunk, had hit his head against the wall and that later on, while being detained in the cell for administrative detainees, had grabbed the metal bars and repeatedly hit his head against them.",

In the present case the applicant's lawyer complained of ill-treatment to the prosecution authorities on 8 March 2003 (see paragraph 19 above). The Court is mindful of the fact that the prosecutor's office opened its investigation immediately after being notified of the alleged beatings. On 9\u00a0March 2003 the applicant was subjected to a medical examination authorised by the investigating authorities. Further steps were promptly taken in the aftermath of the applicant's admission to the hospital. In particular, on 15 March 2003, the day following the applicant's hospitalisation, the investigator, assisted by the expert criminologist and two attesting witnesses, examined the cells where the applicant had been detained and drew up a detailed report, documenting the evidence collected. In the following few days the authorities took significant investigative measures, including questioning police officers, fellow inmates of the applicant and emergency doctors and obtaining an expert opinion. The Court does not find the fact that the three investigator's decisions were annulled by a higher-ranking prosecutor or court due to certain procedural defects to be evidence of the inefficiency of the investigation, since from the materials in the case it follows that the investigating authorities made diligent efforts to establish the circumstances of the events and to reconcile conflicting versions of events. In particular, they persistently tried to identify and interview additional witnesses who could have shed light on the events in question. They also further questioned the known witnesses in order to eliminate or explain the discrepancies which had arisen in their previous statements. The Court is also mindful of the fact that the authorities' task was significantly complicated by the applicant's confusing complaints and inconsistent description of the events. In this connection the Court observes that the fact that the investigators had heard the applicant in person with a certain delay did not affect the efficiency of the investigation as the applicant's testimony had not clarified the situation and had not divulged any evidence which could have assisted the authorities in establishing the truth. In addition, the Court does not overlook the fact that the applicant did not complain that he had not been duly informed of the progress of the investigation.",

The Court is also of the opinion that from the start of the investigation the authorities thoroughly evaluated medical evidence before them, attempting to draw conclusions from it, without accepting too readily the police officers' version of events. The Court does not therefore find it established that the investigating authorities failed to look for corroborating evidence or exhibited a deferential attitude to the police officers.\u00a0The Court also finds that the authorities may be regarded as having acted with sufficient promptness and having proceeded with reasonable expedition.",

During that time, while awaiting trial, the defendant had been considered to be detained on the basis of the legal provision in question.

The Court further observes that a part of the applicant's complaint refers to a period of pre-trial detention which ended more than six months before he lodged the application with the Court on 19 April 2004. The most recent period of detention which the Court may examine commenced on 6\u00a0November 2003 when the three-month period of detention covered by the order of 1 September 2003 expired (see paragraph 40 above). On 31\u00a0October 2003 the Chernoyarskiy District Court issued the subsequent decision, meant to cover the period of the applicant's detention for an additional month, from 6 November to 6 December 2003 (see paragraph 45 above). The final decision concerning the lawfulness of that order was given on 10\u00a0November 2003, that is, within the six months preceding the lodging of the application (see paragraph 45 above). The Court also notes, and the parties did not dispute the fact, that the decision of 15 October 2003, which was quashed on appeal on 13 November 2003, could not be construed as a formal order authorising the applicant's continued detention during the period between 15 October and 6 November 2003 (see Matyush v. Russia, no. 14850/03, \u00a7 63, 9 December 2008; Shukhardin v. Russia, no.\u00a065734/01, \u00a7\u00a081, 28\u00a0June 2007; and Melnikova v. Russia, no.\u00a024552/02, \u00a7\u00a061, 21\u00a0June 2007). The Court therefore considers that the part of the applicant's complaints concerning the alleged unlawfulness of his detention before 6\u00a0November 2003 has been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention (see Salmanov v.

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention - with which it has close affinity -, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law.

It reiterates the Government's argument that the applicant's detention during that period was governed by Article 255 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure. In the light of the information before it, the Court observes that Article 255 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure lays down a set of regulations for detention of a defendant after his case has been referred for trial (see paragraph 76 above). As indicated in the Government's submission, before the ruling of 22\u00a0March 2005 of the Russian Constitutional Court, the Russian courts interpreted that provision as dispensing them from an obligation to issue any detention order within six months after the defendant had been committed to stand trial (see paragraphs 110 and 111 above). The courts' approach was apparently based on the underlying proposition that Article 255 of the new CCrP had introduced time-limits for the detention of defendants \u201cduring judicial proceedings\u201d and that, therefore, the judicial authorities were no longer required to issue any formal order authorising detention during that maximum six-month period.",

The stance of the Russian courts at the material time made it unreasonable for claimants such as the applicant to expect any form of redress until a change in the existing interpretation of Article 255 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure was introduced by the .",

Having said that, the Court would emphasise that there is a general rule that the domestic courts, in particular the trial court, are better placed to examine all the circumstances of the case and take all the necessary decisions, including those in respect of pre-trial detention. The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see B\u0105k v. , no. 7870/04, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007II (extracts)). In the present case the national courts also relied on other circumstances, including the fact that the applicant had fled the crime scene and had attempted to hide the crime weapon. While the Court doubts whether those circumstances, taken on their own, could have justified the domestic courts' finding about the necessity of the applicant's continued detention, it is satisfied that the totality of those factors combined with other relevant grounds could have provided the domestic courts with an understanding of the pattern of the applicant's behaviour and the persistence of a risk of his absconding.",

The Court accepts that, in the special circumstances of the case, the risk stemming from the nature of the applicant's relations with witnesses actually existed and justified holding him in custody for the relevant period (compare with Ra\u017cniak v. Poland, no. 6767/03, \u00a7 31, 7 October 2008, and also see Contrada v. Italy, 24 August 1998, \u00a7 58, Reports 1998V). In order to demonstrate that a substantial risk of collusion existed and continued to exist, the District Court further referred to the scope of the case and the necessity to perform a number of procedural steps with which the applicant could have interfered, if released (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). The District Court based a secondary argument on the applicant's behaviour preceding his arrest.",

The Court readily understands that in such circumstances the authorities considered it necessary to keep the applicant detained in order to prevent him from disrupting the criminal proceedings. It reiterates that the fear of reprisal, justifiable in the present case, can often be enough for intimidated witnesses to withdraw from the criminal justice process altogether. The Court observes that the domestic courts carefully balanced the safety of the two witnesses who had given statements against the applicant, together with the prospect of other witnesses' willingness to testify, against the applicant's right to liberty.",

The Court considers that on the basis of the information in their possession at the time when the detention orders were issued, the domestic courts could have reasonably considered that the danger posed by the applicant's behaviour to the proper administration of justice was real and that it warranted his detention (see, mutatis mutandis, X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 8083/77, Commission's report of 13 March 1980, DR 19, p.\u00a0223).",

Russia, no.\u00a07064/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a072 et seq., 1 June 2006). In the present case, the domestic courts cited specific facts in support of their conclusion that the applicant might interfere with the proceedings. They also considered a possibility of applying alternative measures, such as accepting the guarantees offered by MPs and an Ombudsman, but found them to be inadequate. The Court concludes that the applicant's behaviour as described in the decisions of the domestic courts justified his detention. The applicant's detention was therefore based on \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds.",

The materials presented by the parties show that within eight months the prosecution had searched the applicant's house, obtained several expert opinions, questioned the applicant, confronted him with witnesses and drawn up the bill of indictment. It took the applicant several months to study the case file which delayed the committal of the case for trial through no fault of the authorities (see paragraph 43 above). While the court does not lose sight of the fact that it took the trial court approximately a year and a half to examine the applicant's case, it reiterates that the right of an accused in detention to have his case examined with particular expedition must not hinder the efforts of the courts to carry out their tasks with proper care (see among other authorities, W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 254A). The Court does not observe any delays in the course of the trial proceedings. Hearings were scheduled and held at regular intervals.

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a028, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per level of jurisdiction may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",

The Court is unable to determine whether the expenses claimed by the applicant were, in fact, incurred in the amount he claimed and it therefore makes no award under this head.",

It is clear from the length and detail of the pleadings submitted by the applicant that a great deal of work was carried out on his behalf. Having regard to the documents submitted and the rates for the lawyers' work, the Court is satisfied that these rates are reasonable. However, the Court considers that a reduction should be applied to the amount claimed in respect of legal fees on account of the fact that some of the applicant's complaints were either declared inadmissible or no violation was found. Having regard to the materials in its possession, the Court awards the applicant EUR 124.16 for his postal expenses, EUR 300 in respect of the translation and administrative fees and EUR 2,000 for the applicant's legal representation before the Court, together with any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant.",
