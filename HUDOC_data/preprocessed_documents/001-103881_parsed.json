Italy, 27 February 1992, \u00a7 17, Series A no.\u00a0230D). It is also mindful of the fact that the District Court did not avail themselves of the measures available to them under national law to discipline the defaulting respondent (see Sokolov v. Russia, no. 3734/02, \u00a7\u00a040, 22 September 2005).",
