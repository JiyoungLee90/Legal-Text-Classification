From the facts of the case it seems clear that after the district governor had received the complaint by the applicant's father, he tried to mediate between the father and the officer. According to the district governor, the officer offered his apologies to the father, after which the father accepted the apologies and the original complaint was torn up by the district governor (paragraph 11). Even if the complaint which was later found on the body of the by then deceased father had the same contents as the one which was torn up (something which was denied by the district governor \u2013 see paragraph 32), and notwithstanding the legal obligations laid down in Article 235 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 46), I still do not see that the way the district governor acted at that time was contributory to the procedural violation, unless it should have been clear to the district governor at that time that the applicant's father had been so badly beaten up that an immediate medical investigation was also necessary. There are, however, no indications that this was the case. The only thing I am prepared to accept is that the district governor should have assumed his responsibility and should have ordered an immediate, independent, effective and adequate investigation once he had learnt that the applicant's father had all of a sudden died.",

This was also the conclusion of the . Nevertheless, the domestic court, considering that Mr Emin Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m had been subjected to ill-treatment by Officer Akg\u00fcn, either because the alleged beating had occurred or because, as the officer himself admitted, he had shouted at the deceased, sentenced him to imprisonment for three months and fifteen days and he was temporarily prohibited from public service for two months and fifteen days. The fact that the sentence was decreased to imprisonment for two months and fifteen days and then commuted to a fine does not change the main element of the case, that Officer Akg\u00fcn was put on trial and, after a fair trial, which has not been disputed, was sentenced. Moreover, a heavy penalty of a fine, regardless of the amount, has serious consequences for a convicted person. The majority's finding of a procedural violation could have been justified if Officer Akg\u00fcn had not been brought to trial or had not been punished. This was not the case. Furthermore, it should be taken into account that Mr Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m did not lodge a complaint against Officer Akg\u00fcn, as the officer had apologised to him.",

The shortcomings in the case file indicated by the Forensic Medicine Institute were remedied and the file was completed. After a thorough examination of the file, the Forensic Medicine Institute submitted a report to the domestic court. However, the applicant's representative did not accept the findings of this report. Upon this objection, the domestic court decided to request a report from the General Assembly of the Forensic Medicine Institute. The judgment of 14 June 1999 is based upon the report of the General Assembly of the Forensic Medicine Institute which was signed by twenty-four physicians, all experts in their fields. Some of them are specialists in forensic medicine, some in traumatology, some in radiology, etc.",

It is noteworthy that the report of the Forensic Medicine Institute stated that upon examination of three computerised tomography (CT) scans \u2013 a very sensitive method of diagnosis \u2013 no traces of subdural haematoma or any other trauma were found. Therefore, it is likely that the subdural haematoma was formed during the operation, that is, after the CT scans. Even if it is assumed that a subdural haematoma existed before the operation, there was no evidence to suggest that this was the result of the incident that took place one month earlier. In fact, there is every reason to believe that there was no causal link between the alleged beating and the death of Mr Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, since a subdural haematoma is an acute process that occurs immediately after a head trauma. In the present case, the deceased became unconscious one month after the incident. It should be added that during this period of one month he did not seek any medical help.",
