According to the protesters, they were taken aback by the alteration of the expected layout and were unwilling to turn towards Bolotnaya embankment; they therefore demanded that the police officers at the cordon move the cordon back to allow sufficient space for the protesters to pass and to assemble for the meeting. According to the official version, the protesters were not interested in proceeding to the meeting venue; they stopped because they had either intended to break the cordon in order to proceed towards Bolshoy Kamennyy bridge and then to the Kremlin, or to stir up the crowd to incite disorder. After about fifteen minutes of attempting to engage with the cordon officers, who did not enter into any discussion and with no senior officer delegated to negotiate, at 5.16 p.m. the four leaders announced that they were going on a \u201csit-down strike\u201d and sat on the ground. The people behind them stopped, although some people continued to go past them towards the stage. The leaders of the sit-in called on other demonstrators to follow their example and sit down, but only a few of their entourage did so (between approximately twenty and fifty people in total).",

According to the Ukrainian Government, despite the prompt reaction of the authorities to the report of the first applicant\u2019s alleged abduction, no proof of his abduction had been found. The investigating authority had inspected the place of the alleged abduction immediately after the report, and had questioned Ms B., who had submitted the report, Mr S., who had witnessed someone being pushed into a black van, and their colleague Ms R., who had not seen or heard anything noteworthy and had only learned about the incident from Mr\u00a0R.; it had also questioned residents of the neighbourhood, who had said that they had not seen anyone being pushed into a car; the investigating authority had also made enquiries with the Ministry of the Interior in Kyiv, the Security Service of Ukraine and the State Border Guard Service to establish the first applicant\u2019s whereabouts. The State Border Guard Service had reported that the applicant had crossed the border on the same day in a normal way, his passage had been recorded in the official database, he had presented his passport and he had not made any complaints of abduction to the border guards. The investigating authority had also made an enquiry with Interpol and learned that on 21 October 2012 the first applicant had been detained in Moscow. As to the alleged absence of a border-crossing record at the Russian checkpoint, the Ukrainian authorities were not able to comment as this related to matters that would have taken place in Russian territory and under the authority of the Russian Federation. In conclusion, they considered that this complaint was in any event manifestly ill-founded. That decision was confirmed on 26 February 2013 by the same body.",

If they could not take any practical steps towards an inquiry for lack of territorial jurisdiction, it was their obligation to seek the assistance of the Ukrainian authorities (see G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 232-33), but this has not been done.

Russia, nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, \u00a7 110, 4 October 2016). The Court observes that, according to both parties, the hearings were conducted four days a week, from about 11 a.m. to about 5 p.m. However, this did not include the time the first applicant spent during the transfer between the detention facility and the court. During the trial he regularly complained about his early departures from the detention facility \u2013 as early as 6 a.m. \u2013 and late arrivals after the hearings, typically after 11\u00a0p.m., but sometimes after midnight, and asked the court to reduce the frequency of the hearings, to transfer him to another detention facility or to apply a noncustodial preventive measure. The Government did not comment on the applicant\u2019s submissions about his early pick-up and late drop-off times. It appears from the detention facility\u2019s report that the drop-off time was 10.15\u00a0p.m., which means that the first applicant had seven hours and fortyfive minutes before the pick-up for the next day\u2019s hearing. The Court considers that the time of rest thus afforded to the first applicant was far from adequate (see also paragraphs 254-255 below). However, in the present case the information available about the intensity of the hearing schedule does not, by itself or in combination with other elements known about the conditions of the first applicant\u2019s detention and the medical care provided to him, allow the Court to conclude that it attained the threshold of severity required to characterise it as degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",

According to the Court\u2019s case-law under the latter provision, the persistence of a reasonable suspicion is a condition sine qua non for the validity of continued detention (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. , \u00a7 87, ECHR 2016 (extracts)).

In particular, house arrest is considered, in view of its degree and intensity, to amount to deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention. The Court has held that this type of deprivation of liberty requires relevant and sufficient reasons, just as with pre-trial detention. It has specified that the notions of \u201cdegree\u201d and \u201cintensity\u201d in its case-law, as criteria for the applicability of Article 5, refer only to the degree of restrictions on liberty of movement, not to differences in comfort or in the internal regime in different places of detention. Thus, the Court would apply the same criteria for deprivation of liberty, irrespective of the place where the applicant was detained (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104 and 113-14).",

Although the second applicant considered the latter sanction unlawful and irrelevant for the preventive measure in question, the Court notes that the criminal charges in the present case related to disorder during a public event; the reference to the applicant\u2019s conduct at assemblies during the period when he was subjected to the undertaking was thus pertinent for the assessment of the risk of his reoffending. Therefore, at least one of the grounds relied on by the authorities could be said to have genuinely conformed to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 \u00a7 1\u00a0(c), and it does not appear there was any element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Saadi v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013229/03, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2008, and the cases cited therein). There was thus no violation of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 in this respect.

However, it appears from the parties\u2019 submissions that on that date the second applicant attended the indictment procedure in person. Accordingly, even if on one occasion three days previously the applicant had not answered a telephone call, this was of no consequence to the course of the investigation. Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to corroborate the allegation that the difficulty in contacting the second applicant was a recurring problem or that the applicant had travelled beyond Moscow\u2019s city limits in breach of the undertaking. Accordingly, the risk of his absconding was not sufficiently demonstrated in the judicial decision imposing house arrest.",

As found above, the second applicant\u2019s participation in and conduct at public events could legitimately be taken into account, in view of the nature of the accusations in the criminal case (see paragraph 214 above). Despite the applicant\u2019s disagreement with the administrative conviction, the court deciding on the preventive measure was not required to reassess the administrative charges determined by another competent court. For the purpose of his initial two-month detention, the reference to a final judgment could be regarded as \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d. However, the five subsequent decisions ultimately extending his house arrest to a period of over seventeen months reiterated the reasons given in the original order without a fresh assessment of their continued relevance and sufficiency. In particular, it remained unexplained why the court\u2019s original assessment that the risk of reoffending could be suitably curbed by a two-month period of detention had to be reviewed. The extensions did not mention any circumstances arising during the first two months of the house arrest indicating the applicant\u2019s intention to reoffend or any external reasons pointing to the persistence of this particular risk. Moreover, the courts systematically rejected the applicant\u2019s offer of bail without stating reasons beyond a formulaic indication that this would not suffice as a preventive measure.",

They considered that, as a matter of principle, his appointment had not undermined the lawfulness, independence or impartiality of the tribunal conducting the applicants\u2019 trial.

First, account should have been taken of the role of the Supreme Court as a superior court in relation to the Moscow City Court; for a month, the judge in question had simultaneously held the positions of judge of the first-instance court and of the appellate court. Secondly, the judge\u2019s appointment had resulted in a strict deadline for completing the trial at first instance and giving judgment, and that could have motivated the judge to reject the applicants\u2019 requests to examine witnesses in order to be able to finish the case before taking up his new office. The applicants specified that they had not challenged the judge because of the numerous warnings given to the lawyers throughout the hearing when they had made procedural applications such as requests to examine certain witnesses. The judge had considered some of these applications an abuse of process and potentially punishable, and this had discouraged the defence counsel from raising important procedural points, including the judge\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality.",

In the present case, the Court has no grounds for finding that the appointment of Judge Z. to a superior court precluded him from continuing to hear the case under examination before the new appointment had taken effect.

Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2005XIII). The Court has consistently held that the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (ibid., \u00a7 119; see also Hauschildt v. Denmark, 24 May 1989, \u00a7\u00a047, Series A no. 154). The Court observes that the decision on Z.\u2019s appointment was taken on 18 June 2014, four months after the beginning of the trial and about one month before its end, including two final weeks when the court was deliberating in private, preparing the text of the judgment. The material in the case file contains no indication that Judge Z.\u2019s appointment affected his conduct, in particular his approach to dealing with witnesses and evidence in the proceedings. Moreover, the applicants did not make an objection on this ground at the relevant time and did not refer to any specific occurrence in their points of appeal.

Criminal courts are obliged to establish the facts of the case relevant for the assessment of the legal responsibility of the accused as accurately and precisely as possible, and they cannot present established facts as mere allegations or suspicions. This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third parties, though if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those accused in the trial before it. Even if the law expressly states that no inferences about the guilt of a person can be drawn from criminal proceedings in which he or she has not participated, judicial decisions must be worded so as to avoid any potential prejudgment about the third party\u2019s guilt in order not to jeopardise the fair examination of the charges in the separate proceedings (see Karaman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06465).",

It found that although the conditions in hearing room no. 635 of Moscow City Court did not attain the minimum level of severity to constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, they amounted to a disproportionate restriction of the defendants\u2019 rights to participate effectively in the proceedings and to receive practical and effective legal assistance. In particular, the defendants were separated from the rest of the hearing room by glass, a physical barrier which to some extent reduced their direct involvement in the hearing and made it impossible for them to have confidential exchanges with legal counsel. However, the trial court did not seem to recognise the impact of these courtroom arrangements on their defence rights, and did not take any measures to compensate for these limitations.",

It observes that the first applicant and his lawyers made numerous detailed and specific complaints alleging that he could not concentrate on the hearing because of exhaustion and sleep deprivation. The courts, however, considered that the schedule was reasonable on the basis of the time the applicant spent in court. They did not take into consideration the time the first applicant spent being transferred, although they accepted the report from the detention facility indicating the drop-off time as 10.15\u00a0p.m., implying that this left him seven hours and forty-five minutes before the pick-up for the next day\u2019s hearing. Moreover, lengthy transfers in poor conditions to and from courts appear to have been common in Moscow at the material time (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-11). The cumulative effect of exhaustion caused by lengthy prison transfers leaving less than eight hours of rest, repeated for four days a week over a period of more than four months, must have seriously undermined the first applicant\u2019s ability to follow the proceedings, make submissions, take notes and instruct his lawyers. While the Court accepts the domestic court\u2019s reasons for expediting the proceedings, it considers that in this case insufficient consideration was given to the first applicant\u2019s requests for a less intensive hearing schedule.",

Italy (no.\u00a02), no. 25498/94, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2000X; Kurkowski v. Poland, no.\u00a036228/06, \u00a7\u00a095, 9 April 2013; and Vintman v. Ukraine, no. 28403/05, \u00a7\u00a078, 23 October 2014). It further reiterates that the refusal of leave to attend a relative\u2019s funeral constitutes an interference with the right to respect for family life (see Schemkamper v. France, no. , \u00a7 31, 18 October 2005; Lind v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 92, 6 December 2007; and Feldman v.\u00a0Ukraine (no. 2), no. , \u00a7 32, 12 January 2012). Whereas Article 8 does not guarantee an unconditional right to leave to attend a relative\u2019s funeral, and even though a detainee by the very nature of his situation may be subjected to various limitations of his rights and freedoms, every such limitation must be nevertheless justifiable as being \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (see Lind, \u00a7 94, and Feldman, \u00a7 34, both cited above). The authorities can refuse an individual the right to attend the funeral of his parents only if there are compelling reasons for such refusal and if no alternative solution can be found (see P\u0142oski v.

The latter refusal was not based on the assessment of his individual situation, in particular the fact that he had not been given an opportunity to see his mother before her death. The time constraints complicating the planning of the funeral attendance was not a sufficient reason for refusing it. It is typical for funerals to be fixed at very short notice and they are generally regarded as a matter of urgency. In this case, it would have been physically possible for the first applicant to arrive at the funeral, which was held on the following day in the same city. The fact that the request came from the Ombudsperson rather than from the applicant should not have mattered because it was clear from her letter that the request had been initiated by the applicant\u2019s counsel (see paragraph 144 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the decision to refuse the first applicant leave was taken in a manner incompatible with the State\u2019s duty to carry out an individualised evaluation of his particular situation and to demonstrate that the restriction of his right to attend a relative\u2019s funeral was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

Accordingly, in the circumstances of the case, Article 10 of the Convention is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11 of the Convention, which is the lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 202; Akarsuba\u015f\u0131 and Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek v. Turkey, no. 19620/12, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03133, 23 January 2018; and \u00d6\u011fr\u00fc v. Turkey, no. 19631/12, \u00a7 13, 17\u00a0October 2017). As such, the applicants\u2019 complaints should be examined under Article 11 of the Convention. On the other hand, notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, Article 11 of the Convention must, in the present case, also be considered in the light of Article 10 of the Convention. The protection of personal opinions, secured by Article 10 of the Convention, is one of the objectives of freedom of peaceful assembly as enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention (see Ezelin, cited above, \u00a7 37).",

It found, in particular, that the sit-in had begun because of the unexpected change of the venue layout, of which the police had not informed the organisers. It also found that the authorities had made an insufficient effort to communicate with the assembly organisers to resolve the tension caused by the confusion about the venue layout, and that breaking through the police cordon was not confirmed to have been the organisers\u2019 desired outcome (see Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113-16 and 128).",

Where the sanctions imposed on demonstrators are criminal in nature, they require particular justification (see Rai and Evans v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos.  and , 17 November 2009). A peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction, and notably to deprivation of liberty (see Akg\u00f6l and G\u00f6l v.

Hence, I do not understand why the majority downplayed this degrading conduct by merely considering it under Article 6 and not under Article 3. \u00a0The majority\u2019s legal reasoning on this point is quite contradictory: on the one hand, they admit that the \u201ccumulative effect of exhaustion caused by lengthy prison transfers leaving less than eight hours of rest, repeated for four days a week over a period of more than four months, must have seriously undermined the first applicant\u2019s ability to follow the proceedings, make submissions, take notes and instruct his lawyers\u201d (see paragraph 254 of the judgment), but on the other hand they do not acknowledge that this same seriously damaging conduct had the effect of degrading the applicant to the level of a mere object in the hands of the authorities. \u00a0In my view, the extremely tiring early pick-up and late drop-off times, the excessively intensive hearing schedule and the lengthy prison transfers were the source not only of the breach of the right to a fair procedure under Article 6 acknowledged by the majority (see paragraph 255 of the judgment), but also of a violation of the prohibition of degrading treatment under Article 3, which the majority failed to recognise.",

However, it seems right for me to explain the reasoning by which I arrived at this conclusion as I have disagreed with the Court on this issue in previous cases (see, for example, my partly dissenting opinion in Kasparov v. Russia, no. 53659/07, 11\u00a0October 2016, and my joint partly dissenting opinion with Judges Nicolaou and Dedov in Navalnyy and Ofitserov v. Russia, nos. 46632/13 and 28671/14, 23 February 2016).",

The essence of an Article 18 complaint is that a Convention right was restricted chiefly for a purpose not prescribed by the Convention (see Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], no.\u00a072508/13, \u00a7 305, 28 November 2017). In the single paragraph of his observations addressing Article 18, Mr Udaltsov submitted that his criminal prosecution might have a chilling effect on him and others who publicly criticised the Government. However, he did not argue that his prosecution had been undertaken for a purpose such as a \u201chidden agenda\u201d to silence him (contrast Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 15172/13, \u00a7\u00a7 133-44, 22 May 2014). Because of Mr Udaltsov\u2019s omission in this regard, the Court could only consider the purposes for the prosecution asserted by the Government: the prevention of disorder and crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. These are legitimate aims, as reflected in paragraph 288 of the Court\u2019s judgment.",

                        "content": "3.\u00a0\u00a0The Court would accept the predominance of an ulterior purpose such as the silencing of criticism, which is alien to the ideals and values of a democratic society governed by the rule of law (see Merabishvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0307). However, since Mr Udaltsov has failed to assert an ulterior purpose, it is unnecessary to consider Article 18. My conviction in this regard is strengthened even more by the fact that the second applicant did not submit that the \u201chidden agenda\u201d of the authorities was a fundamental aspect of this case (contrast Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], nos. 29580/12 and 4\u00a0others, \u00a7 156, 15 November 2018). As the Court notes at paragraph 305 of its judgment, his argument as to Article 18 was essentially the same as that made with respect to Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. It should be noted that Mr\u00a0Udaltsov is in a rather unfortunate situation. He made his submission in 2016, before the judgments in Merabishvili (28 November 2017) and Navalnyy (15 November 2018) were handed down (see Navalnyy, cited above, \u00a7 165, and Merabishvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 309-17). At the time when he made his observations, the criteria for a prima facie claim might thus not have been so clear in the Court\u2019s case-law. Nevertheless, after Merabishvili and in the absence of a claim that this aspect of the case is fundamental, there is nothing to induce the Court to deviate in this case from its settled practice, which is not to engage with questions that it has already examined under other provisions of the Convention (see Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a047848/08, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2014).",

The Court has made it clear that applicants may rely on inferences and \u201cunrebutted presumptions of facts\u201d and that it will be more easily persuaded if the alleged purpose is particularly reprehensible or the Convention right at stake is especially significant (see Merabishvili, cited above, \u00a7 314).",
