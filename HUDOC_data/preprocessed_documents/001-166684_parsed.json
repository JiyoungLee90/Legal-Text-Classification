As regards the frequency with which the flat had changed hands and the artificially low price she had allegedly paid for the flat, the applicant argued that those facts had not been established in the course of the relevant domestic proceedings and that the Government were precluded from relying on them in the proceedings before the Court. In any event, the Government had not submitted any evidence in support of their allegation as regards the market value of the flat. In the applicant\u2019s opinion the fact that K. had sold her the flat only a month and a half after he had purchased it had not been sufficient for the national courts to conclude that she had not bought the flat in good faith. To date there has been no official judgment or other act establishing that K. had acted in contravention of the law when buying and then selling the flat. There was nothing in the Government\u2019s submissions to suggest that K. had not been a bona fide purchaser of the flat. In any event, each transaction in respect of the flat had been subject to strict verification by the relevant State bodies which had discerned no illegality in that respect.",
