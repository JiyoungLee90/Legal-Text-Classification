M., who had taken him to the crime scene on the day after the murder. He claimed that he had been ill-treated by the police in order to own up to the crime. The judgment did not specify the date of the murder and there was evidence confirming that M. had died later than the prosecution maintained. The applicant also submitted that, before being questioned as an accused, he had told the police all the details about the murder which he had found out from R. M. This contradicted the court's finding that the police had not had any details about the murder before the applicant's interview as a suspect. He refused to sign both confessions but could not offer further resistance due to fear of ill-treatment. He referred to evidence in his criminal file that on the morning of 4 June 1997 his relatives had concluded a contract with a lawyer for his representation but that the investigator had refused to allow that lawyer to represent him. He was then provided with another lawyer whom he did not trust and who did not protect his rights, but was in agreement with the investigator. In addition, the presence of a medical expert and witnesses at the first interview was not a common practice and the expert had not been warned, according to the law, of his criminal responsibility for making false statements. The unusual presence of so many persons at the very first interview only confirmed that the investigator had known that the applicant's will had been broken as a result of ill-treatment and he had agreed to \u201cconfess\u201d. The investigator needed to create a very strong appearance of lack of ill-treatment which would be difficult to rebut. The court had failed to even mention the statement of I. M., which constituted an alibi for the applicant because it confirmed that he had returned home much earlier than R. M. and U.",

Witness T. did not mention his name in her statement. The illtreatment applied to him (making him wear a gas mask and blocking the access of air until he lost consciousness from suffocation) could not have left marks on his body. He referred to the findings of the forensic report, which contradicted his statements and the version of the prosecution, according to which he and R. M. had attempted to strangle M. That report did not find any marks of strangulation but found multiple injuries, which confirmed that M. had been hit repeatedly. The date of the murder had not been established: the residual quantity of the soporific in M.'s blood was small, confirming that she had taken it a long time before her death. In addition, the expert declared that she had died several days before the report was drawn up (on 5\u00a0June 1997), which excluded the date of 19 May 1997 as the date of the murder. Another expert submitted in 1998 that M. had died a week before the report of 5 June 1997, which also challenged the prosecution's version that M. had been murdered on 19 May 1997. The applicant drew the court's attention to his refusal to sign the confessions, which cast doubt on their genuine character. He invoked Articles 3, 5 and 6 of the Convention.",

However, it does not see in the domestic courts' judgments a proper analysis of these arguments raised by the applicant. The one exception was the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice, which addressed the discrepancy between the self-incriminating statement concerning an attempt to strangulate M. with a cord and the findings of the expert, who had found no signs of strangulation on M.'s body. However, while the Supreme Court of Justice apparently tried to deal with this clear discrepancy, it chose to simply rephrase the applicant's statement from what it expressly said (an attempt at strangulation) to something better corresponding to the findings of the expert (signs of severe beating, which had never been mentioned in the applicant's statement, see paragraphs 13 and 33 above). The Court considers that this tempering with evidence (by significantly amending the applicant's statements) was not only arbitrary but also did not answer the applicant's argument that there was a serious contradiction between his statements and objective evidence found which, together with his refusal to sign those statements, challenged their genuine character. Answering the applicant's arguments in this respect was even more important in the light of the fact that this was one of the reasons for which the courts had acquitted him in the first round of the proceedings (see paragraph 22 above).",

There was no explanation for this omission, which concerned one of the strongest arguments put forward by the defence and thus required a proper analysis. Similarly, even though there was a discrepancy between what T. declared to the police (not mentioning the applicant, but another person S.) and what S. P. reported as having been told by T. (mentioning the applicant), the investigators and the courts did not question T. again in this respect during her interview on 5 June 1997 to dispel any doubts, but simply preferred to rely on S. P.'s hearsay evidence, to the detriment of that provided by the original witness.",

The Court could not find any explanation for such omissions in the domestic courts' decisions (see Gr\u0103dinar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117). This is striking, given that two courts acquitted the applicant in the first round of proceedings (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above) and since, in the absence of any new evidence mentioned in the courts' judgments, they convicted the applicant in the second round of proceedings, disregarding circumstances which had earlier led to his acquittal (see Salov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a091).

It was this failure of the two appellate courts to give sufficient reasons for reversing the factual conclusions of the trial court which was at the heart of the Court's finding of a violation of Article 6. In marked contrast, the applicant in the present case was convicted of murder on his retrial after a full rehearing of the evidence in the case and his conviction was upheld by both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. The majority's finding is based not, as in Gr\u01cedinar, on the failure of the appellate courts to give sufficient reasons for reversing the trial court's conclusion on the evidence before it, but on the alleged failure of the trial and appellate courts on the retrial of the applicant to give sufficient reasons for departing from the assessment of the evidence by the original trial court.",

While the procedural guarantees of fairness in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention undoubtedly require that a tribunal conduct a proper examination of the submissions, arguments and evidence before it, it is for the tribunal itself to assess the extent to which they are relevant for its decision. As is correctly emphasised in the judgment, the Article cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced or detailed reasons to be given for accepting or rejecting the evidence before it. Still less can Article 6 be understood as requiring, in a case such as the present, where there has been a retrial of an applicant, that reasons are given by the tribunal for reaching a different assessment of the evidence before it, or a different conclusion on that evidence, from that of the original trial court. The  will in principle be justified in intervening only in a case where the assessment of the evidence before the domestic courts, or the reasons given for the conclusions reached on that evidence, are manifestly unreasonable or otherwise arbitrary.",

As to the first of these elements, it is said that, while noting that the incriminating documents had been found in the apartment which the applicant shared with his co-defendant, R. M., the  omitted to mention that the record of the search of the apartment did not specify whether the documents were found in the room rented by R. M. or elsewhere in the apartment. However, there is nothing in the material before the Court to indicate what reliance, if any, was placed by the applicant at his trial on this element of the evidence. Certainly, it does not appear from the judgments of the appellate courts, that it was made a central part of the applicant's appeals to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.",

P.'s report of his interview with T. and not in T.'s own statement. However, it is also true that S. P. was called as a witness at the retrial and that he confirmed his account of what T. had told him on 4 June 1997. Complaint is made in the judgment of the fact that the domestic courts \u201cpreferred to rely on S. P.'s hearsay evidence to the detriment of that provided by the original witness\u201d and that no steps had been taken to question T. again during her interview of 5 June 1997 to dispel any doubts about the alleged discrepancy between the two accounts. But, again, it is unclear whether any objection at trial was taken by the applicant to the admission of S. P.'s evidence; nor does it appear what, if any, reliance was placed at the trial or on appeal on the alleged inconsistency between the two statements.",

The Regional Court expressly found the statements to have been voluntary, noting that the forensic medical expert had discovered no physical injuries on the applicant, that when questioned by the police inspector the applicant had stated in the presence of a lawyer and witnesses that there had been no coercion whatsoever and that he had given the statements without any constraints. The judgment asserts that there was a \u201cserious contradiction\u201d between the statements and the objective evidence which cast doubt on the genuineness of the statements and that the Supreme Court had \u201ctampered\u201d with the applicant's statements in order to circumvent this contradiction. It is not in our view the role of this Court to reach an independent assessment of the existence or the seriousness of the alleged contradiction; still less do we feel justified in drawing the conclusion that the Supreme Court tampered with evidence by significantly amending the applicant's statement as alleged.",

M. did not give evidence, his alibi being included in a written statement before the . It is true that the domestic courts on the retrial of the applicant did not make reference to the alibi or explain why it had been discounted. However, we note that, although the alibi was claimed by the applicant to be \u201cunchallenged\u201d, it was clearly inconsistent with the applicant's own confession statements, which were accepted by the domestic courts as valid.
