She pointed out that section 112 of the Civil Procedure Act allowed the submission of an application by fax and that according to the existing case-law of the Supreme Court an application was deemed to be submitted in due time if delivered to the competent court before the expiry of the time-limit regardless of how it was subsequently handled by the court, which was a matter of the court\u2019s internal organisation. The applicant submitted that the Local Court had received her appeal by fax in due time but then most probably failed to print it out and the document had automatically been deleted from the fax machine\u2019s memory. Hence, she argued that the date when the fax had been sent should be considered as the date the appeal had been lodged and that she should not be made to bear the burden of proof in a case where the document had not been printed out by the court. She further emphasised that a timely delivery should not have any negative consequences for the parties to the proceedings. Furthermore, as regards her failure to prove the content of the fax that had been sent to the Local Court on 28 June 2011, the applicant submitted: firstly, that the confirmation page from her lawyer\u2019s fax machine had showed the date of the transmission, the number of pages sent and the time it had taken to deliver the document to the receiving machine; secondly, on the following day, 29\u00a0June\u00a02011, the applicant had lodged the relevant document by registered mail which, according to her, proved that the document in question was in fact the appeal against the judgment of 24 May 2011. The applicant added that, according to information given to her by a telecommunications company and a fax-machine manufacturer, it was not possible to prove the content of a document sent by fax as those transmissions were encrypted.",

In the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, there was a possibility that the court would not receive the relevant document in due time because of faults in the telecommunications network or similar technical reasons (lack of paper, an empty ink cartridge, the machine shutting down, and so on). Such a risk was borne by the applicant in the same manner as if the document were sent by regular \u2013 as opposed to registered \u2013 mail, whereby the risk of late receipt of a motion was borne by the sender. Since the applicant had failed to prove the content of the document sent by fax on 28\u00a0June\u00a02011, the Supreme Court confirmed that the Higher Court had correctly taken into consideration only the appeal sent by registered post the next day.",

The Supreme Court held that proof that the fax was sent was not proof of receipt of the document by the addressee. In the Supreme Court\u2019s view, there existed a possibility that the court would not receive the relevant document in due time on account of faults in the telecommunication network or similar technical reasons.

The document was received by the Local Court\u2019s fax machine on the same day at 6.59 p.m., but it was not printed out for reasons which could not be explained by the Government. The following day, when the time-limit had already expired, the applicant sent an appeal (likewise consisting of six pages) by registered mail. The applicant\u2019s appeal was rejected as out of time, as were her subsequent objections that it had been sent by fax within the prescribed time-limit. The domestic courts only took into account the document sent by registered mail, noting that the applicant was unable to prove the content of the document sent by fax.

Accordingly, it was not in dispute in the present case that the applicant had been entitled to lodge her appeal by fax. However, their opinions differed as to whether an application successfully transmitted to the Local Court\u2019s fax machine could be considered delivered if it was not printed out and, consequently, no conclusive proof existed of its content, and to who was to bear the risk of any error or malfunction of the Local Court\u2019s fax machine resulting in the failure to print. The applicant took the view that, since the confirmation pages showed that the document in question had been received by the Local Court\u2019s fax machine, she should not have borne this risk. By contrast, the Government argued that any risks of technical failure in the transmission of documents by fax should be borne by the person submitting such a document.",

However, it cannot be overlooked that this view was adopted subsequent to the date on which the applicant lodged her application by fax; in its initial 2004 decision on the issue, the Supreme Court limited its findings to the issue of whether an application submitted by fax was to be treated as duly lodged (see paragraph 19 above). The court confirmed that such applications should be accepted and considered as delivered if they were submitted within the prescribed time-limit. However, the question of what constituted successful delivery of an application by fax was not addressed in that first decision. Accordingly, at the time of the applicant\u2019s appeal there was no basis for her to consider that what was recorded as a successful and timely fax transmission could nonetheless result in the rejection of the appeal as out of time.",

However, in the present case the parties did not dispute that a document of six pages had reached the Local Court on 28 June 2011. It appears that the applicant\u2019s properly dispatched fax was saved in the memory of the Local Court\u2019s fax machine, which was borne out by the confirmation pages from both the sending and receiving fax machines and by the registry of the Local Court (see paragraph 10 above). In view of these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant had good reason to believe that the document was submitted to the Local Court in accordance with the rules of domestic civil procedure on time-limits. As to the subsequent handling of the document in question by the Local Court, the applicant had no influence on whether it would be printed out or indeed whether the fax machine functioned properly.",

However, according to her undisputed information, fax transmissions are encrypted and thus their content cannot be proved (see paragraph 12 above). While a direct analysis of the content of the document in question was thus not possible, the applicant submitted to the domestic courts the confirmation page showing that on 28 June 2011 her lawyer had faxed a document of six pages to the competent court. She further pointed out that the document was the same size as the appeal lodged the next day by registered post. Notwithstanding the fact that it is primarily the role of the competent national authorities to decide upon the admissibility and relevance of evidence (see Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, \u00a7\u00a046, Series\u00a0A no. 140, and Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7\u00a091, Series A no. 22), the Court considers that the above considerations, coupled with the fact that the technical issue resulting in the incomplete delivery of the document in question to the Local Court was not attributable to the applicant but to the Local Court, render the domestic courts\u2019 approach of placing the entire burden of proof on the applicant overly rigid.",
