Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in a large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. In such cases it is up to the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000-VII).

The first question for the Court is whether it is established that the applicant\u2019s medical conditions were serious enough to need treatment, and whether his alleged suffering attained the minimum level of severity to make Article 3 of the Convention applicable. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s neurological problems were revealed in January 1997 at the latest. Subsequently, in the period to 19 December 2002, the medical diagnoses, so far as they are legible, alternated between those confirming the applicant\u2019s neurological problems (paragraphs\u00a030-33 above), diagnoses where no neurological problem was established (paragraph\u00a028 above), and those stating that the applicant\u2019s state of health was satisfactory and that he did not need any specific medical treatment (paragraphs\u00a029 and 34 above). In these circumstances, it is difficult for the Court to come to any factual conclusions as to the applicant\u2019s state of health and his alleged suffering over the whole of the period at issue.",

Although it is not for the Court to speculate, from the medical point of view, on whether the applicant\u2019s ailment per se caused him suffering going beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a094), the Court is of the view that the minimal level of severity was attained in the instant case. In particular, the knowledge that he had been diagnosed by the prison authorities as having ailments calling for specialist treatment but that such treatment was not available must have caused the applicant a degree of anguish over and above the mere discomfort and pain of his complaints. Accordingly, Article 3, in the Court\u2019s view, applies to the present case.",

However, the Government have done no more than state generally that the applicant received \u201crelevant treatment\u201d, without giving any details of the kind of treatment administered, when it was given and by whom (see, mutatis mutandis, Ostrovar v.\u00a0, no.\u00a035207/03, \u00a7 86, 13\u00a0September 2005).

On his release, he was immediately admitted to a specialised hospital and underwent medical treatment (see paragraph\u00a041 above). Hence, the Court takes the view that the applicant\u2019s detention in the SIZO No.\u00a027 from 19\u00a0December\u00a02002 onwards subjected him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kud\u0142a v.

In particular, they stated that the applicant\u2019s case was complicated on points of fact, given the number of accused (15\u00a0persons), civil claimants (16 persons), witnesses (according to them, more than 70 persons). This case, in their view, was also complicated on points of law as it concerned a number of multi-count crimes committed by a group of persons. In this respect, they maintained that the domestic authorities had had to carry out more than 20 different forensic expert examinations. Furthermore the Government pointed out that delays in the proceedings at issue had been caused by the accused and their lawyers, who had taken long periods of time to familiarise themselves with the case-files. Furthermore, their manifold complaints and requests likewise contributed to the length of the proceedings. In sum, they took the stance that the domestic authorities had acted with due diligence and that the length of the impugned proceedings was reasonable.",

The Court also takes into account the fact that, prior to the period under consideration, the proceedings had already been pending for nearly two years. The Government did not, however, put forward any plausible argument outweighing the above considerations.
