Pr\u00e9fet des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, case C-249/13, judgment of 11 December 2014, \u00a7\u00a7 28-35). The principles established by the case-law of the CJEU concerning the right to be heard under the Return Directive are set out in detail in the judgment in Khlaifia and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 42-45). This right to be heard, which applies as a fundamental principle of EU law, (a) guarantees to every person the opportunity to make known his or her views effectively during an administrative procedure and before the adoption of any decision liable to affect his or her interests adversely; and (b) is designed to enable the competent authority effectively to take into account all relevant information, to pay due attention to the observations submitted by the person concerned, and thus to give a detailed statement of reasons for its decision (see Khaled Boudjlida, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38). The CJEU added, among other things, that the alien need not necessarily be heard in respect of all the information on which the authority intended to rely to justify its return decision, but must simply have an opportunity to present any arguments against his removal. The CJEU established the restrictions to which the right to be heard could be made subject, and the consequences of failure to comply with this condition, and held that a decision taken following an administrative procedure in which the right to be heard had been infringed would result in annulment only if, had it not been for such an irregularity, the outcome of the procedure might have been different. Furthermore, the right to be heard could be subjected to restrictions, provided that they corresponded to objectives of general interest and did not involve, with regard to the objective pursued, a disproportionate and intolerable interference which infringed the very substance of the right guaranteed (see\u00a0Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45).",

It takes note of the remarks made by the CEAR in its observations concerning the border zone between Spain and Morocco (see paragraphs 33 and 47 above), and those of the Human Rights Commissioner echoing the remarks of the Spanish Ombudsperson, according to which Spanish jurisdiction is also exercised on the land between the fences at the Melilla border crossing, and not just beyond the protective structures of that crossing (see paragraphs 34 and 46 above).",

Basing their assertions on expert assessments, the Government criticised the poor quality of the video recordings in question, which in their view made it impossible to compare the footage with the photos in the official identity archives that had been checked when the applicants had entered Spanish territory subsequently. Furthermore, even assuming that the persons visible in the video footage were indeed the applicants, the latter had ceased to have victim status in so far as, a few months later, they had succeeded in entering Spanish territory unlawfully via the same border crossing and had been the subject of expulsion orders issued in the context of proceedings which, in the Government\u2019s submission, had been attended by all the necessary safeguards. Moreover, neither of the applicants had applied to the Spanish authorities for international protection before applying to the Court. Only N.D. had done so subsequently, despite the fact that, when they had entered Spain unlawfully after the events in the present applications, both applicants had been assisted by lawyers and interpreters.

They alleged that the Government had not produced the video recordings made by the infrared security cameras and movement sensors installed at the Melilla fence; those images, in the applicants\u2019 submission, were clearer than the ones which they had themselves produced (see paragraph 14 above), and which had been taken by third parties in spite of the threats issued by the Guardia Civil officials in an attempt to prevent them from filming. The impossibility of providing additional evidence of their identity was the result of the Spanish Government\u2019s failure to follow the procedures for identification and assessment of individual circumstances required by Article 4 of Protocol No. 4.

In the Court\u2019s view, the Government cannot take shelter behind the absence of identification given that they are themselves responsible for it.

The intervener further noted that the collective nature of the expulsion was determined more by the absence of an objective and reasonable examination of each individual case, or the existence of an examination that was unpredictable, unjust, inappropriate and in breach of the rule of law, than by the number of aliens expelled. Persons were to be classified as aliens if they did not possess the nationality of the State concerned, irrespective of whether or not they had refugee status. The prohibition on collective expulsions was also distinguishable from the principle of non-refoulement in that it formed part of the right to a fair trial. States were required to ensure that the victims of collective expulsion had the right to an effective remedy enabling them to challenge the measure in question and capable of preventing the taking of measures contrary to international human rights law and, where applicable, of affording redress for the violation, putting an end to its effects, erasing its consequences and compensating the individuals concerned. In order to be effective, the remedy against a collective expulsion measure had to have automatic suspensive effect.",

Accordingly, in the CEAR\u2019s view, there was no justification for applying the special rules for Ceuta and Melilla laid down by the tenth additional provision of the LOEX (see paragraph 19 above). The special rules allowed the administrative authorities to return migrants in the absence of any procedure, in a manner wholly incompatible with the principle of legal certainty. It deprived the aliens who were returned of any opportunity to plead their case in a Spanish court and afforded them no procedural guarantees and no legal or linguistic assistance. Furthermore, the mere fact of including a reference to international human rights rules in paragraph 2 of the tenth additional provision (see paragraph 19 above) did not in itself equate to actual respect for human rights. That reference could not therefore legitimise an illegal act which did not provide for any administrative procedure or guarantees.",

The Court notes that in the present case the removal measures were carried out in the absence of any prior administrative or judicial decision. At no point were the applicants made subject to any procedure. The issue whether there were sufficient guarantees demonstrating that the personal circumstances of those concerned had been genuinely and individually taken into account does not even arise in the present case, in the absence of any examination of the individual situation of the applicants, who were not subjected to any identification procedure by the Spanish authorities.

For instance, it found that no such risk of harm existed where the person concerned argued that his expulsion would interfere with his right to respect for his private and family life (see De Souza Ribeiro v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 22689/07, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2012), despite finding a violation of Article 13 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 8 on other grounds. In its judgment in Khlaifia and Others (cited above) the Court held that, where an applicant alleged that the procedure followed in ordering his or her expulsion had been \u201ccollective\u201d in nature, without claiming at the same time that it had exposed him or her to a risk of irreversible harm in the form of a violation of Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention, the Convention did not impose an absolute obligation on a State to guarantee an automatically suspensive remedy, but merely required that the person concerned should have an effective possibility of challenging the expulsion decision by having a sufficiently thorough examination of his or her complaints carried out by an independent and impartial domestic forum (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7 279). The Court therefore concluded in Khlaifia and Others that the lack of suspensive effect of a remedy against a removal decision did not in itself constitute a violation of Article 13 of the Convention where, as in that case, the applicant did not allege that there was a real risk of a violation of the rights guaranteed by Articles 2 or 3 in the destination country.",

I voted in favour of finding a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention, but I believe that the finding of a violation is sufficient by way of non-pecuniary damage. It is clear from the facts of the case that the applicants\u2019 situation was not an urgent one resulting from persecution or an immediate threat to their lives, integrity or dignity. Moreover, they had crossed the border illegally and in a violent manner. The authorities, for their part, examined the individual situation of both applicants when they crossed the border again, as required by the Convention. Consequently, even as regards its substance, the violation cannot be considered a serious one.",

I have just one concern as regards this case and numerous other similar cases examined by the Court, namely the fact that the Court, in a situation of unlawful conduct or even violence, maintains (albeit not in all cases) the high standards it requires of the authorities. I can imagine how shocked the Spanish border guards must have been by this invasion, during which the applicants, together with numerous other migrants, launched an assault on the border. We think that State agents should remain calm and impartial in all circumstances because they are trained to deal with any \u201cstandard\u201d situation. But they are people like you and I who have emotions; they also deserve our respect, and we should take that into consideration. We should therefore ask ourselves who was in the more vulnerable position in the present case.",
