It was for that reason that he had not complained about the risk of ill-treatment before the Town Court. He had, however, brought his fears of illtreatment in Uzbekistan to the attention of the authorities both in his appeal against the administrative removal order and in the refugee status proceedings. He had relied on reports by UN agencies and respected international NGOs, and also on the Court\u2019s case-law, which clearly demonstrated that individuals who, like him, were charged with membership of an extremist organisation or the attempted overthrow of the government on account of their membership of unregistered religious organisations, were at an increased risk of illtreatment.",

In considering his appeal, however, the court rejected the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the risk of ill-treatment for two reasons: firstly, because he had not applied for refugee status immediately after his arrival in Russia, and secondly because his allegations were unsubstantiated (see\u00a0paragraph 16 above).",

The conduct of the person concerned, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be taken into account, with the consequence that the protection afforded by Article\u00a03 of the Convention is broader than that provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see Yakubov, cited above, \u00a7 74, with further references). The Court notes that in the present case the applicant arrived in Russia in 2010, at which time no charges were pending against him, and applied for refugee status shortly after he had learned about such charges. Moreover, the domestic authorities\u2019 findings as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to apply for refugee status in due time did not, as such, negate his allegations under Article 3 of the Convention.",

Any such allegation always concerns an eventuality, something which may or may not occur in the future. Consequently, such allegations cannot be proven in the same way as past events. The applicant must only be required to show, with reference to specific facts relevant to him and to the class of people he belongs to, that there is a high likelihood that he would be ill-treated (see Azimov v. Russia, no. 67474/11, \u00a7 128, 18 April 2013). Detailed submissions to that effect were made by the applicant in the present case. In particular, he relied on international reports and the Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 15 above). The Court is struck by the summary reasoning put forward by the domestic courts when rejecting the applicant\u2019s arguments and their refusal to take into account evidence originating from reliable sources, such as international reports and the Court\u2019s case-law. In such circumstances, the Court is not convinced that the issue of the risk of ill-treatment was subjected to rigorous scrutiny in the domestic proceedings.",
