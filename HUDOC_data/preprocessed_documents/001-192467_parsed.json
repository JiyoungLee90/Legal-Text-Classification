The court referred to the caselaw of the Court that Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention could not be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applied could vary according to the nature of the decision. Moreover, it was necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant could bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. This was why the question of whether a court had failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article\u00a06 of the Convention, could only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case. The Supreme Administrative Court relied on the following authorities: Hiro\u00a0Balani v. Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 27, Series A no.\u00a0303B; Ruiz\u00a0Torija v.\u00a0Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 29, Series A no.\u00a0303A; and Suominen v. Finland, no. 37801/97, \u00a7 34, 1\u00a0July 2003, Series A no. 303A. It held that the firstinstance decision had been adequately reasoned. It was established in domestic caselaw that the court could refer the issue to the competent judicial institution of the European Union (see paragraph\u00a018 below). However, the Supreme Administrative Court stated that the request of a party to the proceedings to refer a certain question to the judicial institution of the European Union was not obligatory if the application of European Union law was so obvious that no doubts could arise (bylos \u0161alies pra\u0161ymas teismui n\u0117ra privalomas ir jei Europos S\u0105jungos teis\u0117s taikymas yra toks akivaizdus, kad d\u0117l pateikto klausimo sprendimo negali kilti joki\u0173 pagr\u012fst\u0173 abejoni\u0173, galutin\u0117s instancijos nacionalinis teismas neprivalo kreiptis \u012f Europos S\u0105jungos Teisingumo Teism\u0105 su prejudiciniu klausimu). Also, the mere fact that a party to the proceedings did not agree with the interpretation of the law provided by the firstinstance court did not mean that the substance of the European Union law was not clear and that there was a necessity to refer the question to the CJEU (Pasteb\u0117tina, kad vien faktin\u0117 aplinkyb\u0117, jog gin\u010do \u0161alis nesutinka su pirmosios instancijos teismo pateiktu teis\u0117s ai\u0161kinimu, savaime nerei\u0161kia, jog n\u0117ra ai\u0161kus Europos S\u0105jungos teis\u0117s turinys, ir, atitinkamai, kad yra pagrindas kreiptis \u012f ESTT prejudicinio sprendimo). The Supreme Administrative Court also held that the application of European Union law was clear enough in the present case and that there was no need to refer a question to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling (\u0160io gin\u010do apimtyje teismui nekyla neai\u0161kum\u0173 d\u0117l Bendrijos muitin\u0117s kodekso 29-31 straipsni\u0173 taikymo, tod\u0117l parei\u0161k\u0117jo pra\u0161ymas kreiptis \u012f Europos S\u0105jungos Teisingumo Teism\u0105 su prejudiciniu klausimu netenkintinas). It quoted another of its cases regarding the interpretation of certain provisions of a directive regulating markets in financial instruments, where it held that the applicant company in that case had failed to indicate specific uncertainties as to the interpretation of that directive and had not indicated why the referral to the CJEU was necessary (case no. A858-48/2011 of 14\u00a0April 2011).",

It reiterates that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, the right to have a case referred by a domestic court to another national court or to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. The Court has previously observed that this matter is, however, not unconnected to Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, since a domestic court\u2019s refusal to grant a referral may, in certain circumstances, infringe the fairness of proceedings where the refusal proves to have been arbitrary.
