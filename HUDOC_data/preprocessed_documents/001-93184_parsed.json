Since the phrases \u201cfor the needs of society and the State\u201d and \u201conly in exceptional cases\u201d were concepts requiring assessment and concerned a fundamental constitutional right, the Constitution stipulated that expropriation of property on such grounds could be carried out only on the basis of a law, thereby creating necessary legislative safeguards. The phrase \u201con the basis of a law\u201d implied not a normative legal act which regulated the expropriation procedure in general, but a law pursuant to which the property in question was to be expropriated. Thus, a person\u2019s property could be expropriated and \u2013 in the absence of his consent \u2013 his ownership could be terminated by the State only through the adoption of a law in respect of the concrete immovable property, which would substantiate the exceptional importance and significance of the expropriation and which would indicate the needs of society and the State to be satisfied by the expropriation. The law would also oblige the Government to fix the amount of compensation, taking market prices into account, on the basis of a financial-economic assessment, the results of the negotiation between the Government and the owner of the property subject to expropriation, and upon the owner\u2019s written consent. The Government was not entitled to establish a procedure for expropriation of property for the needs of society and the State that would authorise it to expropriate immovable property.",

The termination of ownership of private persons in respect of houses or other constructions was therefore the result of the State taking land which belonged to it. In the present case, the first applicant did not own land but only a flat in the building situated on a plot of land which had to be taken for the needs of society and the State. Thus, her flat could not be considered as an object of expropriation for those needs and the compensation paid to her was to be viewed as damage awarded as a result of expropriation of the plot of land.

It notes that the first applicant was deprived of her property on the basis of an application lodged with the courts by a private company acting on behalf of the State for the purpose of implementation of Government Decree no. 1151-N. Hence, her ownership in respect of her flat was terminated for no other purpose than implementing the Government policy of carrying out construction projects in the centre of . Furthermore, the domestic courts explicitly stated in their judgments that the first applicant\u2019s ownership was being terminated because the land on which her property was situated was to be taken for State needs. Here the Court does not share the Government\u2019s interpretation, according to which only the land but not the property situated on it should be considered as an object of expropriation. Moreover, it is not clear on what grounds the Government make such an assertion given that in the instant case the plot of land in question was public property and the only private property which was being taken by the State was that owned by the first applicant.

When interpreting this phrase in its decision of 27\u00a0February\u00a01998 the Constitutional Court, whose decisions had binding effect, pointed out, in particular, that private property could be expropriated for public needs only through the adoption of a law in respect of the concrete property. Moreover, the word \u201claw\u201d (\u0585\u0580\u0565\u0576\u0584), as used by the Constitutional Court, denoted not just any legal act but a statute adopted by the parliament, thereby reserving the question of decision-making on specific cases of expropriation for public needs to the legislature. This interpretation was further reinforced by the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding that the Government, that is the executive branch, was not authorised to decide on the expropriation of private property for public needs (see paragraph 33 above).",
