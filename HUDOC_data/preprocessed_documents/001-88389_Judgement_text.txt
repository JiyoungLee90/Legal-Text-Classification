The case originated in an application (no. 28785/04) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Ms Lidiya Nikolayevna Glukhova and Ms Tamara Nikolayevna Bragina (“the applicants”), on 24 July 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, the former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 22 June 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants were born in 1930 and 1932 respectively and live in Voronezh, a town in the Voronezh Region.
The applicants are pensioners. They sued the local welfare authority for underpaid cost-of-living adjustment of their pensions. On 1 December 2000 the Kominternovskiy District Court of Voronezh gave two judgments and awarded the first applicant 1,013.68 Russian roubles (RUB) and the second applicant RUB 906.66. These judgments became binding on 12 December 2000 and were enforced on 27 November 2006.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
