In view of the well-established criteria in length-of-proceedings cases and the Court\u2019s findings regarding the applicant\u2019s diligent behaviour and the complexity of the case (see paragraphs 35-37 of the original judgment), the Court sees no reason to depart from its conclusion that the domestic courts were responsible for the protracted length of the proceedings. In this connection it notes that after the partial decision, the proceedings before the first-instance court concerning the payment of work-related benefits laid dormant for nearly two years and five months (see paragraphs 10 and 15 of the original judgment). During this time, the first-instance court took no action as regards the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim. That delay affected the overall length of the proceedings, which, having regard to what was at stake for the applicant and the special diligence required in employment-related disputes (see Ziberi v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 27866/02, \u00a7 47, 5 July 2007), cannot be regarded as reasonable. In view of the above, the Court considers that the length of the impugned proceedings, as revised, was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
