The case originated in an application (no. 36686/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehmet Koç (“the applicant”), on 27 July 2007. The applicant was represented by Ms F. Danış, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 26 February 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3). On 21 October 2008 the President of the Second Section refused to include in the case file the applicant’s just satisfaction claims, which were filed outside the time-limit (Rule 38 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Diyarbakır. On 27 April 1999 he was arrested. On 24 May 1999 the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment, charging him under Article 125 of the former Criminal Code. On 13 December 2002 the Diyarbakır State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged. On 7 October 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed that decision. Following the abolition of the State Security Courts in 2004, the  took over the case and on 19 April 2007 convicted the applicant. The applicant appealed. On 12 December 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment.
