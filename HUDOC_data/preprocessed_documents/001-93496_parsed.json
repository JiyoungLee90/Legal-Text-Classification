Russia, no. 28488/04, \u00a7 18, 18 September 2008; see also Sirotin v. Russia (dec.), no. 38712/03, 14\u00a0September 2006). Furthermore the applicants' claims for future loss inevitably rely on highly speculative assumptions that veil them in a great deal of uncertainty (Parolov v. , no. 44543/04, \u00a7 45, 14 June 2007). Given the many imponderables in evolving political and economic conditions that could affect future pension entitlements and calculations it would be a largely hypothetical exercise to attempt to predict in the long term the amounts of pension which would have been paid, if any, if the final judgments had not been quashed. The Court can only therefore award the sums which should have been paid until the final rejection of the applicants' claims made after the quashing by way of supervisory review (Nekhoroshev v. Russia, no.\u00a045017/04, \u00a7 35, 10 April 2008). Consequently, no pecuniary awards can be made for the periods after these decisions were taken.",
