As regards the first condition, namely that the expropriation must be carried out \u201csubject to the conditions provided for by law\u201d, the Chamber observed, like the Latvian courts, that the ordinary expropriation procedure in Latvia at the material time was governed by a general law, but that a special law enacted in 1997, providing for a derogation from the ordinary procedure, had been applied in the applicants\u2019 case. Whilst recognising that, before the enactment of the special law, the applicants could have expected that any expropriation would be carried out in the conditions provided for in the general law, the Chamber was of the view that this fact in itself was not sufficient to call into question the lawfulness of the special provisions that were applicable to them. Accepting the Government\u2019s argument that the impugned expropriation had been part of the denationalisation process following Latvia\u2019s restoration of independence, the Chamber accepted that, in this type of situation, a special law could lay down specific conditions for one or more individuals without infringing the requirement of lawfulness, and that the legislature should be afforded particularly broad discretion, in particular to rectify, on grounds of fairness and social justice, any loopholes or injustices created by the denationalisation. The Chamber did not find anything unreasonable or manifestly in breach of the fundamental objectives of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the special Law of 30 October 1997.",

However, it analysed this disproportion in the light of a certain number of considerations, noting firstly that the very significant increase in the value of the properties concerned reflected the development of the port facilities and the complete evolution of the land\u2019s strategic importance between 1940 and 1990, these being objective factors to which the applicants had not contributed in any way; secondly, that the applicants had acquired the properties free of charge and had possessed them for only three years without investing in them or paying taxes in respect of the land; thirdly, that the applicants had benefited from a \u201cwindfall\u201d, receiving rent arrears of about EUR 85,000 and about EUR 593,150 respectively; and fourthly and lastly, they had been afforded appropriate procedural guarantees. Taking into account these facts as a whole and the above-mentioned considerations relating to the need to rectify any injustices created by the denationalisation process, the Chamber accepted that, in the very specific circumstances of the case, the compensation received by the applicants had not been disproportionate.

They further recognised that they had themselves initially decided to indicate minimal values for the properties in question, but pointed out that cadastral values did not exist at that time and that, under the legislative provision then in force (see paragraph 64 above), the sole basis for the calculation of the registration tax was the sale price, which in this particular case could not be determined objectively. They explained that in those circumstances, which were outside their control, they had paid the minimum fee necessary for the registration of their title in the land register and that purely for the sake of form had they indicated the relevant sums in the contracts of donation. Alleging that they could not have known that in future the compensation due to them for the expropriation of their land might depend on the amount of the fee paid for the registration of their title, they argued that it would be unfair to use this against them.",

In this connection they referred to a judgment of the Administrative Division of the Supreme Court Senate in which it was stated that \u201cthe property reform is a single measure that is completed with the transfer of the real estate concerned to private ownership\u201d.

In support of this argument they pointed out that the law had not been enacted until December 1996, at a time when they had already owned their land for two years, that they alone fell within the scope of the new wording of the last paragraph of Article 2 and that they had effectively been the only ones to have been affected by that provision. In this connection they referred to the wording of section 19(5) of the Ports Act, as amended in 2002, which entitled owners of land situated on the territory of ports to compensation calculated on the basis of the current value of their land and not the 1940 value (see paragraph 48 above), and observed that this amendment had been made after the impugned expropriation, with the result that nobody else could have been subjected to the same treatment as themselves.

The Court notes that the law which superseded the General Expropriation Act of 1923 retained the mechanism that applied where the State and the owner could not reach a friendly settlement (see paragraph 52 above).",

Far from being specific to Latvia, the practice of expropriation by means of ad hominem laws (see, in particular, Ruiz-Mateos, cited above, together with, mutatis mutandis, Gorraiz Lizarraga, cited above, \u00a7 58) is part of a nineteenth-century liberal tradition with the aim of ensuring the protection of ownership against abuse by the executive by subjecting any expropriation to parliamentary approval on a case-by-case basis. Illustrations of this can be found in section 3 of the French Public Interest Expropriation Act of 3 May 1841, which obliged the legislature to record in a special legislative instrument the public interest of any major public works, and in the Belgian laws of 17 April 1835 and 27\u00a0May 1870, under which the public interest of major public works had in some cases to be established by Parliament in the form of a statute. In its judgment of 16 December 2005 the Latvian Constitutional Court emphasised that this feature of Latvian expropriation law was protective of the right of ownership (see paragraph 62 above). In any event, the Court reiterates that it is in the first place for the domestic courts to rule on the constitutionality of domestic law (see Jahn and Others, cited above, \u00a7 86). For its part, it finds that the general principles and objectives of the expropriation system set up by Latvian law do not, as such, raise any issue of \u201clawfulness\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

That Regulation, together with the Law of 30 October 1997 by which it was confirmed, was interpreted by the domestic courts as providing for a derogation from the General Expropriation Act of 1923, making it possible to disregard the usual expropriation procedure in the case of the applicants and to limit the amount of the compensation by reference to Article 2 of the Supreme Council\u2019s decision of 1992. Prior to the adoption of Regulation no. 273 and the enactment of the Law confirming it, the applicants could have expected that any expropriation of their property would be carried out in accordance with the 1923 General Expropriation Act. Admittedly, the special Law of 30\u00a0October 1997 was on a par with the 1923 Act in the legislative hierarchy and the applicants have never argued that, in Latvian constitutional law, Parliament cannot derogate from an ordinary law by a subsequent law of equal rank.

Whilst the Government have appeared to call into question before the Court the circumstances in which the applicants became the owners of the land at issue, the Court finds that the Latvian authorities never took legal action to challenge the validity of the 1994 contracts of donation, whereas they could have done so based on the relevant provisions of the Civil Code (see paragraph 59 above). On the contrary, they formally recognised the applicants\u2019 right of ownership by registering the land in their names and by paying them rent. In those circumstances the Court does not find any reason to question the conformity of the donations with the requirements of Latvian law or the validity of the applicants\u2019 right of ownership.",

It would therefore be incorrect, strictly speaking, to assert that the property in question was acquired \u201cfree of charge\u201d. In any event, a donation being definable as a transaction entered into with an animus donandi, the manner in which the applicants acquired their property cannot be held against them (see paragraph 115 above). Similarly, whilst it is true that the applicants possessed their land for only about three years, that fact does not affect the value of the property and does not by itself justify a significant reduction in compensation. Consequently, the Court concludes that the applicants\u2019 personal circumstances and conduct did not in themselves justify the award of such minimal sums.",

Even though the measure was not formally taken under the legislation on denationalisation or land and real-estate reform \u2013 which was removed from the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a result of the reservation made by Latvia (see Kozlova and Smirnova v.

However, it finds that by the time of their expropriation, all the disputed plots of land had already, with final effect, been denationalised and allotted to individuals. In this connection, the Court cannot equate individuals who had not yet recovered their property with those who were already in possession of a valid title deed (see, in this connection, Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-61).",

In those circumstances, even if the applicants had acquired formal title, they could not be sure that their legal position would be maintained (ibid., \u00a7 116 (a)). However, in the present case the laws were enacted by a democratically elected parliament and there was no reason why the applicants could not maintain their rights, except in the event of fraudulent enrichment to the detriment of the former owners, but, as the Court has already noted, neither the validity of the contracts of donation nor the good faith of the applicants has been called into question by the Latvian authorities. In addition, unlike that of the applicants in the Jahn and Others case, the status of Mr Visti\u0146\u0161 and Mr Perepjolkins as property owners was unquestionably sound and the claims deriving from the enjoyment of their possessions had been further strengthened by the Free Commercial Port of Riga Act, which had subjected their land to profitable servitudes (see paragraph 56 above).",

In the case of Jahn and Others a fairly short period of time (two years) had elapsed between German reunification and the enactment of the second Property Rights Amendment Act. Having regard to the huge task facing the German legislature when dealing with, among other things, all the complex issues relating to property rights raised by the transition to a democratic, market-economy regime, the Court acknowledged that it had intervened within a reasonable time to correct the \u2013 in its view, unjust \u2013 effects of the Modrow Law and that it could not be criticised for failing to realise the full effect of that Law on the very day on which German reunification had taken effect (ibid., \u00a7 116 (b)). In the present case, however, all the events at issue took place more than three years after the final re-entry into force of the democratic Constitution of 1922 and more than five years after the restoration of independence of Latvia, that is to say, well after the end of the period of historic upheaval (see, in this respect, \u017ddanoka v.  [GC], no.\u00a058278/00, \u00a7\u00a7 18-27, ECHR 2006IV). It follows that, whilst it was still open to the Latvian legislature, in 1997, to correct any errors that may have been committed during the land reform, it could nevertheless be expected to uphold the principle of legal certainty and to refrain from imposing excessive burdens on individuals.",

Likewise, the balancing of the relevant interests carried out by the , in examining the compatibility of that amending Law with the Basic Law, had not been arbitrary. Given the \u201cwindfall\u201d from which the applicants had benefited as a result of the Modrow Law, the fact that the relevant correction had been made without paying any compensation was not disproportionate. In particular, the second Property Rights Amendment Act did not benefit the State alone, but in some cases also provided for the redistribution of land to farmers (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0116\u00a0(c)). By contrast, the Court questions whether \u201csocial justice\u201d may be invoked in the present case, where the expropriation at issue was of benefit solely to the State, which did not redistribute any of the property to individuals.",

Whilst the Court recognises that the Government are entitled to invoke the State\u2019s budgetary difficulties, these do not, however, constitute an imperative capable of justifying the adoption of such exceptional measures. In principle, it is not for the Court to indicate to the Contracting Parties what concrete legislative or regulatory measures should be taken in order to comply with their obligations.

Furthermore, the authorities could have calculated the compensation on the basis of the cadastral value of the land at the date on which the applicants had actually lost their title instead of using the cadastral value from 1940 (see Guiso-Gallisay (just satisfaction) [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103).

No economic or political logic can justify a situation in which, by a combination of restitution and donation transactions, the State (i.e. the taxpayer) gives away a 1,500-euro plot in 1994 and is required to buy it back for 5 million only two years later.

In other words, the State may owe to them more than just a mathematically corrected amount of compensation. Additional and unexpected profit (even of a windfall nature) may be justified in those historical categories. However, the applicants have never had any historical claim to the land in question.
