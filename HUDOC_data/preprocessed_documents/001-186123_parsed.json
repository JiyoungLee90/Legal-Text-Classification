The applicant had purposefully undermined the plaintiff\u2019s right of personality by labelling abortion as aggravated murder, equating it to the crimes of the Holocaust and reproaching Dr F. specifically for his involvement. This was also true on the assumption that the statements constituted an expression of opinion and not a factual claim.

The allegation had further involved comparing abortions to the extermination of Jews under Nazi rule. This had constituted a serious attack on Dr F.\u2019s reputation and personality rights. The Court of Appeal also confirmed that the applicant had to assume responsibility for the content of the Austrian website. He had given the relevant content from his own website over to M.H. and had given his consent, by means of a link, for it to be posted on the Austrian website. Moreover, the award of monetary compensation was appropriate in the light of the severity of the interference with the general right of personality. The Regional Court had correctly taken into account, to the detriment of the applicant, that he had failed to observe the legally binding decision of the Karlsruhe Court of Appeal of 28\u00a0February 2007. The court further clarified that \u2013 for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be awarded \u2013 it was irrelevant whether Dr F. was Jewish and that his family had been persecuted under the Nazi regime.

In cases that concerned allegations of criminal conduct the Court also took into account that under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see, among other authorities, Worm v.\u00a0Austria, 29 August 1997, \u00a7 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997V, and Du Roy and Malaurie v.

The Court also takes note of the fact that the applicant argued before the Court that abortions could be considered aggravated murder within the meaning of Article 211 of the Criminal Code. However, it also observes that Article 218 of the Criminal Code clearly outlines the criminal liability of abortions that are not exempted from criminal liability under Article 218a of the Criminal Code and that there is no domestic case-law or other evidence in domestic law supporting the applicant\u2019s claim. In sum, the Court finds that there was not a sufficient factual basis for calling abortions as performed by Dr F. \u201caggravated murder\u201d. In that regard the Court also notes that these accusations were not only very serious, something reflected in the fact that a conviction for aggravated murder would carry a life sentence, but might also incite to hatred and aggression.",

However, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s statements in the present case exceeded the ones examined in the context of the case of Annen and that the applicant equated doctors who performed abortions with concentration camp commanders and even stated that \u201cEquating the Babycaust with the Holocaust would mean relativising today\u2019s abortion murders\u201d. In view of these statements the Court agrees with the findings of the domestic courts that the applicant had equated the medical activities of Dr F. to the utterly unjustifiable atrocities inflicted on Jews under the Nazi regime.",

In so far as damages are concerned, the Court observed that the domestic courts elaborated in detail why the violations of Dr F.\u2019s personality rights had been particularly serious and why they considered damages appropriate in the present case. While the Court accepts that this interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression was more intense than in cases where he was only ordered to desist from making a specific statement, it considers that, based on the national courts\u2019 reasoning, the amount awarded to Dr. F did not fall outside their margin of appreciation.",
