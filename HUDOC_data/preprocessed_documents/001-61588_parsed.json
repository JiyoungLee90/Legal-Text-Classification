The Deputy Chancellor of Justice found, in his decision of 30\u00a0October\u00a02000, that the length of the proceedings could not be regarded as excessive, taking into account the fact that the criminal investigation lasted about two years and a half, the prosecutor\u2019s decision whether to prosecute or not took about a year, the District Court\u2019s first judgment was issued in about one year, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to refer the case back to the District Court was made in a few months, the District Court\u2019s second judgment was issued in less than ten months, the Court of Appeal re-examined the District Court\u2019s judgment in about a year and three months, and the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal in about two months. Thus, the court proceedings, including five different court decisions, lasted less than four years all together. Even though the proceedings were lengthy, it had to be noted that the case was complex and that it had proceeded at all times without any unnecessary delay at any stage. He emphasised that it was in the interests of the applicant that the criminal investigation was also carried out in a profound and appropriate manner. As the applicant\u2019s application was still pending before the Strasbourg Court, the Deputy Chancellor of Justice found it unnecessary to take any measures in the case.",

The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint; however, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see, among other authorities, Kud\u0142a v.
