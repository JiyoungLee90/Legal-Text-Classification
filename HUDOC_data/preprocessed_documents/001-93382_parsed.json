The Court points out that indeed it is unable to establish with certainty whether the applicant lodged a formal complaint on 12 February 2001 as it does not have a copy of it at its disposal. Nevertheless, the applicant submitted a copy of her complaint of 21 February 2001 addressed to the military commander of the Urus-Martan District, the district prosecutor\u2019s office and the head of administration of the Urus-Martan District.

The Court does not deem it necessary to establish the exact date of the commencement of the investigation, since it is evident that the district prosecutor\u2019s office failed to respond to the applicant promptly once she had reported the crime to them. The investigators had been aware of Salman Abdulazizov\u2019s kidnapping for at the very least one month before they started taking measures to solve it.

Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries. The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities\u2019 reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities\u2019 conduct (see Orhan v.
