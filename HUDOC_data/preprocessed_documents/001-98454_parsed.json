Firstly, they submitted that the applicant's complaint had been lodged too late, as although the applicant had signed his application form, he had dated it 14\u00a0April without indicating the year. The stamp on the application form showed that the Court had received it on 26 May 2004. Therefore, there was no evidence that the applicant had complied with the six-month requirement, as the criminal proceedings against him had ended with the final judgment of 18 November 2003. As an alternative, the Government argued that the applicant's complaint was manifestly ill-founded. They stressed that the Court only has competence ratione temporis to examine the five-year period after 16 October 1998, when the Presidium quashed the initial conviction. In the Government's opinion, the duration of the proceedings was justified by objective reasons, such as the applicant's and his counsel's illness, the applicant's difficult family situation, the victims' and witnesses' failure to attend, and so on. The domestic authorities were not responsible for any stays in the proceedings, while the applicant twice successfully petitioned the trial court for a change in its composition. Furthermore, the case was sent back to the investigating authorities at the applicant's request.",

He further argued that his absences from court hearings had been rare and caused by his illness. In addition, he had been forced to ask for removal of the bench or presiding judge or for a reopening of the pre-trial investigation, as he had no other means to prevent violations of his procedural rights.

Having regard to the fact that the final judgment in his case was issued on 18 November 2003, the Court considers that he raised his complaint of excessive length of the criminal proceedings within the six-month time-limit established by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Arslan v.

The period in question ended on 18 November 2003 with the final judgment of the Supreme Court of the . In this respect, the Court observes that it only has competence ratione temporis to consider the second period, which commenced after the Convention had entered into force in respect of Russia on 5 May 1998 and which lasted a little over five years and one month before the investigating authorities and courts at two levels of jurisdiction.

Bearing in mind the prominent place which the right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal holds in a democratic society (see, inter alia, De Cubber v. Belgium, judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a030), the Court considers that the State should bear the responsibility for a delay incurred through a successful challenge of the trial bench by a party to the proceedings. If a court accepts a party's request for a change in the composition of the bench, it inevitably means that the fears of that party as to the impartiality and independence of the tribunal are justified (see Sidorenko v. Russia, no. 4459/03, \u00a7 32, 8 March 2007). The Court further reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide the cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v.  (No. 2), no. 72159/01 \u00a7 57, 4 March 2004). Therefore, the responsibility for an aggregated delay of approximately ten months caused by changes in the composition of the Ivolginskiy District Court and the transfer of the case to Sovetskiy District Court rests ultimately with the State (see Marchenko v. Russia, no.\u00a029510/04, \u00a7\u00a039, 5\u00a0October 2006).",

The inquiry was closed and reopened on several occasions because the investigating authorities had consistently failed to decide how to proceed with the case and what its outcome should be. While the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the investigation was stayed on a number of occasions because the applicant was ill, it nevertheless is mindful that the additional investigation was, in the first place, the result of the authorities' failure to comply with procedural requirements and to safeguard the applicant's defence rights during the initial pre-trial investigation. The Court therefore considers that the period from 21\u00a0February 2000, when the additional investigation was authorised, to 15\u00a0April 2003, when the case was returned to the trial court for adjudication, is attributable to the State.",
