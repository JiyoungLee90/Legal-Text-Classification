Moldova, cited above, and Lupacescu and Others v.\u00a0Moldova, nos. 3417/02, 5994/02, 28365/02, 5742/03, 8693/03, 31976/03, 13681/03 and 32759/03, 21 March 2006). It also found a breach of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 in Teteriny v. Russia, no. 11931/03, 30 June 2005, where the State failed to enforce a judgment awarding a social tenancy to the applicants. In the light of the similarity between those cases and the present case and of the Government's admission, the Court finds that the failure to enforce the judgment of 27 November 2001 constitutes a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",

It follows, among other things, that a judgment in which the Court finds a breach imposes on the respondent State, inter alia, to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects (see, by analogy, Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 249, ECHR 2000VIII).
