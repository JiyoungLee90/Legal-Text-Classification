They explained that after the entry into force on 29 December 2009 of amendments to the relevant legislation providing a remedy for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, a constitutional complaint could no longer be lodged in respect of Supreme Court decisions rendered in proceedings for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time. According to the Government, the Constitutional Court had already adopted that view in its decision no.\u00a0UIIIVs-3669/2006 of 2\u00a0March 2010, which was published in the Official Gazette on 19 March 2010. The applicant, who had been represented by an advocate, should have been aware of that. Consequently, the final decision, within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, for the purposes of calculating the six-month time limit in the applicant\u2019s case was not the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 12\u00a0December 2012 (see\u00a0paragraph 29 above) but the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 6 June 2011 (see paragraph 27 above).

Rather, as specified in the decision of 2 June 2011 (see paragraph 22 above), it also included (i) statutory default interest accrued on that amount from 11\u00a0March 2009, (ii) HRK\u00a019,495.90 for the costs of civil proceedings, plus statutory default interest accrued on that amount from 1 June 2006, and (iii) HRK\u00a02,606.25 for the costs of enforcement proceedings, plus interest accrued on that amount from 7\u00a0November 2008. In this connection the Court further notes that in the execution of that decision, on 21 July 2011 the Domestic Payments Agency transferred from the debtor company\u2019s account to the accounts of the applicant and his legal representative a total of HRK 38,306.87, that is to say some EUR 5,125.12 (see paragraph 23 above).

In that context the fact that the enforcement was completed, while indeed important, is nevertheless not of such crucial importance that the applicant\u2019s failure to inform the Court of it would constitute an abuse of the right of application. The present case therefore cannot be compared to the case of Kerechashvili v.
