In order to lodge a cassation appeal, however, the applicant would still have to meet the compulsory requirement of being represented by a professional lawyer in the proceedings before the Supreme Court (see paragraph 43 above).

It requires in addition, however, that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely, to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see\u00a0Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, \u00a7 63, Series A no. 244). Furthermore, the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified in cases where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest. That means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. , \u00a7 78, ECHR\u00a02000-III).",

It is true that none of the psychiatric opinions prepared in the applicant\u2019s case mentioned that the applicant posed a direct threat to the life or health of herself or third persons. The opinion of 8 May 2008 mentions only an indirect risk to the applicant\u2019s life resulting from her neglect of basic hygiene principles, and of her place of residence and nutrition (see paragraph 11 above). In the opinion dated 6 April 2009, prepared after the applicant\u2019s placement in the home, the psychiatrist found no need for the applicant to be admitted to and treated in hospital. Likewise, no direct danger to the applicant\u2019s own or a third person\u2019s health or life was found (see paragraph 25 above). However, it was established that she had neglected herself and her apartment and failed to observe the basic principles of hygiene and nutrition. It was also confirmed that she needed constant care to be able to function normally. In its decision of 19 June 2008 the District Court stressed the need to provide the applicant with permanent assistance lack of which posed a danger to her life. Having examined the circumstances of the case the District Court found that there were no members of family or third persons who could take care of the applicant on permanent basis. In particular, the applicant\u2019s daughter expressly refused to do it. Also the assistance by social care employees, by its nature provided on temporary basis only, had not been sufficient to secure the applicant\u2019s basic needs (see paragraph 11 above). The District Court concluded that the applicant\u2019s placement in a social care home was the only solution to assure her necessary care and assistance. Taking into consideration the applicant\u2019s state of health and all the circumstances addressed by the courts at the time of the applicant\u2019s placement in the social care home, the Court accepts that the domestic court\u2019s decision to confine the applicant in a social care home was properly justified by the severity of disorder.",

Although the applicant was under the supervision of a psychiatrist, the aim of such supervision was not to provide an assessment at regular intervals of whether she still needed to be kept in the social care home for the purposes of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (e). Indeed, no provision was made for such an assessment under the relevant legislation (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0158, X v. Finland, no. 34806/04, \u00a7\u00a0169, ECHR\u00a02012, and paragraph 40 above and compare Raudevs v. Latvia, no.\u00a024086/03, \u00a7\u00a086, 17 December 2013). The domestic provisions do not provide for a periodic compulsory examination for the purpose of assessing whether an applicant needs to remain in a social care home. The applicant has been kept in confinement for over six years now and it has not been shown that the authorities undertake any steps which would allow assessment whether her continuous confinement in the social care home is indeed indispensable.",
