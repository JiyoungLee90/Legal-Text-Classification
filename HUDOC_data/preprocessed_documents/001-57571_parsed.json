Taking as its basis the fact that Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) was directly applicable in , the Federal Department of Justice and Police took the initiative of exchanging views with the Federal Court. By an exchange of (unpublished) letters dated 27 December 1976, 28 January 1977, 29 April 1977 and 9 May 1977, the two institutions agreed to interpret sections 22 to 25 of the Act, in particular the second paragraph of section 25, in such a way as to establish the general and exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court (1) to rule on any objection lodged against arrest with a view to extradition (from then on this legal remedy was expressly mentioned on the back of the arrest warrant, receipt of which had to be acknowledged in writing by the person concerned), and (2) to rule on any request for provisional release, even when, by reason of the absence of any objection to the request for extradition, the Federal Court had no jurisdiction over the merits of the matter.",

In cases where review of the lawfulness of detention covers the merits of the disputed measure - as where confinement of a mentally ill person is involved (Winterwerp judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, p. 24, para. 60) - it may be necessary to require that an applicant be heard in person. The situation is different, however, in the case of extradition, where detention is the rule, as the requested State may be required under international law to hand over the person being proceeded against to the requesting State - without any further requirements having to be satisfied. Furthermore, detention pending extradition, contrary to the type of detention at issue in the Winterwerp case, is an interim measure determined merely by the existence of an administrative extradition procedure. In the instant case, moreover, the applicant was not challenging the lawfulness of his detention nor that of the extradition procedure (which he did in the extradition proceedings themselves); he was merely seeking to be provisionally released, as was permitted on certain conditions by the law in force in Switzerland at the time (section 25 of the Federal Act of 22 January 1892 on Extradition to Foreign States). It could even be disputed that these were proceedings within the meaning of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4). However that may be, the authority empowered to grant provisional release could only do so if there were weighty considerations in favour of such a step, and even then it was not bound to do so. There accordingly did not exist any individual right to (provisional) release.",
