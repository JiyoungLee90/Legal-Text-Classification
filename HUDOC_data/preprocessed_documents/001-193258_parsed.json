One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brum\u0103rescu v.

Under Article 362 of the same Code, as interpreted by the Plenary Supreme Court of Justice (see paragraph\u00a013 above), the time-limit for lodging an appeal is thirty days from the date of the delivery of the operative part of the judgment, irrespective of whether the parties were present or not at that delivery. Article 369 (1) (b) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that where a party has failed to observe the time-limit for lodging an appeal and does not request its extension, the appellate court must strike the appeal out of its list of cases.",

The above calculation was not challenged by the Inspectorate or disputed by the Supreme Court of Justice and appears to be in line with the explanatory judgment of the Plenary Supreme Court of Justice (see paragraph 13 above).
