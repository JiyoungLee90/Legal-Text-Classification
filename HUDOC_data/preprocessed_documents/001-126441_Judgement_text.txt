The case originated in an application (no. 14697/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Beşerler Yapı San. ve Tic. A.Ş. (“the applicant”), on 23 March 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Erol, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 27 August 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant is a construction company, a legal entity, based in Istanbul.
On 7 May 1999 a traffic insurance company lodged a case with the Fatih Civil Court of First Instance against the applicant company, claiming compensation on account of a traffic accident.
On 16 July 2002 the court granted the plaintiff’s claim and subsequently the applicant company appealed that decision.
On 4 December 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the court on the grounds that the applicant company’s right to examine witnesses against it was breached.
On 29 June 2004 the Fatih Civil Court of First Instance, to which the case had been remitted, after having examined the witnesses once again accepted the plaintiff’s request.
On 13 March 2006 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision.
On 21 September 2006 the Court of Cassation dismissed a request by the applicant company for rectification of the judgment.
On 2 November 2006 the decision of the Court of Cassation was notified to the applicant company.
