The Government expressed doubts as to whether Mr Akhmadov's death had been ascertained. They cited the absence of a forensic report and the relatives' refusal to permit the exhumation of the body. However, the Court notes that in June\u00a02002 the Argun Prosecutor's Office issued a note confirming that the body had been identified by the relatives as that of Shamil Akhmadov. The note concluded that his death had been violent in view of the extensive injuries, including bullet holes in the skull bones, and put the time of death at a point in March 2001, owing to the condition of the remains. In August\u00a02002 the Argun civil registration office issued a death certificate for Shamil Akhmadov and indicated the date of death as being 22 March 2001. On the basis of these documents the Court accepts that, for the purposes of the domestic law, Shamil Akhmadov was killed in March 2001 and that his body was discovered in late April 2002.",

The Court further remarks that the provisions of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the Government refer, do not preclude disclosure of the documents from a pending investigation file, but rather set out a procedure for and limits to such disclosure. The Government failed to specify the nature of the documents and the grounds on which they could not be disclosed (see, for similar conclusions, Mikheyev v. Russia, no.\u00a077617/01, \u00a7\u00a0104, 26 January 2006). The Court also notes that in a number of comparable cases that have been reviewed by or are pending before the Court, similar requests have been made to the Russian Government and the documents from the investigation files submitted without reference to Article 161 (see, for example, Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia cited above, \u00a7\u00a046; and Magomadov and Magomadov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a058752/00, 24 November 2005).

A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention. In a case where the application raises issues of the effectiveness of the investigation, the documents of the criminal investigation are fundamental to the establishment of facts and their absence may prejudice the Court's proper examination of the complaint both at the admissibility stage and at the merits stage (see Tanr\u0131kulu v.\u00a0Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070).",
