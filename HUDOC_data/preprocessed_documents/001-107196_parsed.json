Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Treatment has been held by the Court to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them. In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question of whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of violation of Article 3 (see Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 119-20, ECHR 2000-IV).",

The applicant\u2019s allegations of ill\u00adtreatment in this connection were examined and rejected by the domestic authorities in the course of the criminal investigation into the events of 8 December 2001 which ended with the decision of 11 June 2004 (see paragraph 43). That decision was upheld by the domestic courts at two judicial instances on 1\u00a0November 2004 and 27 January 2005 respectively (see paragraphs 44 and\u00a045). The Court notes, however, that the authorities at the domestic level largely ignored the medical data contained in that report and, apart from the decision of 3 April 2003 which was later quashed (see paragraph 36), made no serious attempt to explain the origin of this injury and to establish in detail the relevant factual circumstances (see paragraphs 26-32, 34, 36, 38, 40 and 43). Furthermore, it is clear that there is nothing in the case file or the parties\u2019 submissions suggesting that the injury described in the report had been inflicted either before the applicant\u2019s arrest on 8 December 2001 or in the period following her release on the next day. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that no satisfactory and convincing explanation for the origin of the applicant\u2019s injuries has been obtained or advanced either at the domestic level, or in the proceedings before this Court. Without prejudice to the question of the personal criminal liability of the alleged perpetrators of the acts in question, the Court concludes therefore that the Government failed to discharge its burden and that it was not satisfactorily established that the applicant\u2019s account of events had been inaccurate or otherwise erroneous.",

The applicant\u2019s allegations, which were detailed and consistent throughout the domestic proceedings and before this Court, were, at least to some extent, corroborated by a medical certificate recording an injury. The domestic authorities themselves repeatedly admitted having serious doubts concerning the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention and reacted to the applicant\u2019s complaint by instituting criminal proceedings in this connection (see paragraphs 23, 24 and 38). They were therefore under an obligation to conduct an effective investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations, both concerning the ill-treatment during her arrest and also in so far as she complained of pain and suffering as a result of being detained in a cell with an injury to the tail bone (see Fedotov v. Russia, no. 5140/02, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 25 October 2005), satisfying the above requirements of Article 3 of the Convention.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the issue is consequently not so much whether there was an investigation, since the parties did not dispute that there was one, but whether it was conducted diligently, whether the authorities were determined to identify and prosecute those responsible and, accordingly, whether the investigation was \u201ceffective\u201d.",

The Court finds that this shortcoming fundamentally incapacitated the investigation, having switched its focus from the use of allegedly excessive force through the specific actions of officers Sh. and M. to the general guidance of the operation by S.

As acknowledged by the investigating authority itself (see paragraphs 37 and 40), the necessary actions were not carried out even more than two years later and in fact they were not conducted at the domestic level at all (see paragraph 62). The Court, however, is mindful of the important role which investigative interviews play in obtaining accurate and reliable information from suspects, witnesses and victims and, ultimately, the discovery of the truth about the matter under investigation. Observing the suspects\u2019, witnesses\u2019 and victims\u2019 demeanour during questioning and assessing the probative value of their testimony forms a substantial part of the investigative process.",

The investigator later mentioned the need to punish the applicant for a breach of public order (see paragraph 36) and finally in its last two decisions of 11 June and 1 November 2004 the authorities explained the arrest as a legitimate response to a provocation by the applicant (see paragraph 43) or as a reaction for her refusal to follow legitimate orders given by the policemen (see paragraph 44).

In addition, they admitted that the domestic authorities had made no records in respect of the applicant\u2019s release. The Court reiterates that the absence of a record of arrest and detention with an indication of a number of details such as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Menesheva v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 87). The Court has previously considered that the loss of records is capable of depriving an applicant of an opportunity to usefully challenge his arrest and detention (see Boris Popov v. , no. 23284/04, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 28\u00a0October 2010). This is precisely what happened in the present case, where the destruction of the relevant records demonstrably impeded the pending criminal investigation at the domestic level, such loss being specifically mentioned and deplored by the investigative authorities (see paragraph 43), which repeatedly questioned the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention (see paragraphs 24 and 38). The storage of the relevant records for at least the duration of the relevant investigation was thus incumbent on the national authorities and it follows that the unavailability of the record of the applicant\u2019s arrest is imputable to the national authorities.",

The applicant was neither brought before a judge after her arrest (see paragraphs 16-22), nor found liable by a police authority (see paragraph 16), nor was there any need to bring the applicant to the police station to draw up a record, as the relevant record could have easily been produced on the spot (see paragraph 47). In addition, the Government were unable to produce any evidence that the police brought proper administrative proceedings against the applicant in connection with the events of 8 December 2001. Against this background, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s account of the reasons underlying the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention and finds that the applicant\u2019s arrest was not \u201ceffected for the purpose of bringing [her] before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence\u201d and could not be \u201creasonably considered necessary to prevent [her] committing an offence or fleeing after having done so\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (c).",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they comply with their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 95, Reports 1996-VI).",
