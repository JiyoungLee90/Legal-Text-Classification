Serbia, no. 44095/06, \u00a7 26, 22 October 2013). It further observes that the applicant lodged applications for the enforcement of final court decisions of 10 April 2001 and 3 July 2003 on 25 March 2003 and 29 September 2004 respectively (see paragraphs 7 and 17 above) The domestic court allowed the applications on 25 March 2003 and 30 September 2004 respectively (see paragraphs 8 and 18 above).
