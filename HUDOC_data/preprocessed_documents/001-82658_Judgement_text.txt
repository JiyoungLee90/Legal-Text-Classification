The case originated in two applications (nos. 35765/05 and 37847/05) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Mr Mikhail Ivanovich Derevyanko of Gorlivka born in 1955 and Mr Leontiy Adamovich Beletskiy of Kirovske born in 1959 (“the applicants”), on 3 September and 5 October 2005 respectively.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
The applicants complained about the unreasonable delay in enforcement of the final judgments given in their favour.
On 30 May 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
On 23 August 2002 the  (Кіровський міський суд Донецької області) awarded the second applicant UAH 25,579.40 in disability benefits from his former employer, the State OJSC Mine “Svitanok” (ДВАТ „Шахта „Світанок” ДП ДХК „Жовтеньвугілля”).
On 1 March 2004 the Central District Court of Gorlivka (Центрально-міський суд м. Горлівка) awarded the first applicant UAH 45,678.80 in disability benefits from the Donetsk Regional Board of Mine Liquidation. On 1 June 2004 the court rectified the judgment by stating that the proper name of the debtor was the State Company “Donvuglerestrukturyzatsiya” (ДП „Донвуглереструктуризація”).
The judgments given in the applicants' favour were not appealed against, became final, and enforcement proceedings were instituted to collect the debts.
The judgments have not been enforced in full to the present day on account of the debtor-companies' lack of funds and statutory restrictions on selling their assets.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, § 17-22, 26 April 2005).
