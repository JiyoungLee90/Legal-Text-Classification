Since the applicant had not been given the opportunity to put questions to A., in a manner described in more detail in the Criminal Investigations Act, the video recording of A.'s interview could not, in principle, be played back before the court and used in evidence. The court found, however, that testimony about A.'s account of the alleged events could be received from his mother. The statement concerning A.'s interview, and testimony by Dr S. on that matter, were also permissible. The court then noted the applicant's submissions that, under those circumstances, he would invoke the video recording as evidence. Having regard to the fact that he had already done so in the District Court, it found that the recording could also be treated as evidence in the Court of Appeal.

The court noted, at the outset, that such evidence was not prohibited by the domestic law and could be taken into account according to the principle of free assessment of evidence. In this case, the complainant child had initially been examined by a psychologist, who had interviewed her on two occasions. These interviews had given rise to a suspicion of sexual abuse and led to a criminal complaint. At the request of the police, the child had been interviewed again, now as a part of the pre-trial investigation. Unlike the previous interviews, the third interview had been recorded on video-tape, but the suspect was not given an opportunity to put questions to the child. In that third interview, the child had retracted her previous statements. Charges were subsequently brought and the defendant was convicted of sexual abuse. The conviction was upheld on appeal. According to the appellate court the main evidence against the defendant had not been the video-taped interview but the child's account as given to the psychologist. That court found it very unlikely that hearing the child again would shed more light on the matter, as the child had retracted her initial account.",

The recording also allowed them to observe the manner in which the interview was conducted and to assess for themselves, at least to some degree, the credibility of A.'s account. It was open to the applicant to contest and comment on the video-taped evidence before the trial courts. While the Court acknowledges the significance of such a recording as evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Bocos-Cuesta v. the , no.\u00a054789/00, \u00a7\u00a071, 10\u00a0November 2005; W.S. v.

Finland, \u00a7\u00a041, and D. v. Finland, \u00a7 50, both cited above).

At the time of the trial in those cases, the current law obliging the authorities to provide the defendant with an opportunity to put questions to the witness during the pre-trial investigation in the event that his or her video-taped testimony was to be used in evidence in subsequent court proceedings, was not yet in force. Thus, in the case at hand, the lack of such an opportunity is further highlighted by the non-compliance with the provisions of the domestic law, even though the trial courts, the Court of Appeal in particular, gave detailed reasons for their derogation from those procedural rules.",

(at that time a five-year-old boy) contacted the police on account of a suspicion that her child had been sexually abused. One month later A. was interviewed at the children's hospital. The interview was recorded on video-tape and was conducted by a psychologist. The investigating police officer, the head psychologist and Dr S., a specialist in child psychiatry, followed the interview from behind a mirrored wall. The applicant, not being officially suspected of sexual abuse at that stage, was not present. That was the only statement taken from A., since Dr S. noted that issues regarding the suspected abuse had seriously disturbed A.'s psychological balance, causing him confusion, insecurity and anxiety. He recommended that A. should not be interviewed again. After being indicted, the applicant in his communication to the District Court agreed that, in the light of Dr S.'s statement, A. should not be heard again. At this point it could be said (as the Chamber did) that the applicant had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to A. during the pre-trial investigation (as required by domestic law) and because of that there had been a violation of his procedural rights. However, in my opinion the applicant was at fault. Instead of requesting the trial court to exclude A.'s account in view of the procedural error, he actually insisted on submitting the video recording as evidence on his behalf. In my view, it was at that particular moment that the applicant waived his right to examine the child as a witness by simply consenting to the trial court's use in evidence of his video-taped account. In addition, during the District Court's first hearing and after a discussion concerning the use of the recording, the applicant once again consented to its being viewed, with the result that the District Court proceeded with the hearing (\u00a7\u00a713-14 of the judgment).",

In its judgment, the majority of the Chamber accepted the applicant's arguments, confirming in addition that A.'s account, recorded on video-tape, constituted the only direct evidence for the applicant's conviction (see \u00a7 74 of the judgment). This led the Chamber to the conclusion that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 taken together with Article\u00a06\u00a73\u00a0(d).",

It seems to me that the applicant, acquitted by the District Court but convicted by the Court of Appeal, wanted the  to decide on the outcome of domestic proceedings. For me, that is what the Chamber actually did by finding that A.'s account constituted the only direct evidence against the applicant and therefore his statement should not have been accepted since it was obtained and used in violation of the applicant's procedural rights. I think that it is not for the  to establish whether A.'s account did or did not constitute the only or decisive evidence against the applicant. Moreover, by establishing that it did constitute the only evidence against the applicant, the Chamber actually substituted its own assessment for that of the national courts, in defiance of the Court's case-law mantra that it cannot \u201cassume the role\u201d nor \u201ctake the place of those authorities\u201d. Generally, up to now, the  has deferred to national courts' assessment of \u201cthe credibility of witnesses and the relevance of evidence to the issues in the case\u201d. Paragraph 74 of the judgment, to my understanding, changes that principle.",

It is the well established case-law of the  that \u201cin the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the alleged victim. Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence\u201d (see Baegen v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1995, Series A no. 327-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 44, \u00a7 77). To my understanding, this means that there should be a balance between the victim's and the accused person's rights. In this case, \u201ccertain measures taken for the purpose of protecting the victim\u201d were the child's video-taped interview and the expert's opinion that the child should not be interviewed again, which opinion was accepted by the applicant. The real question is whether these measures \u201ccould be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence\u201d, or, put better, whether the correct balance was struck between the child's and the applicant's rights. The Chamber came to the conclusion that there was no balance, and that the applicant should have been invited to participate in the hearing of the child, to be given an opportunity to observe the child's interview and to have questions put to the child (see \u00a7 56 of the judgment). However, to my understanding, this kind of balance was not possible since at the moment when the child was interviewed the applicant was not suspected and there was no reason for him to be either present or given an opportunity to put questions to the child. The balance could have been achieved if the applicant, instead of insisting on submitting the video recording as evidence on his behalf and thereby declining or turning down an opportunity for the effective exercise of his rights, had requested the court to exclude A.'s account.",
