The authorities accordingly conducted a full autopsy on the victims\u2019 bodies to identify the exact cause of death, questioned the principal of their school as well as a couple of their friends, examined their telephone records and reviewed the CCTV footage of the location where their bodies were found.

While the Court has no reason to doubt the thoroughness of the review conducted by the authorities, it cannot but note that no special effort was made to identify the person who had called Aykut a few days after his disappearance, in rather peculiar circumstances. Furthermore, although the authorities questioned M.Y. \u2013 the person who had sent Aykut a message in Arabic prior to his death (see paragraph 16 above) \u2013 there is no information in the case file to suggest that they took any measures to verify the accuracy of his statement, in which he had denied ever having contacted Aykut.
