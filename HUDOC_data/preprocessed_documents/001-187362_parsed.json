However, such a situation is incompatible with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of one\u2019s possessions, which requires reimbursement of any legal fees incurred by the expropriated party. There are two reasons for this. The first, which has already been mentioned by the Court, is that the litigation originated in an expropriation, that is to say an act carried out by the State in the exercise of its public-authority functions and that the applicant bears no responsibility for the institution of the proceedings. The second is that the fees in question amount to 40% of the compensatory award for expropriation and that any failure to reimburse them would be tantamount to depriving the applicant of much of his compensation.",
