The evaluation had been carried out upon the instructions of the trial court. The experts concluded that there were \u201cno objective forensic medical data\u201d suggesting that the applicant had been subjected to electric shocks. In reply to a question put to them regarding any chronic diseases which might explain the symptoms manifested by the applicant, the experts noted that prior to 2004 he had not had any chronic diseases with neurological symptoms. They also observed that the applicant had not sought any medical assistance since 30 July 2004. The last question put to the experts was about what could have caused the area of pigmentation on the applicant\u2019s thigh (mentioned in report no. 18 of 28 January 2005 \u2013 see paragraph 37 above) and when it had appeared. The experts noted that the applicant had sought assistance from a doctor in respect of that issue for the first time on 18 May 2004, more than a year after his arrest and his alleged ill-treatment. There was therefore no link between those events. They also found that it was impossible to establish when the area of pigmentation in question had appeared.",

It dismissed his complaint of ill-treatment as unfounded. The trial court relied on forensic medical expert reports nos. 90 and 18, according to which there was no indication that the applicant had been subjected to electric shocks (see paragraphs 37 and 47 above). The court also questioned the experts who had issued those reports. As regards the expert conclusion which the applicant had commissioned (no. 719 \u2013 see paragraph 34 above), according to which there had been an indication that he had been subjected to electric shocks, it was concluded that it had been based on incomplete medical documentation. Namely, the court noted that the applicant had provided the expert with only the medical records containing his complaints that he had been subjected to electric shocks, and that no forensic medical examination reports of 2003 had been given to the expert. The expert in question was not summoned to the hearing, in spite of the applicant\u2019s requests to that effect. The trial court questioned the prosecutor to whom the applicant had complained of ill-treatment on 6 February 2003 (see paragraph 16 above). He stated that he had seen some linear marks around the applicant\u2019s fingers which had looked like they had been caused by pressure from a fingernail. The prosecutor also submitted that he had drawn the forensic medical expert\u2019s attention to the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had sustained electric shocks. Furthermore, the court questioned the doctors from Novi Sanzhary Hospital who had treated the applicant in February-March 2004 (see paragraph 32 above). One of them said that the applicant had stated that he had sustained an electric shock as a result of an accident at his house in the country. Lastly, the Regional Court questioned a number of former detainees with whom the applicant had been detained in the same detention facility in February 2003. One of them stated for the first time that he had seen linear marks on the applicant\u2019s fingers in June 2003. The court did not find that statement credible, given that it contradicted statements given by the same witness at an earlier stage, and having regard to the timing of the statement. No other former detainees confirmed the veracity of the applicant\u2019s allegation.",

However, none of that evidence \u2013 including the confessions made by the applicant\u2019s co-accused Pi. during the investigation stage, the victim\u2019s statements and the material evidence \u2013 constituted direct evidence.

However, his arguments were rejected. The Supreme Court, which considered the case at second (and final) instance, did not mention the applicant\u2019s submissions in that regard in its ruling (see paragraphs 84 and 85 above). In the Court\u2019s view, this indicates the absence of relevant procedural safeguards afforded by domestic law and practice which could be regarded as counterbalancing the restrictions on the applicant\u2019s right to legal assistance. The Court has previously stressed that, where there have been procedural defects at pretrial stage, the primary concern of the domestic courts at trial stage and on appeal must be the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Doyle v.\u00a0Ireland, no. 51979/17, \u00a7 101, 23 May 2019). As such, the apparent failure of the Supreme Court to engage with the applicant\u2019s submissions is an important consideration.",
