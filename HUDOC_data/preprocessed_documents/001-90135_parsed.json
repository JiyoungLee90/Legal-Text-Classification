He submitted that, according to Article\u00a0104 \u00a7 2 of the former Criminal Code, the running of the statutory time-limits defined in Article 102 could be interrupted by a variety of events such as a conviction, an arrest, the detention and questioning of an accused and, in case of such an interruption, the time would start to run again from the date of the latest event. Yet the same paragraph stipulated that, anyway, the statutory time-limit could be extended for a maximum additional period of half the period prescribed in Article 102. Therefore, the statutory time-limit for the prosecution of offences of ill-treatment and torture had expired at the end of seven years and six months.

France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 95, ECHR 1999-V). It recalls that where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured by the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused and to produce evidence casting doubt on the veracity of the victim\u2019s allegations, particularly if those allegations are supported by medical reports. Failing this, a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see, among many others, Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 87, and \u00c7elik and \u0130mret v.\u00a0, no. 44093/98, \u00a7 39, 26 October 2004).
