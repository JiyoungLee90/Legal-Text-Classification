The case originated in an application (no. 34254/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Zoltánné Szabó (“the applicant”), on 15 June 2010.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 9 April 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Balkány.
On 11 November 2004 the applicant brought an action before the Debrecen Labour Court. She claimed that she had been unlawfully dismissed from public service.
On 14 November 2007 the Labour Court found against her. Relying on various pieces of evidence, the court was satisfied that the reasons for the applicant’s dismissal were real and relevant.
On 10 April 2008 the Hajdú-Bihar County Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
On 11 November 2009 the Supreme Court rejected her petition for review (service: 17 December 2009).
The applicant’s criminal accusations made in the above context against third persons were to no avail.
