Administration of justice, including trials, derives legitimacy from being conducted in public. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to fulfilling the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Gautrin and Others v. France, 20\u00a0May 1998, \u00a7\u00a042, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 III, and Pretto and Others v.\u00a0Italy, 8 December 1983, \u00a7 21, Series A no. 71). There is a high expectation of publicity in ordinary criminal proceedings, which may well concern dangerous individuals, notwithstanding the attendant security problems (see Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0June 1984, \u00a7 87, Series A no.\u00a080).",

This is apparent from the text of Article 6 \u00a7 1 itself, which contains the provision that \u201cthe press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of ... national security in a democratic society, ... or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice\u201d. Thus, it may on occasion be necessary under Article 6 to limit the open and public nature of proceedings in order, for example, to protect the safety or privacy of witnesses, or to promote the free exchange of information and opinion in the pursuit of justice (see B.\u00a0and P. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 36337/97 and 35974/97, \u00a7\u00a037, ECHR\u00a02001III, with further references).",

In the present case, neither the first instance nor the appeal court gave any reasons for closing the trial to the public, even though Article 18 of the Code of Criminal Procedure obliges the trial judge to do so. Therefore, the Government are prevented from developing those reasons before the Court (see, in the context of reasons for detention on remand, Dolgova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a011886/05, \u00a7\u00a046, 2\u00a0March 2006).",
