Such a position explains the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the Bar. Moreover, the courts \u2013 the guarantors of justice, whose role is fundamental in a State based on the rule of law \u2013 must enjoy public confidence. Regard being had to the key role of lawyers in this field, it is legitimate to expect them to contribute to the proper administration of justice, and thus to maintain public confidence therein (see Sch\u00f6pfer v.

In that connection, account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved, which include the public's right to receive information about questions arising from judicial decisions, the requirements of the proper administration of justice and the dignity of the legal profession. The national authorities have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of an interference, but this margin is subject to European supervision as regards both the relevant rules and the decisions applying them (see Sch\u00f6pfer, cited above, pp. 1053-54, \u00a7 33).
