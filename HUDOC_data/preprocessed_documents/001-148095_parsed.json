The experts were further asked to investigate the legality of the offshore activities of Yurt Security Offshore Bank. On 14 July 2003 the experts submitted a lengthy report to the court.

In order for the right to a fair hearing to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires, as a rule, access to a lawyer as from the first questioning of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the particular circumstances of the case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. In the present case, the applicant\u2019s lawyer was allowed to enter the hearing room during the questioning of the applicant, however, this was a passive presence without any possibility at all to intervene to ensure respect for the applicant\u2019s rights. Furthermore, the restriction imposed concerning access to a lawyer was systematic, pursuant to section 31 of Law no.\u00a03842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the mere presence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer in the hearing room cannot be considered to have been sufficient by Convention standards.",

However, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Accordingly, Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Del Rio Prada, cited above, \u00a7 93).",

In this connection it was alleged that the applicant, as the Director General of Yurtbank, had influenced the bank\u2019s branch offices to collect deposits to be transferred to offshore accounts. It was pointed out that these deposits had been used to provide loans to companies which were owned by the bank\u2019s main shareholder, Mr A.B. During the proceedings, in which the case was examined at length twice at two levels of jurisdiction and the applicant was manifestly able to submit his counter-arguments by submitting legal opinions and witness statements in his favour, the domestic courts found it established that a large sum of money that had been collected from depositors for the offshore accounts had never been transferred to the \u201cTRNC\u201d and had been used instead to provide loans to several companies owned by Mr\u00a0A.B. In its judgment dated 17 December 2004 the trial court found the applicant guilty as charged under Article 504 of the now repealed Criminal Code (Law no. 765) and sentenced him to two years and eleven months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine in respect of this offence. As the appeal proceedings were pending, the Court of Cassation decided that the sentence should be reassessed in the light of the new Criminal Code (Law no.\u00a05237) that had entered into force in June 2005. Accordingly, the case was remitted to the Assize Court. Following a retrial, on 29 November 2005 the court sentenced the applicant to two years and one month\u2019s imprisonment and a fine under Article 158 \u00a7 (f) of the new Criminal Code, indicating that this was the most favourable provision applicable to the case.",

As this latter provision provided more favourable terms to the applicant, the trial court decided to rely on this new provision, and accordingly the applicant\u2019s prison sentence was reduced to two years and one month (see Scoppola v.

This is particularly true in relation to persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation.

I note that it is true that in subsequent Chamber case-law (see in particular Dayanan v. Turkey, no. 7377/03, 13\u00a0October 2009), the Court adopted a rather categorical approach to the application of the Salduz judgment. However, in Dayanan, the facts were materially different from the facts of the present case. There, the applicant had remained silent during police questioning and up until the first hearing at his trial, when he denied all the charges against him and gave testimony (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06-11). Thus, a material question arose in that case as to whether and to what extent the trial judge \u201cattach[ed] consequences\u201d (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052) to the applicant\u2019s initial decision, taken without legal assistance, to remain silent. I reiterate that no such material question of prejudice arose in the present case as the applicant confirmed throughout the trial the statements he had given while he was in custody during the initial stage of the investigation. Before the Court, the applicant thus does not claim that the lack of legal assistance during police questioning irretrievably prejudiced his defence rights, only that the mere fact that a lawyer was not present automatically entailed a violation of his human rights.",
