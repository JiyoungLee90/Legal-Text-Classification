It further stated that the applicant had lived in Russia since 1980 and on 1 May 2003 he had been provided with a Russian residence permit valid until 1 May 2008.

On 11 August 2010 the Ministry of Justice had issued decision no. 6204-p excluding him from Russia until 21\u00a0December 2018. The court stated further that the decision had been taken due to the applicant\u2019s conviction for commission of a premeditated serious offence and the danger he posed for public order, which was demonstrated by the crime he had committed \u2013 causing grievous bodily injuries to the victim. The applicant\u2019s reference to his release on parole for good behaviour and the fact of his mother\u2019s residence in Russia were not sufficient to outweigh the threat he represented to public order. The court also stated that even though the applicant had been released on 4\u00a0May 2010, he had not tried to apply for Russian nationality until almost a year later, on 11 April 2011. Since his release from prison in May 2010, the applicant had failed to find employment, despite that being one of the conditions of his parole, and although his positive character references had been of significance for his release on parole, they did not amount to convincing evidence that he would pose no threat to public order were he to continue to reside in Russia. The applicant\u2019s need to comply with the requirements of his parole was not a valid reason for remaining in Russia, given that the relevant period had passed.

While a number of Contracting States have enacted legislation or adopted policy rules to the effect that long-term immigrants who were born in those States or who arrived there during early childhood cannot be expelled on the basis of their criminal record (see paragraph 39 above), such an absolute right not to be expelled cannot, however, be derived from Article 8 of the Convention, couched, as paragraph 2 of that provision is, in terms which clearly allow for exceptions to be made to the general rights guaranteed in the first paragraph.\u201d",

The age at which the person entered the host country is also of relevance, as is the question of whether they spent a large part or even all of their childhood in that country (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73).

The Court also notes that the applicant, contrary to his submission, visited Poland afterwards, in the years preceding his conviction in 2004 (see paragraphs 11 and 21 above). Furthermore, despite his residency in Russia, the applicant remained a Polish national and took conscientious steps to maintain that status by regularly renewing his Polish passport. Prior to his expulsion, the applicant never showed a desire to become a Russian national when he was entitled to do so. Thus, the Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s arguments to the contrary and finds that the applicant had ties with Poland (see Baghli v.\u00a0France, no. 34374/97, \u00a7 48, ECHR 1999VIII, and Samsonnikov, cited above, \u00a7 88).",

Spain (nos. 76550/13 and 45938/14, 18 December 2018), the Court was faced with a somewhat similar situation of expulsion following a criminal conviction. In that case the Court concluded that, when examining the appeals against the applicants\u2019 expulsion following their conviction for drug trafficking, the domestic courts had failed to properly apply the \u00dcner criteria and to balance all the competing interests (ibid., \u00a7 51). More specifically, the Court found that the national authorities had failed to examine the nature and seriousness of the criminal convictions in question, or any of the other criteria established by the case-law of the Court, in order to assess the necessity of the expulsion and exclusion orders. Thus, the competent court had not taken into consideration the length of the applicants\u2019 residence in Spain (including the fact that they had gone to school in Spain since at least the age of twelve and that they had spent a major part of their adolescence and youth there), the family situation of one of the applicants, or the solidity of the applicants\u2019 social, cultural and family ties to their host country, Spain, and the country of destination, Morocco (ibid., \u00a7 50).",
