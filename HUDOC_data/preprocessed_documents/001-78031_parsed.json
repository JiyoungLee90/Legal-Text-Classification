Four out of more than sixteen decisions ordering such reports were served on the applicant with delays ranging from two to three and a half months, whilst the remaining twelve decisions were served within a month from the respective dates of their delivery (see paragraphs 34-37 in the summary of facts). The applicant principally argued that the late notification of these decisions had effectively deprived him of the possibility to participate in the ordering of the expert examinations and that the subsequent admission of the respective expert examinations had been in breach of Article 6.",

The applicant and his counsel had an unrestricted opportunity to make related requests and motions in writing and, indeed, there is no indication in the case-file that any of the requests of the defence were turned down as belated or otherwise inadmissible. On the contrary, the authorities granted and implemented all of the applicant's requests in this respect. Moreover, there is nothing in the case-file to suggest, and indeed the applicant has not alleged that he was unable, personally or with the assistance of his defence counsel, to study the impugned expert examinations beforehand, contest them throughout the trial and appeal proceedings or avail himself of his rights under Sections 89 and 290 of the Criminal Procedure Code by requesting the trial court to order additional or repetitive expert examinations.",

Furthermore, the defence was given an opportunity to request the trial court to order translations of any of these documents and at least on one occasion the applicant availed himself of this right, and the required translation was ordered. As regards the documents in Norwegian, their translation was added to the case-file on 24 April 1998, i.e. already after the beginning of the trial, and was fully available to the parties for study after that date. In addition, the Regional Court discussed in detail the decision to join to the case-file a number of untranslated documents taken at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings and concluded that all relevant documents had been translated into Russian during the trial which had remedied violations of the criminal procedure. In accordance with Sections 240 and 292 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all translations were examined by the trial court in the presence of the applicant and his defence team who had ample opportunities to contest them. The Government concluded that there been no breach of Article 6 of the Convention in this respect.",

In respect of the period between the first instance judgment of 27 May 1998 and the appeal proceedings on 10 August 1998, the Court observes that the applicant and his defence team had sufficient time at least between 10 June and 20 July 1998 to study the amended version of the first instance judgment of 27 May 1998, the first instance transcripts and the case-file. The applicant was provided with this opportunity on 10, 11, 15 and 16 June 1998, whilst the defence counsel had access to the records between 17 June and 23 June 1998 (see paragraphs 51-53). In the Court's view, this time was sufficient for the defence to prepare its appeal arguments. This being so and given the lack of evidence of any unjustified limitations on the applicant's ability to study the case-file, the Court concludes that the time afforded by the authorities to study the case-file was not as such insufficient and that the applicant's rights under Article 6 have not been breached in this respect.",

Switzerland, judgment of 23 October 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V, p. 1567-68, \u00a7\u00a038 and Helle v. Finland, judgment of 19 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII, p. 2928, \u00a7\u00a053). In addition, the Court reiterates that it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility and assessment of evidence, which are primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see, among other authorities, Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000V).",

The Court observes however that there is nothing in the case-file or the parties' submissions to suggest that these translations were not read out at the hearings, as required by Section 292 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and there is nothing in the case-file or in the parties' submissions to suggest that they were not fully available to the defence for study afterwards. Furthermore, as of these dates and until 27 May 1998 which is the date of the delivery of the first instance judgment, the applicant, personally and through his defenders, had ample time and opportunity to challenge the contents of these documents as well as call into question the competence of those who translated them or arrange for additional or alternative translations of relevant documents. In view of the above, the Court finds that both the prosecution and the defence had equal opportunities to make use of the evidence in question. The Court is therefore unable to conclude that the admission of these translations after the beginning of the trial placed the defence at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis its opponents or adversely affected the fairness of the proceedings.",

Germany, judgment of 28 November 1978, Series A no.\u00a029, \u00a7\u00a040), there is no indication in the present case that either the bill of indictment or the applicant's first instance conviction relied on any of these documents or that their presence in the prosecution case-file could have otherwise undermined the fairness of the proceedings. On the contrary, the presence of these materials was fully compatible with the prosecution's duty of disclosure which requires the investigative authorities to disclose to the defence all material evidence both for and against the accused (see e.g. Edwards v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247B, p.\u00a0417, \u00a7 36). Throughout the proceedings the defence in the present case was given an opportunity to request the investigator and the trial court to order translations of any of these documents and, according to the Government, at least on one occasion the applicant availed himself of this right and necessary translation was ordered. In view of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the presence of non-translated documents in the prosecution case-file was not incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention.",

The authorities did their best to secure their presence at the trial but their attempts proved futile as the Norwegian nationals resided in Norway, refused to appear voluntarily and could not be compelled to come to . The court furthermore gave a motivated and justified decision to admit the oral evidence given by these witnesses. As regards German national P., he was away in  and could not be summoned, whilst witnesses M. and A. were repeatedly searched for by the authorities, but their whereabouts could not be established.

The Court further recalls that, according to its case-law, all evidence must normally be produced in the presence of the accused at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. This does not mean, however, that the statement of a witness must always be made in court and in public if it is to be admitted in evidence; in particular, this may prove impossible in certain cases. Thus, the use of statements obtained at earlier stages of proceedings is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 3 (d) and 1 of Article 6 of the Convention, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Asch, cited above, \u00a7 27).",

Austria, judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 186, \u00a7\u00a7 25-31). Furthermore, from the case-file and documents presented by the Government (see paragraph 30 in the summary of facts) it transpires that reasonable measures were taken by the court aimed at summoning these witnesses and it cannot be said that their failure to attend was imputable to the lack of diligence by the authorities in this respect (see, by contrast, Delta v. France, judgment of 19 December 1990, Series A no. 191A, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-37). This being so and having regard to the fact that the applicant's conviction was firmly corroborated by various other pieces of evidence such as the statements of a number of other witnesses, documentary evidence and expert examinations (see e.g. Trivedi v. UK, no. 31700/96, Commission decision of 27 May 1997), the Court concludes that the admission of statements made by witnesses P., M., and A. did not fail to respect the rights of the defence.",

Italy, judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-53).
