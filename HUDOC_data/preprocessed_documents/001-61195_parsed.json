This court also takes the view that the District Court had no cause to permit exceptions for any specific area of life. It considers that the arguments advanced in the contested decision are correct. It regards it as important that the girl [M.] \u2013 who is, after all, thirteen years old \u2013 has stated clearly and for a long time that she wants no contact with her father. The applicant should accept this clearly expressed wish in his adolescent daughter\u2019s interest and also his own. Only if he ceased to exert pressure on her might it one day be possible for them to resume contact. The court would also point out that access to [M.] on the strength of a court order could hardly be enforced against the child\u2019s will.\u201d",

Thus, the Court has recognised that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation, in particular when deciding on custody.

Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed (see Elsholz v.

In this connection, the Government referred to the District Court\u2019s reasoning, as endorsed by the Regional Court, that an enforceable right of access was not in the child\u2019s interest, if she was opposed to contact and her mental and psychological well-being would be endangered thereby. Accordingly, the German courts had based their decisions not only on the ground that access would not serve the child\u2019s well-being, but on the much stronger reason that it was incompatible with the child\u2019s well-being.",

Accordingly, the legislature could reasonably give the family courts special jurisdiction in all disputes relating to marriage. In any event the differences were negligible, two levels of jurisdiction being available in both cases and the further appeal constituting the exception in access proceedings, which should be determined speedily.

Under such rules and circumstances, there was evidently a heavy burden of proof on the side of a father of a child born out of wedlock. The crucial point is that the courts did not regard contact between child and natural father prima facie as in the child\u2019s interest, a court decision granting access being the exception to the general statutory rule that the mother determined the child\u2019s relations with the father. Even if the District Court\u2019s decision contains the formulation that there was a risk to the child\u2019s mental and psychological well-being if she had to take up contact with the applicant against her wish, the mother\u2019s initial prohibition of further contact and her influence on the child remained decisive. Accordingly, there is sufficient reason to conclude that the applicant as a natural father was treated less favourably than a divorced father in proceedings to suspend his existing right of access.

It is not for this Court to supervise the national courts\u2019 findings in relation to the interests of a child except in cases where their reasoning is clearly arbitrary and would in the end harm the child\u2019s health and development. We fully agree with the reasoning of the Grand Chamber in paragraphs 57 to 60 of the judgment and we would like to stress that it is completely wrong to assume that the Court has increasingly entered into the material elements of the best interests of children in the field of parental rights of access.

The fundamental issue raised by this case under Article 8 concerns the procedural requirements implicit in this Article, requirements which the Court has already developed and clarified on many occasions. It is one of the basic requirements in relation to parents\u2019 rights of access to their children that there exist legal safeguards designed to secure the effective protection of the rights of parents and children to respect for their family life (see Elsholz v. Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR 2000-VIII; Kutzner v. Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, ECHR\u00a02002-I; and Covezzi and Morselli v. Italy, no. 52763/99, 9 May 2003). A decisive element of these \u201cparental rights of access\u201d resides in the question whether the level of involvement of the applicant in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, provided him with the requisite protection of his interests. The procedural rule should be that first established in Elsholz (cited above), namely that the domestic courts should assess the difficult question of the child\u2019s best interest on the basis of a reasoned and up-to-date psychological report, and that the child, if possible, should be \u201cheard\u201d by the psychological expert and the court.",

The procedural requirement to have up-to-date psychological expert evidence in order to obtain correct and complete information on the child\u2019s relationship with the applicant as the parent seeking access to the child would seem an indispensable prerequisite for establishing a child\u2019s true wishes and thereby striking a fair balance between the interests at stake. This procedural requirement is endorsed even more by recent research on the so-called parental alienation syndrome (\u201cPAS\u201d), which has been described by Richard A. Gardner in the American Journal of Forensic Psychology (2001, pp. 61-106) under the title \u201cShould courts order PAS children to visit/reside with the alienated parent? A follow-up study\u201d, and which has received an increasing amount of attention. Courts should therefore address the question whether parental alienation syndrome is present and what specific consequences such a syndrome could have on the child\u2019s development and \u2013 as the Chamber put it \u2013 on the establishment of \u201ca child\u2019s true wishes\u201d. It is also noteworthy that the psychologist who was heard by the District Court in the first set of proceedings in 1992 had tried to arrange a meeting between the applicant and his child, which, however, had been cancelled by the child\u2019s stepfather (paragraph 16 of the judgment). It is true that the District Court judge, in the second set of proceedings, heard the thirteen-year-old M., who stated that she did not wish to talk to or see the applicant. However, since the last and only psychological expert opinion (a one-page submission) was submitted in April 1992, there was no other opinion about the truthfulness of the wishes expressed by the child and the question how far and how strongly she was influenced by her mother and her stepfather. To give the applicant the chance of effective participation in the proceedings, we would prefer to have adhered to the normal rule taken from Elsholz that an up-to-date psychological expert opinion is necessary to evaluate the child\u2019s statements and to establish whether she is able to make up her own mind. The statements of a ten- or thirteen-year-old girl, whether she is heard in court or not, cannot always be decisive or even indicative of her true wishes. In such a complex situation, where the alienation of the child from her natural father by the strong influence of her mother and her stepfather can be perceived, a more thorough approach has to be taken and an effective and genuine chance of participation has to be given to the natural father.",

Under German law it was the mother, having sole custody, who determined the father\u2019s access. Only if it was in the child\u2019s interest to have personal contact with the father could the guardianship court decide that the father had the right to such contact.

This application of section\u00a01711 of the Civil Code placed the whole burden of proof on the applicant, requiring him to show that even against the clearly stated will of his daughter, personal contact with her biological father would be in her interest. Such proof could only be established by a thorough psychological expert opinion, which would have to include the questions whether the child had really expressed her own wishes or more or less those of her mother and her stepfather, and whether a meeting with her biological father, such as the one that the psychologist had tried to arrange in 1992, would be useful for the development of relations between the child and her biological father. The absence of a new psychological expert opinion was a clear result of the disadvantages of the legal situation of children born out of wedlock at the material time. We agree that this legislation violated Article 8 in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention and we furthermore conclude that this violation had a direct impact on the denial of the applicant\u2019s procedural rights inherent in Article 8 of the Convention itself.",
