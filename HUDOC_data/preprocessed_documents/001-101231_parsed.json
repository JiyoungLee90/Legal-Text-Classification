The same holds true in so far as degrading treatment is concerned (see Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, 25\u00a0March 1993, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 247-C). The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see  and Costello-Roberts, both cited above, loc. cit.). In this connection overcrowding and inadequate facilities for heating, sanitation, sleeping arrangements, food, recreation and contact with the outside world may sometimes amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. When assessing conditions of detention, account has to be taken of the cumulative effects of these conditions, as well as of specific allegations made by the applicant (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2001II).",

Both of these reports strongly criticise the conditions of detention, which are described thus: \u201coutrageous overcrowding and general sordidness in the facility beggared belief\u201d. The CPT further recommended in the second report that the official capacity of the facility should not be exceeded. Although the Court has not conducted an on-site visit, it notes that the applicant's allegations are corroborated by the conclusions of the CPT report. The applicant was detained for ninety days at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters, which had been found to be overcrowded and fundamentally inadequate by the CPT. It appears that there were not enough beds or blankets for everybody. Additionally the Government do not specify whether the rooms had natural light or deny that the detainees were not allowed to spend time outdoors. Therefore it seems, as alleged by the applicant and supported by the second CPT report cited above, that the applicant did not have access to natural light or open air during the ninety days he was detained in the Foreigners' Department.",
