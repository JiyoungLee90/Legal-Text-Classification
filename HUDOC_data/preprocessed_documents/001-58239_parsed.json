The latter in his academic writings asserted that although habeas corpus is not essentially a part of the ordinary law of Malta, there are in the Maltese Criminal Code two provisions, namely Articles 137 and 353 which, taken together, may be regarded as providing an equally effective safeguard of personal freedom.",

Every person in Malta was assured that an arrest could not last beyond forty-eight hours and the appearance before the magistrate ensured that if the arrested person had any submissions to make, he or she could do so in the presence of a totally independent person and not before a representative of the prosecuting authority. In connection with habeas corpus decisions, under Article 137 of the Criminal Code the magistrate did not need to hear the Attorney-General. However, since this was an adversarial procedure where the prosecution was led by the police, the magistrate was expected to hear the police as parties to the case in observance of the principle audi alteram partem and the principle of equality of arms. This was a power quite separate and distinct from the power to grant bail. If the arrest was found by the magistrate to be unlawful, then the magistrate had to order the release of the person arrested and the question of bail did not therefore arise.

Although Article 582(1) of the Criminal Code required the filing of applications for provisional release (see paragraph 27 above), it could not limit the competence of magistrates to hear habeas corpus applications.

Moreover, there was no instance of an arrested person being released on being brought before a magistrate on the ground that the magistrate had decided that the arrest was unlawful. Additional arguments could be drawn a contrario from Articles353 (see paragraph 24 above) and 397(5) of the Criminal Code. The latter provision provided that the court could also order the arrest of an accused person who was not already in custody. In any event, even assuming that the applicant could have made an application under Article 137 of the Criminal Code, this would not have ensured compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention which required an automatic review. Finally, the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention could not have been considered unlawful because in the Ellul case the Constitutional Court had found that the limitations imposed by the system in force on the magistrate\u2019s power of release did not raise any issues under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see paragraph 25 above).",

The applicant alleged the absence of a procedure ensuring the specific kind of judicial control required by Article 5 \u00a7 3. In so far as the Government\u2019s argument is that, if the applicant had invoked the above-mentioned Articles of the Criminal Code, he would have obtained a review of his detention by a judge as envisaged by Article 5 \u00a7 3, this is an argument going directly to the issue of compliance with that provision.

Since the offence for which the applicant had been arrested carried a penalty exceeding three years\u2019 imprisonment, the bail application had to be communicated to the Attorney-General, who should normally have had one working day in which to decide whether he would oppose it or not. During that period the magistrate was not competent to decide on the the applicant\u2019s release. According to standard practice, after the accused\u2019s first appearance before a magistrate the case went to the registrar who chose by lot the magistrate who would hear the evidence. This system was introduced to eliminate the possibility of forum-shopping by the police. The magistrate who heard the evidence also examined the bail application after the Attorney-General had had the opportunity of expressing his view.

In any event, the Attorney-General replied expeditiously and, as a result, the review of the accused\u2019s detention could be concluded within the time-frame of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03. If the Attorney-General did not reply within the time-limit set by the magistrate, the latter could give a ruling on the bail application without hearing the Attorney-General\u2019s views, which were not in any event binding. The period of eleven days which had elapsed between the applicant\u2019s arrest (20 July 1992) and the decision on his bail application (31\u00a0July 1992) could not be considered a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3. Furthermore, the Government stressed that the applicant had had ample opportunity to present his case in writing and could have made oral submissions. The Convention did not require that the magistrate who decided on an arrested person\u2019s bail application should be the same as the \nmagistrate before whom the arrested person initially appeared. Although the second magistrate had not heard the applicant in person, he had had at his disposal all the information required and was totally independent of the executive. In any event, the applicant could have asked the second magistrate to hear him in person.",

Bulgaria judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, p. 3298, \u00a7 146). It is essentially the object of Article 5 \u00a7 3, which forms a whole with paragraph\u00a01\u00a0(c), to require provisional release once detention ceases to be reasonable. The fact that an arrested person had access to a judicial authority is not sufficient to constitute compliance with the opening part of Article 5 \u00a7 3. This provision enjoins the judicial officer before whom the arrested person appears to review the circumstances militating for or against detention, to decide by reference to legal criteria whether there are reasons to justify detention, and to order release if there are no such reasons (see the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, pp. 21-24, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 47 and 51). In other words, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires the judicial officer to consider the merits of the detention.",

However, the scope of flexibility in interpreting and applying the notion of promptness is very limited (see the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, pp. 33-34, \u00a7 62).",

It cannot be made to depend on a previous application by the detained person. Such a requirement would not only change the nature of the safeguard provided for under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03, a safeguard distinct from that in Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a04, which guarantees the right to institute proceedings to have the lawfulness of detention reviewed by a court (see the De Jong, Baljet and Van\u00a0den Brink judgment cited above, pp.\u00a025-26, \u00a7\u00a057). It might even defeat the purpose of the safeguard under Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 which is to protect the individual from arbitrary detention by ensuring that the act of deprivation of liberty is subject to independent judicial scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kurt v. Turkey judgment of 25\u00a0May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1185, \u00a7 123). Prompt judicial review of detention is also an important safeguard against ill-treatment of the individual taken into custody (see the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18\u00a0December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2282, \u00a7 76). Furthermore, arrested persons who have been subjected to such treatment might be incapable of lodging an application asking the judge to review their detention. The same could hold true for other vulnerable categories of arrested persons, such as the mentally weak or those who do not speak the language of the judicial officer.",

Even assuming the Government\u2019s interpretation of national law to be correct, the Court considers that Article 5 \u00a7 3 would not be complied with. The matters which, by virtue of Article 5 \u00a7 3, the judicial officer must examine go beyond the one ground of lawfulness cited by the Government. The review required under Article 5 \u00a7 3, being intended to establish whether the deprivation of the individual\u2019s liberty is justified, must be sufficiently wide to encompass the various circumstances militating for or against detention (see paragraph 47 above). However, the evidence before the Court does not disclose that the magistrate before whom the applicant appeared on 22 July 1992 or any other judicial officer had the power to conduct such a review of his or her own motion.

However, compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 cannot be ensured by making an Article 5 \u00a7 4 remedy available. The review must be automatic (see paragraph 49 above). Furthermore, even in the context of an application by an individual under Article 137 and having regard to Article 353, the scope of the review has not been established to be such as to allow a review of the merits of the detention. Apart from the cases where the forty-eight-hour time-limit was exceeded, the Government have not referred to any instances in which Article\u00a0137 of the Criminal Code has been successfully invoked to challenge either the lawfulness of or the justification for an arrest on suspicion of a criminal offence. Moreover, from what the Court can deduce from the domestic cases cited before it, the absence of a reasonable suspicion or of reasons militating in favour of the applicant\u2019s continued detention would not necessarily have rendered the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention unlawful under Maltese law (see paragraphs 22, 25 and 26 above). It follows that the Government have not substantiated their preliminary objection that the applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies because he did not seek to rely on Article 137 of the Criminal Code read together with Article 353. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.",
