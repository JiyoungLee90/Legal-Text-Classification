His antiretroviral treatment consisted of a combination of four active substances grouped into three separate drugs. One of these was Truvada, which contained two active substances but was not available in the recommended combination through the national infectious diseases programme. For this reason, and given that the applicant had purchased the necessary medication himself, he had not been given treatment through the national programme. He had signed a waiver refusing to receive treatment through the programme and had therefore exercised his right to purchase his own medication.

Although the Government provided information to the Court concerning the periods of detention in each facility, cell size and number of inmates and beds, they did not provide precise information on the number of detainees the applicant shared his cell with on a daily basis.
