A. had been stressed and troubled, with the knowledge of the applicant\u2019s suicide attempts adding to his emotional burden. The youngest child F. was the least troubled, though the memories of hitting and shouting were clearly also frightening and disturbing for her. All three children separately indicated that they wanted to live with their mother and were worried about contact with the applicant. There was evidence of a fairly ritualised and damaging cycle of events with the applicant being unreasonably harsh with his children on repeated occasions.

In a welfare report before the court at that time, the court welfare officer concluded that a break in contact would be unhelpful in counteracting the children\u2019s negative views of their father and it was also noted that, if no contact order was made, then contact was unlikely to occur, whatever the children\u2019s wishes. A psychiatric report dated 12 March 1993 suggested that there should be an increase in contact, unsupervised, and that there was no reason why overnight stays with the father could not be permitted. The report noted that the applicant had acknowledged hitting the children with a belt in the past, had provided a reason for it (his illness) and had apologised to the children for it.

At the hearing of his application on 2 August 1993, the applicant appeared in person and his former wife was represented by counsel. The judge was told that the mother was very unhappy about contact, that the telephone was disconnected, that the house appeared to be occupied and that the door was unanswered. The applicant informed the judge that the mother might be suffering from depression. The applicant stated in his memorial that the County Court judge said that he had power to make an order requiring the mother to be brought before the court, but suggested instead that the matter should be dealt with by the High Court (Family Division) because of its greater powers.

The children were however to remain wards of court and it would be open to the applicant to apply to lift the stay on proceedings in England if the proceedings in Scotland were not pursued. The judge noted that the applicant claimed that he would be disadvantaged by the change of jurisdiction, as he was not conversant with Scottish procedures and as it would be more expensive for him to travel to Scotland for hearings and to consult with lawyers.

As the mother\u2019s definitive location was unknown until May 1994, no coercive steps were in fact possible through most of this period and, once she was in Scotland, the High Court no longer had jurisdiction to enforce. Nor is the Court persuaded that there was any failure by the authorities to protect the applicant\u2019s interests by leaving it to the applicant to approach the High Court to make the applications for such orders to locate the mother as he required. When the applicant first appeared in the High Court on 25 July 1993, it was not clear whether the mother had left home with the children, temporarily or definitively, and certainly it was not known to the authorities that she had left the jurisdiction of the English court. The steps taken by the High Court, first to appoint the Official Solicitor to represent the children and carry out an investigation, then to instruct the Tipstaff who could use the police to search possible addresses and access the Police National Computer, and finally to order Government agencies to disclose the mother\u2019s address, show a not unreasonable progression in the measures applied. The argument of the applicant that the High Court should, on its own motion, have ordered the last measure first immediately, relies on the hindsight that this was the step which finally succeeded in locating the children. In any event, the applicant, who was represented in the High Court proceedings from about 1 October 1993, was himself at liberty to make an application for this measure to be applied at any stage.",

It also appears that the address had been passed to the Official Solicitor, who entered into contact with the mother and whose appointed social worker secured interviews with the mother and children during which the question of access was raised. It appears probable that it was the mother\u2019s emphatic refusal to envisage contact that made it clear that the matter would have to be transferred to the Scottish courts who had jurisdiction to take enforcement steps and that, in those circumstances, the decision was taken to give the address to the applicant to enable him to institute the necessary proceedings.

While there was a delay of some five months in presenting a report, this was a necessary step in establishing the circumstances of the children. Though it might have perhaps proceeded more quickly, the time taken was not outside reasonable bounds. Similarly, the delay of two and a half months in the High Court transmitting the mother\u2019s address to the applicant to enable proceedings to commence was not unreasonable in the circumstances. ",

Furthermore, while the hearing on the merits of the contact dispute was originally fixed for November 1996, the applicant consented to it being adjourned until 27 May 1997. The difficulty which arose with enforcing the Scottish order of 22 June 1995 also derived from the applicant\u2019s mistake in requesting it in terms amending the English order which was beyond the Scottish court\u2019s competence and permitted the mother to apply to have it set aside.",
