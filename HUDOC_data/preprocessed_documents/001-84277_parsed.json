Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a  has violated fundamental rights (see Musayev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057941/00, 58699/00 and 60403/00, \u00a7\u00a0143, 26\u00a0July 2007 and the cases referred therein).",

In view of the above and taking into account the fact that, save for minor details, her version of facts has been constant, the Court finds the applicant's submissions regarding these facts credible. In this connection, the Court finds it significant that the modus operandi of the applicant's husband's abduction shows some similarities with the disappearances of persons in south-east Turkey in the mid1990s (see, for example, Nuray \u015een v. Turkey (no. 2), no.\u00a025354/94, \u00a7\u00a031, 30\u00a0March 2004, Tahsin Acar v.  [GC], no.\u00a026307/95, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2004III, \u00c7elikbilek, cited above, \u00a7 14, and Koku v.

It appears that apart from the applicant's stamped petition of 29\u00a0December 1997 there exists no official trace of his detention and of his subsequent whereabouts or fate. In accordance with the Court's practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see for example Baysayeva v. , no. 74237/01, \u00a7\u00a0146, 5\u00a0April 2007).",

However, the Court's reasoning and findings in relation to Article 2 above, in particular as regards the inadequateness of the investigation conducted into Mehmet \u00d6zdemir's disappearance, leave no doubt that the authorities failed to take prompt and effective measures to safeguard him against the risk of disappearance.",
