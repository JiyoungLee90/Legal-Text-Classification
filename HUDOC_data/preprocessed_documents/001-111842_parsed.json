Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2008, and \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2006XII). Indeed it will be a rare case where a settled migrant will be unable to demonstrate that his or her deportation would interfere with his or her private life as guaranteed by Article 8 (see A.H. Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 6222/10, \u00a7 32, 20\u00a0December 2011, and Miah v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 53080/07, \u00a7\u00a017, 27\u00a0April 2010). Not all settled migrants will have equally strong family or social ties in the Contracting State where they reside but the comparative strength or weakness of those ties is, in the majority of cases, more appropriately considered in assessing the proportionality of the applicant\u2019s deportation under Article 8 \u00a7 2. It will depend on the circumstances of the particular case whether it is appropriate for the Court to focus on the \u201cfamily life\u201d rather than the \u201cprivate life\u201d aspect (see\u00a0Maslov, and \u00dcner, loc. cit.). However, the Court has previously held that the existence of \u201cfamily life\u201d cannot be relied on by applicants in relation to adults who do not belong to the core family and who have not been shown to have been dependent members of the applicants\u2019 family (see Slivenko v.

However, their decisions in this field must, in so far as they may interfere with a right protected under paragraph 1 of Article 8, be in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society, that is to say justified by a pressing social need and, in particular, proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Dalia v.

While a number of Contracting States have enacted legislation or adopted policy rules to the effect that long-term immigrants who were born in those States or who arrived there during early childhood cannot be expelled on the basis of their criminal record (see paragraph 39 above), such an absolute right not to be expelled cannot, however, be derived from Article 8 of the Convention, couched, as paragraph 2 of that provision is, in terms which clearly allow for exceptions to be made to the general rights guaranteed in the first paragraph.",

France, no. 52206/99, \u00a7 31, 15 July 2003). Indeed, the rationale behind making the duration of a person\u2019s stay in the host country one of the elements to be taken into account lies in the assumption that the longer a person has been residing in a particular country the stronger his or her ties with that country and the weaker the ties with the country of his or her nationality will be. Seen against that background, it is self-evident that the Court will have regard to the special situation of aliens who have spent most, if not all, their childhood in the host country, were brought up there and received their education there.\u201d",

It takes note of the fact that the applicant\u2019s father lived separately with his partner and also has regard to the periods that the applicant spent in prison or abroad. The applicant\u2019s brother also has a family of his own. As concerns the applicant\u2019s relations with V., the Court notes that their cohabitation started soon after the applicant\u2019s deportation from . By that time the applicant had been refused a residence permit in  and that refusal had been upheld by the first-instance court. Thus, V. must have been aware of the applicant\u2019s precarious status as regards his residence rights in . Furthermore, the applicant and V. had no children and they only made inquiries about the possibility to get married some weeks before the applicant\u2019s expulsion. Considering the above circumstances, the Court does not doubt that the applicant had strong personal ties with  but finds that his family ties were weaker.",

Thus, the Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s argument that he had no ties with . It also appears that his relatives were Russian and that his social circle mainly consisted of persons of Russian origin. The Court has regard in this context to the fact that although V. was a person of undetermined citizenship and held a permanent residence permit in , she was of Russian ethnic origin as well. The Court observes that Russia is a country geographically close to Estonia, sharing a border with it, and that the applicant has relatives in  \u2013 although according to him they are distant ones with whom he maintained no contact prior to his expulsion. The Court concludes that the applicant had such links with Russia that he did not face insurmountable difficulties in settling in  and that V. would not have any such difficulties either if she wished to continue her relationship with the applicant.",

He was sentenced to two years and four months\u2019 imprisonment for that offence and although he was released before having served the sentence in full, the sentence meted out to him is indicative of the seriousness of the cross-border drugs offence in the view of the Swedish authorities. The Swedish court also applied a seven-year ban on the applicant entering . Furthermore, it appears from the information in the case file that a prohibition on entry or stay in the Schengen area had already been applied in respect of the applicant on 20 August 2007, that is before the commission of the offence in Sweden, and that the prohibition on entering the Schengen area was subsequently extended. It is unclear whether the later extensions were related to the applicant\u2019s conviction in , but the first prohibition could evidently have had no connection to the conviction in question and must have been based on some other considerations. That being said, the application by the Swedish authorities of a prohibition on entry into the Schengen area, indicative of their assessment of the applicant\u2019s dangerousness as it may have been, did not conclusively rule out granting the applicant an Estonian residence permit. Even though the applicant might have been expected to challenge the decision of the Swedish authorities in , it was still possible for the Estonian authorities to grant him a residence permit under section 12(4-1) of the Aliens Act.",

In doing so, the Board had regard \u2013 in addition to his conviction in  \u2013 to the applicant\u2019s other convictions, including the offences against public order and safety. The Court observes in this context that during the twelve years before the Board\u2019s refusal, the applicant had been convicted of criminal offences on four occasions. Two of the offences involved violence and one was related to narcotic drugs. Although he did not have to serve the full sentences in each instance and the first two sentences were suspended altogether (albeit the fact that he had to serve the second sentence later, after having reoffended), it remains a fact that the applicant was sentenced to a total imprisonment of eight years in the course of the twelve years preceding the Estonian authorities\u2019 refusal to extend his residence permit. In addition, the applicant had a number of convictions for misdemeanours, some of which were drugs-related. Against this background and having regard to the applicant\u2019s age, the length of the period of his criminal behaviour as well as the seriousness of the offences, the Court is unable to conclude that the acts committed by the applicant can be regarded as \u201cacts of juvenile delinquency\u201d (see, by contrast, Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 81; see also Joseph Grant v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a010606/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03940, 8 January 2009). The Court reiterates, in this context, that an absolute right not to be expelled cannot be derived from Article 8 of the Convention regardless of whether an alien entered the host country as an adult or at a very young age, or indeed whether he or she was born there (see \u00dcner, cited above, \u00a7 55). Furthermore, according to Recommendation Rec(2000)15 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, each member state should have the option to provide in its internal law that a long-term immigrant may be expelled if he or she constitutes a serious threat to national security or public safety (see paragraph 53 above).",

They participate in the economy by working and paying taxes and they are influenced by the culture, language and education of the host country. As a result of this reality, nationality is defined as a legal and not an effective bond with the country. The Court pointed out that although Article 8 provides no absolute protection against expulsion for any category of aliens, including those who were born in the host country or moved there in their early childhood, regard is to be had to the special situation of aliens who have spent most, if not all, their childhood in the host country, were brought up there and received their education there (see \u00dcner \u00a7 55 and Maslov \u00a7\u00a074). This is the reason why we look at the sum total of the social ties with the community in the host country as part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d. The concept of expulsion to the country of nationality without any other supporting element is not convincing and leads to interference with the applicant\u2019s private and family life.",

It is important to note that the fundamental principles that laid the foundations for the Court\u2019s subsequent case-law concerning the application of Article 8 of the Convention to cases involving the expulsion, following conviction, of foreign nationals legally resident in the host country are well established in the Boultif judgment (Boultif v. Switzerland, no. 54273/00, ECHR 2001IX) and have been further developed in the \u00dcner case (\u00a7\u00a7 54-55 and 57-58) and later in Maslov v. Austria. In these cases, the main emphasis was consistently placed on the \u201cfamily life\u201d aspect. The Court has adopted a broad approach to the notion of \u201cfamily life\u201d. In the Marckx judgment it observed that \u201c\u00a0\u2019family life\u2019, within the meaning of Article 8, includes at least the ties between near relatives, for instance those between grandparents and grandchildren, since such relatives may play a considerable part in family life\u201d (see Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 21, \u00a7 45). Therefore, the notion of \u201cfamily life\u201d is much broader than the notion of \u201cfamily\u201d.",

This acknowledgment is even more important as regards the extremely difficult health and social situation of the applicant in this concrete case. The applicant is HIV-positive and suffers from hepatitis C. We consider that at the time when he was expelled, the applicant was in an extremely vulnerable position. The support and help of his family were all the more necessary to him. He stressed that he had close family ties with his father and that because of his own illness and his father\u2019s age they were dependent upon one another. In our view the applicant not only has strong personal ties but also strong family ties with . His brother and his brother\u2019s family also live in . The applicant is in a relationship with V. They live together and attempted to marry, but without any success (paragraphs 43 and 44). Family is crucial for stability, support and social integration not only for children but also for adults facing life-threatening instability and uncertainty as a result of health and social problems. In this concrete case Article 8 of the Convention appears to play an enhanced role regarding the notion of family life between a seriously ill dependant adult and his family.",

Thus, the Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s argument that he had no ties with . It also appears that his relatives were Russian and that his social circle mainly consisted of persons of Russian origin\u201d (see paragraph 88). In our view, the argument that in applying for Russian citizenship \u201cthe applicant must have identified himself with that country\u201d does not lead to the conclusion that he should be expelled from the host country to the country of nationality. According to Article 2 of the European Convention on Nationality, \u201cnationality means the legal bond between a person and a State and does not indicate the person\u2019s ethnic origin\u201d. Furthermore, the fact that he spoke his mother tongue better than the Estonian language and that his relatives in Estonia were Russian and his social circle mainly consisted of persons of Russian origin, is without any relevance for the outcome of the procedure for expulsion with prohibition from entering  for three years. Unlike the majority, we conclude that none of these reasons was sufficient to demonstrate his links with Russia or justify expelling him to , where it is difficult for him to organise his existence and his health care. We think that all these elements were primarily part of his social, cultural and family ties with Estonia, because his father and brother, his Russian relatives and friends and his partner V. all live in Estonia and not in . In the circumstances of his case the support of the community where he was born and raised was of crucial importance.",

Similar to our case is the case of Nasri v. France (judgment of 13 July 1995, series\u00a0A no. 320B). The applicant, born deaf and dumb in Algeria, arrived in  at the age of five and was convicted several times, of theft, robbery and gang rape. In 1987, following that last conviction, the Minister of the Interior ordered his deportation. The applicant alleged violations of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention and the Commission found violations of those Articles. In that particular case, even before the Maslov v. Austria case, the Court placed itself mainly in the context of Article 8. It began by pointing out that the offence at the origin of the deportation decision (gang rape) was very serious, but most of all took into account the applicant\u2019s infirmity and the very special importance of the family\u2019s support in such circumstances. The family\u2019s strong ties with France and the applicant\u2019s lack of social and cultural ties with  led the Court to find a breach of Article 8 (Nasri \u00a7\u00a046).",

With much regret we disagree that this balance was successfully struck in this case. The applicant was refused an extension of his residence permit after he was convicted of aggravated drug smuggling in . He was sentenced to two years and four months\u2019 imprisonment for that offence and released before having served the sentence in full. At the same time the Swedish court also applied a seven-year ban on the applicant entering . In  the applicant has criminal convictions mainly for aggravated hooliganism, aggravated theft and attempted theft, and administrative offences of petty theft and consumption of narcotic substances. Between 2006 and 2009 the applicant was punished seven times for misdemeanours (illegal consumption or possession of narcotic drugs and travelling on public transport without a ticket). Like the majority we are unable to conclude that the acts committed by the applicant can be regarded as \u201cacts of juvenile delinquency\u201d (contrast Maslov, \u00a7 81), but in our view, none of his criminal convictions was of a sufficiently serious nature to endanger the interests and constitutional rights of others.
