Until 18 December 2001, his detention had been repeatedly ordered and prolonged on the sole ground that there was a risk of collusion by him. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision of that date did not give any reason for abandoning that ground and for deciding to prolong his detention on the ground that there was a risk that he would abscond. Since there must have been a new fact on which the Supreme Court based its conclusion that there was such a risk, it was obliged, pursuant to section 379/A \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to hold a hearing. However, no explanation was given for the court\u2019s decision to dispense with a hearing. Given the facts that the prosecution\u2019s motion, based on the risk of his absconding, was not served on the applicant, that the Supreme Court did not hold a hearing, and that the decision was not subject to an appeal, the applicant was deprived of any opportunity to challenge the ordering of his detention on an unexpected new ground. His defence counsel\u2019s motion for release of 27 November 2001 could not possibly remedy this situation, since it only concerned the issue of collusion \u2013 which was, to the defence\u2019s knowledge, the only ground of detention relied on by the prosecution \u2013 whereas the prosecution had meanwhile introduced a new ground for the proposed prolongation. In any event, the motion was never forwarded to the Supreme Court.",

Before taking a decision, the court holds a hearing if a new fact or circumstance has emerged, thereby enabling the defendant to put forward his views, to become familiar with the public prosecutor\u2019s views and statements contained in the latter\u2019s written and oral motions and to study them. Accordingly, the principle of equality of arms is respected whenever a decision is taken to prolong a defendant\u2019s detention on remand.",

At this stage, the judge decides on the basis of the available documents and communicates his decision to the defendant and his counsel. However, this decision is normally subject to an appeal. Furthermore, the defendant and his counsel are entitled at any stage of the proceedings to lodge with the court an unlimited number of requests for release. Prior to the submission of the bill of indictment, requests for release are decided by the public prosecutor; if the public prosecutor rejects the request, he must transmit it to the competent court. After the indictment has been filed, such requests are decided directly by the court.",

Since in the present case the essential procedural guarantees \u2013 including access to court, the adversarial nature of the proceedings and the impartiality of the court taking the decision \u2013 were ensured, it should be concluded that the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention were not violated.",

The Court considers that even if the applicant was able to appear in person or be represented at the court hearings concerning his detention, this possibility was not sufficient to afford him a proper opportunity to comment on the prosecution\u2019s motions. Moreover, the Court notes that the applicant could not appear in person or be represented before the Supreme Court, which decided in camera to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention on remand.",
