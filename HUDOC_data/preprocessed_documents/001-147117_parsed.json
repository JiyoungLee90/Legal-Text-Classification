In balancing these competing interests, the Minister took into account the following: already in Suriname and before her arrival in the Netherlands the applicant had been in a relationship with her current spouse; she had entered the Netherlands without having been granted entry clearance for joining her partner as required under the relevant immigration rules; and she had created her family in the Netherlands without holding a residence permit.

The Netherlands authorities could not be held responsible for the consequences of the applicant\u2019s personal choice to come to, settle and create a family in the Netherlands without any certainty as to her entitlement to permanent residence.

According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands [no.\u00a050435/99, ECHR 2006I]), where family life has started while no residence permit for that purpose has been granted, removal will lead to a violation of Article 8 only in the most exceptional circumstances. The appellant has not established that, as regards her and her family, there are such exceptional circumstances. Her reliance on the judgments in Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer and Nunez v. Norway (no.\u00a055597/09, 28 June 2011) fails, as her situation is not comparable to the one in the cases of Rodrigues da Silva and Nunez. In those cases it was established that the children could not follow their mother to the country of origin. With the removal of the mother, contact with the children would become impossible. However, in the appellant\u2019s case, it has not become sufficiently apparent that her husband and children could not follow her to her country of origin to continue family life there. The appellant has insufficiently demonstrated that her family members will encounter difficulties in entering Suriname. The consequence of her husband\u2019s inclusion on a blacklist is that airlines can refuse to allow him on direct flights from the Netherlands to the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Suriname and Venezuela during the period between 2 August 2009 and 2 August 2012. This does not mean that it is self-evident that the husband will not be admitted to Suriname. The appellant has not established that it would be impossible for her husband to travel to Suriname in another manner. In addition, it is important to note that registration on the blacklist is only of a temporary nature.",

The defendant has taken the interests of the minor children sufficiently into account in the balancing exercise. The children were all born in the Netherlands and hold Netherlands nationality. At the time the impugned decision was taken, they were respectively eleven, six and one year old. The children have always lived in the Netherlands. Although the oldest child has built up bonds with the Netherlands, the defendant did not have to accept this as a basis for holding that the children could not take root in Suriname.

As follows from paragraphs 68 and 69 of the Dereci judgment, this right is not, as such, protected by Article 20 of the TFEU but by other international, EU and domestic rules and regulations, such as Article 8 of the Convention, Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, EU Directives and section 15 of the Aliens Act 2000. In answering this question the desire of family members to reside as a nuclear family unit in the Netherlands or the European Union is, inter alia, also of limited importance.",

The Convention does not guarantee the right of a foreign national to enter or to reside in a particular country (see, for instance, Nunez, cited above, \u00a7 66).

A subsequent withdrawal of that right, for instance because the person concerned has been convicted of a criminal offence, will constitute an interference with his or her right to respect for private and/or family life within the meaning of Article 8.

Rather, the question to be examined in the present case is whether, having regard to the circumstances as a whole, the Netherlands authorities were under a duty pursuant to Article 8 to grant her a residence permit, thus enabling her to exercise family life on their territory. The instant case thus concerns not only family life but also immigration. For this reason, the case at hand is to be seen as one involving an allegation of failure on the part of the respondent State to comply with a positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention (see Ahmut v. the Netherlands, 28 November 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996VI).

However, the Court considers that they fell short of what is required in such cases and it reiterates that national decision-making bodies should, in principle, advert to and assess evidence in respect of the practicality, feasibility and proportionality of any such removal in order to give effective protection and sufficient weight to the best interests of the children directly affected by it (see above \u00a7 109). The Court is not convinced that actual evidence on such matters was considered and assessed by the domestic authorities. Accordingly, it must conclude that insufficient weight was given to the best interests of the applicant\u2019s children in the decision of the domestic authorities to refuse the applicant\u2019s request for a residence permit.",

We were unable to follow the majority in finding that the domestic authorities failed to live up to a positive obligation by not granting the applicant residence in the Netherlands upon any of her repetitive requests. These requests for residence were lodged on various grounds, and filed from Dutch territory during an illegal overstay after expiration of a short-term tourist visa. From one point of view \u2013 that of the present dissenters \u2013 the Court can be seen to be acting as a first-instance immigration court, in disregard of the principle of subsidiarity; although, in all fairness, the rejoinder to that criticism is presumably that the Court has merely taken the approach of granting paramount importance to the best interests of the children. Is the Court striking the right balance, while the respondent State had failed to do so? Who is to perform such a balancing exercise going into the factual, detailed merits of the applicant\u2019s individual circumstances? Where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court should require strong reasons to substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts (see Von Hannover v. Germany (No. 2), nos.\u00a040660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7 107).",

The applicant, a Surinamese woman, was allowed to enter the Netherlands only once for a limited period of 45 days for the declared purpose of a tourist visit to an aunt in 1997. After expiration of her visa she overstayed illegally in the Netherlands. The applicant then repeatedly requested legal residence and all of these requests were ultimately refused, while one such request is still pending. In the meantime, the applicant had started building a family life in the Netherlands despite having no legitimate expectation of being granted permanent legal residence in the country, a factor that was at all times perfectly well known to herself and her partner. Her partner/husband is of Surinamese origin and holds Dutch nationality. Both of them have lived most of their lives in Suriname, and indeed they cohabited there before coming to the Netherlands. The applicant and her husband have three children, all holding Dutch nationality by virtue of their father\u2019s nationality. The applicant, her husband and her children have led a continuous family life together in the Netherlands in the period under consideration. The children have never visited Suriname.

Rather, the judgment goes to the issue of the Contracting States\u2019 positive obligations regarding family life in the sphere of immigration. If this judgment is to be taken as establishing principled guidelines, it (a) expands the positive obligations incumbent on the State under the Convention in the interface of immigration and family law, (b) thus shrinks the margin of appreciation in relation to family life created during illegal overstay, (c) virtually disregards the attitude of the applicant as a relevant matter of consideration, (d) upgrades the obligation to take into account the best interests of the children. However, it must be observed that most of these seemingly fundamental jurisprudential developments are not reflected in the applicable general principles as hitherto formulated by the Court in its case-law and reiterated in the current judgment. They appear only under the surface in the application of these principles to the facts of the case. Perhaps this judgment by the Grand Chamber is not to be taken as establishing principled guidelines?

In the Court\u2019s longstanding case-law this question is answered mainly in the negative. True, the Court does acknowledge that Article 8 is capable of being applicable under its family-life head, but it has concluded most of the time that the immigration treatment accorded to these persons was not such as to violate this provision, regard being had to their situation and the general interest of the community. The overriding consideration highlighted in this case-law is that they are foreign nationals, that is to say members of a category in respect of whom the States enjoy, under international law, as is stressed in all the relevant decisions, a virtually absolute right of control over entry into their territory and discretionary power in the matter of admission and residence. The Convention does not guarantee the right of a foreign national to enter or to reside in a particular country (see, for instance, Nunez v. Norway, no. 55597/09, \u00a7 66, 28 June 2011); and it does not prevent the Contracting States from enacting into law and enforcing a strict, even very strict, immigration policy. In concrete terms, the Court has taken the stance that a Contracting State is not obliged under the Convention to accept foreign nationals and permit them to settle except in cases where family life could not be lived elsewhere than on its soil. In the great majority of cases, it has pointed out that such family life could flourish in another country.",

However, taking into account the particulars of the case, the Court considers that granting residence to the applicant on the territory of the Netherlands is the only appropriate way to respect her family life and that, by not taking such a decision to grant residence, the national authorities have failed to meet the positive obligation which Article 8 placed on them.",

Both of these cases concerned the reunification of families by admitting a child to the territory of the host State (the Netherlands) where the parent or parents had legal residence. The integration of the children concerned into the family unit was regarded as necessary for their development in view of their young age (nine years in \u015een and fifteen years in Tuquabo-Tekle and Others). It should be observed that neither of these two cases concerned family-formation during an illegal overstay in the host State, but that, on the contrary, in both instances the request to have the children enter the State was filed before they had entered the State, in compliance with the applicable immigration law \u2013 quite unlike the situation in the present case. In both of these previous cases, where the children themselves were applicants, the Court concluded that the Netherlands had a positive obligation to allow the children to reunify with their parent(s) lawfully on Dutch territory.",

It is noteworthy that the Court has not changed its position on the legitimacy of the immigration condition contested by the applicant. It reiterates in paragraph 101 that, in principle, Contracting States have the right to require aliens seeking residence on their territory to make the appropriate request from abroad. This matter is not further addressed in the judgment because the Court, after having reformulated the complaint proprio motu (in paragraph 76 - the original complaint being set out in paragraph 77), decides on the merits that in the particular circumstances of the case denial of residence violates the obligation to respect family life. The particular circumstances taken into consideration by the Court are that the husband and children all hold Dutch nationality; that the children have always lived in the Netherlands; that the applicant\u2019s husband provides for the family by working full-time in a job that includes shift work, with the consequence that he is absent from the home on some evenings; and that, as a result, the applicant is the primary care-taker of the children. What is remarkable is that the Court performs a balancing exercise of its own as regards the factual, detailed merits of the individual circumstances affecting the applicant, although it cannot be said that the domestic authorities did not themselves have full and careful regard to the relevant principles, considerations and aspects as developed in the Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 34).",

The Court equates the absence of a forced removal with tolerance of her presence. While this precarious situation continued for such a lengthy period of time, during which, according to the Court, for a large part it was open to the authorities to remove her, the applicant was enabled to establish and develop strong family, social and cultural ties in the Netherlands. The Court\u2019s reasoning can hardly be understood as applying the principle that family-creation without having stable grounds for residence is at the risk of those who do so in a situation that is known to them to be precarious. The margin of appreciation, which was wide in such circumstances, has undergone a hot wash in this case.",

                        "content": "9.\u00a0\u00a0Where parents make personal choices, the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 8 are generally spoken of as being of secondary importance and almost the same goes for facing consequences of deliberate acts. Thus, imprisonment of fathers sentenced for having committed a crime rarely raises issues under Article 8 of the Convention, even though their children are liable to suffer from it. The same goes for divorce. The present case, of course, is not at all about a committed crime or a divorce; nor is it about an eventual rupture of family life caused by the State. It is about a family wishing to establish a particular place of residence. What would be the perspective in cases of chosen emigration from the Netherlands in contrast with this case of refused residence? Many parents seek economic or other opportunities abroad; and nowadays Suriname is a notably popular destination. Even though children of such emigrants might prefer to stay where they reside, they would be obliged to follow their parents. In such cases of chosen emigration the State has generally speaking no positive obligation to intervene. It is commonly understood that respect for family life implies that the best interests of the children are then considered to be best served by accepting the consequences of the (lawful) choices made by their parents, unless fundamental rights of the children (such as those protected by Article 3) would thereby be violated. Shifting the responsibility for consequences of choices made by parents to the State is, in our view, in principle not conducive to the furtherance of the best interests of the children with regard to family life. There would also be a great risk that parents exploited the situation of their children in order to secure a residence permit for themselves (see Butt v. Norway, no. 47017/09, \u00a7 79).",

The majority holds a different view. The approach adopted by the Court in the present case in effect involves giving to those prospective immigrants who enter or remain in the country illegally and who do not properly and honestly comply with the prescribed conditions for seeking residence a special premium, in terms of Convention protection, over those who do respect the applicable immigration law by remaining in their country of origin and conscientiously complying with the procedures laid down for seeking residence. The result is liable to be to encourage illegal entry or over-staying and refusal to comply with the prescribed immigration procedures and judicially sanctioned orders to leave the country. The right answer in hard cases is the one that fulfils the obligation of the community to treat its members in a civilised but also coherent and principled manner. In replacing the domestic balancing exercise by a strong reliance on the exceptional character of the particular circumstances, the Court is drifting away from the subsidiary role assigned to it by the Convention, perhaps being guided more by what is humane, rather than by what is right.",
