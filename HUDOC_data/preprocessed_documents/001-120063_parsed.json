Accordingly, that obligation, which should have been borne by the other party and which was imposed on the applicants at the enforcement stage, constituted a restriction of a purely financial nature and therefore calls for particularly rigorous scrutiny from the point of view of the interests of justice (see Apostol, cited above, \u00a7 60, and Osman Y\u0131lmaz v. Turkey, no.\u00a018896/05, \u00a7 41, 8 December 2009). In this connection, the Court takes account of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision dated 14 January 2010, which repealed the provision in the second sentence of section 28(1)(a). It notes that the higher court found the said provision incompatible with the right of access to court, as it imposed the obligation to pay the court fees on the party whose case had been accepted and who was not legally liable for such fees pursuant to the judgment.",

It considers that by shifting to the applicants the full responsibility to meet the court costs, the State avoided its positive obligation to organise a system for the enforcement of judgments which is effective both in law and in practice (see Fuklev v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 71186/01, \u00a7 84, 7 June 2005, and Osman Y\u0131lmaz, cited above, \u00a7 42).
