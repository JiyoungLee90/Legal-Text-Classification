If the conduct in question did not reach that threshold, the correct response was to first reprimand the person and to impose the penalty only after the alternative responses had been exhausted to no avail. Making reference to Article 31 of the Polish Constitution, the court observed that the punishment, as the reaction of a judge to the behaviour of a person subjected to judicial assessment, should be moderately used and considered necessary in the democratic society for its security and public order, freedom and right of others or for the protection of other public interests. In the circumstances of that particular case, in which a fine was imposed on the applicant, who had been subject to a court decision to enforce his previously conditionally stayed sentence, the court considered that his ironic statement made in a loud voice: \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of law we have\u201d (takie mamy prawo), constituted an unacceptable comment about the Polish legal order.

The applicant\u2019s own disruptive behaviour forced the court to deliver the impugned decision in another courtroom and in his absence.

The Government referred to the Rule 80 (B) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence common for the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and to Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Court, which authorise the court to order the removal of a person for his or her disruptive conduct and to continue the proceedings in the person\u2019s absence.",

To that end, they maintained that the court had been composed of three professional judges who had not been put under any outside pressure; had not shown prejudice against the applicant; or had they had any particular interest in punishing him. The Government also stressed that, unlike in the case of Mariusz Lewandowski v.\u00a0Poland (no. 66484/09, 3\u00a0July 2012), the judges had not been called to assess the applicant\u2019s statements in so far as they might have insulted them personally but only in so far as they concerned the court as an institution.
