For example, in Deak v.

In Stenzel v. Poland (dec.), no. 63896/00, 28 February 2006, even though the Polish courts did not divest the applicant of his parental rights, in the absence of proceedings brought under the Hague Child Abduction Convention, the Court found, in respect of the applicant\u2019s access rights, that he had never applied under that Convention to the German authorities for assistance in securing the right to visit his child in Germany.",
