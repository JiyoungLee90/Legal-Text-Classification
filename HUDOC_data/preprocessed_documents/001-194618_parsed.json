As to the risk of torture in Spain alleged by the Indictments Division, the investigating judge specified that the CPT\u2019s information had been disputed by the Spanish Government in March 2012 and that, during its subsequent periodic visits in 2012 and 2014, the CPT had made no further mention of it. With regard to incommunicado detention, the judge stated that it was tightly regulated. It could be imposed only in exceptional cases concerning the investigation of armed gangs or terrorists; all persons subjected to such detention were guaranteed a forensic medical examination, and the national torture prevention mechanism included the possibility of unannounced visits by the Ombudsman; the person concerned was entitled to the assistance of a lawyer during the police and judicial proceedings; detention was always subject to judicial supervision, and the person concerned had the right to apply for a writ of habeas corpus; the communal areas were monitored by CCTV and interviews could be recorded; and the restrictions on communications with family and friends were limited to five days and had to be reviewed by a judge. Furthermore, the crime of torture under the Spanish Criminal Code encompassed any physical or psychological ill-treatment, and allegations of torture were examined by an independent judge. Lastly, the investigating judge observed that Spain had transposed the European directives strengthening existing safeguards in criminal matters.",

The CJEU held, in substance, firstly, that the executing judicial authorities were required only to assess the actual and precise conditions of detention of the person concerned that were relevant in determining whether he or she was at real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. Secondly, where the issuing authority had given assurances that the person concerned would not be subjected to such treatment, the executing authority, in view of the mutual trust between the judicial authorities of the member States, had to rely on those assurances, in the absence of any specific indications that the conditions of detention were in breach of Article\u00a04 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.",

Moreover, the murder had taken place in Spain and no connection with Belgium had been invoked. Furthermore, the Belgian authorities\u2019 refusal to execute the European arrest warrant had been based on considerations relating to the treatment of prisoners in Spain. While it was true that N.J.E now came prima facie within the jurisdiction of the Belgian courts, it could not be inferred from this that the same applied to the victims, who had no connection to that country. While acknowledging that the procedure for the execution of a European arrest warrant did not allow the applicants to intervene and that the decisions complained of had had an (indirect) impact on their interests, the Government nevertheless stressed that the applicants had never been parties to proceedings in Belgium.",

The present case was to be distinguished from cases in which the Court had recognised that the State to which the suspected perpetrator had fled could have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention. Firstly, Belgium had never instituted an investigation into the murder of the applicants\u2019 father. Secondly, it could not be argued that the Belgian State had any obligation under Article 2 to obtain evidence. There had never been any question of this in the proceedings concerning the European arrest warrant, and in view of the time elapsing between the murder and the first set of proceedings in Belgium, the idea of still being able to gather evidence was somewhat illusory. Thirdly, the Government stressed that Belgium had cooperated with Spain and that it was only in the course of that cooperation that the Belgian courts, applying Article 3 of the Convention in particular, had decided not to surrender N.J.E. From that standpoint it was clear that the harm alleged by the applicants did not stem from the conduct of the Belgian authorities, but rather from the situation in Spanish prisons at the time of the refusal decision.",

In view of this principle, any refusal to surrender an individual must be supported by detailed evidence of a clear threat to his or her fundamental rights capable of rebutting the presumption in question. In the present case the Court of Cassation found that the Indictments Division of the Ghent Court of Appeal, in its judgment of 31\u00a0October 2013, had provided legal justification, on the basis of section 4(5) of the Belgian European Arrest Warrant Act, for its decision to refuse execution of the European arrest warrants issued by the Spanish investigating judge, on account of the risk of an infringement of N.J.E.\u2019s fundamental rights in the event of her surrender to Spain, and in particular the risk that she would be detained there in conditions contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 12 above). In its judgment of 14 July 2016 the Indictments Division essentially referred to its previous judgment, taking the view that the fresh information referred to in the new European arrest warrant did not call for a different assessment and that the previous assessment was in fact confirmed by the observations made by the Human Rights Committee in 2015 (see paragraph 20 above).",

It is true that the Indictments Division referred to observations published in 2015 by the Human Rights Committee concerning the existence of incommunicado detention (see paragraph 28 above), but it did not conduct a detailed, updated examination of the situation prevailing in 2016 and did not seek to identify a real and individualised risk of a violation of N.J.E.\u2019s Convention rights or any structural shortcomings with regard to conditions of detention in Spain.",

This \u201cchallenge of symmetry\u201d is manifested, in particular, within the EU mechanisms of mutual recognition which are based on the principle of mutual trust, as was examined most recently by this Court in its Grand Chamber judgment in Avoti\u0146\u0161 v.

However, this Court holds today, correctly in my view, that viewing this refusal to execute the EAW through the lens of Belgium\u2019s duty to cooperate under the procedural limb of Article 2 of the Convention, it must be concluded that the respondent Government have violated this provision of the Convention owing to the inadequate factual basis upon which the refusal was based.",

The \u201cduty to cooperate\u201d is, in other words, context-specific in relation to the normative framework of transnational cooperation applicable in a particular case, as transpires from \u00a7 235 of the judgment in G\u00fczelyurtlu, as referenced in paragraph 81 of today\u2019s judgment. When Member States of the European Union trigger their mutual obligations under the EAW Framework Decision No. 2002/584/JAI of 2002, as transposed into their respective national laws, the Conventionbased \u201cduty to cooperate\u201d under Article 2 may, at the same time, come into play, the supervision of which is finally for this Court. However, in assessing whether the duty to cooperate has been fulfilled in an EAW context, the Court must be careful to articulate its assessment in a manner which, on the one hand, enforces already settled principles in its case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, but, on the other, retains, as far as possible, the required \u201csymmetry\u201d between Convention and EU law, so as not to undermine the delicate balance of duties and obligations embedded in the EAW framework of cooperation.",

This concept has, in my view, two elements which are assessed on a prima facie basis by this Court. On the one hand, the refusal must in substance be in conformity with the norms applicable under the transnational framework of cooperation and, on the other, be sufficiently supported by the facts adduced by the authorities of the requested State when reasoning their refusal, also taking account of the Convention rights of third parties. It is this second element which was lacking in the present case (see paragraphs 86-90 of the judgment) and constitutes the core of the Court\u2019s finding of a violation. However, as is made clear in paragraph 92 of the judgment, this finding in no way entails an obligation at this point for the Belgian Government to execute the EAW warrant issued by the Spanish authorities. It only means that the Belgian Government has not convinced the Court that it had a sufficiently strong basis in the facts, as relied upon by the domestic courts, to conclude that the warrant\u2019s execution would rise to the concrete and individual level of a real risk of ill-treatment of the accused in Spain, as is required under the Court\u2019s Article 3 case-law, also taking account of the context in which it takes place in the present case (see, most recently, A.M. v. France, no. 12148/18, 29 April 2019, \u00a7\u00a7 117 and 119).",

Seen in this light, Article 53 of the Convention, which permits States to provide a higher level of human rights protections than flow from the minimum guarantees of the Convention, has limited, if any, direct application in this context.",
