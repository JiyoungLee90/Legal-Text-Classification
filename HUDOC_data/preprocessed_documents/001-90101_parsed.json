Apart from this certificate, the applicant has not furnished the Court with any documents, such as witness statements, plans, photographs or a video recording of the scene of the incident, documents from public bodies, or any other evidence confirming the involvement of the State agents in inflicting damage on her property (see, by contrast, Khamidov v. Russia, no.\u00a072118/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063-72, 136 and 138, ECHR 2007... (extracts). The Court is sceptical about the applicant\u2019s allegation that she had adduced photographs showing a missile hole in the walls of the destroyed block of flats to the domestic courts, as the enclosures listed in the applicant\u2019s written submissions to the District Court (see paragraph 28 above), or the materials listed in the transcript of the court hearing of 3\u00a0December 2001 (see paragraph 65 above) do not mention any photographs among the adduced documents. Also, the applicant has not submitted any such photographs, if they exist, to the Court, or given any reasons preventing her from submitting this evidence. Nor has she relied on any independent sources to confirm that on the date in question there was an attack by federal forces resulting in the damage alleged (see, by contrast, Isayeva v. Russia, no. 57950/00, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 111-115, 24\u00a0February\u00a02005).",

It is not convinced that in such circumstances the State may or should be presumed responsible for any damage inflicted during the military operation, and that the State\u2019s responsibility is engaged by the mere fact that the applicant\u2019s property was destroyed.",

The Court therefore finds that the applicant\u2019s complaints as to the State\u2019s responsibility for the damage to her property, and the claims for compensation, have not been substantiated.",
