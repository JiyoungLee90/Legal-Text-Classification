However, the situation is more complex where the direct victim dies before lodging an application in Strasbourg (see Sanles Sanles v.

However, the fact that an applicant had been a party to the domestic proceedings, though by itself not sufficient and not always indispensable, can be considered as a preliminary step to be able to bring proceedings before the Court. Indeed in Nolkenbockhoff v Germany, (judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no.\u00a0123-A, \u00a7\u00a033), while holding that the widow had a material and legitimate interest to pursue proceedings under the Convention, the Court also noted that the Federal Constitutional Court, whose individual recourse procedure was similar to that of the Convention, had not rejected the applicant\u2019s request for lack of victim status. Its preliminary nature was further highlighted in Georgia Makri and others v. Greece ((dec.), no. 5977/03, 24 March 2005), where the Court held that relatives of a deceased person could not be considered as victims in respect of complaints concerning, inter alia, Article 6 - length of proceedings - since they had not participated in their own name in the domestic proceedings at issue nor had they intervened as heirs in the proceedings before the \u201cConseil d\u2019Etat\u201d after the direct victim\u2019s decease.",

Firstly, there was no automatic obligation on a judge to withdraw in cases where impartiality could be an issue, a matter which remains unchanged in the law in force at present. Secondly, at the time of the present case the law did not recognise as problematic and therefore as a ground for challenge a sibling relationship between judge and advocate, let alone that arising from relationships of a lesser degree such as those of uncles or aunts in respect of nephews or nieces. Thus, the Court considers that the law in itself did not give adequate guarantees of subjective and objective impartiality.

The court may be required to establish whether the lawyer\u2019s management of the case was sound, fanciful, negligent or downright erroneous. (Did the lawyer sue the defendant in the competent court? Did the lawyer comply with the formalities required in written pleadings? Did the lawyer mislead the court? Did the lawyer summon all the relevant witnesses? Were time limits allowed to lapse?) When a court brands an advocate\u2019s handling of a case as defective, this may open the way to an action for damages by the client against the lawyer. The Maltese system, until recently, allowed judges to determine whether their son, daughter, parents, spouse or sibling could be sued in tort. The impartiality of presiding judges called upon to decide the professional virtue or otherwise of their closest relatives would be seen to be rather problematic, and not solely by the passionately paranoid. This injury to fairness was retained in the Maltese legal system with a firmness of purpose worthier of causes more noble.

The old case-law of the  organs seems to have taken on board as altogether in conformity with the Convention the view that injunctions should be issued or denied by a biased judge, by a judge in the pocket of one of the parties, or by a judge with a personal or family interest in the outcome of that injunction.

They hinder or permit the exercise of civil rights, and they determine \u2013 temporarily \u2013 civil rights and obligations, sometimes with extremely far-reaching consequences for the parties. Nowhere does the Convention, nor the basics of rationality, mandate that civil rights and obligations should be determined irretrievably in order for Article 6 to be allowed entry.

In the case of Markass Car Hire Ltd v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 51591/99, 23 October 2001, to which reference is made in paragraph 38 of the judgment of the Chamber, the Court confirmed its earlier case-law to the effect that Article 6 did not apply to proceedings relating to interim orders but found the case-law to be inapplicable in the particular circumstances of that case. In that case the applicant company, which was the owner of a fleet of vehicles, was the defendant to proceedings in which K. sought damages for breach of contract for the delivery of vehicles. At the same time, K. sought and obtained an interim order requiring the applicant company to hand over a number of vehicles which were still in the applicant\u2019s possession at the time. Having noted that the interim decision partly coincided with the main action and that, unless reversed by the  within a short time-limit, would affect the legal rights of the parties resulting from the contract, the Court continued as follows:",

Instead, emphasis is placed in the judgment on the fact that the impugned decision of the Court of Appeal was taken not in the course of the interlocutory injunction proceedings brought by Mr F. but in separate proceedings brought by Mrs M., which involved the determination of the question whether a party had, as a matter of domestic law, a right to be heard. It is said that the Court of Appeal may be regarded as having examined the merits of Mrs M.\u2019s application and, in so doing, to have determined the dispute over the right to be heard, a dispute which the applicant could claim at least on arguable grounds was covered by Article 6.",

In particular, I find wholly artificial the reliance placed on the fact that the impugned decision of the Court of Appeal was reached in separate proceedings rather than in an appeal from the grant of the interim injunction. Had Maltese law allowed such an interlocutory appeal, and had the Court of Appeal rejected an appeal by Mrs M. based on the fact that she had not been heard when the injunction was granted, the case would have fallen squarely within the Court\u2019s constant case-law. The fact that, in the absence of an interlocutory appeal, Mrs M. was required to resort to separate proceedings to have the injunction set aside does not in my view change anything. The proceedings were clearly brought not, as the judgment suggests, for the purpose of establishing that she had a right to be heard under domestic law but for the purpose of setting aside the injunction which had in her submission been granted in breach of that principle. Furthermore, even if as the judgment asserts the procedural requirement of audi alteram partem can be said to be a substantive \u201cright\u201d under domestic law, I do not consider that it could be regarded as a \u201ccivil right\u201d for the purpose of Article 6, such that any dispute concerning such right would attract the protection of that Article.",

([GC], no. 63235/00, 19 April 2007, ECHR 2007-). The Court in that case was concerned with the specific problem of the applicability of Article 6 to disputes involving civil servants, which had traditionally been treated by the Court as falling within a special category so far as the right of access to court was concerned. In reversing its decision in the case of Pellegrin v. France ([GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999-VIII) so as to widen the scope of application of Article 6 to include disputes concerning civil servants, the Court noted that it was primarily for Contracting States to identify those areas of public service involving the exercise of the discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty where the interests of the individual to have access to a court must give way. It was in this context that the Court observed (as noted in paragraph 41 of the current judgment) that if the domestic system barred access to a court, the Court would verify that the dispute was indeed such as to justify the application of the exception to the guarantees of Article 6, but that, if it did not, there was no issue and Article 6 \u00a7 1 would apply. This statement of the Court was confined to the case of civil servants and was not intended to overrule or otherwise affect the Court\u2019s established case-law as to the applicability of Article 6 in other contexts. This was indeed made clear in the very next sub-paragraph of the Court\u2019s judgment, where it was emphasised that:",

I fully share these sentiments but I am unable to conclude that they are such as to justify the Chamber in departing from well-established case-law so as to find Article 6 to be applicable to what in my view are to be seen as interlocutory proceedings.",
