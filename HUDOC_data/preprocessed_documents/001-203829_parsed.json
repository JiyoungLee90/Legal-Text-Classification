It follows from the foregoing principles that the Court must verify whether the authorities acknowledged, at least in substance, that there had been a violation of a right protected by the Convention. In cases of wilful illtreatment by State agents in breach of Article 3, in addition to acknowledging the violation, two measures are necessary to provide sufficient redress. Firstly, the State authorities must have conducted a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Secondly, an award of compensation is required where appropriate or, at least, the possibility of seeking and obtaining compensation for the damage sustained as a result of the illtreatment (see G\u00e4fgen v.

The Court must further examine whether there was sufficient redress in the form of an adequate investigation and compensation.

Having regard to the fact that the sentence was imposed eight years after the wrongful conduct, the suspension appears lenient and disproportionate to the gravity of the act (see Atalay v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 1249/03, \u00a7 44, 18 September 2008).",

The main conclusion of the domestic courts was that the liver rupture had been inflicted by joint actions of officer M. and an unidentified person at the police department, but it was impossible to establish whose actions in particular had caused the rupture (ibid.). In this regard, the Court notes that the circle of individuals involved in the ill-treatment was sufficiently clear and the investigation\u2019s inability to identify a perpetrator responsible for liver rupture may only be attributed to the reluctance of the authorities to pursue the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Velkhiyev and Others v.
