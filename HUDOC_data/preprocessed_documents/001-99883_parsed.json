Although an identity card and a passport were prima facie evidence of nationality they were not conclusive, especially when citizenship had been obtained through registration (as in the case of the applicant) or naturalisation, both being subject to revocation according to section 14 of the Maltese Citizenship Act (see relevant domestic law). The Minister's deposition in respect of the recently issued circular was irrelevant, since responsibility for ascertaining the compliance with the requirements of Article 244(1) was for the Director of the Public Registry. Thus, the requirement of a letter of nationality was in accordance with the law, pursued a legitimate aim and was proportionate. However, the  noted that from the witness testimony at the hearing of 2 May 2006, it was clear that the applicant was a Maltese citizen; however, interdepartmental lethargy had meant that the Director of the Public Registry only called upon the applicant to register the marriage on 9\u00a0November 2006. Thus, the Court revoked the first-instance judgment in part by ordering the costs to be shared between the parties.

It constituted erga omnes proof that the State recognised that the husband and wife were lawfully married. The applicant submitted that whenever a Government department required proof of marriage, a copy of the original act of marriage would not suffice, unless the marraige had been registered by the Public Registry. According to Maltese law (Article\u00a0627 (f) of the COCP), certification following registration of a marriage required no further proof and could not be contested. Registration was necessary for the purposes of the Immigration Act, allowing his wife to be an exempt person as opposed to a prohibited immigrant, and dispensing with the need for a visa, a matter which to date had been concessionary. Registration would also have allowed her to work (without requiring a permit) and to have the status of a lawfully wedded wife. Furthermore, it was necessary for the purposes of the Social Security Act, the Income Tax Act, and to obtain free medical aid for his wife, all of which required official proof of marriage.

Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8. Beyond a person's name, his or her private and family life may include other means of personal identification and of linking to a family. An individual's ethnic identity must be regarded as another such element. Article 8 protects in addition a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, S. and Marper v. the  [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, \u00a7 66, 4\u00a0December 2008, and the case-law cited therein).

Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, Series A no.\u00a032) and that decisions to nullify\u00a0an applicant's marriage had implications for her legal status and in general for her private life (see Benes v.

As acknowledged by the Government, the relevant departments would not require further proof of marriage when a document from the Public Registry was presented to them. In consequence, lack of such documentation would make the processing of certain requests, such as applications for social or tax benefits, lengthier and more complex, if at all possible. The same would hold true for verifications required in the private domain, such as the employment sector. The refusal to register the applicant's marriage would clearly have had an impact on his private life. It follows that the lack of registration or a substantial delay in such registration, such as a delay amounting to over twenty-eight months as in the present case, constitutes interference within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.",
