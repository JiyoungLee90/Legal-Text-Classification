It pointed out that, in relation to EU Member States, the procedure for detaining an individual must be in accordance with EU law. However, as a part of the EU Asylum Acquis, Article 18 of Directive 2005/85/EC (\u201cthe Procedures Directive\u201d) stipulates that no individual should be held in detention on the sole basis that he is seeking asylum and that all asylum seekers have the right to judicial review of their detention. In addition, Article 7 \u00a7 of Directive 2003/9/EC (\u201cthe Reception Conditions Directive\u201d) recognises the right of asylum seekers to move freely within the territory of the host Member State; they may be confined only when it proves necessary. In the AIRE Centre\u2019s view, these provisions taken together indicate that the detention of asylum seekers is to be avoided and that any detention is subject to an examination of its necessity to achieve its given purpose. Moreover, the AIRE Centre emphasised the relevance of Article 15 \u00a7 4 of Directive 2008/115/EC (\u201cthe Returns Directive\u201d), as it states that a detention will no longer be permitted when there is no \u201creasonable prospect of removal\u201d or the legal or other considerations justifying the detention no longer exist.",

A further concern of theirs was that most asylum seekers who had been transferred to  under the Dublin II Regulation were wrongly considered by the Hungarian asylum authority to have illegally entered, which was automatically followed by their placement in detention. UNHCR stressed that under international human rights and refugee law (in particular Articles 31 to 33 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees) as well as Hungarian national law, asylum seekers could not be deported or expelled until a final decision was rendered on their claims, determining that they were not in need of international protection. Moreover, Hungarian law only permitted detention with a view to deportation where that deportation could be executed, which was not the case during the asylum proceedings. Therefore, UNHCR shared the applicants\u2019 view that the Hungarian practice of detaining asylum seekers for the purposes of expulsion was not in line with the relevant national and international law.",
