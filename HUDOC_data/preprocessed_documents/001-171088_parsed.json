It further noted that it was apparent from the documents in the file that X had acted lawfully. In addition, the information collected by X and the applicant\u2019s active participation in the crime in question were supported not only by the police reports, but also by transcripts of the telephone conversations that the applicant had with C.A.O. and X. The court stated that it was clearly apparent from those transcripts that the applicant had initiated calls to X on two occasions in order to act as an intermediary in the drug deal. It also noted on this point that the applicant and the other co-defendants had signed the offence report without any objection (see paragraph 10 above).

Where the authorities claim that they acted upon information received from a private individual, the Court draws a distinction between an individual complaint and information coming from a police collaborator or informant (see Milinien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 74355/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03738, 24 June 2008; Malininas v.

The latter would run a significant risk of extending their role to that of agents provocateurs, in possible breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, if they were to take part in a police-controlled operation. It is therefore crucial in each case to establish if the criminal act was already under way at the time when the source began collaborating with the police (see Veselov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 23200/10, 24009/07 and 556/10, \u00a7 91, 2 October 2012).",

The domestic court was therefore under an obligation to take the necessary steps to uncover the truth, while bearing in mind the burden of proof falling on the prosecution to prove that there had been no incitement. It should accordingly have verified, by assessing the information in the case file and, if necessary, reviewing the relevant material concerning the undercover operation and examining the officials and other individuals involved, what the basis was of the authorities\u2019 suspicion that the applicant might have been involved in drug dealing. The Court observes on this point that the domestic courts failed to verify the statement included in the initial report of 1 March 2007 that the police were in possession of information concerning the applicant\u2019s involvement in drug trafficking. That would have helped to clarify the reasons why the operation had been set up, more specifically whether the authorities acted upon information received from a private individual and therefore joined a continuous offence, or the information had been collected directly by the police, the latter running the risk of extending their role to that of agents provocateurs (see paragraph 35 above).",

In this context, X\u2019s statement did not offer the necessary clarifications in respect of the applicant\u2019s allegations of police incitement.

The majority seem to be satisfied with this \u201cexplanation\u201d. The Government might have erred in submitting that the applicant confessed to having been involved in the drug-deal. Be that as it may, the applicant was not a bystander, and he was approached by the agent not at random. The Government\u2019s submissions are assessed critically, and those of the applicant should also be similarly assessed. Alas, they are not. All factual circumstances are assessed in favour of the applicant in a spirit of na\u00efve, excessive legalism.",

For the majority, the respondent State\u2019s fault is that \u201cthe domestic courts did not adequately investigate the allegations of entrapment\u201d (see paragraph 53). I am not persuaded by such a conclusion. In my opinion, the courts saw both sides. They balanced the parties\u2019 versions of events against each other. The police version outweighed that of the applicant \u2013 and for good reason. In the circumstances of the case, there were indeed very good reasons not to take the applicant\u2019s version too uncritically, let alone at face value.",
