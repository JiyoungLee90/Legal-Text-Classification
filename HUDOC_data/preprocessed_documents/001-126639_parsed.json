Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant\u2019s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d. The complaint about the conditions of detention must be filed within six months from the end of the situation complained about or, if there was an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted, of the final decision in the process of exhaustion (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 78, 10 January 2012).",

The Court has previously examined the situation of the applicants who had been transferred from the remand prison to the correctional colony to serve their sentence and who had later returned to the same prison in connection with proceedings in a different criminal case. Their departure to the colony being definitive at the material time and their subsequent return to the same prison being a mere happenstance, the Court reached the conclusion that their transfer marked the end of the situation complained about and that the six-month period should run from the day they left the prison (see Mitrokhin, cited above, \u00a7 36, and Yartsev v. Russia (dec.), no. 13776/11, \u00a7 30, 26\u00a0March 2013). By contrast, the applicant\u2019s transfer to a medical facility was obviously of a temporary nature. Upon completion of the treatment, he was to return to the prison in which he was remanded in custody. The Court accordingly finds that two short periods of his absence from the prison had no incidence on the continuous nature of his detention. It rejects therefore the Government\u2019s argument relating to the application for the six-month rule to the earlier period of the applicant\u2019s detention.",
