Detainees were allowed to take a shower once every seven to ten days, or even once a fortnight, and then only for ten to fifteen minutes. In order to get to the shower area or investigation rooms, or to be transferred to court, detainees had to pass through an underground tunnel which had poor lighting and was flooded with sewage. The shower was dirty and the water flow could not be adjusted. The floor was flooded with dirty water, as the drainage system did not work properly. The hairdresser at the SIZO used the same hair clippers on all of the detainees, without disinfecting them. Only one pair of scissors was available for cutting their nails, and these were also not disinfected.

Before being placed in the van, the detainees were held in a small, airless and smoky preliminary reception cell. Upon returning to the detention facility, the detainees had to wait for a long time in the van before being transferred to the preliminary reception cell, where they also had to wait to be escorted to their cells. It was very cold in the prison van in winter and hot in summer. During the court hearings the applicant was not taken to the toilet.

The Government provided no details as to the exact size of the cells, but stated that an inspection carried out at some point after the complaint had been communicated to the Government had determined that each cell in the SIZO allowed each detainee at least 2.5 sq. m of personal space, which was in compliance with the relevant domestic standards. A toilet was located in the corner of each cell, separated from the living area by fixed partitions. The windows were protected by metal bars, and allowed daylight and fresh air to reach the cells.

However, they provided a description of the general transport arrangements and advised that prison vans had been in use in 2004-2007. The vans were designed to accommodate twenty-one people in three compartments (two larger ones and one designed for single occupancy). The vans had no windows, but they were equipped with ventilation grills and had metal bars integrated in the lower and upper part of the vehicle door. The Government further submitted that, on average, it took up to ten minutes to transport detainees from the SIZO to the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Poltava (a distance of 7 km), and about twenty minutes to transport them to the Kyivskiy District Court of Poltava (a distance of 10 km). The latter court was not equipped with a room for defendants, and the detainees were therefore held in the courtroom. They were able to use public toilets. At the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Poltava the detainees were kept in the rooms for defendants, which were equipped with all the necessary sanitary facilities.",

When the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3 sq. m of floor space in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises (see Mur\u0161i\u0107 v.

This presumption will normally be capable of being rebutted only if the following factors are cumulatively met: (1) the reductions in the required minimum personal space of 3 sq. m are short, occasional and minor; (2)\u00a0such reductions are accompanied by sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities; (3) the applicant is confined in what is, when viewed generally, an appropriate detention facility, and there are no other aggravating aspects of the conditions of his or her detention (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 132 and 135).",

Thereafter and until his release from the prison, the applicant was under regular medical supervision on account of those problems, and on a number of occasions underwent inpatient treatment at the neurological department of specialist prison hospitals (see paragraphs 43 and 49 above). The applicant does not seem to contest either the diagnosis or the relevance of the treatment he was prescribed following his medical examinations, but rather complains that he did not receive the prescribed medication. With regard to the latter point, the Court observes that the case file contains a number of detailed complaints which the applicant lodged before the authorities. The Government failed to comment on these allegations or provide any evidence that the treatment prescribed was always correctly administered to the applicant.",

It is, however, unclear from the available evidence what kind of treatment he had and/or needed in this respect. In particular, there is no information as to whether the CD4 cell count which the applicant was prescribed was eventually performed, what the results were, or whether he was ever prescribed and received ART. At the same time, the Court observes that it took the authorities five months to prescribe a CD4 cell count. Furthermore, the case file contains a number of the applicant\u2019s complaints to different state bodies regarding the lack of any treatment on account of his HIV, even at the HIV Treatment Facility. The Government did not comment on that evidence provided by the applicant, and the factual information provided by them was fragmentary and incomplete.",
