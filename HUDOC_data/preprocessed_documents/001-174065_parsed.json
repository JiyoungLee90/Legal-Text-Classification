Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a047-51, 29 January 2015; Andrey Medvedev v. Russia, no. 75737/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042-47, 13 September 2016; Kirillova v.

Having examined the specific conditions and procedures under which the State had alienated its assets to private individuals, the Court noted that they were within the State\u2019s exclusive competence and held that the defects in those procedures resulting in the loss by the State of its real property should not have been remedied at the expense of bona fide owners. The Court further reasoned that such restitution of property to the State or municipality, in the absence of any compensation paid to the bona fide owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

It was encumbered on the authorities to verify the legitimacy of each transaction with the flat. The Government, however, did not proffer any explanation, as to why those safeguards had not been effective in detecting fraud and protecting the City\u2019s interests. In such circumstances, the Court considers that it was not for the applicant to assume the risk of the title to the flat being revoked on account of the said omissions on the part of the authorities in procedures specially designed to prevent fraud in real-property transactions. The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors on the part of State authorities should serve to benefit the persons affected. In other words, the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova, cited above, \u00a7 49). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the flat by the first applicant and the transfer of the ownership of the flat to the City of Moscow, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on him. There has therefore been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention.",
