As long as there is some meaningful contact between families and the authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a time when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be, provided. When that stage is reached will depend, unavoidably, on the circumstances of the particular case.

The applicants were not informed of the suspension or of the transfers of the investigation between the prosecutors\u2019 offices until February 2008 (see paragraph 28 above). Thus for a period of five years the proceedings lay dormant, whereas the applicants kept lodging complaints with the authorities, trying to obtain information and expedite the proceedings (see paragraphs 26-27 above).

In January 2003 the investigation was suspended until June 2007 when the authorities obtained eyewitness evidence (see paragraph\u00a0140 above). The Court notes that there was a significant gap in the proceedings of more than four years and four months, when no steps were taken by the authorities and that the applicants did not seek information from the investigation either. However, it also notes that the investigation was resumed in February 2010 as a result of the applicants\u2019 requests, following which a number of measures were taken (see paragraphs 142-47 above).
