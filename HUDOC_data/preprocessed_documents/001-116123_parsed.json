We have already observed that the ultimate test is that of real risk of serious harm. We have not heard much evidence about enhanced risk categories, and that is not an issue we have had to consider in relation to the appellant. It was accepted by counsel for the respondent that those who could be perceived as collaborators may be considered to be in such a category. That may include teachers, local government officers and government officials. The concept of a group of people at enhanced risk of indiscriminate violence is not an immediately obvious one. The difficulty concerns the use of the word \u201cindiscriminate\u201d, but the answer is partly contained in QD and AH, which considered the \u201cindividual risk of indiscriminate violence\u201d. The way in which an enhanced risk might arise for a group can best be demonstrated by example. If, say, the Taliban wanted to make a point about teachers continuing to teach girls, it may resolve to kill a teacher. It would not be any specific teacher but one who came into their sights. A teacher is of course not a combatant and an attempt to kill the first teacher they came across could be argued to demonstrate that teachers were then at enhanced risk of indiscriminate violence. Another possible example could be disabled people. If a bomber, or sniper, were to walk into a crowded marketplace, the public may well flee. A man with only one leg would move considerably more slowly and arguably as a result would be in a higher risk group than the general public. In view of the paucity of evidence, we cannot give a list of risk categories, and certainly cannot say that any particular occupation or status puts a person into such a higher risk category. We merely record that there may be such categories, and that if a person comes within one, the degree of indiscriminate violence required to succeed may be reduced depending upon the particular facts of the case both in terms of the individual concerned, and the part of Afghanistan from which he comes. It should also be borne in mind that such a person may, depending on the facts, be entitled to refugee status rather than relying on the subsidiary protection offered by Articles 2 and 15 of the Qualification Directive. We emphasise that those examples should not be taken to indicate that teachers, or the disabled, are members of enhanced risk groups, without proof to that effect.\u201d",

He argued that the Immigration Judge had barely considered the impact of this risk upon him and, in any event, had done so without reference to most of the background evidence that he now cited (see paragraphs\u00a041-51 above).",

He argued that, in the struggle for scarce accommodation and given the length of time that he had been outside of Afghanistan, there was a real risk he would be left seriously disadvantaged and in conditions analogous to those set out in M.S.S. v.\u00a0Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, \u00a7 263, 21 January 2011. Thus he contended that he would be left living in the street, without resources or access to sanitary facilities, and without any means of providing for his essential needs. He submitted that the domestic authorities had failed to properly consider that, as a victim of an armed conflict without family members, he was plainly a member of a particularly underprivileged and vulnerable population group in need of special protection (see M.S.S, cited above, \u00a7 251). In that regard, he asserted that the Immigration Judge\u2019s statement that he \u201cwould have certain disadvantages greater than others by reason of his disability\u201d but that \u201che would not be alone\u201d because persons with such disadvantages were continuing to exist in Afghanistan (see paragraph 19 above) did not begin to properly consider the issue of his vulnerability.",

In reaching its conclusions, the Court noted that the alleged future harm would emanate not from the intentional acts or omission of public authorities or non-State bodies but from a naturally occurring illness and the lack of sufficient resources to deal with it in the receiving country. The Court also stated that Article 3 did not place an obligation on the Contracting State to alleviate disparities in the availability of medical treatment between the Contracting State and the country of origin through the provision of free and unlimited health care to all aliens without a right to stay within its jurisdiction (ibid, \u00a7\u00a044). The Court acknowledges that, in the present case, the applicant\u2019s disability cannot be considered to be a \u201cnaturally\u201d occurring illness and does not require medical treatment.

Central to the Court\u2019s conclusion was its finding that the destitution of which the applicant in that case complained was linked to his status as an asylum seeker and to the fact that his asylum application had not yet been examined by the Greek authorities. The Court was also of the opinion that, had they examined the applicant\u2019s asylum request promptly, the Greek authorities could have substantially alleviated his suffering.

By contrast, the present application concerns the living conditions and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, a , which has no such similar positive obligations under European legislation and cannot be held accountable under the Convention for failures to provide adequate welfare assistance to persons with disabilities.

In particular, there was clear and extensive evidence before the Court that the humanitarian crisis in  was predominately due to the direct and indirect actions of all parties to the conflict who had employed indiscriminate methods of warfare and had refused to permit international aid agencies to operate ( paragraph 282 of the Sufi and Elmi judgment). On the current evidence available, the Court is not able to conclude that the situation in Afghanistan, albeit very serious as a result of ongoing conflict, is comparable to that of south and central . First, unlike Somalia, which has been without a functioning central Government since 1991,  has a functioning central Government and functioning infrastructures remain in place. Second, Afghanistan, and in particular Kabul to where the applicant will be returned, remains under Government control, unlike the majority of south and central Somalia, which, since 2008, has been under the control of Islamic insurgents. Third, although UNHCR has observed that the humanitarian space in Afghanistan is declining in some areas as a result of the continuing instability (see paragraph 43 above), there remains a significant presence of international aid agencies in Afghanistan, unlike in  where international aid agencies were refused permission to operate in multiple areas. Fourth, even though the difficulties and inadequacies in the provision for persons with disabilities in Afghanistan cannot be understated, it cannot be said that such problems are as a result of the deliberate actions or omissions of the Afghan authorities rather than attributable to a lack of resources. Indeed, the evidence suggests that the Afghan authorities are taking, albeit small, steps to improve provision for disabled persons by, for example, the National Disability Action Plan 2008-2011 (see paragraph 48 above), and the provision of financial support by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, Martyrs, and the Disabled to 80,000 disabled persons in Afghanistan (see paragraph 49 above). The Court does not accept that the report of the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation (see above at paragraph 51) lends support to the applicant\u2019s claim because that report was published in 2007 and the later December 2010 UNHCR Guidelines make no similar recommendations in relation to the return of disabled persons to Afghanistan.",

This was, in reality, the crux of his application for asylum, as well as of his application before this Court (\u00a7\u00a7 56-60, and 78-80).

In this regard we point out in the first place that it is somewhat contradictory to suggest as relevant possible limited \u201cfamilial ties\u201d with his married sisters in Afghanistan, since such ties would not be accepted as relevant \u201cfamilial ties\u201d under Article 8 of the Convention had his sisters been living in the . In addition, the implication that he may be able to seek help and support from them is highly speculative as there is nothing in the case file indicating that they would be able or willing to provide him with any relevant help and support that might alleviate in a meaningful way the obvious severe hardship the applicant, as a very seriously disabled person, would face upon return to Afghanistan.",

It also needs to assess, given the general situation in the country of origin, how the person with a specific kind of disability might or might not re-settle (see, mutatis mutandis, Salah Sheekh, cited above, \u00a7 141).",

Among the \u201cvulnerable\u201d, UNHCR lists persons with medical illness or disability (physical or mental). It specifies that: \u201cIll or disabled persons who cannot work or live on their own in  should not return unless they have effective family and/or community support. ... [T]here are Afghans for which UNHCR strongly advises that, at least temporarily, solutions be identified in countries of asylum and that exemptions to obligations to return are made on humanitarian grounds\u201d (see pp. 78\u201379 of the Document). The 2009 Eligibility Guidelines continue to note that: \u201cThe traditional family and community structures of the Afghan social and tribal system constitute the main protection and coping mechanism for returning Afghan refugees... Those who may face particular difficulties upon return include ... physically and mentally disabled persons...\u201d (see p. 61). The 2009 UK Border Agency Report on Afghanistan in fact refers back to the UNHCR\u2019s 2007 report inviting States to seriously consider the need to return a person with disability to . The 2010 Eligibility Guidelines (\u00a7 41), while they do not specifically discuss difficulties faced by persons with disabilities, note a general worsening of the security situation and the increase of generalised violence in parts of Afghanistan and emphasise the importance of family and community structures for personal safety (\u00a7 44).

With the exception of provisions for access to social security (Article\u00a024(1)(b)), the 1951 Refugee Convention and its travaux pr\u00e9paratoires (UN Ad Hoc Committee 1950) provide little guidance on a disability-sensitive interpretation of refugee law and there are currently no official guidelines on this matter\u201d (see Research Paper No. 194). We would submit that in light of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which the United Kingdom ratified in 2009 (\u00a7 36), the assessment of whether return to Afghanistan of the applicant in the instant case complies with Article 3 of the Convention required a disabilitysensitive interpretation of the facts and of the application of the Court\u2019s case-law to those facts.",

We cannot agree that the Immigration Judge examined properly this claim (\u00a7\u00a7 19 and 20). The Judge drew crucial inferences from the applicant\u2019s prior stay in Afghanistan and his ability to make a journey to the . It is not clear why these negative inferences were drawn since there can also be many other different explanations as to the applicant\u2019s initial stay in  (following the injuries) and his decision to leave the country. These could be linked to his precarious state of health. In our view, and precisely because the applicant\u2019s disability and the facts surrounding it were not examined in sufficient detail, we are left to speculate on the questions that should have been properly dealt with at a national level taking into consideration the need to adopt a disability-sensitive approach in such cases.",
