It appears from an audio recording of the hearing that the applicant's lawyers insisted on being given a copy of E.S.'s depositions, while the prosecutor maintained that they had seen them. The applicant's lawyers requested that the prosecutor produce a receipt proving that they had been given the transcript and asked the prosecutor to give it to them at the hearing. At the lawyers' request, the court took a pause apparently so as to enable the prosecutor to provide them with a copy of E.S.'s depositions; however, after the pause it went straight to pronouncing its decision. The lawyers' request does not appear to have been allowed as the Court of Appeal did not refer to it at all in its judgment. It found that the first-instance court had not committed any breach of procedure. However, given that the applicant had a fixed address, did not have a criminal record and that there was no risk of his hindering the discovery of the truth, the Court of Appeal decided to release him on bail. In reaching that decision the Court of Appeal referred to the principle that an accused should always be tried at liberty and fixed the bail at MDL\u00a02,000,000.

Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or brought before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or discontinuing suspicions which provide the grounds for detention (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no.\u00a0300-A, p. 27, \u00a7 55). However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. The fact that a suspicion is held in good faith is insufficient. The words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d mean the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, pp. 16-17, \u00a7 32).",

However, they do not appear to have contained any evidence to support the theory that an offence had been committed and that the applicant may have been guilty of it. Indeed there is no mention in the above documents on how the prosecution reached the conclusion that the value of the office building in question was under-estimated or whether there was collusion between the applicant and the bank making the sale. It only referred to the existence of a witness within the criminal proceedings without however saying anything about her testimony, let alone whether that witness's testimony confirmed the accusation against the applicant. Moreover, while the applicant specifically argued during the habeas corpus proceedings that there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence imputed to him (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above), the courts appear to have ignored this submission and treated it as irrelevant (see paragraphs 13 and 16 above).",
