However, it was included in the inventory of the 6th\u00a0Armoured Brigade after the date of the incident in question. The maximum shooting range of the RPG-7 is 700\u00a0metres. The results of an investigation into the military units deployed in the region prior to the incident revealed that only one of these units had engaged in shooting practice. According to the records of that unit they had left no unexploded grenades. The rocket launcher in question is frequently used by members of the PKK terrorist organisation.

Moreover, the conditions in the region are particular: the weapon in question is frequently used and hidden by the terrorist organisation. The grenade might have been left by terrorists who attacked the barracks. It should therefore be concluded that the damage in the present case was not caused by the activities of military forces but rather by terrorist activities.

However, the events leading to the first applicant's injury and the death of the other applicants' sons are matters which must also be addressed from the angle of the adequacy of the mechanisms in place for shedding light on the course of those events. In this connection, the Court observes that criminal proceedings were promptly initiated ex officio by the Tatvan prosecutor, who conducted an on-site visit and secured the collection of forensic evidence. Subsequently, the investigation was transferred to the military public prosecutor, who heard evidence from witnesses and examined official records regarding the use of grenade launchers by the military during training at the material time. The prosecutor concluded that no fault could be attributed to the military authorities. Although, this decision was served on the applicants (see paragraphs 13 above), the applicants failed to object. They thereby deprived the authorities of the opportunity to redress any deficiencies there might have been in the course of the investigation.",

In their application the applicants claimed that Kamuran Alican had been injured and \u00c7etin Alican and Ilhami Alican killed as a result of a mine which had been placed there by the gendarmerie police station (see paragraph\u00a015 above). The Court finds that the courts dealing with the applicants' cases were indisputably empowered to assess the facts established thus far, to apportion liability for the events in issue and to deliver an enforceable decision. In the instant case, the administrative courts, after having examined the documentary evidence submitted to them, also concluded that no fault could be attributed to the military authorities and that the grenade in question might have been abandoned there by terrorists. Consequently, the domestic courts attributed compensation to the applicants solely on the basis of the \u201csocial risk\u201d doctrine\u201d, a no-fault-based principle adopted by administrative courts in Turkey when awarding compensation to those who suffer damage as a result of terrorist acts, or in the fight against terrorism, without establishing the identity of those responsible for the incident. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicants, who were represented by lawyers and who had the opportunity to participate actively in the proceedings and to avail themselves of their procedural rights to influence their course, chose not to appeal against the decisions of the firstinstance courts to oppose their factual or legal findings.",

It finds, having regard to the fact that during that time the first-instance court merely asked for the production of documents from various authorities and twice sought experts' report without having to hold hearings, hear witnesses or conduct on-site inspections, such durations to have been unreasonable. Moreover, as regards the proceedings initiated by the first and third applicants, the Court cannot overlook the fact that an additional lengthy period - three years - elapsed between the date of the decision of the  and the date of the 's determination of the Ministry's appeal against that decision. Such delays, when account is taken of the high rate of inflation in  at the time of the events, undoubtedly caused a significant depreciation in the value of the amounts asked by the applicants and in those subsequently awarded by the domestic courts. Reiterating that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each requirement of that provision, including the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, Frydlender, \u00a7 43, cited above), the Court finds that, in the absence of any convincing explanation from the Government, the above proceedings in the instant case were unnecessarily prolonged, as the national courts failed to act with the necessary diligence.",
