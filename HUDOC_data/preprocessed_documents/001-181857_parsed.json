The applicant believed that this right had to be protected not only in theory but also in practice. He argued that by limiting, in law, the possibility of bringing a challenge to fatherhood to one year after the child\u2019s birth or the date of learning thereof, the legislator had deprived of protection any individuals who, like and including the applicant, happened to learn about the biological reality after the expiry of that one year period.

That law pursued the legitimate aim of ensuring the legal certainty of the origin and civil registration of individuals, together with the aim of protecting the rights of children, who were the most vulnerable persons in family relationships. The law provided legally presumed fathers with a procedural guarantee for the exercise of their right to private life by allowing them to challenge the legally established reality within one year from learning about the child\u2019s birth. The limitation in law of one year in which to bring such a challenge to paternity was a reasonable solution which accounted for the different interests involved by providing a fair balance between the need to establish biological reality and the need to protect the stability of already confirmed civil origin.",

He continued to live with the mother and the child as a family for about three years after the child\u2019s birth and before he and the mother divorced.

When the applicant challenged his paternity, the domestic courts dismissed his claim, finding that it had been submitted after expiry of the time-limit under the law (see paragraph 8 above).",

The Court has previously found that the establishment of inflexible time limits is likely to run counter to the importance of the private life interest at stake (see A.L., cited above, \u00a7\u00a071). Thus, in several cases it has found a violation of Article 8 as a result of the impossibility, due to the application of strict time-limits running as from the birth of the child, to contest paternity where the applicants had learned about the circumstances supporting their claims \u2212 or had obtained relevant scientific evidence \u2212 only after the expiry of this time limit (see Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 112\u2013114, and Tavl\u0131 v.

In particular, in those cases the applicants\u2019 claims, or the claims brought in their interest, were rejected by the relevant national authorities after consideration of their factual circumstances and following a balancing exercise which, however succinct, accounted for the different interests involved paying particular attention to the needs of the child (see, in particular, Kriszti\u00e1n Barnab\u00e1s T\u00f3th, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33\u201337, and A.L., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 75\u201378). In other cases the Court has found that rejections of the applicants\u2019 paternity-related claims did not breach the required fair balance under Article 8 of the Convention because they had been based on considerations such as the child having the benefit of previously established origin, the need to preserve stability and continuity in the children\u2019s relationships where there was an established social reality in which they thrived, or the fact that granting such requests would not have been in the child\u2019s best interests for other reasons (see Kautzor, cited above, \u00a7 77; Ahrens, cited above, \u00a7 74; Marinis v.\u00a0Greece, no. 3004/10, \u00a7 77, 9 October 2014, and Nylund v. Finland (dec.), no. 27110/95, ECHR 1999VI). In all these cases the Court noted that the father\u2019s inability to have his paternity claim examined on the merits was not absolute and that the domestic law envisaged situations in which such claims were allowed, for example when the legal presumption did not correspond to the established social and family reality. Importantly, the Court also considered relevant in those cases that the decision-making process comprised elements such as a detailed examination of the factual circumstances by the competent authorities, a consideration of the different interests involved, keeping in mind the higher interest of the child, and the question of whether the applicant had been given an opportunity to present his personal situation and position (see L.D. and P.K. v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a07949/11 and 45522/13, \u00a7 63 with further references, 8 December 2016).",
