The Hague Convention recognises this fact because it provides for a range of measures to ensure the prompt return of children removed to or wrongfully retained in any Contracting State. Article 11 of the Hague Convention requires the judicial or administrative authorities concerned to act expeditiously to ensure the return of children, and any failure to act for more than six weeks may give rise to a request for explanations (see Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a0140, ECHR 2010). In proceedings under the EU Regulation on Recognition of Judgments (see paragraph 49 above) this is likewise so, as Article 11 \u00a7 3 requires the judicial authorities concerned to act expeditiously, using the most prompt procedures available in domestic law, and to issue a judgment no later than six weeks after the application is lodged (see Shaw v. Hungary, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 66, 26 July 2011).",

Even if the domestic legal order does not allow for effective sanctions, the Court considers that each Contracting State must equip itself with an adequate and sufficient legal arsenal to ensure compliance with the positive obligations imposed on it by Article 8 of the Convention and the other international agreements that it has chosen to ratify (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 108).",

The Court notes that since 2012 K.S. has been in hiding with the child. It appears, therefore, that in order to make it possible for the applicant to maintain family ties with his child, the domestic authorities were required in the first place to establish the whereabouts of K.S.",

As regards the alleged lack of measures for establishing the whereabouts of K.S., the Court notes that the bailiff visited the presumed places of residence of K.S. and K.S.\u2019s mother on several occasions, but did not find her there (see paragraphs 22, 23, 27, 28, 35 and 38 above). It was further established that K.S. had not been receiving her correspondence. The Court notes, however, no further steps were taken in order to locate K.S. and her daughter elsewhere. In this respect, it is worth noting that it was not until October 2016 that the child\u2019s pediatrician and K.S.\u2019s relatives were questioned by the Court about K.S.\u2019s whereabouts (see paragraphs 40 and 42 above). In particular, the pediatrician told the Mez\u0151t\u00far District Court that she had issued a medical certificate for the child\u2019s enrolment in kindergarten. In the Court\u2019s view, this shows that the child was probably registered in the school system and could easily have been located by the domestic authorities had they diligently tried to enforce the relevant court decisions.",

Without overlooking that the enforcement proceedings have to protect the rights of all those involved, with the interests of the child being of paramount importance, the Court reiterates that the lapse of time risks compromising the position of the non-resident parent irretrievably, and, as long as the return decision remains in force, the presumption stands that return is also in the interests of the child (see, for instance, M.A. v.\u00a0Austria, \u00a7 136, and Severe v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a053661/15, \u00a7 110, 21\u00a0September 2017; all cited above).",

It is true that the authorities took some other measures, including the organisation of mediation proceedings by the Ministry of Justice (see paragraph 24 above) and the institution of criminal proceedings against the mother. However, these measures proved to be ineffective or not sufficiently prompt, resulting in a situation wherein the applicant had been, until at least February 2018 (see paragraphs 46 and 72 above), still not able to see his daughter.",
