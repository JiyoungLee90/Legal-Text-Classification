The Krasnodar Regional Court was thus called upon to make an assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence within the scope of the grounds of appeal.

In so far as the Government argued that it had been for the applicant to seek leave for his counsel to appear before the appeal court, the Court notes that, apart from the fact that the Government did not point to any legal provision which supported their reading of the applicant\u2019s obligation, it has already held on a number of occasions that the effectiveness of the guarantee of legal representation by default contained in Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be undermined without a corresponding obligation on the part of the courts to verify in each individual case whether it is lawful to proceed with a hearing in the absence of legal counsel for the accused (see Grigoryevskikh v.\u00a0Russia, no. 22/03, \u00a7 90, 9 April 2009).",
