Regardless of this fact, the proceedings continued for approximately four years. Admittedly, the Court notes that the proceedings were prolonged partly because of the failure of some of the accused, in particular those who were remanded in custody, to appear before the court. However, reiterating that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of the requirements of that provision including the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see\u00a0Arvelakis v. , no. 41354/98, \u00a7\u00a026, 12\u00a0April 2001), the Court considers that the domestic court could have applied stricter measures to speed up the proceedings. Neither the complexity of the case nor the conduct of the defendants is sufficient to explain the delay in which the case was processed by the first-instance court. Therefore, the Court considers the delay must be considered to be attributable to the domestic court's handling of the proceedings.",
