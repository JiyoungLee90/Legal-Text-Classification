The case originated in an application (no. 12300/12) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovak national, Mr Vojtech Keszeli (“the applicant”), on 23 February 2012.
The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Pirošíková.
On 17 September 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government submitted a unilateral declaration on 4 December 2012. The Court found that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it did not offer a sufficient basis for concluding that respect for human rights no longer required examination of the case within the meaning of Article 37 § 1 Convention. The Court was therefore required to continue the examination of the admissibility and merits of the case.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Šaľa.
On 31 May 1994 the applicant claimed a sum of money from a bank.
On 16 September 2005 the applicant lodged an application before the Court challenging the length of these proceedings. On 22 May 2007 the Court decided to strike that case (application no. 34161/05) out of its list of cases on the ground that a friendly settlement had been reached between the parties.
In the proceedings complained of the Supreme Court’s decision of 30 April 2007 to dismiss the applicant’s appeal, examined as an appeal on points of law, became final on 11 June 2007.
On 27 January 2010 the above decision was quashed by the Constitutional Court and the case was remitted to the Supreme Court for reexamination.
On 23 September 2010 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint challenging the length of the proceedings.
On 7 June 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the first-instance judgment. Upon the applicant’s appeal on points of law the cassation chamber of the Supreme Court quashed that decision on 25 April 2013.
On 19 June 2014 the Supreme Court again dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the first-instance judgment. The applicant indicated that he intended to lodge an appeal on points of law after the service of the Supreme Court’s decision.
