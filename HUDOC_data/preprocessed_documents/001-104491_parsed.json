The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Hentrich v. France, 22 September 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0296-A, and Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports 1996-II). Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. To hold otherwise would mean duplicating the domestic process with proceedings before the Court, which would hardly be compatible with the subsidiary nature of the Convention (see Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a074012/01, \u00a7 42, 6 November 2008). Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires only that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his or her Convention grievances (see Balogh v. Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7\u00a030, 20\u00a0July 2004, and John Sammut and Visa Investments Limited v. Malta (dec.), no. 27023/03, 28 June 2005).",

Slovakia, no.\u00a056195/00, \u00a7\u00a043, 5 July 2005). Indeed, where an applicant has a choice of remedies and their comparative effectiveness is not obvious, the Court interprets the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies in the applicant's favour (see Budayeva and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a015339/02, 21166/02, 20058/02, 11673/02 and 15343/02, \u00a7\u00a0110, ECHR\u00a02008-... (extracts), and the cases cited therein). Once the applicant has used such a remedy, he or she cannot also be required to have tried others that were available but probably no more likely to be successful (see Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7\u00a056, 12\u00a0April 2007, and the cases cited therein).",
