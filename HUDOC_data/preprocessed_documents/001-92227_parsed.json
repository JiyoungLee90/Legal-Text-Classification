They further asserted that, on two or three occasions each, the applicant and the Fund had failed to appear before the domestic courts. In their view, the applicant had also contributed to the overall length of proceedings by modifying his claims, requesting forensic examinations and appealing against the courts\u2019 decisions.

It further observes that normally the applicants are not called on to be legally represented in the cases like the present one and therefore their legal expenses are not reimbursed. Although the applicant in the instant case was not officially represented by anyone, the Court takes the view that it would be unfair to expect him to conduct his case himself and without legal advice, given the state of his health.
