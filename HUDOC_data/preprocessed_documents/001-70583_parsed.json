Italy, no. 32190/96, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2003IX). In Luordo the Court found such an obligation, imposed on the applicant for the duration of the bankruptcy proceedings, disproportionate because of the length of the proceedings, in that case 14 years and 8 months, even though there had been no indication that the applicant had wished to leave his place of residence or that such permission had ever been refused. This pattern was followed in subsequent cases, where the duration of an obligation not to leave one's place of residence varied between 13 years and 6 months (see Goffi v. Italy, no. 55984/00, \u00a7\u00a020, 24 March 2005) and 24\u00a0years and 5\u00a0months (see Bassani v. Italy, no. 47778/99, \u00a7 24, 11 December 2003).",

The letter merely states that on the relevant dates the second applicant had been summoned to the Prosecutor's Office.
