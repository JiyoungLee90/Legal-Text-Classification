In particular, not only was that judgment based on H.B.\u2019s claim concerning the second flat but the reasoning part of the judgment itself made reference to the flat measuring 46.3 sq. m., that is the second flat (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).

As a result, on the one hand the judgment of 22 April 2009 recognising the unlawfulness of the expropriation of the first flat remained in force but on the other hand, the Court of Appeal, without providing any further reasoning, stated that the questions relating to the lawfulness of the expropriation of the first flat had already been determined in the final and binding judgments of 29 December 2007 and 26\u00a0May 2008 which, as already mentioned above, concerned the expropriation of different property, namely the second flat owned by the applicant and her daughters in the same building.

Instead, the Government submitted a \u201cSpecialist opinion\u201d issued by a specialist commission acting under the authority of the State Real Estate Registry which pointed out several shortcomings in the relevant report, namely as to non-compliance with relevant standards applicable in real estate valuation activity. In its opinion, however, the commission did not indicate that the shortcomings in question had rendered the report invalid nor did it question the final value determined therein. In those circumstances, and having regard to the information available to it on purchase prices on the Armenian property market during the relevant period, the Court sees no reason to question the accuracy of the market value as determined in the expert report produced by the applicant.",
