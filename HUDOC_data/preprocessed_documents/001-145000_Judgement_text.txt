The case originated in four applications (nos. 48357/07, 52677/0/07, 52687/07 and 52701/07) against the Italian Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) in 2007 by four firms with registred addresses in Italy (see Annex for details).
The applicant companies were represented by Ms Alessandra Mari, a lawyer practising in Rome. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent Ms Ersiliagrazia Spatafora and their Co-Agent, Ms Paola Accardo.
The applicant companies alleged that they had suffered a violation of Article 6 § 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a result of legislative intervention in pending proceedings.
On 11 October 2012 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants are agricultural firms operating in northern and/or disadvantaged areas in Italy as defined in the relevant Italian laws.
In the 1980s the Italian legislator instituted a series of norms to favour economic activity in general and, more specifically, agricultural activity.
More precisely, Article 1(6) of Law no. 48 of 1988 (Legislative Decree no. 536 of 30 December 1987) (see “Relevant domestic law”, below) provided a concession (fiscalizzazione), namely, that as of 1 January 1987 the State would bear a portion of the contributions paid by employers in the agricultural sector for the purposes of Article 31(1) of Law no. 41/48 in respect of each employee.
Furthermore, Article 9(5) of Law No. 67 of 1988 (Legge finanziaria 1988) (see “Relevant domestic law” below) introduced a system of exemptions (sgravi contributivi) in respect of payments for the purposes of premiums and contributions related to welfare and assistance. Such payments were due in the measure of 15% (later 30%) by employers in the agricultural sector in northern regions and 40% (later 60%) by employers in the agricultural sector working in disadvantaged agricultural zones in the south of Italy.
According to the applicant companies, Article 9(6) of Law No. 67 of 1988 (see “Relevant domestic law” below) indicated that the latter benefit was not alternative to the one provided for by Law no. 48 of 1988. That sub-article specified that for the purposes of the calculation of the exemption mentioned above, the concession was not to be taken into account. This, they considered, was also clear from the explanatory memorandum (scheda di lettura) to the law (see “Relevant domestic law” below).
Following further normative changes between 1988 and 1996, the burden to be taken over by the State amounted to the following:
a)  85,000 Italian lire (approximately 44 euros (EUR)) per employee for twelve monthly salaries;
b)  a global 5.62 percentage points for exemptions in respect of contributions for the purposes of TBC (Tuberculosis), ENAOLI (Orphans of Italian Employees) and the SSN (National Health Service);
c)  a global 4.92 percentage points for exemptions regarding the said contributions in respect of labourers and 5.02 percentage points for employees and directors, as from 1 June 1996.
Despite the law, by circular no. 160 of 18 July 1988 the Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (“INPS”), an Italian welfare entity, considered that the two benefits (concession and exemption) could not be accumulated and had to be considered as alternative.
In fact, the applicant companies benefited only from the exemption (sgravi contributivi) and not from the concession (fiscalizzazione). They considered that this interpretation was contrary to what was provided for in the law.
Indeed, from as early as 1994 a number of agricultural firms (in particular Floramiata Spa) instituted proceedings (following administrative refusals) complaining about the matter, and consistent case-law in favour of the agricultural firms was established by the Italian courts, including the Court of Cassation. The applicant companies submitted that between 1997 and 2003 more than twenty-five first-instance judgments and more than five appeal judgments on the same subject matter had been delivered, together with two Court of Cassation judgments (see “Relevant domestic law and practice”, below) finding in favour of the agricultural firms.
In this light, in 2000/2002 the applicant companies instituted proceedings as explained below. Pending these judicial proceedings Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003 (hereinafter Law no. 326/03) was enacted (see “Relevant domestic law” below), providing that the benefits could not be accumulated.
By judgment no. 274 of 7 July 2006 the Constitutional Court considered that Law no. 326/03 was legitimate and not unconstitutional (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below).
On 7 November 2000 the applicant company requested the INPS to return the monies which it had held contrary to what was provided for by law when it failed to apply the concession in its respect, for the period between 1 April 1990 and 31 December 1997, amounting to 173,738,951 Italian lire (approximately EUR 90,000) plus interest and subject to revaluation.
The INPS’s failure to reply amounting to an implicit rejection (silenzio-rifiuto), on 26 June 2001 the applicant company instituted an administrative procedure before the INPS. The latter again failed to reply.
Thus, on 4 January 2002 the applicant company instituted judicial proceedings to recover the monies due (as mentioned above) for the period not covered by prescription (2000 onwards).
By a judgment (no. 56/2003) of 13 February 2003 the Bergamo Tribunal found in favour of the applicant company. Considering that the two benefits could be accumulated and that the applicant company had paid the relevant dues, it ordered the INPS to pay back the misappropriated sums (from 2000 onwards), with interest and subject to revaluation, and to pay its share of the costs of the proceedings.
By a judgment (no. 276/03) of 25 September 2003 filed in the relevant registry on 4 November 2003 the Brescia Court of Appeal dismissed the INPS’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment.
Following the entry into force of Law no. 326/03 the INPS appealed to the Court of Cassation.
The applicant company cross-appealed, arguing that the application of Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003 to its case would amount to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and a violation of the Italian Constitution in so far as it obliged the State to abide by the European Convention, a matter which had not been considered at all by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 7 July 2006.
By a judgment (no. 10110/07) filed in the relevant registry on 2 May 2007 the INPS’s appeal was allowed by the Court of Cassation on the basis of Law no. 326/03. The remaining grounds of appeal were dismissed on the basis that Law no. 326/03 had an authentic interpretative nature and was therefore only apparently retroactive, it having now been given the original intended meaning of the law. Indeed, as a thorough examination of the relevant laws revealed, the benefits at issue could not be awarded cumulatively; rather, one had to identify the most favourable benefits to a firm according to its specific position. Furthermore, the State had legitimate discretion to decide whether benefits could be granted cumulatively or not, thus no issue relating to a fair trial could be considered to arise. Each party was to bear its own costs for the entire proceedings.
On 9 July 2001 and again on 29 January 2002 the applicant company requested the INPS to return the monies which it had witheld contrary to what was provided for by law when it failed to apply the concession in its respect, for the period between 1 April 1990 and 31 December 1997, amounting to 413,928,856 Italian lire (approximately EUR 213,776) plus interest and subject to revaluation.
The INPS’s failure to reply amounting to an implicit rejection (silenzio-rifiuto), on 7 June 2002 the applicant company instituted an administrative procedure before the INPS. The latter again failed to reply.
Thus, on 11 June 2002 the applicant company instituted judicial proceedings to recover the monies due (as mentioned above) for the period not covered by prescription.
By a judgment (no. 58/2003) of 13 February 2003 the Bergamo Tribunal found in favour of the applicant company. Holding that the two benefits could be accumulated and that the applicant had paid the relevant dues, it ordered the INPS to pay back the misappropriated sums (from 2001 onwards, the date on which prescription was interrupted), with interest and subject to revaluation, and to pay its share of the costs of the proceedings.
By a judgment (no. 277/03) of 25 September 2003 filed in the relevant registry on 4 November 2003 the Brescia Court of Appeal dismissed the INPS’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment.
Following the entry into force of Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003 the INPS appealed to the Court of Cassation.
The applicant company cross-appealed along the lines mentioned above.
By a judgment (no. 12863/07) filed in the relevant registry on 1 June 2007 the INPS’s appeal was allowed by the Court of Cassation on the basis of Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003. The remaining grounds of appeal were dismissed for the same reasons outlined above. Each party was to bear its own costs for the entire proceedings.
On 14 and 30 July 1999 the applicant company requested the INPS to return the monies which it had withheld contrary to what was provided for by law when it failed to apply the concession in its respect, for the period between 1 January 1989 and 31 December 1997, amounting to 210,609,000 Italian lire (approximately EUR 108,770) plus interest and subject to revaluation.
The INPS failed to reply.
Thus, on 25 January 2000 the applicant company instituted judicial proceedings to recover the monies due (as mentioned above) for the period not covered by prescription.
By a judgment (no. 8/2001) of 3 April 2001 the Siena Tribunal found in favour of the applicant company. Considering that the two benefits could be accumulated and that the applicant had paid the relevant dues, it ordered the INPS to pay back the misappropriated sums, with interest and revaluation (from 1999, the date of its administrative claim, onwards), together with the full costs of the proceedings.
By a judgment (no. 249/02) of 16 April 2002 filed in the relevant registry on 24 April 2002 the Florence Court of Appeal dismissed the INPS’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment.
Following the entry into force of Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003 the INPS appealed to the Court of Cassation.
The applicant company cross-appealed along the lines mentioned above.
By a judgment (no. 13291/07) filed in the relevant registry on 7 June 2007 the INPS’s appeal was allowed by the Court of Cassation on the basis of Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003. The remaining grounds of appeal were dismissed for the same reasons outlined above. Each party was to bear its own costs for the entire proceedings.
On 10 December 2001 the applicant company requested the INPS to return the monies which it had withheld contrary to what was provided for by law when it failed to apply the concession in its respect, for the period between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1997, amounting to 163,373,972 Italian lire (approximately EUR 84,375) plus interest and revaluation.
The INPS’s failure to reply amounting to an implicit rejection (silenzio-rifiuto), on 15 May 2002 the applicant company instituted an administrative procedure before the INPS. The latter again failed to reply.
Thus, on 11 September 2002 the applicant company instituted judicial proceedings to recover the monies due (as mentioned above) for the period not covered by prescription (2001 onwards).
By a judgment (no. 57/2003) of 13 February 2003 the Bergamo Tribunal found in favour of the applicant company. Considering that the two benefits could be accumulated and that the applicant had paid the relevant dues, it ordered the INPS to pay back the misappropriated sums, with interest and subject to revaluation (from 2001 onwards), and to pay its share of the costs of the proceedings.
By a judgment (no. 278/03) of 25 September 2003 filed in the relevant registry on 4 November 2003 the Brescia Court of Appeal dismissed the INPS’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment.
Following the entry into force of Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003 the INPS appealed to the Court of Cassation.
The applicant company cross-appealed along the lines mentioned above.
By a judgment (no. 12864/07) filed in the relevant registry on 1 June 2007 the INPS’s appeal was allowed by the Court of Cassation on the basis of Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003. The remaining grounds of appeal were dismissed for the same reasons outlined above. Each party was to bear its own costs for the entire proceedings.
Article 1(6) of Law no. 48 of 1988 (Legislative Decree no. 536 of 30 December 1987) reads as follows:
“A reduction of contributions for the purposes of Article 31 sub-article 1 of Law no. 41/48, of Lire 133.000 per employee, is granted to employers in the agricultural sector to run from 1 January 1987 throughout the salary period up to 30 November 1988, for every monthly payment up to the twelfth month included. Such a reduction does not apply to employers in the agricultural sector who operate in the territories mentioned in Article 1 of the laws on interventions in the South of Italy (il Mezzogiorno) (testo unico) approved by Decree no. 218 of the President of the Republic of 6 March 1978.”
Article 9(5) and (6) of Law No. 67 of 1988 (legge finanziaria 1988) read as follows:
“(5) As from 1 January 1988, premiums and contributions related to welfare and assistance in respect of employees, whether on indeterminate or determinate duration contracts, are due in the measure of 15% by their employers in the agricultural sector in Northern regions in accordance with Article 9 of Decree no. 601 of the President of the Republic of 29 September 1973. The said premiums and contributions are due in the measure of 40% by employers in the agricultural sector operating in disadvantaged agricultural zones as defined in Article 15 of Law no. 984 of 1977 and in the measure of 20% by employers in the agricultural sector operating in disadvantaged agricultural zones as defined in Article 1 of the laws on interventions in the South of Italy (il Mezzogiorno) (testo unico) approved by Decree no. 218 of the President of the Republic of 6 March 1978.
(6) For the purposes of the calculation of the exemption mentioned in sub-article 5, the concession (fiscalizzazione) provided for in Article 1 sub-articles 5 and 6 of Legislative Decree no. 536 of 30 December 1987 as modified by Law no. 48 of 1988, is not to be taken into account.”
According to the explanatory memorandum (scheda di lettura) in respect of sub-article 6, the amount of premiums and contributions due is arrived at by, firstly, calculating the percentage of exemption applicable according to the different rates provided by sub-article 5 of the text and subsequently subtracting the share, per head, of the concession and percentage established in sub-articles 5 and 6 of Article 1 of Legislative Decree 536/1987.
Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003, entitled Urgent dispositions to favour development and to adjust the trend in public finances, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:
“Article 9 sub-article 6 of Law No. 67 of 1988 together with any subsequent modifications, must be interpreted to the effect that the exemption referred to in its sub-article 5 (...) cannot be accumulated with the benefits provided for in (...) Law no. 48 of 1988.”
According to the travaux préparatoires the law provided an authentic interpretation of the non-cumulability of the two benefits, in relation to which a significant number of proceedings had been instituted, with the courts taking the opposite view than that taken and applied in practice by the INPS. Thus, the norm was intended to avoid greater burdens than those which had been borne in previous years.
The Court of Cassation held that the two benefits (concessions and exemptions) were not incompatible. They had been provided for by different laws and had different aims. Thus, if a firm fulfilled the requirements to be eligible for both benefits, they could not be denied. It considered that the INPS had not submitted any relevant arguments, save for a reiteration of the text of the impugned law. According to the Court of Cassation, by means of Article 9(6) of Law No. 67 of 1988, the legislator had wished to specify that the exemption was to be applied to the entire rate and not to the rate resulting after concession, thus excluding the incompatibility of the two benefits and presupposing the enjoyment of both contemporaneously. The Court of Cassation noted that when the legislator had wished to exclude the application of the concession to employers operating in the South, it had specifically done so (as in Legislative decree no. 536 of 1987). However, the legislator had made no mention of employers operating in disadvantaged areas in the North.
The Court of Cassation reiterated its finding in judgment no. 14227/00 of 27 October 2000 (above), considering that there was no reason to depart from those conclusions. Moreover, it noted that the theory that, in general, benefits could not be granted cumulatively had been proved false even by Article 68 of Legislative Decree No. 388 of 2000, which explicitly mentioned that certain benefits could not be granted cumulatively. Had it been a general principle no explicit statement by the legislator would have been required.
The Constitutional Court noted that the legislator had intervened due to the uncertainty created by a well-established administrative practice and supervening case-law to the contrary ten years later. It considered that it was not necessary to verify whether the enacted law had been interpretative (thus retroactive) or innovative with retroactive effect. Indeed, the prohibition on applying laws retroactively was a constitutional norm only applicable to the criminal sphere. It considered that the legislator could enact both laws of authentic interpretation – which clarify and determine the extent of the original norm within the content of what was originally plausibly provided – and innovative ones with retroactive effect in so far as such retroactivity was reasonably justified and not in conflict with other values and interests protected by the Constitution. The Constitutional Court noted that a law of authentic interpretation could not be unreasonable in so far as it was limited to assigning to the provision to be interpreted a meaning which was already therein contained and which was one of the possible meanings of the original text. Indeed, in the present case, the prohibition on applying the benefits cumulatively had been one of the possible interpretations of Article 9(6) of Law No. 67 of 1988 which had immediately been contested by the INPS but which ten years later had been given another, indeed possible, meaning by the Court of Cassation. Given this state of uncertainty, the impugned law of authentic interpretation could not be considered unreasonable.
In this judgment the domestic court was again faced with the interpretation of the laws concerning the cumulability of benefits, the constitutionality of Law no. 326/2003 and the subsequent implications under Article 6 of the Convention.
Confirming the interpretative nature of Law no. 326/2003, it considered that even if the law were ignored, the interpretation (of the relevant provisions) which conformed to the ratio legis was that of the non-cumulability of the benefits at issue. While it was true that the court had twice considered that benefits could be applied cumulatively if i) they were provided to see to different needs and ii) if the law did not expressly prohibit such accumulation, in the present case the reasons justifying the relevant reductions overlapped in part. This was evident from the object, function and method of calculation of the benefits at issue. Thus, had they been intended to be cumulative, it would have had to be expressly provided for in law or authorised. The fact that the benefits at issue were not cumulable was further confirmed by an assessment of the entire legal framework concerning the subject matter, including, for example, other benefits available to the agricultural sector in general. It followed that the enactment of Law no. 326/2003 had no bearing on the interpretation of the provisions, and thus had no effects which were incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention.
