The applicants complied with that request and submitted their application form to the Court on 15 April 2011 and not, as maintained by the Government, on 27\u00a0April 2011. Noting that the applicants submitted their application form to the Court before 2 May 2011, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s arguments that the date of application should be 27 April 2011. The Court therefore considers that the application was lodged on 18 October 2010 and that the applicants have complied with the six-month rule under Article 35\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Convention. It thus dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.",

The use of force, however, must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of any of the purposes set out in subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c). In this respect the use of the term \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d in Article 2 \u00a7 2 indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraph 2 of Articles 8-11 of the Convention. In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in the subparagraphs of the Article (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0148149, Series A no. 324).",

The Court will therefore examine whether the Government have discharged their burden of justifying the killing. In doing so, it will have particular regard to the investigation carried out at the domestic level in order to establish whether that investigation was effective, in the sense that it was capable of leading to the determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances (see G\u00fclbahar\u00a0\u00d6zer and Others v. Turkey, no. 44125/06, \u00a7 59, 2 July 2013). In this connection the Court reiterates that in cases such as the present one where the respondent Government bear the burden of justifying a killing, the examination of the steps taken in an investigation does not only serve the purpose of assessing whether the investigation was in compliance with the requirements of the procedural obligation, but also, as set out above, of deciding whether it was capable of leading to the establishment of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances and whether the Government have thus satisfactorily discharged their burden to justify the killing (see Cang\u00f6z and Others v. Turkey, no. 7469/06, \u00a7 115, 26\u00a0April 2016; for a summary of the principles of an effective investigation, see Mustafa\u00a0Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v.

This meant that no assessment was made at the national level as to whether or not the use of force had been absolutely necessary and strictly proportionate and whether it had been in compliance with the applicable national legislation concerning the use of force by law enforcement officials. As there are no decisions taken at the national level by any investigating authority to lend support to the Government\u2019s submissions, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s arguments that the use of force was justified.",

In the opinion of the Court, the lack of an official investigation entailed the result that the evidence collected was not examined by any investigating authority and its probative value was not assessed. In this connection, although the lack of an investigation makes it unnecessary to highlight any specific failures, the Court cannot but remark on the complete failure to identify and question the soldiers who killed the applicants\u2019 relative and it reiterates that one of the common features of investigations conducted by prosecutors in Turkey into killings by members of the security forces is the failure to question the perpetrators in a timely manner or to question them at all (see, most recently, Cang\u00f6z and Others, cited above, \u00a7 127).",
