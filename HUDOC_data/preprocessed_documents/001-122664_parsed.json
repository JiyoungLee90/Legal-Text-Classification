The judgment records the Secretary of State\u2019s policy statement of 10 November 1997, in which the Secretary of State indicated that he was open to the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances, including for example, exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in custody, a review and reduction of the tariff may be appropriate.

This is implicit in the fact that no issue under Article 3 appears to arise provided that there is, in law and in practice, a possibility of the offender being released, even though it remains possible, or even likely, that no release will be granted in his lifetime.

If, despite this, he will remain imprisoned for the rest of his life it is at least arguable that this is inhuman treatment.

Is there some maximum term of imprisonment that can be justified by the objects of punishment and deterrence, after which a prisoner ought to be released if rehabilitation has transformed him into a man who no longer poses a threat of criminal behaviour? If this question falls to be answered in the affirmative, then an irreducible life sentence that may result in detention beyond that term is arguably inhuman and raises an issue under Article 3. The concurring opinion of Judge Bratza and the opinion of the five dissentients suggest that they were of the view that this was indeed the position. The European material to which we have referred suggests that some Member States consider that there is a maximum sentence of imprisonment that can be justified by way of punishment, after which humanity requires that the offender be given the opportunity to demonstrate that he is fit to be permitted back into society.",

Yet a prisoner\u2019s incarceration without hope of release is in many respects in like case to a sentence of death. He can never atone for his offence. However he may use his incarceration as time for amendment of life, his punishment is only exhausted by his last breath. Like the death sentence the whole-life tariff is lex talionis. But its notional or actual symmetry with the crime for which it is visited on the prisoner (the only virtue of the lex talionis) is a poor guarantee of proportionate punishment, for the whole-life tariff is arbitrary: it may be measured in days or decades according to how long the prisoner has to live. It is therefore liable to be disproportionate \u2013 the very vice which is condemned on Article\u00a03 grounds \u2013 unless, of course, the death penalty\u2019s logic applies: the crime is so heinous it can never be atoned for.

The Judicial Committee of Privy Council considered the Court\u2019s judgment in Kafkaris, cited above, and found that the safeguards available in Cyprus to prevent Kafkaris from being without hope of release were not available in . The Mauritian Supreme Court had interpreted such a sentence as condemning de Boucherville to penal servitude for the rest of his life, a sentence to which the provisions of the relevant legislation on parole and remission did not apply. In the view of the Privy Council, this meant the sentence was manifestly disproportionate and arbitrary and so contrary to section 10 of the Mauritian Constitution (provisions to secure protection of law, including the right to a fair trial).",

It did, however, find that the safeguards available in Cyprus (in the form of the AttorneyGeneral\u2019s powers to recommend release and the President\u2019s powers to commute sentences or decree release) were not available in Mauritius.

Indeed, in the Government\u2019s submission, it might never arise. For this reason, the Convention did not require a review mechanism for life sentences. A review mechanism would be directed at offering only a tenuous hope of release. The tenuous nature of that hope arose from the fact that a whole life order was imposed to punish the offender for the exceptional gravity of his or her crime, and the gravity of that crime remained constant over time. Article 3 did not require a procedure offering such a tenuous hope. Instead, it required that a prisoner\u2019s Convention rights be vindicated if time ever came when continued detention was incompatible with Article 3.

This is because States have a duty under the Convention to take measures for the protection of the public from violent crime and the Convention does not prohibit States from subjecting a person convicted of a serious crime to an indeterminate sentence allowing for the offender\u2019s continued detention where necessary for the protection of the public (see, mutatis mutandis, T. v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 97, and V.\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, \u00a7 98, both cited above). Indeed, preventing a criminal from re-offending is one of the \u201cessential functions\u201d of a prison sentence (see Mastromatteo v.  [GC], no. 37703/97, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2002VIII; Maiorano and Others v. , no. 28634/06, \u00a7 108, 15\u00a0December 2009; and, mutatis mutandis, Choreftakis and Choreftaki v.\u00a0Greece, no. 46846/08, \u00a7 45, 17 January 2012). This is particularly so for those convicted of murder or other serious offences against the person. The mere fact that such prisoners may have already served a long period of imprisonment does not weaken the State\u2019s positive obligation to protect the public; States may fulfil that obligation by continuing to detain such life sentenced prisoners for as long as they remain dangerous (see, for instance, Maiorano and Others, cited above).",

Many of these grounds will be present at the time when a life sentence is imposed. However, the balance between these justifications for detention is not necessarily static and may shift in the course of the sentence. What may be the primary justification for detention at the start of the sentence may not be so after a lengthy period into the service of the sentence. It is only by carrying out a review of the justification for continued detention at an appropriate point in the sentence that these factors or shifts can be properly evaluated.",

If anything, the punishment becomes greater with time: the longer the prisoner lives, the longer his sentence. Thus, even when a whole life sentence is condign punishment at the time of its imposition, with the passage of time it becomes \u2013 to paraphrase Lord Justice Laws in  \u2013 a poor guarantee of just and proportionate punishment (see paragraph 54 above).",

This would be contrary both to legal certainty and to the general principles on victim status within the meaning of that term in Article 34 of the Convention. Furthermore, in cases where the sentence, on imposition, is irreducible under domestic law, it would be capricious to expect the prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether, at an unspecified, future date, a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release. A whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought.

Furthermore, given that the stated intention of the legislative amendment was to remove the executive entirely from the decision-making process concerning life sentences, it would have been more consistent to provide that, henceforth, the twentyfive year review, instead of being eliminated completely, would be conducted within a wholly judicial framework rather than, as before, by the executive subject to judicial control.",

Notwithstanding the reading given to section\u00a030 by the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force and provides that release will only be ordered in certain exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, namely if a prisoner is terminally ill or physically incapacitated and other additional criteria can be met (namely that the risk of re-offending is minimal, further imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy, there are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison, and early release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his or her family).",

Indeed, in the Court\u2019s view, compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by a \u201cprospect of release\u201d in Kafkaris, cited above.

In particular, the Order does not reflect the possibility \u2013 made available by the Human Rights Act \u2013 for even whole life prisoners to seek release on legitimate penological grounds some time into the service of their sentence. To that extent, on the basis of the Government\u2019s own submissions as to the state of the applicable domestic law, the Prison Service Order is liable to give to whole life prisoners \u2013 those directly affected by it \u2013 only a partial picture of the exceptional conditions capable of leading to the exercise of the Secretary of State\u2019s power under section 30.",

At the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such an application for release under section 30 by a whole life prisoner, the Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber. Of course, any ministerial refusal to release would be amenable to judicial review and it could well be that, in the course of such proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for example by the withdrawal and replacement of the Prison Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the courts. However, such possibilities are not sufficient to remedy the lack of clarity that exists at present as to the state of the applicable domestic law governing possible exceptional release of whole life prisoners.",

My unease relates to the very notion of State responsibility in international law and in fact to the distinction that one draws between an internationally wrongful act and its consequences. Article 28 of the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, 2001 (the \u201cDraft Articles\u201d) provides: \u201cThe international responsibility of a State which is entailed by an internationally wrongful act in accordance with the provisions of Part One involves legal consequences as set out in this Part [Part Two]\u201d. The wording that the Court uses, in my view, mixes together the establishment of State responsibility by a court based on a violation of the State\u2019s obligations under the Convention and the question of the Court\u2019s view on the possible legal consequences following the finding of responsibility.",

It is true that there are different forms of reparation, which include satisfaction for the injury caused \u201cin so far as it cannot be made good by restitution or compensation\u201d (Article 37 \u00a7 1 of the Draft Articles). \u201cSatisfaction may consist in an acknowledgment of the breach, an expression of regret, a formal apology or another appropriate modality\u201d (Article 37 \u00a7 2 of the Draft Articles). It is important to keep in mind that satisfaction provided by the responsible State, and not the courts, is not a standard form of reparation and may work only in those cases in which reparation cannot be fully satisfied through restitution or compensation. In any event, satisfaction under the rules on State responsibility should not be confused with what the European Court of Human Rights or other international courts or tribunals have considered to be just satisfaction.",

The Court has explained that where it has found a breach of the Convention in a judgment, the respondent State is under a legal obligation to put an end to that breach and make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach (see, for example, Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 32, ECHR 2000 XI). In the case of Papamichalopoulus and Others v.

If the nature of the breach allows of restitutio in integrum, it is for the respondent State to effect it, the Court having neither the power nor the practical possibility of doing so itself. If, on the other hand, national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 50 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate\u201d.",

At the same time, it is important to note in what specific factual context this practice of international courts and tribunals was established. The ICJ judgment in the Corfu Channel case is the main authority for this approach. However, the ICJ ruled that the declaration of a violation by the British Navy was \u201cin itself appropriate satisfaction\u201d in a situation in which Albania had not sought any other form of reparation (see Corfu Channel, Merits, ICJ Reports 1949, p.35). The ILC stated as follows: \u201cHowever, while the making of a declaration by a competent court or tribunal may be treated as a form of satisfaction in a given case, such declarations are not intrinsically associated with the remedy of satisfaction. Any court or tribunal which has jurisdiction over a dispute has the authority to determine the lawfulness of the conduct in question and to make a declaration of its findings, as a necessary part of the process of determining the case. Such a declaration may be preliminary to a decision on any form of reparation, or it may be the only remedy sought\u201d (see commentary on Article 37 of the Draft Articles, \u00a7 6). It should also be pointed out that, while noting the long-established practice of using satisfaction as a remedy, the tribunal in the \u201cRainbow Warrior\u201d arbitration drew the following distinction: \u201cThis practice relates particularly to the case of moral or legal damage done directly to the State, especially as opposed to the case of damage to persons involving international responsibilities\u201d (see the \u201cRainbow Warrior\u201d case, UNRIAA, vol.

It may well be that the Court considers that the compensation sought is unjustified and thus decides not to award it. The Court should therefore say exactly that. The finding of a violation will remain and will not go away with the decision not to make an award in respect of damage. These will be very rare cases and there might still be remedies available at domestic level.

It goes no further than that. The judgment recognises, implicitly, that hope is an important and constitutive aspect of the human person. Those who commit the most abhorrent and egregious of acts and who inflict untold suffering upon others, nevertheless retain their fundamental humanity and carry within themselves the capacity to change. Long and deserved though their prison sentences may be, they retain the right to hope that, someday, they may have atoned for the wrongs which they have committed. They ought not to be deprived entirely of such hope. To deny them the experience of hope would be to deny a fundamental aspect of their humanity and, to do that, would be degrading.",

As was intimated by the Chamber in its judgment (CJ\u00a0\u00a7\u00a092, quoted at GCJ \u00a7 86), defendants convicted of very serious crimes of violence such as murder or manslaughter must expect to serve a significant number of years in prison before they can realistically have any hope of release; and life sentence prisoners, even if they benefit from a possibility of release on parole, must know that there is no guarantee of release being granted in their lifetime.",

As noted above and, more importantly, in the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment (GCJ \u00a7 111), the balance between the various penological justifications for life imprisonment (punishment, deterrence, protection of the public and rehabilitation) are susceptible of shifting with the passage of time, such that in exceptional circumstances the point may be reached where it would constitute \u201cinhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\u201d, contrary to Article 3, to maintain the prisoner in continued detention.",

Indeed, to quote the Government\u2019s own words, \u201cas a matter of English law, when exercising the power the Secretary of State must act compatibly under the Convention\u201d (see the Government\u2019s written observations before the Grand Chamber, \u00a7\u00a068\u00a0 underlining supplied); with the consequence that, if the continued detention of a whole life prisoner is shown to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, contrary to Article 3, the Secretary of State would not merely be free but would be duty-bound to exercise his power to release the prisoner. The Government have acknowledged that whole life prisoners such as the applicants could contend, in an application to the Secretary of State for exercise in their favour of his power of release under the 1997 Act, that their continued detention is not justified on any penological grounds; and any negative decision by the Secretary of State would be amenable to judicial review and a challenge on Article 3 grounds (see the Government\u2019s written observations, \u00a7 66).",

Although as a matter of English law, the restrictive terms of that administrative, \u201cpolicy\u201d text are overridden by the Secretary of State\u2019s duty to act compatibly with the Convention when exercising his discretion, the specific instrument on the statutory power to release \u201con compassionate grounds\u201d is less than transparent.
