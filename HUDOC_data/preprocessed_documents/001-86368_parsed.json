However, it raised two questions concerning disciplinary procedures, namely lawyers\u2019 participation in disciplinary proceedings, and its corollary, lawyers\u2019 access to their clients\u2019 disciplinary file. Furthermore, the CPT queried whether the current provisions of the legislation rule out the involvement of a lawyer during disciplinary proceedings.

Domestic law must afford a measure of protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with Convention rights, in respect of which the rule of law would not allow unfettered powers to be conferred on the Executive. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any executive discretion and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2000XI).

In the instant case, six disciplinary sanctions were imposed on the applicant for damaging prison property, chanting slogans and refusing to be searched.
