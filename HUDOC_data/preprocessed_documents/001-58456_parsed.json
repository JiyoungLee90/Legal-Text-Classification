That compromise was necessary as a transitional phase during which the principle of equality which the Act had intended to promote could be progressively inserted into our law. Twenty-seven years later, the transitional phase has come to an end. The second argument stems from the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. It is likely that the Court will soon find that the French rule violates the Convention, and it would be preferable for an amendment of our law not to appear to be imposed from outside. Lastly, and above all, the solution favoured by the group of making the law of descent equal by abolishing divisive classifications makes it more and more difficult to maintain inequalities based on conditions of birth, without inevitably incurring the two-fold complaint of injustice and contradiction.",

The group does not think so. Adultery is clearly a serious injury inflicted on the spouse who is the victim of it and, over and above the spouses, on the children born of their marriage. In more legal terms, adultery is always an instance of misconduct and can be serious misconduct, for the duty of fidelity is inherent in the marital commitment. If such misconduct must be punished, however, it is only those who have committed it who should be punished and certainly not, we feel, the child born as a result. It is contradictory to declare on the one hand that parents have equal responsibility for their children irrespective of how they choose to lead their life as a couple and, on the other hand, to impose on a child, on the grounds that he or she is adulterine, the consequences of the parent\u2019s infidelity.

For one thing, relations between husband and wife will often have been broken off well before the birth of the child, and there is therefore something hypocritical about imposing on that child the ties of a commitment from which those who entered into it have long since freed themselves. For another thing, even if the marital ties have remained intact until the end, is it not vain to hope that a hereditary advantage will succeed in healing a split which by its very nature belongs to a completely different realm? Moreover, as the law currently stands, it is almost always possible for the child\u2019s parent to \u2018erase\u2019 this reduction in rights by legitimising \u2013 after divorcing and re-marrying, or, without divorcing, by seeking a court order \u2013 or even adopting the child. Far from making the rule more easily bearable, that option has the effect of leaving the child\u2019s ultimate destiny to the discretion of the adulterous parent. Thus the current provisions have the effect of multiplying inequalities, without succeeding in strongly affirming the importance of the marital commitment.",

The effect of that solution would be minimum compliance with the international conventions, whose sole concern is to secure equality between children, whereas the protective provisions specific to the spouse apply, by definition, only where the deceased leaves no other issue. Such a hybrid solution would merely be a means of failing to resolve the debate. What is actually at issue is not only material equality between children born of different partnerships in the division of their common parent\u2019s estate, but, in both more abstract and stronger terms, equality of the rights conferred by descent.",

Thus the 3\u00a0January\u00a01972 Act constituted, among other things, a major step forward in the development of family law and the position of children born out of wedlock, since it settled the question of establishing the descent of all children. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which enshrined the prohibition on discrimination based on birth, was adopted on 20 November 1989 (see paragraph 18 above). Subsequently, in May 1990 the Conseil d\u2019Etat published a report recommending, in the light of socio-demographic data, the abolition of discrimination against adulterine children in inheritance matters (see paragraph 19 above). In December 1991 a bill proposed bringing the inheritance rights of adulterine children into line with those of other children (see paragraph 20 above). In 1998 the Minister of Justice set up two projects, one designed to study shifts in family models from a sociological angle, and the other to consider possible changes to the law in the light of factual developments. The first report, submitted on 14\u00a0May 1998, criticised the inegalitarian status of adulterine children (see paragraph 21 above) while the second report, submitted on 14 September 1999, recommended abolishing the restrictions on adulterine children\u2019s inheritance rights (see paragraph 22 above). With regard to the situation in other member States of the Council of Europe, the Court notes, contrary to the Government\u2019s assertions (see paragraph 38 above), a distinct tendency in favour of eradicating discrimination against adulterine children. It cannot ignore such a tendency in its \u2013 necessarily dynamic \u2013 interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Convention. In that connection, the reference made by the Government to the Rasmussen judgment (see paragraph 38 above) is not convincing, since the factual and temporal circumstances have now changed. ",

It is thus indeed here, in the realm of family life, that the problem arises, namely discrimination based on descent. The same Family Law Commission\u2019s report of 14 September 1999, to which we referred in the previous point, pinpointed it when it recommended \u201cgiving full effect to the principle that children should be treated equally regardless of descent\u201d and, to that end, considered it necessary \u201cto achieve equality of status\u201d (see paragraph 22 of the judgment). By confining itself to one of the consequences of that status, in this case the restrictions on \u201cadulterine\u201d children\u2019s inheritance rights (in respect of which, moreover, there is a broad consensus in favour of abolition), the Court has perhaps not addressed the issue in its most meaningful terms, that is, the maintenance of inequalities, in the law of descent, based on conditions of birth. To apply a lex specialis in the instant case risks resembling a form of judicial \u201cminimalism\u201d or, to quote from the report of the Commission chaired by Professor Dekeuwer-Defossez, a \u201chybrid solution\u201d, for \u201cwhat is actually at issue is not only material equality between children born of different partnerships in the division of their common parent\u2019s estate, but, in both more abstract and stronger terms, equality of the rights conferred by descent\u201d (see paragraph 22 in fine of the judgment). Furthermore, the Court\u2019s judgment leaves unresolved the question as to whether it considers, as the Government suggested, that inheritance rights fall outside the ambit of respect for private and family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention, which may appear to be a regression compared with earlier judgments.
