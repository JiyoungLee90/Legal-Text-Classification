Moreover, the applicable provisions did not require that the prosecutor\u2019s submissions in support of the applicant\u2019s detention be communicated either to the applicant or to his lawyer. Consequently, the applicant did not have any opportunity to comment on those arguments in order to contest the reasons invoked by the prosecuting authorities to justify his detention.

The applicant referred in this connection to the Court\u2019s established case-law, in which emphasis had been laid on the importance of respect for the confidentiality of correspondence of prisoners with the European Commission of Human Rights since it could concern allegations against the prison authorities or prison officials (the Campbell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 233, s. 22, \u00a7 62).

Belgium judgment of 25 April 1983 (Article 50), Series A no. 63, p. 7, \u00a7 13, and the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands judgment cited above, p. 29, \u00a7 65). However, in more recent cases, it has declined to make any such award (see the Pauwels v. Belgium judgment cited above, p. 20, \u00a7 46; the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above (Article 50), pp. 44-45, \u00a7 9; the Huber v. Switzerland judgment cited above, p. 19, \u00a7 46; the Toth v. Austria judgment of 12 December 1991, Series A no. 224, p. 24, \u00a7 91; the Kampanis v. Greece judgment cited above, p. 49, \u00a7 66; the Hood v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 February 1999, to be published in the Court\u2019s official reports, \u00a7\u00a7 84-87; and the Nikolova v. Bulgaria judgment of 25 March 1999, also to be published in the Court\u2019s official Reports, \u00a7 76). In some of these judgments the Court stated that just satisfaction can be awarded only in respect of damage resulting from a deprivation of liberty that the applicant would not have suffered if he or she had had the benefit of the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 3 and concluded, according to the circumstances, that the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction in respect of any non-pecuniary damage suffered.",
