It found that there had been clear, independent and persuasive evidence demonstrating the genuine nature of his confession to the police. Furthermore, it noted that apart from the free and voluntary confession, the conclusion about the applicant\u2019s guilt was supported by other strong and independent evidence and facts. In particular, the court relied on the applicant\u2019s further statement of 9 May 2000 (see paragraph 11 above), placing the applicant at the time and place of the crime and confirming that he used force against the victim, a statement of a friend of the applicant to whom the applicant had stated that he had been involved in a serious fight with the victim, and various testimonies confirming that the applicant had been seen in a pub drinking and talking to the victim, leaving the pub right after the victim and heading in the same direction as the victim. Moreover, further testimonies confirmed that the applicant was seen in the early hours of the following morning drinking in another pub dressed in clothes covered in mud.

Article\u00a06\u00a0\u2013 especially paragraph 3 \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its requirements (see \u00d6calan v.

The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) is to be applied during the preliminary investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case. In order to determine whether the aim of Article 6 \u2013 a fair trial \u2013 has been achieved, regard must be had to the entirety of the domestic proceedings conducted in the case (Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038).",

Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6 (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7\u00a045, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I, and Funke v. France, 25 February 1993, \u00a7\u00a044, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0256A). The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see, inter alia, Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a068, Reports 1996VI; Heaney and McGuinness v. Ireland, no.\u00a034720/97, \u00a7\u00a040, ECHR\u00a02000XII; J.B. v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a031827/96, \u00a7\u00a064, ECHR\u00a02001-III; and Allan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a048539/99, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR\u00a02002-IX).

The right of an accused minor to effective participation in his or her criminal trial requires that he be dealt with with due regard to his vulnerability and capacities from the first stages of his involvement in a criminal investigation and, in particular, during any questioning by the police. The authorities must take steps to reduce as far as possible his feelings of intimidation and inhibition (see, mutatis mutandis, T. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085) and ensure that the accused minor has a broad understanding of the nature of the investigation, of what is at stake for him or her, including the significance of any penalty which may be imposed as well as of his rights of defence and, in particular, of his right to remain silent (mutatis mutandis, S.C. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a060958/00, \u00a7\u00a029, ECHR 2004IV).

Moreover, before an accused can be said to have impliedly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be (see Talat Tun\u00e7 v.

The Court considers that given the vulnerability of an accused minor and the imbalance of power to which he is subjected by the very nature of criminal proceedings, a waiver by him or on his behalf of an important right under Article 6 can only be accepted where it is expressed in an unequivocal manner after the authorities have taken all reasonable steps to ensure that he or she is fully aware of his rights of defence and can appreciate, as far as possible, the consequence of his conduct.",

The applicant, who was a minor at the relevant time, visited the Police Director\u2019s office together with his father. The Police Director explained to the father, in the applicant\u2019s presence, that the police were investigating a murder and robbery, that there was evidence linking the applicant with the commission of these crimes and that an arrest warrant had been issued against him. The arresting officer then entered the Director\u2019s office, showed the arrest warrant and arrested the applicant. During his arrest, the applicant was \u201ccautioned\u201d within the meaning of the relevant Judges Rules (see paragraph 44 above). He was therefore told that he was not obliged to say anything and that anything he did say could be used in subsequent court proceedings. The applicant was then taken into a separate room for questioning. The applicant\u2019s father was concerned that the police might use force against the applicant and the Director reassured him that no such practices would be used. He explained that the case was serious and that they should seek the assistance of a lawyer. A few minutes later and while the applicant was already being questioned, they were informed that the applicant had confessed his guilt. The Director suggested that the applicant\u2019s father join the applicant in the interview room so that he could hear himself what the applicant had admitted. The applicant\u2019s father preferred to wait outside. The applicant was cautioned before his written statement confessing his guilt was taken by a police officer.",

The applicant, when arrested by the police, was under age (17\u00a0years and 8 months), and for this reason he was called to the police station accompanied by his father and guardian. Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c) of the Convention, although it protects the right to legal representation, does not specify the manner of exercising it and everything seems to depend on the circumstances. It must be noted that under domestic law there was no requirement at the material time for the authorities to warn persons arrested of their right to be legally represented. The only requirement under Article\u00a011 \u00a74 of the Constitution of the  is that the arrested person \u201cshall be allowed \u201d the services of a lawyer. To my mind, the distinction between denial of the right to have access to legal assistance and failure to inform of the existence of such right is important and must be borne in mind when examining a possible violation of the Convention. I do not dispute that, under the Convention, a right to be informed might exist under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, as the Convention does not detail the manner in which the right to be legally represented may be exercised and domestic law did not at the time have such a requirement, I would prefer to look at the totality of the proceedings before I decide on their fairness and whether any limitation of the right, through failure to inform, could amount to a violation under Art. 6 \u00a7 3 (c). As stated by the Court in Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, no. 13972/88, \u00a7 37, \u201cThe right set out in paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c) is one element, amongst others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings...\u201d.",

The warning was given 30-40 minutes before the first written confession was made by the applicant. The father had, in my opinion, ample time to seek the services of a lawyer or even request that further interrogation be halted or delayed, until he could consult a lawyer. However, he elected to remain inactive. There is, in my opinion, no doubt that, on behalf of his son, the father waived any right that he may have had ",

Furthermore, the father was invited by the authorities to be present during his son\u2019s questioning, but again he preferred to stay outside the investigating room and walk up and down. Therefore, I cannot come to the conclusion that, in the circumstances, there was a denial of the right to have access to a lawyer at the initial stages of the proceedings, or that the whole treatment of the applicant by the police was in any way unfair.",

Even if I were to accept that, due to the failure to inform, some limitation of the applicant\u2019s right to legal assistance did occur, its effect must nevertheless be examined in the context of the whole proceedings and not in isolation. The applicant, less than 24\u00a0hours after his arrest, had the services of a lawyer who represented him at the remand proceedings the very next day. Within one week he appointed a second lawyer and, throughout the one and a half years the trial lasted, he was at all times legally represented and had the opportunity to test all the evidence adduced. The fact that his guardian and not the applicant himself was informed of the right to consult a lawyer cannot make any difference. In any event the issue was examined by the  during the trial within a trial and it was found that the warning to the father was sufficient, and that the statement the applicant gave was in any event voluntary. These findings were subsequently scrutinised and upheld by the Supreme Court. In G v. the United Kingdom, no. 9370/81, 35 DR 75 (1983), where the accused was similarly questioned in the absence of a lawyer, the Commission was satisfied that the statement was voluntary by the mere availability of voir dire proceedings.

The Court would appear to be acting contrary to its established case-law that, unless the case is exceptional, it does not interfere with questions of admissibility and assessment of evidence when such issues have been decided by the domestic courts. My non-exhaustive search of the case-law under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c) has not revealed a similar case where failure to inform alone led to a violation. In most cases the denial of the right in question takes the form of a request by the arrested person to have the services of a lawyer, followed by a denial on the part of the authorities. For instance, in Brennan v. the United Kingdom (no. 39846/98, ECHR 2001-X), the applicant requested a lawyer but access was delayed. The applicant was then interviewed for 35\u00a0hours on 4 consecutive days, during which he made a confession. Even so, the Court was not persuaded that the denial of access to legal assistance had infringed the applicant\u2019s right under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c). Having in mind the entirety of the proceedings, I consider any prejudice there may have been in the present case relatively much less serious than in Brennan and G v. the United Kingdom (cited above) and I see no reason for reaching a different conclusion.",

The first caution was given on arrest in the presence of his father, the second when he was to be interviewed by the police shortly after arrest and the third before a written statement was taken from him. I cannot subscribe to the view that a mere caution in words is not enough to enable the applicant to comprehend the nature of the right. The applicant was of sufficient maturity to understand the nature and implications of the caution. I also doubt whether in ordinary cases, and in the absence of special factors or some form of incapacity, we should place a special duty on the investigating authorities to make sure that an arrested person comprehends the caution given.

The findings of the Court in the Kyprianou case (cited above) with regard to the lack of impartiality on the part of the Assize Court were confined to Mr Kyprianou and to the contempt proceedings against him and in no way extended to the rest of the proceedings or affected the applicant in any way. I consider any insinuation that, as a result of the incident with Mr. Kyprianou, the  lost its impartiality or fairness towards the applicant to be totally unfair to the judges of the  and generally to the judiciary of . I therefore cannot agree that, in respect of the applicant, there was any violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as a result of the contempt proceedings that took place against the applicant\u2019s Counsel.",

With all respect, I cannot agree. The , in refusing leave, based its judgment on established domestic jurisprudence and took into account both the interests of justice and those of the defence. With regard to the interests of justice, it must be noted that the lawyer\u2019s application to withdraw was made towards the end of the main trial and after most of the evidence had been admitted. To have granted leave at that late stage of the proceedings would have meant that the trial would be delayed until a new lawyer was found and the voluminous record of the court containing all the evidence was transcribed for the benefit of the new lawyer. It is likely that this would have taken a considerable time, thus further delaying the proceedings. In trying to safeguard the defence interests, the  considered that a new lawyer, who would not have had the opportunity to see or hear the witnesses testify in court, would have been at a serious disadvantage. I do not detect any fault in the reasoning of the court, nor do I see any unfairness in the way the court dealt with the lawyer\u2019s request. Had the applicant\u2019s lawyer considered that he could not do his best for his client, as he was obliged to do at all times and under any circumstances, he should have advised his client to dismiss him forthwith, rather than continue with the trial and complain afterwards. The applicant himself never raised the issue and never indicated that he wanted to change his lawyer. Under the circumstances, I cannot agree that the refusal of leave for the lawyer to withdraw had any detrimental effect on the proceedings as a whole.",

Given the main violation that the majority finds, I do not see any need in this case to find separate violations.

The finding of separate violations is, with respect, unnecessary, serves no useful purpose and tends to eclipse the main violation that the majority of the court finds.",
