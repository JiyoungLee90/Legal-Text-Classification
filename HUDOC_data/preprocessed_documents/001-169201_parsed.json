First of all, as you already know, we left \u015e\u0131rnak to go to the peace meeting, Gemlik meeting which was organised by Tuhay-Der. As a result of the arbitrary security measures taken by the security forces and the fact that we were forced to wait two and a half hours at each checkpoint for identity checks, we were not able to travel as fast as we wanted. For us, those who conducted themselves in such a manner are the people who do not want peace in this country (his speech is interrupted by applause and ululations). Subsequently, we were taken into police custody because of our democratic reaction to the search order. We were kept in police custody for one night and then taken before a court. The court released us. However, it took a decision to place me under judicial control. I have to go to give my signature every Monday and I am banned from travelling abroad (His speech is interrupted by boos and the slogan \u2018Bar\u0131\u015fa uzanan eller k\u0131r\u0131ls\u0131n\u2019 (\u2018May those hands which aim to damage peace be broken\u2019). We condemn with contempt the mentality which obstructed the meeting in Gemlik; we condemn with contempt the fact that Mr Abdullah G\u00fcl, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, called us \u2018provocateurs\u2019 as well as the mentality which prevented the peace meeting from taking place and which blocked and attacked the crowds. Two vehicles were burned. A person lost his life and hundreds were injured. We condemn with contempt the mentality which is against your and the Kurdish people\u2019s sensibility, your wish for peace and the meeting on peace. We want peace in this country. We want harmony. Those who are against unity and solidarity in this country and those who do not want this country to reach modernity, that is to say, who obtain an unjustified gain out of this war, prevent us from having peace ... As you know, Mr\u00a0Abdullah \u00d6calan, the leader of the Kurdish people (His speech is interrupted by the slogan \u2018Biji Serok Apo\u2019 (\u2018Long live President \u00d6calan\u2019) called for a ceasefire six years ago.

We have once again started to receive the bodies of guerrillas and soldiers. We want an end to the crying of the mothers of guerrillas and soldiers in this country. We want peace in this country. We will continue our struggle for peace. The demonstration organised by Tuhay-Der will contribute to peace because a one-month ceasefire has been declared. Mr\u00a0Abdullah \u00d6calan has not been able to meet his lawyers or members of his family for the last three and a half months. We believe that that sanction is harmful to the peace process. That is why we participated in the peace march that was organised by Tuhay-Der. We thank those who attended that demonstration for their wish for peace and for their determination, despite injustice and obstructions. We hope that our friends who were injured will recover soon. We condemn with contempt those who obstructed the peace march. We want peace and we will continue to struggle for peace. I thank you all. You can disperse now in silence ...\u201d",

The court noted that those who disseminated propaganda in favour of the PKK were expressing their support and approval for the PKK, whose methods were those of terrorism and violence. The court accordingly considered that the dissemination of propaganda in favour of that organisation essentially amounted to incitement to violence and the use of terrorist methods. The first-instance court further noted that it was a well-known fact that during illegal demonstrations and meetings PKK members and supporters disseminated propaganda by way of waving photographs of the leader of the PKK and yellow, red and green pieces of cloth, symbolising the so-called flag of the PKK. The court thus concluded that on 5\u00a0September 2005 the accused had disseminated propaganda by acting in support of the PKK\u2019s aims and by their acts in front of the building of the Cizre branch of the DEHAP.",

There remains the question of the latter\u2019s accessibility and the foreseeability of its effects, as well as its compatibility with the rule of law. In this connection, the Court observes that there appears to be no issue regarding the accessibility of the legislation in question (see Faruk Temel v. Turkey, no. 16853/05, \u00a7 49, 1\u00a0February 2011). As to the question of foreseeability and the compatibility with the rule of law of the interference, the Court notes that the first-instance court convicted the applicant pursuant to the amended version of section\u00a07(2), which had entered into force on 18 July 2006, finding that the new version was more favourable to him (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). The Court finds that the offence proscribed by section 7(2) after 18\u00a0July 2006, that is \u201cdisseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation\u201d, and its interpretation by the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court do not appear to be entirely clear. Nevertheless, having regard to its conclusion regarding the necessity of the interference (see paragraph 38 below), the Court considers that it is not required to conduct an examination of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the interference on the basis of section 7(2) of Law no.\u00a03713, as amended in 2006 by Law no. 5532 (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00dcrper and Others, cited above, \u00a7 29; G\u00f6zel and \u00d6zer v.

France [GC] (no. 29369/10, \u00a7\u00a0124, ECHR 2015), for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression. The Court further emphasises that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on freedom of expression in the area of political speech or debate, where that freedom is of the utmost importance. While precious to all, freedom of expression is particularly important for political parties and their active members. They represent their electorate, draw attention to their preoccupations and defend their interests. Accordingly, interferences with the freedom of expression of a politician who is a member of an opposition party, like the applicant, call for the closest scrutiny by the Court (see Incal v. Turkey, 9 June 1998, \u00a7\u00a046, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV; S\u00fcrek v.

Turkey [GC], nos. 25067/94 and 25068/94, \u00a7 52, ECHR 1999IV, in which the Court considered that an interview published in a monthly review in which the members of the PKK had been referred as \u201cguerrilla\u201d had not constituted incitement to violence and could not be construed as liable to incite to violence; Gerger v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a024919/94, \u00a7 50, 8 July 1999, in which the Court held that the applicant\u2019s speech, which referred to the members of the PKK as \u201cguerrilla\u201d, had constituted political criticism of the Turkish authorities and not an incitement to violence, armed resistance or an uprising; Bah\u00e7eci and Turan, cited above, \u00a7 30 and Savg\u0131n v. Turkey, no. 13304/03, \u00a7 45, 2\u00a0February 2010, in which the Court considered that text messages and slogans which referred to Abdullah \u00d6calan as the president had not incited to violence; Faruk Temel, cited above, \u00a7 62, in which the Court found that referring to Abdullah \u00d6calan as \u201cesteemed\u201d (say\u0131n) during a speech did not incite to violence; and \u00d6ner and T\u00fcrk v. Turkey, no. 51962/12, \u00a7 24, 31 March 2015, in which the Court held that the applicant\u2019s speech, in which he described Abdullah \u00d6calan as the \u201cKurdish leader\u201d did not constitute incitement to violence). Besides, the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court did not conduct an assessment of the applicant\u2019s speech as a whole. It focused on the use of those two expressions and found that they constituted propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation, without providing an explanation for the reasons for its conclusion. In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s speech as whole cannot be construed as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising (see Demirel and Ate\u015f v. Turkey (no. 3), no. 11976/03, \u00a7\u00a026, 9\u00a0December 2008). On the contrary, during his speech, the applicant reiterated several times that he was in favour of peace in Turkey and of finding a peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue (see paragraph 14 above). The Court further observes that the first-instance court failed to examine whether the applicant\u2019s speech had had any adverse impact on public order. In this connection, the Court notes that there is no indication in the case file that the gathering in front of the DEHAP building was not peaceful or that the people who had attended the demonstration engaged in acts of violence after listening to the applicant\u2019s speech (see K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 and Eren v. Turkey, no.\u00a043807/07, \u00a7 27, 29 November 2011). The first-instance court therefore appears to have failed to take into account the context in which the speech was made and the conduct of the demonstrators (see Faruk Temel, cited above, \u00a7 61).",

                                                "content": ".\u00a0\u00a0As to the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court\u2019s finding that the applicant had directed the demonstrators who had chanted slogans in favour of the PKK, waved yellow, red and green pieces of cloth and carried Abdullah \u00d6calan\u2019s photographs, the Court first observes that the slogans chanted during the applicant\u2019s speech, that is to say, \u201cMay those hands which aim to damage peace be broken\u201d and \u201cLong live \u00d6calan\u201d did not contain any elements of violence or incitement to violence (see Bah\u00e7eci and Turan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a030). The Court recalls that in its judgment in the case of Y\u0131lmaz and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 68514/01, \u00a7 66, 17 July 2008), it found that the slogan \u201cA tooth for a tooth, blood for blood, we are with you \u00d6calan\u201d had a particularly violent connotation. Likewise, in its judgment in the case of K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 and Eren (cited above, \u00a7 28), the Court found that the slogan \u201cRise up again and again, our president is \u00d6calan\u201d, taken literally, might be construed as having a violent tone. The Court does not find any reason to depart from these considerations in the present case. Nevertheless, those slogans were shouted during a peaceful gathering, which limited their potential impact on \u201cnational security\u201d and \u201cpublic order\u201d, and thus they were not a call to violence (ibid.) or apology of terrorism (compare Ta\u015fdemir v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a038841/07, 23 February 2010). In any case, there is no evidence in the case file showing that the applicant was the source of the slogans chanted by the demonstrators (see B\u00fclent Kaya v Turkey, no. 52056/08, \u00a7\u00a042, 22\u00a0October 2013). Nor is it established that he encouraged or instructed the demonstrators to chant slogans (see paragraph 14 above).",
