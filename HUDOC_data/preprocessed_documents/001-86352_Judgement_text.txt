As the first defendant was declared insolvent, the applicant withdrew his claim against it on 2 June 1998. That company was subsequently deleted from the companies register.
On 18 September 1998 the Bratislava II District Court decided to transfer the case to the District Court in Žilina. On 30 November 1998 the Supreme Court decided that the case fell within the jurisdiction of the Bratislava II District Court.
Between 22 April 1999 and 2 October 2001 the District Court scheduled eleven hearings. The defendant’s representative failed to appear on seven occasions.

On account of the latter’s health problems, a third expert was appointed on 22 November 2004. The third expert informed the District Court that he was not qualified to determine remuneration for artistic design, and for this reason a fourth expert was appointed on 22 April 2005.

The applicant had not contributed by his conduct to the length of the proceedings. The defendant had failed to appear at seven hearings, which had resulted in the proceedings being prolonged. The District Court had not proceeded with the case in a smooth and efficient manner, as a result of which the applicant’s claim had not yet been determined.
