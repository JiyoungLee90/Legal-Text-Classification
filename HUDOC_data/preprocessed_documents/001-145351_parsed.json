Departures from that principle are justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Kot v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020887/03, \u00a7\u00a024, 18\u00a0January 2007). The Court observes that in the case at hand the judgment was set aside by way of a supervisory review solely on the ground that the lower courts had incorrectly applied the substantive law. The Court reiterates its constant approach that in the absence of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings a party\u2019s disagreement with the assessment made by the first-instance and appeal courts is not a circumstance of a substantial and compelling character warranting the quashing of a binding and enforceable judgment and re-opening of the proceedings on the applicant\u2019s claim. The Court has on several occasions found that the quashing of the final and binding judgment solely for the reason of the misapplication of the domestic law by the lower courts was in breach of the legal certainty principle in a number of cases concerning very similar sets of facts (see, among many others, Sizintseva and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a038585/04, 2795/05, 18590/05, 24012/07 and 55283/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a031-32, 8\u00a0April 2010, and Markovtsi and Selivanov v. Russia, nos.\u00a0756/05 and 25761/05, \u00a7\u00a020, 23\u00a0July 2009). The Government did not put forward any arguments which would enable the Court to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The Court accordingly concludes that the quashing of the judgment of 19\u00a0August 2002 did not respect the principle of legal certainty.",

In the present case the judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour was enforceable until at least 16 September 2004 and it was incumbent on the State to abide by its terms (see, among others, Velskaya v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a021769/03, \u00a7\u00a018, 5\u00a0October 2006, and Markovtsi and Selivanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a029).
