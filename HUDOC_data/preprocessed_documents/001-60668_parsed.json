It noted that, following the applicant's successful appeal against the penal order of 28 September 1995, the District Court had joined these and further criminal proceedings involving the applicant and two other accused and relating to several charges of fraud. In the latter proceedings, trial proceedings had not yet been opened on account of difficult investigations. The Court of Appeal stated that it would not await the outcome of these proceedings either. Rather, it opted for a procedure under section 308 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to examine the question whether or not, in addition to the conviction by the Ahrensburg District Court of 1993, the applicant's criminal offence to the detriment of Mr. H. could constitute a reason for revoking the suspension of his sentence.

When the transaction was to be carried out some time later at a parking place on the motorway, the applicant had taken H.'s money and disappeared without handing over the promised goods. While H. had not identified the applicant on police photographs shown to him at the police department the day after the offence, he did recognise him in a collection of police photographs which had been presented to him by the police officer B. The Court of Appeal considered that both witnesses' statements were true. The court argued that H. had openly talked about his bad conscience regarding the low price of the two objects and he had also admitted that, because he was ashamed, he had not told the truth as to the circumstances of the applicant's disappearance on the occasion of his questioning by the police. Moreover, police officer B. had remembered many details and had also explained an amendment to the minutes of H.'s questioning.  ",

Accordingly, no measures amounting in effect to a finding of guilt or a penalty could be taken against a defendant without his guilt having been established beforehand at a proper trial. However, punishable conduct could be ascertained in other than criminal proceedings, and it was not against the presumption of innocence to draw specific conclusions for the purpose of such court proceedings even before a final conviction by the competent court. It was therefore not objectionable from a constitutional point of view that the decision to revoke a suspension on account of a new criminal offence could be taken prior to the person's conviction. It was sufficient that the court was, on the basis of its own assessment, convinced that the person had committed the offence. As far as the suspension was concerned, the initial criminal judgment had made a prognosis of the convicted person's future conduct which could have been negative in the event of \u201ca high probability of another offence committed in the meantime\u201d (\u201ceine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit einer zwischenzeitlich begangenen weiteren Tat\u201d). The decision to revoke the suspension did no more than correct the initial prognosis, which had turned out to be incorrect (Federal Constitutional Court, decisions of 1 and 4 December 1986, Neue Juristische Wochenschrift 1988, p. 1715 et seqq.).",

With its decision to revoke the suspension of the applicant's prison sentence under the initial conviction, the Court of Appeal drew penal consequences from the new criminal offence and imposed a disadvantage upon the applicant that, in the Court's view, equates with a penalty.
