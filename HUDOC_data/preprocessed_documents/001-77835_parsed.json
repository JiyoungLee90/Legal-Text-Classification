The Court further considers that the applicant must have suffered distress and frustration resulting from the State authorities\u2019 failure timeously to execute a final judicial decision in his favour, and that this cannot be sufficiently compensated for by the finding of a violation. However, the amount claimed appears excessive. Taking into account the nature of the decision which was not executed in time, the delay in the execution proceedings and other relevant aspects and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards EUR 3,100 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
