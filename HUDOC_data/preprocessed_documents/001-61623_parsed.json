Thus, in the first type of case, the court's supervisory role focused on the proceedings before the indictment division and the reasons stated in the judgment, and was confined to ascertaining whether the legal classification given to the matters described in the judgment justified a committal to an assize court. In the second type of case, the court's supervisory role shifted to reflect the special nature of the proceedings before the assize court, and concerned those proceedings as a whole: on the basis of the court record, the Court of Cassation verified compliance with the procedural rules and the formal propriety of the questions put and replies given, with a view to ensuring that the questions were worded in a clear, factual and unambiguous manner and that the replies given were coherent.
