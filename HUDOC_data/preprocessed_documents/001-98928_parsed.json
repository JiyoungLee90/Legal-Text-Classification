That delay can be attributed only to the State since the trial judge remained responsible for the preparation and the speedy conduct of the trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Scopelliti, cited above, \u00a7\u00a023). Had the court found the applicant's request to use Hebrew abusive, as argued by the Government, it should not have waited until 28 January 2004 (see paragraph 20 above), namely, nearly six years after the proceedings had started, to discontinue the assistance of an interpreter into Hebrew. Furthermore, several adjournments were ordered because of the trial court's inability to secure the attendance of either the parties, the experts or the interpreters (see paragraph 20 above). As a result, it took seven years for that court to take the first and only decision in the applicant's case.

This decision was given on an assumption about the applicant's sufficient command of these languages. During this time, the court admitted no additional evidence.
