Secondly, the Court rejects the applicant\u2019s argument that he was not interviewed by the TCPO, because he explicitly acknowledged the opposite in his letter of 20 August 2006 (see paragraph 26 above). However, the Court finds it conflicting with the relevant principles of an effective investigation that the TCPO relied heavily on the information provided by the RDPO and Rustavi police officers directly or indirectly implicated in the impugned events, without seeking any information from the applicant\u2019s witnesses (see, for example, Erg\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a083-84) or confronting the applicant himself with Mr\u00a0M., Mr\u00a0A. and Mr\u00a0G., whom the former had directly incriminated (see Davtian, judgement cited above, \u00a7\u00a046). The Court attaches further importance to the fact that the TCPO did not consider interviewing the Tbilisi no.\u00a05 Prison doctor who had examined the applicant at the material time and allegedly refused to report the signs of ill-treatment on his body (see paragraph\u00a011 above). Lastly, instead of ordering an independent and thorough medical examination of the applicant\u2019s state of health (ibid.), the TCPO limited the expert\u2019s enquiry to reading the prison medical log (see paragraph 28 above).",
