Referring to chapter 21, section 3\u00a0a, subsection\u00a02\u00a0(2) of the Code, the Government contended that in cases concerning aggravated drunken driving there might be reason to give a conditional sentence combined with an order to undergo different kinds of treatment and the courts therefore often consider the assistance of counsel to be necessary in order to have put forward arguments relating to the personal circumstances of the accused which speak in favour of penalties other than imprisonment. In the applicant\u2019s case, the District Court had appointed a public defence counsel of its own motion, obviously considering that the interests of justice required legal assistance. It is primarily for the domestic authorities to make such an assessment. By appointing a public defence counsel for the applicant, the court had guaranteed the right to an adequate defence. Moreover, the applicant had not been prevented from appointing S. as his private defence counsel. Nothing in the case-files of the Swedish courts indicated that the applicant had informed the courts that he was prepared to pay S.\u2019s fees himself. If he had done so, the courts would certainly have revoked H.\u2019s appointment as public defence counsel. ",

A formal request for H. to be replaced by S. was not made until the case was pending before the Court of Appeal, at which stage of the proceedings a change of public defence counsel would have entailed substantial additional costs. The Government were further of the opinion that the assessment made by the courts of the need to replace defence counsel must clearly be considered as falling within the margin of appreciation afforded to a Contracting State when examining a question of this character. They also submitted that the minutes of the oral hearing before the Court of Appeal did not indicate that the applicant had objected to H.\u2019s attendance as public defence counsel or that the applicant had been prevented from conducting his own defence.",

In general this includes not only the right to be present, but also the right to receive legal assistance, if necessary, and to follow the proceedings effectively. Such rights are implicit in the very notion of an adversarial procedure and can also be derived from the guarantees contained in sub-paragraphs (c) and (e) of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (see, among other authorities, the Stanford v. the United Kingdom judgment of 23\u00a0February\u00a01994, Series\u00a0A no. 282-A, pp. 10\u201311, \u00a7 26).",

The Court accepts the Government\u2019s contention that this situation often arises in cases concerning aggravated drunken driving as there might be reason to give a conditional sentence combined with an order to undergo different kinds of treatment. Further considering that the assessment whether the interests of justice require that an accused be provided with legal assistance primarily rests with the national authorities, the Court finds that neither the legal requirement of legal assistance under the Code of Judicial Procedure nor the District Court\u2019s appointment of H. as the applicant\u2019s public defence counsel contravened the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 of the Convention, notwithstanding his obligation to pay a minor part of the litigation costs in the case.",

In fact, a formal request for H. to be replaced by S. was not submitted until August 1994, when the case was before the Court of Appeal. It is true that the applicant informed the District Court of his wish when it scheduled its main hearing in the case. However, he did not pursue this request after having been told to contact H. and made no objection to H.\u2019s appearance and assistance at the District Court\u2019s hearing in May 1994.",

Thus, when the applicant \u2013 during the scheduling of that hearing \u2013 sought his replacement, H. had already undertaken a certain amount of work, notably in regard to the six indictments that had been made against the applicant on different occasions and in preparation for the main hearing. The amount of work undertaken had obviously increased when the Court of Appeal was seized with the replacement request in August 1994. In this connection, it should be noted that the courts approved H.\u2019s invoices, including the ten hours of work accounted for in the District Court. Thus, whether the courts can be said to have been called upon to determine the question of replacement of counsel already when the applicant informed the District Court of his wish at the time of that court\u2019s hearing preparations or only when a formal request was made to that end before the Court of Appeal in August 1994, it is clear that the proceedings had reached a stage where the requested replacement would have caused certain inconvenience and entailed additional costs. The Court does not find it unreasonable, in view of the general desirability of limiting the total costs of legal aid, that national authorities take a restrictive approach to requests to replace public defence counsel once they have been assigned to a case and have undertaken certain activities.",

The interpretation assistance provided should be such as to enable the accused to have knowledge of the case against him and to defend himself, notably by being able to put before the court his version of the events (see, among other authorities, the Kamasinski v.\u00a0Austria judgment cited above, p. 35, \u00a7 74).",

It further observes that interpretation between Finnish and Swedish was arranged both at the District Court\u2019s and the Court of Appeal\u2019s hearings and that the applicant made oral submissions in Finnish during those hearings.
