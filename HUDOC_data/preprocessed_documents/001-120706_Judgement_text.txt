The case originated in four applications (nos. 28237/03, 24386/04, 46124/07 and 33488/10) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Romanian nationals.
The applicant G. in application no. 46124/07 died on 3 August 2008. The application was pursued in his name by G. and M., heirs to the applicant’s estate.
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented successively by their Agents, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu, Mrs Irina Cambrea and Mrs Catrinel Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 10 July 2007 the application no. 24386/04 was communicated to the Government. The other applications were communicated to the Government on 5 October 2011.
All applicants obtained favourable decisions concerning various possessions by means of final judgments. These judgments have later been quashed following extraordinary appeals: review, annulment or supervisory review proceedings initiated by the adverse parties or the ProcuratorGeneral of Romania.
Detailed information concerning the applicants and their proceedings are set out in the table appended hereto.
Some relevant domestic provisions on extraordinary appeals are summarised in the cases of Ştefănică and Others v. Romania, no. 38155/02, § 19, 2 November 2010 (request for supervisory review), Androne v. Romania, no. 54062/00, § 36, 22 December 2004 (request for review), and Mitrea v. Romania, no. 26105/03, § 14, 29 July 2008 (request for annulment).
Moreover, Article 322 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a final decision may be revised where, inter alia, a disciplinary sanction has been ordered against a magistrate for the exercise in bad-faith of his or her function or severe negligence in the examination of a case (Article 322 § 4), or written evidence which has been withheld by the opposing party or which it was not possible to submit for a reason beyond the parties’ control is discovered after the decision has been delivered (Article 322 § 5).
