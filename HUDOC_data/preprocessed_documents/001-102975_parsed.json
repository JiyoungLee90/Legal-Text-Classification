It observed, in particular, that the German owners of hunting grounds, by way of their adherence to the hunting association, were in a position to influence the decision-making process on how the hunting rights should be exercised. Furthermore, they had a right to receive a share of the profits derived from the exploitation of the hunting rights. All owners of plots which were too small to allow a proper management of hunting rights adhered to a hunting association. The court also considered that the hunting associations did not only serve the leisure interests of those who exercised the hunting rights, but imposed certain specific obligations on them, which served the general interest, in particular the duty to manage the game stock with the aim of maintaining varied and healthy game populations and to avoid damages caused by wild game. They were furthermore obliged to comply with specific quotas set by the administration for the hunting of game. These duties applied in the same way to the owners of hunting grounds more the 75 hectares of area, notwithstanding the fact that these bigger plots were not regrouped in hunting associations.",

The applicant was neither enjoined to exercise the hunt himself, nor to participate in it or to support it. The fact that he had to tolerate the exercise of the hunt on his premises did not result from his own decision, but was the result of the legislator's legitimate decision.

This was evident in the notion of \u201cHege\u201d, which transcended the simple management of an orderly hunt and encompassed a general protection of the game stock both quantitatively and qualitatively. The hunting right carried with it the obligation to preserve varied and healthy game stock while at the same time regulating the number of game in order to prevent game damage on agricultural and forest areas. A regulation of the quantity of wild game was particularly important in densely populated , for example in order to avoid the spreading of animal diseases and to avoid damage caused by wild game on other premises. It followed that the hunt not only served ecological interests, but also other general interests and the protection of other landowners' properties.",

While this participation in the profits might be unsatisfactory to the applicant, who was opposed to hunting for ethical reasons, this compensation had to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the measure.

As the wild game did not stop at district borders, and would retreat into areas which were exempt from hunting, the aims of the hunting law could only be achieved if the hunt was exercised on all appropriate surfaces. There were only rare exceptions to this rule which were all based on overriding, general interests. It was true that the hunt was stayed under section 1, \u00a7 1, first alternative of the Federal Hunting Law, on those areas which did not adhere to a hunting district. However, having regard to the wide definition of hunting districts in sections 7 and 8 of that law, only few surfaces fell within the scope of that provision. Furthermore, such surfaces were generally incorporated into other hunting districts. The hunting authority only granted a stay of the hunt under section 10 \u00a7 2 sentence 2 of the Hunting Law in exceptional cases and for reasons which related to management and protection of game stock. Even in nature reserves the exercise of the hunt was not generally excluded; the regulation of the hunt depended on the specific conservation purposes.

The Court thus considers that the hunting associations are sufficiently integrated into State structures in order to qualify them as public law institutions.

France (Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, ECHR\u00a01999III) and Schneider v. Luxembourg (Schneider v. Luxembourg, no.\u00a02113/04, 10 July 2007).

Similar objections of the respondent Government in Chassagnou did not prevent the Grand Chamber from finding that the fact that the prefect supervised the way the associations operated was not sufficient to support the contention that they remained integrated within the structures of the State. The Court also found that it could not be maintained that the associations enjoyed prerogatives outside the orbit of the ordinary law, whether administrative, rule-making or disciplinary, or that they employed processes of a public authority, like professional associations (see Chassagnou, para. 101). The Court concluded that to \u201ccompel a person by law to join an association such that it is fundamentally contrary his own convictions to be a member of it, and to oblige him, on account of his membership of that association, to transfer his rights over the land he owns so that the association in question can attain objectives of which he disapproves, goes beyond what is necessary to ensure that a fair balance is struck between conflicting interests and cannot be considered proportionate to the aim pursued\u201d (para. 117). Those findings were confirmed, as recently as in 2007, in Schneider.",
