The text of this provision does not provide for any possible exceptions, not even on grounds of prior judicial involvement (see Harkmann, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Bergmann v.\u00a0Estonia, no.\u00a038241/04, \u00a7 45, 29 May 2008).

This is a minimum safeguard against arbitrary treatment. The provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5: by virtue of paragraph 2 anyone who is arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4. Whilst this information must be conveyed \u201cpromptly\u201d, it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed are sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 182). Anyone entitled to bring proceedings in order to have the lawfulness of his detention speedily decided cannot make effective use of that right unless he is promptly and adequately informed of the reasons relied on to deprive him of his liberty (see Van der Leer v. the Netherlands, 21 February 1990, \u00a7\u00a028, Series A no.\u00a0170A). Furthermore, if the grounds for detention change, or if new relevant facts arise concerning the detention, a detainee has a right to be apprised of this further information (see X. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a06998/75, Commission\u2019s report of 16 July 1980, \u00a7 105, Series\u00a0B no. 41).",
