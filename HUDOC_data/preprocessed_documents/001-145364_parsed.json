In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, any argument as to an alleged violation of a Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used (see Azinas v.

However, both were adjourned on account of the applicant\u2019s inability to attend due to professional commitments (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). At his own request, the applicant was eventually heard by the Rijeka Minor Offences Court assisting the competent Vrgorac Minor Offences Court (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).",

In other words, the Court will examine whether, in the present case, the domestic courts\u2019 discretion as to the conduct of the summary minor-offence proceedings was exercised in a way which was compatible with the requirements of Article 6 (see Margu\u010d, cited above).",

Slovenia, no. 11411/11, \u00a7 32, 28 February 2013), he never requested that the police officer be heard as a witness (compare Aubrecht v.

The applicant did not argue that he was prevented from making such a request and, given that the domestic courts accepted his request to be questioned at a hearing, there is no reason for the Court to believe that any request on his part for the questioning of the police officer, which would have allowed the applicant to put the credibility of the police officer\u2019s findings to the test in an adversarial procedure, would not have been granted.",
