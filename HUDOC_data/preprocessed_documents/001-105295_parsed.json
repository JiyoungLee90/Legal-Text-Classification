It observed that the right to education was not limited to basic education and that it also applied to subsequent, post-compulsory education.

The fees did not pursue any legitimate aim and failed to strike a proper balance between the interests of the individual and the public interest. In , secondary education was a precondition for any sort of employment, and the lack of such education meant that those concerned would be unable to integrate properly or even ensure their livelihood. Under Article 28 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the State had the duty to assist children in their drive to become fully fledged members of society. By erecting insuperable obstacles to the completion of their secondary education, the State was preventing them from developing in that way. The requirement for the applicants to pay fees had been discriminatory because they had been in an identical situation to the rest of their schoolmates.

It has in the past recognised that the right to education by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, and that this regulation may vary in time and place according to the needs and resources of the community (see the \u201cBelgian linguistic\u201d case, cited above, p. 32, \u00a7 5; Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1982, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 48; \u00c7ift\u00e7i v.

The Court must solely determine whether, once a State has voluntarily decided to provide such education free of charge, it may deny that benefit to a distinct group of people, for the notion of discrimination includes cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7 82, Series A no. 94; \u00dcnal Tekeli v.

It may also, in certain circumstances, justifiably differentiate between different categories of aliens residing in its territory. For instance, the preferential treatment of nationals of member States of the European Union \u2013 some of whom were exempted from school fees when Bulgaria acceded to the Union (see paragraph 32 above) \u2013 may be said to be based on an objective and reasonable justification, because the Union forms a special legal order, which has, moreover, established its own citizenship (see, mutatis mutandis, Moustaquim v.

It is true that education is an activity that is complex to organise and expensive to run, whereas the resources that the authorities can devote to it are necessarily finite. It is also true that in deciding how to regulate access to education, and in particular whether or not to charge fees for it and to whom, a State must strike a balance between, on the one hand, the educational needs of those under its jurisdiction and, on the other, its limited capacity to accommodate them. However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that, unlike some other public services (see Nitecki v. Poland (dec.), no. 65653/01, 21 March 2002, and Pentiacova and Others v. Moldova (dec.), no. 14462/03, ECHR 2005I, regarding health care; Budina v.

It is expressly enshrined in Article 2 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see the \u201cBelgian linguistic\u201d case, cited above, pp. 3031, \u00a7 3). It is also a very particular type of public service, which not only directly benefits those using it but also serves broader societal functions. Indeed, the Court has already had occasion to point out that \u201c[i]n a democratic society, the right to education ... is indispensable to the furtherance of human rights [and] plays ... a fundamental role\u201d (see Leyla \u015eahin, cited above, \u00a7 137). Moreover, in order to achieve pluralism and thus democracy, society has an interest in the integration of minorities (see Konrad, cited above).",

Thus, at the university level, which to this day remains optional for many people, higher fees for aliens \u2013 and indeed fees in general \u2013 seem to be commonplace and can, in the present circumstances, be considered fully justified. The opposite goes for primary schooling, which provides basic literacy and numeracy \u2013 as well as integration into and first experiences of society \u2013 and is compulsory in most countries (see Konrad, cited above).",

It is also confirmed by the differentiation between those three levels of education in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (see paragraph 34 above). However, the Court is mindful of the fact that with more and more countries now moving towards what has been described as a \u201cknowledge-based\u201d society, secondary education plays an ever-increasing role in successful personal development and in the social and professional integration of the individuals concerned. Indeed, in a modern society, having no more than basic knowledge and skills constitutes a barrier to successful personal and professional development. It prevents the persons concerned from adjusting to their environment and entails far-reaching consequences for their social and economic well-being.",
