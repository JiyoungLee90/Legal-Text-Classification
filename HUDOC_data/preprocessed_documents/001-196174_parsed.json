The case was examined in an expedited procedure under the CAO, which required that in cases concerning an administrative charge for an offence punishable by administrative detention, the police were to transmit the administrativeoffence file to a court immediately after having compiled it, and the court was to examine the case on the same day or within forty-eight hours of the defendant\u2019s arrest. It appears that no adjournment was possible. The Court reiterates in this connection that recourse to that procedure when a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d is to be determined is not in itself contrary to Article 6 of the Convention as long as the procedure provides the necessary safeguards and guarantees (see\u00a0Butkevich v.

Be that as it may, in the Court\u2019s view, it is questionable whether it would have been at all practicable (in view of the statutory time constraints and the swiftness of the trial \u2013 see paragraph 21 above) for the trial court to ensure the immediate presence of the witnesses against him, following such a request by the defence.",

This being said, the Court notes that at the appeal hearing the applicant and his lawyer requested the appeal judge to summon and hear evidence from Kr. and Kor. The judge examined and rejected this application. It is noted that this application was not dismissed because under Russian law a defendant in a CAO case would be precluded from seeking \u2013 including by way of an application made orally during an appeal hearing \u2013 the examination of a witness for the first time on appeal having failed, without having a valid reason, to make that request at the initial trial.
