This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh, cited above, \u00a7 52; Asito v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 40663/98, \u00a7 46, 8\u00a0November 2005).",

It takes notice of the Government\u2019s argument that, unlike in Ryabykh, the exercise of this power by the president was subject to a five\u00a0year time-limit, so that judgments were not liable to be challenged indefinitely. That being so, the Court cannot fail to observe that two years lapsed from the date the decision in the applicant\u2019s favour had become legally binding to the day the proceedings were reopened (see paragraphs 9 and 15 above). In this context the Court recalls that it has already found an issue under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention where the final decisions by the domestic courts had been challenged fourteen months after they became binding and enforceable (see, mutatis mutandis, Prisyazhnikova and Dolgopolov v. , no.\u00a024247/04, \u00a7\u00a025, 28\u00a0September 2006).

Since those arguments had already been examined and rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court on appeal, the reopening of the proceedings can be regarded as an attempt by the local authority to re-argue the case on the points which had failed on appeal.",

In this context, the Court recalls its case-law about public interest in protecting nature and forests and that financial imperatives and even certain fundamental rights, such as ownership, should not be afforded priority over environmental protection considerations (see paragraph 54 below).

Romania, nos. 30767/05 and 33800/06, \u00a7\u00a0164, 12 October 2010). Taking into account the Lithuanian courts\u2019 conclusions that the plot of land at issue is situated in the forest of national importance, the Court also reiterates its position that financial imperatives and even certain fundamental rights, such as ownership, should not be afforded priority over environmental protection considerations, in particular when the State has legislated in this regard (see Turgut and Others v. , no. 1411/03, \u00a7\u00a090, 8 July 2008 and the cases cited therein). Be that as it may, the Court also recalls that it has already found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the annulment of the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s final decision of 12\u00a0February 2002, which had determined the applicant\u2019s property rights vis-\u00e0-vis the State. It therefore considers that for the years that followed (see paragraphs 9 and 18 above) the applicant had been deprived of her property without a proper legal basis. Whilst acknowledging that after the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision of 20 May 2004 the applicant has a right to choose another plot of land or to receive a pecuniary compensation, the Court nevertheless holds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention.",
