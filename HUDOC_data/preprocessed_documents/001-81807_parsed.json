The Supreme Court noted that the respondent's residence permit had expired on 7\u00a0September 1998 and that since then she had been staying in  without a permit. Nonetheless, she had not been deported pending the proceedings in another recourse she had filed against the administrative authorities' decision not to grant her another permit. This recourse had been rejected by the Supreme Court on 5 July 2000 and this was the reason that the deportation order of 21 July 2000 had been issued. Furthermore, the Supreme Court observed that to grant the respondent her application for an interim order for the suspension of the deportation order would in essence result in the grant of permission to stay, which was outside the competence of the Court. The right of any person, whether Cypriot or alien, to be present at proceedings before a court, was not related to the question of permission to stay. The applicant, in her recourse, had linked the two, but the need for her to be present at the trial before the Family Court would be regulated by the requirements of the trial and not according to a general obligation of the Republic to grant her permission to stay in the Republic for the duration of the trial, as she asserted.",

Furthermore, although certain of the adjournments, in particular during the first instance proceedings, were by the parties' mutual agreement (see paragraph 10 above), on the whole there were no major delays attributable to the applicant. As regards the conduct of the authorities, the Court notes that although the retrial proceedings were particularly prompt (four months and twenty five days), there were considerable delays at the first instance and appeal stages. In particular, in the first instance proceedings there was one significant period of inactivity of more than nine months between 2 March 1999 and 15 December 1999 (see paragraphs 8-9\u00a0above). No explanations have been given by the Government in this respect. Furthermore, at the appeal stage, there was a period of inactivity in the proceedings of approximately ten months between 11 January 2002 and 5\u00a0November 2002 (see paragraphs 21 to 23 above). The only event that appears to have happened within this period was the delivery of the Supreme Court's interim decision on the applicant's interim application for costs (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). Even in this regard the Court notes that it took the Supreme Court over five months to deliver this decision. In addition, the Court observes that the intervals between fixing the appeal also had an impact on the overall length of the appeal proceedings (see paragraphs 17, 18, 24 and 25 above).",
