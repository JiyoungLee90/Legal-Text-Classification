In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant was not in a position to calculate the aggregate term of the sentences on his own. While the conversion of the term of community work into the prison term was indeed an arithmetical exercise, the judicial authorities still had discretion to decide whether the converted sentence would be added in full or in part, regard being had to the particular circumstances of the case. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the hearing for determination of his aggregate criminal sentence is compatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention.
