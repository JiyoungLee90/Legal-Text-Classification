As a consequence, the judge had not ruled on the merits of the charges and U. had dodged criminal responsibility for illtreating her. Delays in the proceedings were caused in particular by: multiple transfers of the case between judges; the failure to apply a preventive measure to U. such as an undertaking to stay in town, and to sanction him when he had not appeared at hearings; unreasonably long intervals between hearings lasting up to two months, and belated commissioning of a medical assessment. An excessive number of hearings mentally exhausted the applicant, distracted her from work and drained her finances. She disbursed up to a hundred euros for her legal representation at each hearing because victims of domestic violence had no access to free legal aid in Russia. U. had volunteered for a mission abroad as a way to delay the proceedings. The court could have required the Ministry of Interior to recall him from the mission, to prevent him from leaving by requiring him to appear before court, or to suspend the limitation period for the duration of his absence. It had not however taken any such initiative and rejected all of the applicant\u2019s requests to that effect. The absence of a judgment on the merits thwarted the applicant\u2019s attempts to vindicate her right to live free from violence and ill-treatment and to obtain compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage and legal costs.",

Slovenia, no.\u00a03400/07, \u00a7 48, 15\u00a0January 2015, and Kosteckas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 960/13, \u00a7\u00a041, 13 June 2017). Special diligence is required in dealing with domestic-violence cases, and the specific nature of the domestic violence must be taken into account in the course of the proceedings. This obligation will not be satisfied if the protection afforded by domestic law exists only in theory; above all, it must also operate effectively in practice, and that requires a prompt examination of the case without unnecessary delays (see Opuz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 145-51 and 168; Talpis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106 and 129, and T.M. and C.M. v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 26608/11, \u00a7 46, 28 January 2014). Violations have been found in cases where the trial had continued unduly or had ended by prescription allowing the accused perpetrators to escape accountability (see Opuz, cited above, \u00a7 151, and P.M. v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a049669/07, \u00a7\u00a7 64-66, 24 January 2012). The effectiveness principle means that the domestic judicial authorities must on no account be prepared to let the physical or psychological suffering inflicted go unpunished. This is essential for maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in, and support for, the rule of law and for preventing any appearance of the authorities\u2019 tolerance of or collusion in acts of violence (see Okkal\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 52067/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)).",

Nevertheless, the Court considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, the two-year period was not so short as to justify the Russian courts\u2019 failure to bring proceedings to the judgment stage.

On one occasion in 2007, the proceedings were adjourned by three months to perform a one-day medical assessment. In 2008, as the statute of limitation was about to expire, the applicant\u2019s complaint to the president of a higher court did not lead to an acknowledgment of delays or to any measures capable of speeding up the proceedings but rather to the decision to replace the trial judge once again with the effect that the trial had to be started from the beginning (compare H\u00fcseyin \u015eim\u015fek v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a068881/01, \u00a7 69, 20 May 2008).

Ukraine, no.\u00a010792/04, \u00a7 43, 28 May 2009). A large number of hearings did not take place because of U.\u2019s absence from Russia. The Government did not offer any explanation why U. was afforded the freedom to come and go as he pleased for the entire duration of the trial. His absence from Russia was not continuous; he did attend a few hearings between April and October 2007 and also after October 2008. The trial judge did not use those occasions to ensure his attendance by requiring him to give an undertaking to appear or by applying a standard preventive measure in criminal proceedings, such as an obligation not to leave town without permission (see paragraph\u00a022 above). Nor did the trial judge liaise with the human resources department of the Ministry of the Interior to have him recalled from the mission. As it happened, the court did not react in any way to the defendant\u2019s dilatory conduct (see Rypakova v. Russia, no. 16004/04, \u00a7 34, 8 January 2009, and Sokolov v. Russia, no.\u00a03734/02, \u00a7 40, 22 September 2005). The unrestricted liberty of movement put the defendant \u2013 the individual having a vested interest in seeing the statute of limitations expire before the trial had reached the judgment stage \u2013 in a position to control the pace of the proceedings. The Court reiterates that the judicial authorities bear ultimate responsibility for management of their proceedings so that they are expeditious and effective (see Mitchell and Holloway v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a044808/98, \u00a7\u00a056, 17 December 2002, and Nikonenko v. Ukraine, no. 14089/03, \u00a7\u00a025, 29\u00a0May 2008). In the present case, by not availing themselves of the measures available under national law to secure the defendant\u2019s presence in the courtroom, the authorities bear responsibility for their failure to ensure that the case be heard within a reasonable time and that the perpetrator of domestic violence be brought to justice.",
