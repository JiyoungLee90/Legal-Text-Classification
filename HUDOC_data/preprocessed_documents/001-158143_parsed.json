Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s office to which the applicant complained had examined the circumstances under which the relevant decisions of the Court of Appeal had been made.

It had also established that the case file contained summonses addressed to the applicant and copies of the defendant\u2019s appeal.

The first-instance court interpreted the provisions of domestic legislation to answer this question in the affirmative, while the appellate court answered it in the negative. In short, the case raised a purely legal and technical question but no questions of fact or of the assessment of evidence. The Court has repeatedly held that such disputes concerning the benefits payable under social security schemes are technical and may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument (see, for example, Miller v.\u00a0Sweden, no.\u00a055853/00, \u00a7 29, 8 February 2005, and Schuler-Zgraggen v.\u00a0Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 263).

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which presupposes respect for the principle of res judicata, that is to say the principle of the finality of judgments, according to which no party is entitled to seek review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 52, ECHR 2003-X).",

In such circumstances it was all the more important for the domestic courts to indicate the reasons for their decision to extend the time-limit and reopen proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case.",
