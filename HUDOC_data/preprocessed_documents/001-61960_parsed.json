They maintained that the issues raised by the case were novel, complex and of general public concern. Any delay before 31 March 1995 was due to the exchange of the parties\u2019 pleadings. While acknowledging that the applicants were exercising their legal right, the Government argued that their opposition to the Attorney-General\u2019s application delayed the proceedings since a separate hearing was required. The Government further noted that, while the applicants made some effort to secure the delivery of the High Court judgment (April 1995 - December 1996), they made no such effort to ensure the resumption of the Supreme Court hearing after February 1998. It was reasonable, in the Government\u2019s view, for the Supreme Court to give priority to more urgent cases and the appeal hearing did not finish in February 1998 because the parties had incorrectly estimated the time necessary. Finally, and as to what was at stake for the applicants, the Government submitted that the case had no relevant significance for the applicants after 1998 (other than costs) as the Council had already repaired the road pursuant to the High Court judgment.
