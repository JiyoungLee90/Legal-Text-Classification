The case originated in an application (no. 37641/97) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Tomasz Matwiejczuk (“the applicant”), on 7 November 1996.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr W. Hermeliński, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the facts of his case disclosed a violation of Articles 5 § 3, 6 § 1, 8 and 34 of the Convention.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) . This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
By a decision of 4 June 2002, the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant was born in 1966 and is currently detained in the Radom prison.
In July 1996 the applicant was released from prison. On 11 September 1996 the police arrested him. The police suspected that on 10 September 1996 the applicant had committed an armed robbery and rape. At the same time, the police enforced a warrant for the arrest of the applicant issued on 28 August 1996 by the Pruszków District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) in the criminal proceedings against the applicant pending before that court.
On 13 September 1996 the Warsaw District Court remanded the applicant in custody on charges of armed robbery and sexual assault. The court took into account the fact that the applicant was of no fixed abode and that his accomplices had not been arrested.
On 8 November 1996 the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) dismissed the applicant's appeal against the District Court's decision to remand him in custody. The Regional Court considered that the applicant's detention was justified by the existence of serious evidence of his guilt, the gravity of charges against him, the risk of collusion, the fact that he was of no fixed abode and was unemployed. In addition, the court observed that the police failed to apprehend the applicant's accomplices and that there was a risk that he would go into hiding. Finally, the court was of the view that the applicant's case did not disclose any of the grounds for release provided by Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
On 10 December 1996 the Warsaw Regional Court extended the applicant's detention until 11 March 1997.
The applicant made an application for release but it was dismissed on 19 December 1996 by the Warsaw Regional Court. It referred to the gravity of the charges brought against the applicant and the existence of serious evidence of his guilt.
Between 20 January and 27 February 1997 the prosecution service decided that it would seek evidence from five expert witnesses and requested the applicant's medical file from a psychiatric hospital in which he had been treated.
On 4 March 1997 the Warsaw Regional Court appointed legal aid counsel to defend the applicant.
On 5 March 1997 the prosecution service received two expert opinions. On 7 March 1997 the District Prosecutor interviewed the victim of rape.
On 10 March 1997 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) allowed the request submitted by the prosecutor and extended the applicant's detention on remand until 11 May 1997. The court referred to the gravity of the charges against the applicant and the grounds for detention provided in Article 217 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Moreover, it noted that one of the co-accused was still in hiding and that immediately after the commission of the alleged crime “there had been an attempt to contact the victim [of the assault]”. The court also agreed with the submissions of the prosecutor that the investigation was not finished because certain forensic tests still had to be carried out, the applicant and another co-accused were still under psychiatric observation, whereas the police was trying to apprehend the third accused. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).
Between 8 and 18 April 1997 the prosecution service received two expert opinions and decided to request DNA tests.
On 24 April 1997 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the Warsaw Court of Appeal's decision of 10 March 1997. It referred to the charges against the applicant and observed that there existed serious evidence of his guilt.
On 29 April 1997 the Warsaw-Ochota Deputy District Prosecutor (Zastępca Prokuratora Rejonowego) replied to the applicant's letter of 23 April 1997 in which he complained about the censorship of his correspondence with the European Commission of Human Rights. The prosecutor advised the applicant about domestic legislation, which allowed the authorities to censor his correspondence.
On 9 May 1997 the Warsaw Court of Appeal allowed the request submitted by the prosecutor and extended the applicant's detention on remand until 11 July 1997. The court relied on the existence of serious evidence of the applicant's guilt and the nature of charges against the applicant. It also considered that the applicant's case did not disclose any of the grounds for release provided by Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Finally, the court noted that the prosecution service was awaiting an expert opinion from a forensic expert and that one of co-accused was still in hiding. The applicant appealed against that decision.
On 16 May 1997 the prosecution service received the results of DNA tests. On 18 June 1997 the District Prosecutor interviewed the applicant and decided to modify charges against him.
On 27 June 1997 the prosecuting authorities filed with the Warsaw Regional Court a bill of indictment against the applicant.
On 7 July 1997 the Warsaw Regional Court extended the applicant's pretrial detention until 11 September 1998.
On 9 July 1997 the trial court dismissed the applicant's challenge to the prosecutor who worked on his case. During the two following days the applicant was consulting the case-file.
On 10 July 1997 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the Warsaw Court of Appeal's decision of 9 May 1997. The Supreme Court relied on the gravity of charges against the applicant, the existence of serious evidence of his guilt and the grounds for detention listed in Article 217 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It also pointed out that the Warsaw Regional Court's decision of 7 July 1997 extending the applicant's detention had been taken before the Supreme Court had the opportunity to decide his appeal against the Warsaw Court of Appeal's decision of 9 May 1997 and therefore constituted “an inappropriate practice”.
On 15 July 1997 the applicant's counsel appealed to the Warsaw Court of Appeal against the Regional Court's decision of 7 July 1997. On 25 July 1997 the appellate court rejected the appeal. It pointed out that at the time of his arrest the applicant had been of no fixed abode and had been the subject of the arrest warrant.
In the meantime, on 22 July 1997 the applicant lodged with the Warsaw Court of Appeal an appeal against the Regional Court's decision of 7 July 1997. On 5 September 1997 the Warsaw Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. The court relied on a medical opinion confirming that the applicant's medical problems could be treated in prison.
In the meantime, on 20 August 1997 the applicant made an application for release. On 16 October 1997 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the application. It relied on a medical opinion. The applicant's appeal against that decision was rejected because it was not provided by law.
On 24 March 1998 the Warsaw Regional Court was informed that the applicant had tried to smuggle a message to his accomplices. However, it was seized by the prison service and included in the court's case-file.
Between 25 November 1997 and 19 May 1998 the applicant on six occasions attended hearings before the Pruszków District Court in the criminal proceedings against him pending before that court.
On 19 June 1998 the Warsaw Regional Court decided to stop the applicant's letter in which he made threats against one of the prisoners. The letter was included in the court's case-file.
On 22 July 1998 the Warsaw Regional Court requested the Supreme Court to extend the applicant's pre-trial detention under Article 222 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which empowered the Supreme Court to prolong detention beyond two years. The request was based, inter alia, on Articles 209 and 217 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and referred to the gravity of charges against the applicant, the existence of serious evidence of his guilt and the inability to schedule hearings because of holidays and workload of judges involved in the applicant's case. The request also referred to the fact that the next hearing could not be fixed before evidence is taken from an anonymous witness who could not testify before 3 November 1998.
On 22 July 1998 the first hearing was held before the Warsaw Regional Court. The applicant and his co-accused asked that the hearing be adjourned as they had not been able to prepare their defence. The court allowed the request and adjourned the hearing until 3 November 1998. The court took into account heavy workload of judges, the holiday period and the fact that an anonymous witness could not be heard before that date.
On 28 August 1998 the Supreme Court allowed the Regional Court's request of 22 July 1998 and extended the applicant's pre-trial detention until 15 December 1998. It pointed out that difficulties in fixing hearings caused by holidays and workload of judges could not be considered as grounds for extending pre-trial detention. Furthermore, the Supreme Court agreed with the Regional Court that the applicant's case disclosed the existence of grounds for detention provided in Articles 209 and 217 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Supreme Court concluded that the inability to take evidence from an anonymous witness before 3 November 1998 justified the extension of the applicant's detention under Article 222 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
On 3 November 1998 the Warsaw Regional Court held the second hearing in the applicant's case. It took evidence from the victim of sexual assault. The court also made arrangements for taking evidence from an anonymous witness.
On 17 November 1998 evidence was taken from an anonymous witness.
On 19 November 1998 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the applicant's challenge to the judges trying his case. The Regional Court considered that the fact that the judges were female did not deprive the applicant of a fair trial on charges of sexual assault.
On 23 November 1998 the hearing was adjourned because the prosecution service and witnesses had not been informed about it.
The applicant made a further application for release at the hearing held on 1 December 1998 but it was dismissed by the Warsaw Regional Court on 2 December 1998. The court considered that the applicant's detention was justified by the existence of serious evidence of his guilt, the gravity of charges against him and the fact that he had been of no fixed abode at the time of his arrest. Moreover, the court observed that it had not finished taking evidence from certain witnesses. The applicant's appeal against that decision was rejected because it was not provided by law.
On 2 December 1998 the Warsaw Regional Court requested the Supreme Court to further extend the applicant's pre-trial detention. On 4 December 1998 the Supreme Court allowed that request and prolonged the detention until 15 February 1999. The Supreme Court referred to its decision of 28 August 1998 and observed that the trial court still had to take evidence form certain witnesses. In addition, the trial court did not know the address of one of those witnesses, whereas another witness had to be transported to the court from the Łódź Prison.
On 17 December 1998 a hearing took place before the Warsaw Regional Court.
On 22 December 1998 evidence was taken from an anonymous witness.
The applicant made a fresh application for release but it was dismissed on 4 January 1999 by the Warsaw Regional Court. It referred to the nature and the gravity of charges against the applicant and noted that his trial was in the final stage.
On 7 January 1999 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the applicant's challenge to the judges trying his case. The applicant's appeal against that decision was rejected because it was not provided by law.
On 12 January 1999 the police informed the Warsaw Regional Court that one of the witnesses for the defence was dead.
On 21 January 1999 a hearing was held before the Warsaw Regional Court. It was adjourned until 3 February 1999 because one of the judges was ill.
On 25 January 1999 the Warsaw Regional Court requested the Supreme Court to further extend the applicant's pre-trial detention. On 10 February 1999 the Supreme Court allowed that request and prolonged the detention until 31 March 1999. It referred to the reasoning of its decision of 4 December 1998. The Supreme Court also noted the difficulties the trial court experienced in taking evidence from one of the witnesses. Moreover, the court considered that because the applicant had been of no fixed abode at the time of his arrest he could interfere with the proceedings if released from detention.
The hearing held on 3 February 1999 was adjourned because the applicant requested that evidence be taken from a new witness.
The next hearing was held on 19 February 1999.
During the hearing held on 15 March 1999 the applicant applied for release from detention but the court dismissed it. The applicant's appeal against that decision was rejected because it was not provided by law.
On 25 March 1999 the Supreme Court prolonged the applicant's detention until 31 May 1999.
During the hearing held on 7 April 1999 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the applicant's request that the case be remitted to the prosecution service for further investigation.
The last hearing before the trial court was held on 28 April 1999.
On 4 May 1999 the Warsaw Regional Court convicted the applicant of armed robbery and sexual assault and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment. The applicant appealed against that judgment to the Warsaw Court of Appeal.
On 9 November 1999 the Warsaw Court of Appeal held a hearing. The court dismissed the appeal except for the conviction for armed robbery, which it qualified as robbery without the use of arms.
The Court's case-file contains the following documents pointing to the monitoring of the applicant's correspondence:
(i)  the applicant's letters of 5, 22 and 31 January and 7 February 1997 addressed to the European Commission of Human Rights are marked with a handwritten note: “Censored” (Ocenzurowano) and an illegible signature and also bear a stamp: “Assistant Warsaw-Ochota District Prosecutor Grażyna Garboś-Jędral” (Asesor Prokuratury Rejonowej Warszawa Ochota Grażyna Garboś-Jędral);

The Code of Criminal Procedure 1969, which remained in force until 1 September 1998, listed as preventive measures, inter alia, detention on remand, bail and police supervision.

“Preventive measures may be imposed in order to secure the proper course of proceedings if the evidence against the accused sufficiently justifies the opinion that he has committed a criminal offence.”
Furthermore, the Code of Criminal Procedure allowed authorities a margin of discretion as to whether to continue the enforcement of preventive measures. Detention on remand was regarded as the most severe preventive measure. Article 213 of the Code provided as follows:
“A preventive measure shall be immediately quashed or changed if the grounds therefor have ceased to exist or if new circumstances have arisen, which justify quashing a given measure or replacing it with one that is either more or less severe.”
Article 225 of the Code provided:

Article 222 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as applicable after 4 August 1996, provided insofar as relevant:
Subsequently, paragraph 4 was extended to include also “other significant circumstances, which could not be overcome by the organs conducting the proceedings”.

Article 263 of the new Code, insofar as relevant, provides:

Rule 33 of the Rules on Detention on Remand 1989, as amended on 29 December 1995, provided, in so far as relevant, as follows:
“(1)  A detainee has a right to correspond.
(2)  Detainee's correspondence shall be censored by the organ at whose disposal he remains (...).

No restrictions shall be applied to him except such as are necessary to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings, to maintain order and security in a remand centre and to prevent demoralisation of detainees.”
Article 217 § 1 reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:
