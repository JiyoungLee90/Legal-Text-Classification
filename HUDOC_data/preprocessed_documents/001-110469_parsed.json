The appeal setting out the above allegation does not specify which provisions were breached; it would appear from the grounds of the appeal that it concerns Article 391 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, which the trial court relied on when reading out the statements of JH once it had been established that he was staying permanently (for a longer period of time) abroad and thus objectively it is impossible to hear him directly. There is no doubt in the circumstances of the case that the court made all possible procedural attempts to secure the presence of JH at the trial, and that the court took the decision to read out the statements of that witness after having established objectively and unequivocally that the precondition specified in Article 391 \u00a7 1 of the CCP had been met (his\u00a0uninterrupted long stay abroad), and then only just before closing the trial. The defendant [the applicant] does not dispute that the circumstances specified in Article 391 \u00a7 1 of the CCP in respect of witness JH were correctly ascertained, admitting expressly that the witness went away and has lived abroad. In this procedural situation the trial court had the right to read out the statements of that witness, a minor, given at the time when he was questioned as a suspect (the fact that the trial court did not invoke \u00a7 2 of Article 391 of the CCP does not have any procedural significance for the justified use of the measure provided by Article 391 of the CCP in the circumstances of the case), being an exception to the principle of directness and the principle of oral proceedings \u2013 since the trial court assessed the admissibility of that evidence (reading\u00a0out a witness\u2019 statements), the circumstances in which it was obtained and the credibility of those statements by corroborating them with other evidence obtained in the case, as already explained.

It recalled that the guarantees in paragraphs 3 of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of this provision which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings. In addition, the Court underlined that its primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, also Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, 16\u00a0November 2010, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted (see,\u00a0G\u00e4fgen\u00a0v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 175, ECHR 2010...) and, where necessary, to the rights of\u00a0witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26\u00a0March\u00a01996, \u00a7\u00a070, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II). Furthermore, the admissibility of evidence is a\u00a0matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 162, and references therein).",

All the evidence was carefully examined both by the trial court and by the Court of Appeal. JH\u2019s statements made to the police were not the only evidence incriminating the applicant. More critically, the applicant did not seek to challenge JH\u2019s statements (\u00a7\u00a7 20, 62).",

The judgment in AlKhawaja\u00a0and\u00a0Tahery seems to revolve to some extent around a very specific statutory definition of what is \u201chearsay evidence\u201d, a definition that has replaced the previous peculiar common-law definition (or definitions) (see, for example, the Privy Council decision in Subramaniam\u00a0v.\u00a0The\u00a0Public\u00a0Prosecutor [1956] WLR 965 at 970); and this seems to be so notwithstanding what is stated by the Grand Chamber at \u00a7\u00a0126. Even among common-law jurisdictions there is divergence as to what hearsay evidence exactly encompasses \u2013 compare and contrast s. 114(1) of the [English] Criminal Justice Act 2003 with s. 59(1) of the New South Wales Evidence Act 1995. Moreover the Grand Chamber also had before it a plethora of procedural safeguards (under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 among others) to counterbalance the possible prejudice of hearsay evidence or evidence which cannot be directly tested in open court, which are not necessarily found in other jurisdictions. Finally, as was correctly hinted by the third-party intervenor in Al-Khawaja and Tahery (\u00a7\u00a0114\u00a0of\u00a0that judgment), the question of the admissibility or otherwise of hearsay evidence is not necessarily bound up with the principle of confrontation, which is what Art. 6(3)(d) is all about.",

While it is true that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and by the domestic courts (Van Mechelen and Others v. The  23 April 1997, no. 21363/93, \u00a7 50; Doorson v. The Netherlands 26 March 1996, no. 20524/92, \u00a7 67), it is also true that well established procedural rules which in essence enshrine the minimum right guaranteed in\u00a0Art.\u00a06(3)(d) should not be lightly abandoned or, worse, whittled down to the point where that minimum right becomes illusory.",
