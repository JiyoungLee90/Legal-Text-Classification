The first applicant stated that the real reason for his exclusion was the deterioration of relations between Russia and Turkey owing to the military aircraft incident, which was illustrated by the fact that the traffic violations he had allegedly committed had been registered after that incident (see paragraph\u00a020 above), as well as the inspection of his farm which had led to his administrative punishment (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, actual proof of that connection had clearly been confirmed by the representative of the Komi FSB at the court hearing on 24 February 2016 when he had stated \u201cthe international situation is complicated, therefore the attitude in Russia towards violations by foreign nationals has become stricter\u201d (see paragraph 21 above). However, despite the first applicant requesting that the courts verify his allegation that his exclusion had been caused by the deterioration of the political relationship between Russia and Turkey, the courts had not done so. The first applicant further pointed out that the copy of the Komi FSB\u2019s letter of 2\u00a0December 2015 requesting that his residence permit be annulled did not provide any information concerning either the factual basis or motives for the sanction against him. The Government had failed to provide the Court with the Komi FSB\u2019s decision of 27 November 2015 which had served as the basis for its request of 2\u00a0December 2015 to annul his residence permit (see paragraph 26 above).

As can be seen from the Town Court\u2019s judgment of 24 February 2016, the court did not examine any of the FSB\u2019s documents substantiating its request for the annulment of the first applicant\u2019s residence permit on national security grounds (see paragraph\u00a023 above). On appeal, the Komi Supreme Court endorsed the findings of the Town Court and refused to examine the basis for the FSB\u2019s assertion that the first applicant was a national security threat, stating that the information obtained by the FSB from classified sources was not subject to judicial control (see paragraph 27 above). The national courts thus failed to examine a critical aspect of the case, namely whether the FSB was able to demonstrate the existence of facts serving as a basis for its assessment that the applicant presented a national security risk (see, by contrast, Regner, cited above, \u00a7 154). Confining their scope of review to a purely formal examination of authorities\u2019 decisions, renders it impossible to duly balance the interests at stake, taking into account the general principles established by the Court (see paragraphs 37-38, above) and applying standards in conformity with Article 8 of the Convention (for a similar situation, see Gaspar, cited above, \u00a7 48, and Zezev v.
