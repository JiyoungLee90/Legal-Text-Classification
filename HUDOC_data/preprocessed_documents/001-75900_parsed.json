They have therefore already lasted more than nine years and eight months for three levels of jurisdiction. However, the Court considers that the applicant cannot rely on the period during which he was a fugitive, when he sought to avoid being brought to justice in his country. The Court is of the opinion that the flight of an accused person has in itself certain repercussions on the scope of the guarantee provided by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the duration of proceedings. When an accused person flees from a State which respects the principle of the rule of law, it may be assumed that he or she is not entitled to complain of the unreasonable duration of proceedings following that flight, unless sufficient reason can be shown to rebut this assumption (see Ventura v. Italy, no. 7438/76, Commission\u2019s report of 15\u00a0December 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 23, p. 91, \u00a7 197). Since there is nothing to rebut the assumption in the present case, the relevant period must be regarded as having ended on 19 October 2001, the day of the applicant\u2019s release pending trial (see, mutatis mutandis, X v.\u00a0Ireland, no.\u00a09429/81, Commission decision of 2 March 1983, DR 32, p.\u00a0226).
