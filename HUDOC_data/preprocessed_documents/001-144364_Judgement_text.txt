The case originated in an application (no. 5741/10) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Sanel Šemić (“the applicant”), on 18 December 2009.
The applicant was represented by Odvetniška Družba Matoz o.p. d.o.o., a law firm practising in Koper. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs T. Mihelič Žitko, State Attorney.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the conditions of his detention in Ljubljana prison amounted to a violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, and that he had no effective remedy in this regard as required by Article 13 of the Convention.
On 27 April 2010 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1) and to give priority to it under Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.
The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Ljubljana.
The applicant served his prison sentence in Ljubljana prison from 16 July 2009 to 31 December 2010, but he was released on 27 December 2010.
From 16 July 2009 to 23 September 2009 and from 24 February 2010 to 27 December 2010 the applicant was held in the closed section of Ljubljana prison. According to the applicant, five prisoners were being held in each of the cells where he was held during his detention. From 16 July 2009 to 23 September 2009 he was held in cell 6 (third floor) measuring 18 square metres (including a separate 1.72 square metre sanitary facility). The Government submitted that the number of prisoners held there varied between four and five. From 24 February 2010 to 2 April 2010 he was held in cell 130 (second floor) measuring 18 square metres (including a separate 1.72 square metre sanitary facility). The Government submitted that the number of prisoners held there varied between five and six. From 2 April 2010 to 5 October 2010 he was held in cell 132 (second floor) measuring 18 square metres (including a separate 1.72 square metre sanitary facility). The Government submitted that the number of prisoners held there varied between three and five. From 6 October 2010 to 16 December 2010 he was held in cell 117 measuring 17.66 square metres (including a separate 1.68 square metre sanitary facility). The Government submitted that the number of prisoners held there varied between two and five and that for the most part the applicant had more than four square metres of personal space. From 17 December 2010 to 27 December 2010 he was held in cell 123 measuring 17.47 square metres (including a separate 1.72 square metre sanitary facility). The Government submitted that the number of prisoners held there varied between four and six.
In the period between 23 September 2009 and 24 February 2010 the applicant was held in the semi-open section of Ljubljana prison, in cell 147 (third floor) measuring 18.8 square metres (including a separate 1.72 square metre sanitary facility).
The cells in the closed and semi-open sections contained, apart from the furniture, five to six sleeping places. Each cell had one 107 x 110 cm double casement window, which the prisoners could freely open or close.
The general characteristics of the cells in the closed and semi-open sections, material conditions inside the cells therein, sanitary conditions and health care are set out in the Court’s judgment Štrucl and Others v. Slovenia (nos. ,  and , §§ 21 to 32, 20 October 2011).
As to the out-of-cell time in the closed section, the Court found in the aforementioned judgment that sentenced prisoners in the closed section of the prison were locked up in their cells and were only able to leave them if they applied for certain activities, most of which were to take place in the recreation room. There was, however, only one 50square-metre recreation room per floor, which was to be used by ten inmates at most (Štrucl and Others § 86).
As to the out-of-cell time in the semi-open section, the Government submitted that the cell doors in the semi-open section of the prison were unlocked, except from 9.45 p.m. (on Fridays, Saturdays and before holidays from midnight) until 6.00 a.m. (on Saturdays, Sundays and during holidays until 8.30 a.m.). During this time prisoners could move freely in the corridor (35.7 square metres), living quarters of co-prisoners or in the indoor or outdoor exercise areas, in accordance with prison rules. The Government alleged that this regime had been in place for several years.
During his imprisonment the applicant had twenty-seven consultations with a general practitioner and two treatments by a dentist. He did not attend sessions with a psychologist.
As regards the cell temperature, the data provided by the Government showed that the average temperature in the cells in the late afternoon (5- 5.30 p.m.) in the second half of July and August 2009 had been approximately 28oC, exceeding 30oC on seven days.
