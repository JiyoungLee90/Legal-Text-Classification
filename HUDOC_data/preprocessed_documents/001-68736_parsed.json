There was a period of inactivity of some two years while the case was pending before the IAP, i.e. from 25 March 1993 when the applicant filed her appeal and 14 February 1995 when the IAP summoned the parties to a hearing. The Court does not overlook that the IAP had to decide on the applicant's request for reinstatement into the first-instance proceedings before deciding on her appeal. However, this does not sufficiently explain the duration of the appeal proceedings. Moreover, after the IAP had publicly pronounced its decision on 21\u00a0March\u00a01995, more than one year and eight months elapsed before the written version was served on 29\u00a0November\u00a01996. The Court is not convinced by the Government's argument that the authorities were not to be blamed for that period as the applicant could have complained to the  and the  against the IAP's decision before the delivery of the written decision. Rather, it finds that in order to enable the applicant to effectively exercise her defence, it was necessary to know the reasons on which the IAP had based its decision before a complaint with the  and  could be lodged. Thus, the Court considers that the authorities were responsible for this delay. Finally, one year and almost four months elapsed before the Administrative Court took its decision, namely from 20\u00a0May 1998, when the case was ready for a decision as the applicant had submitted observations in reply, and 13\u00a0September\u00a01999, when the Administrative Court decided on the applicant's complaint.",
