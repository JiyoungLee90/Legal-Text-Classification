The intelligence officer stated that the surveillance had been continuous until March 2005, when the M\u0130T had stopped it in order to wait for the entry into force of the new Criminal Code. However, when a bomb attack had occurred in March in Ku\u015fadas\u0131, killing a police superintendent, the M\u0130T had gone to the Sixth Division of the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court (\u201cthe Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court\u201d) to seek permission for the interception of communications.",

The M\u0130T had obtained permission to intercept all domestic or international telephone calls and communications provided between 8 April and 30\u00a0May 2005 by national telecommunications company T\u00fcrk Telekom, private mobile network operators and Internet providers and to obtain information contained in SMS, MMS, GPRS and fax communications, as well as caller IDs, correspondents\u2019 IP addresses and all other communication-related information.",

Relying on a number of newspaper and online articles, the applicant alleged that S.T. had decided that the records of all domestic and international electronic communications between 8\u00a0April and 30 May 2005 should be given to the M\u0130T by the telecommunications companies. The judge had made that decision in complete disregard of the legislation then in force and without carrying out any research or requiring proof. The impugned decision had been of a very general nature since it had not included the names of any suspects or indicated the date, location or address of people whose communications would be intercepted. As a consequence, any person, including himself, who had used a landline or mobile telephone to communicate between the above-mentioned dates, had been a victim of the impugned decision. The applicant maintained that the decision had violated his rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention and had also contravened Articles 20 and 23 of the Constitution, which protected private life and the freedom of communication respectively, since the accused had obtained records of his communications and restricted his freedom of communication without any justification. Lastly, the applicant contended that the implementation of the decision, which had been in contravention of section 2 of Law no. 4422, required the punishment of those responsible.",

Firstly, the Court will take into account the scope of the legislation permitting the secret surveillance measures by examining whether the applicant could possibly be affected by it, either because he or she belongs to a group targeted by the contested legislation or because the legislation directly affects all users of communication services by instituting a system where any person can have his or her communications intercepted. Secondly, the Court will take into account the availability of remedies at the national level and will adjust the degree of scrutiny depending on the effectiveness of such remedies (see, for a recent example, Szab\u00f3 and Vissy v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a037138/14, \u00a7\u00a7 37-40, 12\u00a0January 2016).",

Furthermore, for the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 24-30), the Turkish law in force at the material time did not provide for effective remedies for a person who suspected that he or she had been subjected to secret surveillance measures outside criminal proceedings as a result of domestic court decisions authorising such measures.",

However, Article 13 requires a remedy in domestic law only in respect of an alleged grievance which is an arguable one in terms of the Convention (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, 27 April 1988, \u00a7\u00a052, Series A no.\u00a0131). Thus, the effect of this provision is to require the existence of an effective remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d and to grant appropriate relief (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a0157, ECHR 2000-XI).",
