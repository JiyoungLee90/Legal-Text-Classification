At that time he had been asleep in his car parked at the square. Most of the demonstrators who were camping there were also asleep, but news spread that the police were in the vicinity and the demonstrators began to waken. The applicant was woken by his bodyguard and walked to one of the statues situated in the centre of the square. By then the police forces had already encircled the several hundred demonstrators based on the square. They started making a loud noise by banging their rubber batons against their shields, which spread panic among the demonstrators. Some of them managed to switch on the microphones and the lights on the square, whereupon the applicant addressed the demonstrators from a platform: \u201cWe see that police forces have arrived on the square. Please, do not have any contact with them and do not touch them. Please, keep your distance from them. Let us wait and see what they want from us. If they have something to tell us, we are ready to listen. Please, be patient and peaceful\u201d. The demonstrators followed his request and kept their distance from the police forces, which by then had surrounded the demonstrators with a triple cordon. Suddenly, without any prior warning or orders to disperse, the police forces, shouting loudly, had attacked the demonstrators, violently beating them with rubber batons and destroying the camp. In a matter of minutes the demonstrators were pushed out of Freedom Square. They tried to save themselves by fleeing from the police officers who chased, beat and kicked them brutally, regardless of their age and gender.",

After the square was cleared of all demonstrators, the Head of the SPD approached the applicant and ordered him to leave the square. The applicant refused to comply, saying that he would not leave the square voluntarily and that they could make him do so only by arresting him. After further attempts to make the applicant leave the square failed, the Head of the SPD forced the applicant into a car and took him to his house in Yerevan. Once there, he was not allowed to leave the territory of his house and garden. The roads to his house were blocked by special police forces, SPD officers, the road traffic police and other police units. Block posts were set up and all vehicles heading to and from his house were checked and searched. No one could reach the applicant or go in or out of his home without the permission of the special forces.

Firstly, the reason for the police operation of 1 March 2008 at Freedom Square had been the information obtained the day before by the law enforcement authorities, according to which a large number of weapons were to be distributed to the protesters to incite provocative actions and mass disorder in Yerevan. Members of the relevant police force had arrived on Freedom Square at around 7 a.m. to verify that information, but met with resistance from the demonstrators who had attacked the police officers with wooden bats, metal rods and stones. Secondly, once violence had erupted on Freedom Square, because his security was in danger the applicant had been surrounded on the platform by the Head of the SPD and other SPD officers and taken to the edge of the square, about 20 to 30 metres away, where he sat on a bench surrounded by SPD officers. After the assembly was terminated, the applicant, who was still sitting on the bench, was advised by the Head of the SPD to go home, but he refused. During that time a journalist freely approached the applicant, interviewed him and left. The applicant was then again advised by the Head of the SPD to go home, but did not respond. An SPD car then approached and the applicant got into the car voluntarily and was taken by SPD officers to his home in Yerevan. While being taken home, the applicant did not express any wish to go elsewhere. Later in the afternoon additional SPD and police forces were stationed near the applicant\u2019s house as part of special security measures employed on that day in respect of all persons under State protection, because of the escalating violence in Yerevan. For security reasons SPD officers were instructed to search everyone entering the applicant\u2019s house, but they were never instructed to prohibit anyone from entering the house or to prevent the applicant from leaving. The applicant expressed the wish to leave the house and to join the demonstrators near the French Embassy only once, on 1 March. He was told by the Head of the SPD that he was free to leave and go wherever he wanted, but the SPD would not be able to ensure his security in the area near the French Embassy and they would not accompany him there. The applicant did not wish to leave the house without State protection.",

He had been aware that the SPD, entrusted with the protection of his security, was taking him home after a violent clash at Freedom Square and he had not objected to that. Nor did he express the wish to stay at Freedom Square or to go elsewhere. While at home, the applicant was free to go anywhere, and it was he who refused to leave the house after SPD officers told him that they would not accompany him when he expressed the wish to join the demonstrators in the vicinity of the French Embassy. The applicant\u2019s presence at the hearing before the Constitutional Court was the result of his own free will, as opposed to any actions or decisions by the Constitutional Court or the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office. As regards the additional SPD and police forces which were deployed at the applicant\u2019s house on the afternoon of 1 March 2008 as a result of the escalation of violence in Yerevan, they were merely performing their duty of ensuring the applicant\u2019s security and they never barred his exit from the house or prevented anyone from entering.",

The Government argued that there had been numerous cases at the material time in which applicants had made successful claims in the Administrative Court against law enforcement authorities, and submitted copies of four judgments rendered by that court against the Armenian Police.

He had been removed without his consent only from the platform on Freedom Square and taken to a secure place about 20 to 30 metres away, for his own security, since violence had broken out on Freedom Square, but no force or compulsion had been applied to the applicant as he had left Freedom Square, nor any restrictions on his liberty or freedom of movement thereafter. In any event, even assuming that there was an interference with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, it was prescribed by law, namely Sections 6 \u00a7 3, 11 (2) and 12 (2) of the Act on Ensuring the Security of Persons Subject to Special State Protection. The interference, namely the security measures, was aimed at the prevention of possible crimes against the applicant since there was violent disorder at Freedom Square, and then later at home because all persons under State protection were affected by the security measures due to the security situation in Yerevan. The interference was necessary in a democratic society since it was normal practice in democratic societies to protect both current and former presidents and high-ranking officials, especially in emergency situations.",

At the same time, the Court does not have at its disposal any strong and unequivocal evidence which would corroborate those allegations and show beyond reasonable doubt that this was indeed the case and that the SPD acted in bad faith and abused its authority by restricting the applicant\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement under the guise of ensuring his security or otherwise. This issue was never examined before any domestic authority, while the above-mentioned reports, while undoubtedly worrying, are not sufficient by themselves to allow the Court to accept unhesitatingly the applicant\u2019s version of events.

The police officers had had no intention of terminating the assembly on 1 March 2008 and their sole intention had been to carry out an inspection for weapons, to which the demonstrators had reacted violently. The decision to terminate the assembly was therefore taken spontaneously in response to such violence. Thus, the interference was proportionate and necessary, since no democratic society could tolerate such aggressive behaviour and disorder from a large crowd. Moreover, the authorities had shown a very lenient approach to the assembly at Freedom Square by allowing it to take place from 20 February to 1 March 2008, despite the fact that it had been organised in breach of domestic law, and had thereby ensured the freedom of assembly of its participants.",

Turkey (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99 et al., ECHR\u00a02010). The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a034932/04, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a026839/05, \u00a7 109, 18 May 2010). Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999V).",

In this connection, the Government relied on Article 68 of the CAP. The Court notes, however, that, while the Government did produce copies of three judgments in support of their argument, nothing suggests that those judgments were rendered by the Administrative Court under the procedure prescribed by Article 68 of the CAP. In fact, it is explicitly stated in one of the judgments that the claim is lodged under Article 65 of the CAP, while the other two judgments are silent on this point. More importantly, all three judgments concern challenges lodged against interfering administrative acts, such as decisions taken by the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office prohibiting the holding of a rally, as opposed to any interfering actions taken by law enforcement authorities during a demonstration, including its dispersal or forcible termination. The Government have therefore failed to produce any examples of Article 68 of the CAP ever having been applied in a situation similar to the present case. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the applicability of that Article to situations such as the one at hand is not obvious from its wording either. In particular, while paragraph 3 of that Article does mention the possibility of seeking an acknowledgement of unlawfulness of an interfering administrative action, this applies only to an action which \u201cno longer has legal force\u201d and which an applicant has a legitimate interest to have acknowledged as unlawful depending on certain conditions listed under (a)-(c), none of which would appear to exist in the present case. It is therefore not clear whether Article 68 \u00a7 3 could apply to such police actions as the dispersal of an assembly, like in the present case. In view of such lack of clarity and the absence of any examples of domestic practice, the Court considers that the Government have failed to demonstrate \u2013 and there are otherwise no reasons to believe \u2013 that the applicant had an effective remedy in respect of the interference with his right to freedom of assembly.",
