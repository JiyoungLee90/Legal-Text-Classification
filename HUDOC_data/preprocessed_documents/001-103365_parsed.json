Poland, no.\u00a014255/02,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a055, 31 May 2007). Furthermore, according to the authorities, the likelihood of a severe sentence being imposed on the applicant created a presumption to that effect. It was therefore reasonable for the court to consider that the applicant was under considerable temptation to evade trial, especially in view of the heavy prison sentence to which he was liable. However, the Court reiterates that the gravity of the charges or the penalty cannot by itself justify long periods of detention on remand (see Michta v.\u00a0Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7\u00a7 49, 4 May 2006).",

This constituted an aggravating circumstance supporting the courts' decisions further extending his detention on remand, as the risk of his re-absconding was exceptionally high. This, in the Court's view, could be a factor justifying a relatively long period of detention. The domestic courts cannot be reproached for harbouring grave concerns that the applicant would, if released again, go into hiding. In view of the above, the Court is persuaded that the danger of absconding constituted, in the particular circumstances of the present case, a relevant and sufficient ground for refusing the applicant's applications for release (see, mutatis mutandis, Van der Tang v. Spain, judgment quoted above, pp. 19-20, \u00a7\u00a7 64-67).",

In this regard, it would observe that following the already lengthy investigation pending as of 14\u00a0January 1999, the trial started as late as 3 March 2003, the applicant remaining in hiding being a significant reason for that. Furthermore, the Court notes the difficulties entailed in trying a case of an organised criminal group which were also confirmed by a number of relevant factors such as the exceptional security measures taken and the special facilities provided (see paragraph 13 above).",
