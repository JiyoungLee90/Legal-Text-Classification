Under the new Act, religious communities could exist either as Churches or as associations carrying out religious activities (\u201creligious associations\u201d according to the terminology used by the Constitutional Court). The only entities which qualified as Churches were those listed in the Appendix to the 2011 Church Act and those classified as Churches by Parliament subject to certain conditions, originally until 29 February 2012. The constitutional basis of this regulation was provided by Article 21 \u00a7 1 of the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law, which vested in Parliament the power to identify the recognised Churches in the relevant cardinal law and to determine the criteria for the recognition of Churches that might additionally be admitted in the future. Formerly registered Churches could be converted, at their request, into associations and carry on their activities on that basis; however, under the new rules they were not entitled to any budgetary subsidies. Originally (under the 1990 Church Act), there had been 406 registered Churches, whereas the Appendix to the 2011 Church Act contained only fourteen. The Appendix, in force as of 1\u00a0March\u00a02012, lists twenty-seven Churches and Church alliances, giving a total of thirty-two Churches.

If, following examination by the committee, the organisation is found to meet all the statutory criteria, the committee submits a bill for the granting of \u201cincorporated Church\u201d status. Otherwise, it submits a motion proposing the refusal of the request, which must contain due reasoning. Parliament then decides whether to adopt the bill or the motion for refusal.

I would add that, in a sense, the freedom to exercise religion in community has even been extended, since in the case of legal persons, today as few as ten members, in contrast to the formerly required one hundred, may exercise their communal rights under the law on associations; associations are also entitled to 1% donations and, if they maintain institutions, the State may enter into contracts with them. Thus, under the European model, \u2018Church\u2019 status has no direct bearing on freedom of religion.

According to the Convention, religious organisations have to be protected, independently of their recognition by the Hungarian Parliament, not only when they engage in religious activity sensu stricto, but also when they, e.g., engage in community work, provided it has \u2013 according to settled case law \u2013 \u2018some real connection with the belief\u2019.

A merely procedural remedy is, however, clearly insufficient in view of the requirement of Article 13, taken together with Article 9 ECHR.

Such assessment had been introduced only by the 2011 Church Act, with the aim of preventing abuses resulting from this excessive deference to selfdefinition. The Constitutional Court, in decision no. 6/2013 (III. 1.), cited examples where the judicial authorities competent in matters of Church registration under the 1990 Church Act had carried out a review of the religious nature of the activities covered by the statutes of the self-defined Churches requesting registration; however, this review had not been systematic and there had been no legal definition of religion and religious activities; therefore, there had been divergent judicial practice in this field.

Moldova (dec.), no. 12282/02, 14 June 2005). However, in the present case the Court observes that the Government gave no reason for the requirement to scrutinise afresh already active Churches from the perspective of their possible dangerousness to society, still less the requirement to verify the content of their teachings, as required implicitly under the 2011 Church Act (see section 14, as amended, in paragraphs 29 and 32 above). Nor did they demonstrate any evidence of actual danger on the part of the applicant entities (compare Church of Scientology Moscow, cited above, \u00a7 93). The Court notes that by the material time the applicants had been lawfully operating in Hungary as religious communities for several years. There is no evidence before the Court that during that time any procedure had been set in motion by the authorities seeking to challenge the applicants\u2019 existence, notably on the ground that they were operating unlawfully or abusively. The reasons for requiring them to re-register should therefore have been particularly weighty and compelling (see Church of Scientology Moscow, cited above, \u00a7 96, and Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army, cited above, \u00a7 96). In the present case no such reasons have been put forward by the domestic authorities.",

This is particularly so in selecting the partners with which the State intends to collaborate on certain activities. The above prerogative of the State assumes even greater importance when it comes to public, societal tasks undertaken by religious communities but not directly linked to their spiritual life (that is, not related to, for example, charitable activities flowing from their religious duties). In this context, States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation when shaping collaboration with religious communities. At this juncture, the Court notes the particular context of Hungarian State-Church relations, and in particular the fact that Hungarian Churches were subjected to measures depriving them of their rights after 1945 (see the preambles to the two Acts cited in paragraph 33 above).",

These criteria have arguably placed the applicants, some of which are new and/or small communities, in a disadvantageous situation which is at odds with the requirements of neutrality and impartiality. As regards the question of the duration of religious groups\u2019 existence, the Court accepts that the stipulation of a reasonable minimum period may be necessary in the case of newly established and unknown religious groups. But it is hardly justified in the case of religious groups which were established once restrictions on confessional life were lifted after the end of the communist regime in Hungary and which must be familiar to the competent authorities by now, whilst just falling short of the required period of existence.

The Court notes in this connection that, in decision no. 6/2013 (III.\u00a01.), the Constitutional Court identified, in a non-exhaustive list, eight privileges conferred only on Churches (see points 158 to 167 of the decision, cited in paragraph 34 above).

Where a substantive Article of the Convention or its Protocols has been invoked both on its own and together with Article 14 and a separate breach has been found of the substantive Article, it is not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article 14 also, though the position is otherwise if a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7 89, ECHR 1999III, and Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, 22\u00a0October 1981, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 45).",

To be considered a manifestation in this sense, the act must thus be closely connected to the belief. Any State measure that impedes, directly or indirectly, the ability of an individual, whether alone or in community with others, to manifest his or her religion or belief in the ways espoused in Article 9 \u00a7 1 will constitute interference with that freedom and must be justified under paragraph 2 of the same Article.

The State thus has a duty under Article 14 of the Convention to remain neutral and impartial in exercising its regulatory power in the sphere of religious freedom and in its relations with different religions, denominations and beliefs (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116; Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97; and Savez crkava \u201cRije\u010d \u017eivota\u201d and Others v.

The obligation under Article 9, incumbent on the State\u2019s authorities, to remain neutral in the exercise of their powers in the religious domain, and the requirement under Article 14 not to discriminate on grounds of religion, require that if a State sets up a system for granting material benefits to religious groups, for example through the taxation system, all religious groups which so wish must have a fair opportunity to apply for this status and the criteria established must be applied in a nondiscriminatory manner on objective and reasonable grounds (see, mutatis mutandis, Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7 92, and \u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 v.

The 2011 Church Act \u201cchanged the status of all previously registered Churches, except those recognised Churches listed in the Appendix to the 2011 Church Act, into associations.

Russia, no.\u00a018147/02, \u00a7 78, 5 April 2007) where the \u201crefusal of registration\u201d disclosed interference with a religious organisation\u2019s right to freedom of association and also with its right to freedom of religion. On this basis, the Court concludes in paragraph 83 that the \u201cmeasure in issue ... effectively amounted to the deregistration of the applicants as Churches and constituted interference with their rights enshrined in Articles 9 and 11\u201d.",

Neither the 2011 Church Act nor its amendments had, in general, any impact on the legal personality status of the applicants. They were eventually not deregistered as such, only reclassified for the purposes of receiving State benefits or being eligible for cooperative agreements with the State, and they were not under threat of being dissolved through State action, with the exception of those Churches not declaring their intent to continue with their activities. Thus, the two previous cases of the Court which the majority cites in paragraph 82 of the judgment (see paragraph 11 above) do not have a bearing on the resolution of whether any interference occurred in this case.",

In the light of this Court\u2019s case-law on associative religious freedom under Articles 9 and 11, that should have been the end of the matter. Whether \u201cadherents of a religious community feel like second-class citizens, for religious reasons, on account of the State\u2019s less favourable stance towards their community\u201d (see paragraph 109), is immaterial for the purposes of Articles 9 and 11, if they are unimpeded in manifesting their religious beliefs, in form and substance, within legally recognised associations. It should be pointed out that the Court, citing a prior opinion by the European Commission, has consistently held that a \u201cState Church system cannot in itself be considered to violate Article 9 of the Convention\u201d (see Darby v. Sweden, 23 October 1990, opinion of the Commission, \u00a7 45, Series A no. 187, and \u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027).",

As is clear from the case-law of the Court, cited above in paragraph 9, an arguable issue under the Convention only arises in this regard if an applicant can demonstrate on the facts that in the exercise of its regulatory powers the State has withheld material benefits from a religious entity whilst providing benefits to others, and that this difference in treatment is not justified on objective and reasonable grounds. By its nature, an assessment of this kind under Article 14 of the Convention necessitates an individual examination of whether discrimination occurred. Therefore, the Court should have examined the applicants\u2019 complaint on the basis of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Articles 9 and 11 of the Convention. But the majority declined to examine this part of the complaint separately, a decision from which I dissented. Thus, I do not express my views on the Article 14 issue in this opinion.",
