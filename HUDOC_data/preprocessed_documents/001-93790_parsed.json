France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, and Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 44, ECHR 1999VI). The Court notes that parties had not submitted any documents as regards the proceedings after 12 September 2005, such as copies of the domestic judgments, the applicant\u2019s respective statements of claims or his application for annulment of the judgments (see \u00a7 16 above), nor even had they identified the court which had granted the request for annulment. Furthermore, neither the exact scope of the second applicant\u2019s claims in the proceedings which resulted in the judgment of 13 March 2007 nor the reasoning of the domestic courts (i.e. the particular method of calculation of the allowance used by them) was specified. It is unclear whether the claims had been granted in full or in part and, in the latter case, to which extent. In these circumstances, there is no basis on which the Court is able to conclude that the pecuniary award made on 13 March 2007 in respect of arrears for the period from 2000 to 2006 could be regarded as an acknowledgement and redress for the alleged breach of the applicant\u2019s Convention rights as a result of the quashing of the judgment in his favour.",

France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V, and Mifsud v. France (dec.), no.\u00a057220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002-VIII). The Court notes that the issue in the present case is whether the principle of legal certainty was infringed as a result of the quashing on supervisory review which is an instantaneous act and does not create a continuing situation, even if it entails a re-opening of the proceedings (see, mutantis mutandis, Sitokhova v.  (dec.), no.\u00a055609/00, 2 September 2004). In the present case, it was not demonstrated that the subsequent proceedings for recalculation of the pension was a remedy to exhaust in respect of the legal certainty complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Ryabykh v. Russia (dec.), no. 52854/99, 21 February 2002). The objection should therefore be dismissed.",
