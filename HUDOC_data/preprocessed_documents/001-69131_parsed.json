In the present case, the applicants claim that the expropriation decision was given in breach of the substantive provisions of the expropriation law. They seek annulment of this decision, arguing that the area of the property was smaller than 50 hectares provided for by law as the lowest threshold of properties subject to expropriation. They rely on a number of documents challenging the factual findings made in 1948 by the authorities, in particular the finding that the area of the property concerned did not exceed 50 hectares (see \u00a7\u00a7 14, 16 and 43 above). The Court notes that if the authorities established that the area of the property was indeed smaller than this expropriation threshold laid down by law, it could then be reasonably expected that they would declare the expropriation decision null and void.

In that case, the applicant complained that his rights as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and by Article 6 of the Convention had been violated in the restitution proceedings, conducted under the Czech Land Ownership Act of 1991, in that the national authorities had refused to grant the applicant\u2019s restitution claims and in that the restitution proceedings were unfair. When considering the complaint under Article 1 Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, the Court found that the particular claim raised by the applicant could not be regarded as giving rise to a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d, because he had not complied with the relevant substantive requirements laid down by the restitution law. Nonetheless, the Court pursued its examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6.",

The Court considers that the fact that the applicants did not have a legitimate expectation to have their property restored to them under the provisions of domestic law is sufficient to exclude the application of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of the Convention to the circumstances of the case. At the same time, it does not suffice to exclude a conclusion that, once a genuine and serious dispute concerning the existence of property rights arises, the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 become applicable (Kopeck\u00fd v.\u00a0Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2004-...).",

Had the applicants been successful, the expropriation decision would have ceased to have any legal effect. Thus, what the applicants seek in the proceedings which they launched in 1990, is not the re-opening of a case terminated by a final decision on the merits. The result they seek is to have the expropriation decision given in 1948 quashed by the competent administrative authority. The Court observes that such a legal result is a different one from that which is normally sought in proceedings concerning a request for the re-opening of a case. Accordingly, it cannot be maintained that Article 6 is not applicable to the proceedings on this basis.",

In this connection, the Court considers that the problems involved in the applicants\u2019 case are part of the process of transition from the former communist legal order and its property regime to one compatible with the rule of law and the market economy. Such a process, in the very nature of things, is fraught with difficulties. The Court reiterates in this respect that the Convention cannot be interpreted as imposing any general obligation on the Contracting States to restore property which was transferred to them before they ratified the Convention (Kopeck\u00fd v. Slovakia [GC], no.\u00a04912/98, \u00a7 35; Maltzan and Others v. Germany, nos. 71916/01, 71917/01, 10260/02, (dec.), \u00a7 74, 2 March 2005). Nor is there any general obligation under the Convention to establish legal procedures in which restitution of property could be sought. However, once a Contracting State decides to establish legal procedures of such a kind, it cannot be exempted from the obligation to respect all relevant guarantees provided for by the Convention, in particular by its Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

That court, by its judgment of October 1995, obliged the administrative authorities to give a decision within two months. This judgment was not complied with and no decision was rendered, either within the time-limit set out by the Supreme Administrative Court, or later. Subsequently, on 17\u00a0April 1996 the Ministry of Agriculture took steps in order to obtain evidence relevant for the legal assessment of the application. However, the proceedings were stayed in 1997 as the Ministry ordered that H.S. submit documents to prove her rights to the property (see \u00a7 20 above). The applicant\u2019s appeal against this decision was unsuccessful. Later on, on 6\u00a0August 1997, the applicant reiterated their arguments and requested that the proceedings be resumed. They argued that the civil law questions pursued by the Ministry were entirely irrelevant to the administrative case they had launched. Their efforts were unsuccessful, and the restitution proceedings have remained stayed ever since, essentially as a consequence of civil claims to the property having been raised at a late stage of the proceedings.",
