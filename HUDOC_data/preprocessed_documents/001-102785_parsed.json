The issue disputed by the parties - whether or not the applicant filed a pecuniary claim for damages in the criminal proceedings - is irrelevant for the following reasons. As instructed by the criminal court, the applicant brought separate civil proceeding for damages on 21 July 2003. Moreover, on 22 March 2004 he brought a civil action for damages against the State, while only on 10\u00a0February 2006 he made his claim for redress in the criminal proceedings, which was of no effect since he already instituted civil proceedings in this respect. Both civil proceedings were stayed shortly after they had been instituted, pending the outcome of the aforementioned criminal proceedings. Thus, it was only when those civil proceedings were instituted that the outcome of the criminal proceedings became relevant for the determination of the applicant's \u201ccivil right\u201d to compensation, thereby attracting the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 under its civil head to the criminal proceedings at issue (see Jake\u0161evi\u0107 v.  (dec.), no. 18584/05, 10 January 2008). The Government's objection in this respect must therefore be rejected.",

However, the complexity of the case cannot justify the fact that the proceedings have already been pending for seven years on two levels of jurisdiction and are now pending before the first-instance court. The Court notes that in the period falling within the Court's scrutiny, the first-instance court held only five hearings, whereas other scheduled hearings were adjourned due to the inability of the authorities to locate a witness and the non-attendance of the defendant's counsel and experts. Moreover, after a first-instance judgment had been adopted, the case was remitted for re-examination before a new panel of judges, which caused further delays in the proceedings. Although the Court is not in a position to analyse the juridical quality of the domestic courts' decisions, it considers that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is frequently ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings may disclose a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see, for example, Mami\u010d v.  (no. 2), no. 75778/01, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2006X (extracts); and Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.41431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25 November 2003).",

The applicant's requests before the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court were essentially aimed at remedying the violation of the Convention alleged before the Court and therefore the costs incurred in respect of these remedies may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2006V; and Medi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 49916/07, \u00a7 50, 26 March 2009). In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court awards the applicant a sum of EUR 821 for the costs and expenses incurred in the domestic proceedings and EUR 1,200 in respect of the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant on those amounts.",
