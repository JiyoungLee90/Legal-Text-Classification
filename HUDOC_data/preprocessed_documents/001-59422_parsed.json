The rules of court \u2013 the Family Proceedings Rules \u2013 ... came into force on 14 October 1991, which coincided with the coming into force of virtually the whole of the substantial provisions of the Children Act. I think I must approach this case in this manner. The Children Act itself \u2013 the preamble \u2013 says that it is an Act to reform the law relating to children. ... It was a consolidating Act, trying to bring together the various legislative Acts which had gone before, but it was a reforming Act in many senses. It took a great deal of time going through Parliament. I have no doubt at all that various interested parties and pressure groups gave evidence to various committees. I have no doubt at all that judges of family experience at the very highest level were consulted. During the course of its going through Parliament it would have been debated not only in the Lower House but in the Upper House, where all their Lordships of the House of Lords would doubtless have voiced an opinion on it. ... Not only was the Act a long time coming to the statute book, it was nearly two years before the bulk of it came into effect. During the course of that gestation period, rules of court were argued about endlessly, and the rules of court appeared virtually at the eleventh hour. They were not made until 1 May 1991. There is a long history to that, which is not relevant to this judgment. I can only assume, sitting here, that the question of whether or not children\u2019s cases should be heard in open court or in camera was and must have been anxiously considered at all levels during the course of the progress of this Act and the rules under the Act through Parliament. I can only read, and I do so read and interpret 4.16(7), which is the rule to which reference has been made, as being a direction \u2013 a rule of court \u2013 that hearings of family cases shall be heard and shall continue to be heard in chambers. ... I would want chapter and verse as to what should be put before the judge before he otherwise directs a hearing of a case in open court. I am not prepared in the course of this judgment to give myself any guidelines as to the sort of case that that might be. ",

Despite the arguments advanced by [the applicant], it is abundantly clear that the courts are bound by sub-rule (7) to hear child cases generally in private. That was obviously the intention of the Rules Committee and it follows the long-established practice in the hearing of child cases. Sub-rule (7) allows for all or part of the case to be heard in public. In the light of the long established practice it is unlikely that judges will, other than rarely, hear the evidence relating to the welfare of a child in public. The judgment is in a somewhat different position and it may be that the practice of giving judgment in private is partly due to the parties not asking for it to be heard in public and partly because in the county court, where the vast majority of children\u2019s cases are heard, it is less likely that there will be issues of public interest. Where issues of public interest do arise it would seem entirely appropriate to give judgment in open court providing, where desirable in the interests of the child, appropriate directions are given to avoid identification. If the case raises issues of principle or of law, the judgments are increasingly provided to the law reporters and are published in a large number of law reports which report family cases.

Turning to the facts before it, the Court notes that in the first applicant\u2019s case, although the county court judge in his ruling of 14 June 1996 appeared to consider that he had no power to order the hearing to take place in public, this misstatement of the domestic law was corrected on appeal, when Mrs Justice Bracewell held that there was a judicial discretion to hear such a case in public but that there was no reason to exercise that discretion in the applicant\u2019s case. Moreover, in his judgment of 23 July 1996 the county court judge explained that he had refused the application for a public hearing because he did not think that it was in the child\u2019s interests that the matter should be public (see paragraphs 14-16 above). Although before the Court the applicant has stressed his desire to alleviate his parents\u2019 anxiety about their grandson by allowing them to attend the hearing, in fact he did not appear ever to have expressly sought leave for them to attend the hearings before the judge in chambers. In the second applicant\u2019s case the judges at first instance and on appeal gave careful consideration and detailed explanations of their reasons for holding that the proceedings should continue in chambers (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above).",

In its original formulation in 1949, the draft of what became Article 14 of the Covenant was in similar terms to that of the present Article 6 of the Convention, the requirement that \u201cthe judgment shall be pronounced publicly\u201d being subject to no qualification. This stricter approach was explained as reflecting \u201cthe view that some of the factors which might justify a secret hearing would not justify delivery of the judgment in private\u201d (See Marc J. Bossuyt: Guide to the Travaux Pr\u00e9paratoires of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1987), p. 284). Following a proposal of the , an amendment was accepted in 1950 to add the qualification \u201cexcept where the interest of juveniles otherwise requires\u201d.

If the public may legitimately be excluded from the hearing for the purpose of protecting the interests of children or the private lives of parties to a matrimonial dispute, the requirement that the judgment should be pronounced publicly should not be interpreted in such a way as to undermine that protection. It seems to me that it is not a satisfactory answer to this point to argue that the judgment could be entirely anonymised so that it contained no details capable of identifying the parties or the children concerned and/or abridged to the point where only the operative part of the court\u2019s decision was made public. Even if such a course could be said to be adequate to protect the interests of the children or the parties concerned, it is difficult to see how the publication of a judgment so anonymised and",

Germany (judgment of 8 December 1983, Series A no. 72, p. 14, \u00a7 32), public delivery of a decision of a Supreme Court was held to be unnecessary, the requirements of Article 6 being met by the public pronouncement of the judgments of the lower courts. More immediately relevant to the present case, in Sutter, cited above, the Court held the requirements of Article 6 to be satisfied by the fact that \u201canyone who could establish an interest could consult or obtain a copy of the full text of the judgment of the Military Court of Cassation\u201d. It is true that Sutter has been subject to some extra-judicial criticism. Nevertheless, there is nothing in my view in the subsequent case-law of the Court to cast a doubt on the authority of the decision: on the contrary, the case was expressly cited without disapproval in Campbell and Fell itself and, more recently, in Sz\u00fccs and Werner, cited above.",
