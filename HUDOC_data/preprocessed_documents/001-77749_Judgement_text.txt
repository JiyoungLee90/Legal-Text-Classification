The case originated in an application (no. 41183/02) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a citizen of , Ms Ruža Jeličić (“the applicant”), on 19 August 2002.
The applicant complained that a final and enforceable judgment ordering the release of her “old” foreign-currency savings had not been enforced.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
A hearing on admissibility and the merits took place in public in the Human Rights Building, , on 28 June 2005 (Rule 54 § 3).
There appeared before the Court:
The Court heard addresses by Ms Ibrahimović and Mr Radulović, as well as their answers to questions put by Judge Mijović.
By a decision of 15 November 2005, the Chamber declared the application admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed further observations (Rule 59 § 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Association of Foreign-Currency Savers (Udruženje za zaštitu deviznih štediša u Bosni i Hercegovini), which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2).
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in .
Between 7 January 1977 and 31 January 1983 the applicant deposited in total 70,140 German marks (DEM) in her savings account at the then State-owned Privredna banka Sarajevo Filijala Banja Luka. In , as well as in other successor States of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“SFRY”), such savings are commonly referred to as “old” foreign-currency savings, having been deposited prior to the dissolution of the SFRY. The relevant background information on this subject is set out in detail in the Chamber’s decision on the admissibility of the present application (see Jeličić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 41183/02, ECHR 2005-XII).
On 31 December 1991 the balance in the applicant’s account, which included accrued interest, was DEM 235,924 (in the former SFRY, foreign-currency deposits earned high interest).
On several occasions in 1992 and 1993, the applicant managed to withdraw in total DEM 9,352, regardless of statutory restrictions which had been introduced in the late 1980s.
On 3 October 1997 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the Banjalučka banka, the legal successor of the Privredna banka Sarajevo Filijala Banja Luka, seeking the recovery of her entire “old” foreign-currency savings and accrued interest.
On 26 November 1998 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance established that the balance in the applicant’s account indicated above was DEM 295,274, including accrued interest. The court also found that the applicant had DEM 4,896 in another account at the same bank. The Banjalučka banka was ordered to pay the applicant, within 15 days, DEM 300,170 (approximately 153,475 euros (EUR)), default interest on the above amount at the rate applicable in the country of the currency (namely Germany) from 3 October 1997, legal costs in the amount of 9,076 dinars (approximately EUR 290) and default interest on the last-mentioned amount at the statutory rate from the date of the judgment.
On 5 February 1999 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance mistakenly held that the Banjalučka banka had not appealed against the judgment of 26 November 1998 and accordingly issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju). On 25 February 1999 the Banja Luka Court of First Instance established that an appeal had in fact been submitted. On 4 November 1999 the Banja Luka District Court rejected that appeal and the first-instance judgment of 26 November 1998 therefore became enforceable.
Meanwhile, the applicant filed an application with the Human Rights Ombudsperson, who referred the application to the Human Rights Chamber (the human rights bodies set up by Annex 6 to the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace).
On 12 January 2000 the Human Rights Chamber found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 arising from a failure to enforce the judgment of 26 November 1998. The Human Rights Chamber held the Republika Srpska responsible and ordered it to ensure full enforcement without further delay.
After the Banjalučka banka had failed to execute the judgment voluntarily, on 22 March 2000 the competent court sent a fresh writ of execution to the Republika Srpska Payment Bureau (Služba za platni promet Republike Srpske).
On 28 July 2000 the Supreme Court of the Republika Srpska rejected an appeal on points of law (revizija) against the judgment of 26 November 1998.
On 8 November 2000 the writ of execution was returned to the competent court, execution having been impossible on account of a statutory prohibition (see paragraph 24 below).
On 30 January 2001 the applicant converted part of her savings (DEM 20,000) into privatisation coupons under the Privatisation of Companies Act 1998. She subsequently sold those coupons on the secondary market, allegedly for DEM 9,000.
On 18 January 2002 the privatisation of the Banjalučka banka was completed and the applicant’s “old” foreign-currency savings became a public debt of the Republika Srpska pursuant to section 20 of the Opening Balance Sheets Act 1998.
On 7 March 2002 and 9 February 2004 the applicant converted a further part of her savings (EUR 20,452 in total) into privatisation coupons as before. She subsequently sold those coupons on the secondary market, allegedly for EUR 8,794 in total.
On 15 April 2006  took over the debt arising from “old” foreign-currency savings from its constituent units pursuant to section 1 of the Old Foreign-Currency Savings Act 2006.
The judgment of 26 November 1998 has not yet been enforced.
Enforcement of such judgments has been prevented in the Republika Srpska since 3 May 1996 in accordance with the relevant instructions of the government of the Republika Srpska (Odluka o obustavljanju isplate “stare” devizne štednje, Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska (“OG RS”) no. 10/96 of 27 May 1996, and Zaključak, OG RS no. 24/99 of 4 October 1999) and the following legislation:

Legislation of the Republika Srpska
This Act was in force from 23 July 1998 until 25 May 2006. The following were the relevant provisions:
Section 19(1) and (2) (as amended on 19 August 2003)
“A person who has ‘old’ foreign-currency savings in a bank located in the Republika Srpska and who is a citizen of the Republika Srpska at the date of the entry into force of this Act shall be entitled to coupons for the purchase of shares pursuant to this Act.
A person who is entitled to coupons in accordance with this section may decide to convert into coupons his or her entire savings or a part thereof.”
The privatisation coupons acquired in accordance with the above provisions were transferable; this included the possibility of selling them on the secondary market (section 22(2)). Any conversion into privatisation coupons was irrevocable (section 25(3)).
This Act has been in force since 12 November 2004. Section 10(3) provides that “old” foreign-currency savings may be used for the purchase of State-owned business premises and garages on condition that a minimum of 40% of the price is paid in cash.
