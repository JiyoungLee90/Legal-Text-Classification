Where the events in issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7\u00a7 151 and 152, ECHR 2012, with further case-law references).",

Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time.

They also contribute to the prevention of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article\u00a06, notably equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 53, Bykov v.

The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 100, ECHR\u00a02006IX).",

At\u00a0the same time, the lawyer himself stated that such a conversation had taken place before the first applicant\u2019s questioning on 28 June 2008 (see paragraph\u00a022 above).

If the court had sought at least to obtain a factual update on the matter, it would have noticed than meanwhile, on 11 June 2012, a higher-level prosecution authority had in fact stated that the origin of the first applicant\u2019s injuries had never been established and had therefore ordered a repeated forensic medical examination to that effect (see paragraphs 53-55 and 65-66 above).
