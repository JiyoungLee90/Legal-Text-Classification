The case originated in an application (no. 43874/06) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Halis Kulmaç (“the applicant”), on 28 September 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr N. N. Tarakçı, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 2 November 2010 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Istanbul.
On 19 July 1992 as a result of a car accident, the applicant’s car got severely damaged. However, the insurance company failed to pay the damages and the applicant brought proceedings before the Istanbul Commercial Court, claiming compensation.
Following two judgments which were quashed by the Court of Cassation, on 29 December 1998 the Istanbul Commercial Court partially accepted the case and held that the defendant company was to pay compensation to the applicant.
The applicant did not appeal against the judgment of the Commercial Court and was paid the total sum on 22 October 1999.
Subsequently, on 22 November 1999 the applicant initiated proceedings requesting reparation (munzam zarar) for his loss resulting from the delay in the payment of the compensation.
On 12 February 2002 the Istanbul Commercial Court dismissed the case. That judgment was quashed by the Court of Cassation on 13 January 2003.
Having examined the case again, on 14 September 2004 the Commercial Court partially accepted the case and awarded the applicant a certain sum of reparation.
On 30 January 2006 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. The applicant was notified of this final decision on 28 March 2006.
