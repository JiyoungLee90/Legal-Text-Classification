The objective protection afforded by the right of property is not undermined by the classification of the insurance contract as group insurance, in which the employees are mere beneficiaries, or in the assessment of their individual interests.  The argument that the public interest, and notably the interest of all employees in the consolidation of their pensions schemes, called for a reform of those schemes is plausible and is in any event not open to criticism from the point of view of constitutional law.  The interests of employees regarded as beneficiaries may be adequately protected by the organisations that represent them. In view of the superior interest of all civil service employees in having a sound and affordable pensions scheme, a collective defence of those interests would seem objectively appropriate, as it is the sole means of ensuring the necessary balancing of interests within the group.  Whatever the case may be, the objective substance of the right of property does not require additional protection of the individual beneficiary.  The same applies to the assessment of the merits of the new rules.  This is based on both the principle of proportionality and the need to protect confidence in the preservation of acquired pension rights.\" ",
