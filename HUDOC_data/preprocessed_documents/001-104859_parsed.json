The law does not allow the [civil] court freely to assess the evidence and requires that court, in order to abide by the criminal judgment, to regard as established the facts that that judgment has found to have occurred or otherwise. The criminal court\u2019s judgment is res judicata in relation to the matters mentioned in Article 222. That res judicata effect has to be taken into account by all courts and State authorities. It cannot be challenged when the criminal court\u2019s judgment has taken effect. It presupposes that the act that forms the subject matter of the criminal judgment and the act that needs to be established in the civil proceedings coincide. It does not matter whether the act has been perpetrated by the defendant to the civil action or is an act by a third party that has an effect on the defendant\u2019s liability. [The court] must treat as binding not only convictions, but also acquittals, in cases where they have established the lack of elements of the tort [in question]: for instance, the lack of an tortious act, [or] the lack of a causal link between the act and the damage [suffered by the claimant]. However, a criminal court\u2019s judgment does not need to be treated as binding where it has acquitted the defendant on the ground that his or her act was not criminal \u2013 an act, although not amounting to a criminal offence, may still be a tort. The binding effect of the criminal court\u2019s judgment relates to all elements of the criminal offence. When the amount of the damage is an element of the offence, the criminal court\u2019s findings as to that amount are binding on the court which rules on the civil claim. When the criminal court has made findings in relation to the amount of the damage caused because it was an element of the criminal offence of which a person has been accused, those findings are binding on the court determining the civil claim. [For instance,] in the case of a theft, where the sum of money stolen is an element of the criminal offence, the criminal court\u2019s findings as to that sum are binding in the civil case. [Similarly, in] the case of the offence of wilful mismanagement ..., the amount of damage caused is an element of the offence; in order for the impugned act to have constituted an offence, it must have caused significant damage. In order to determine whether the damage is significant, the criminal court must make findings as to its amount. That is why the amount of the damage featuring in the criminal court\u2019s judgment is binding [on the civil court].\u201d",

In particular, P.P. had not been properly interviewed. No attempt had been made to identify and question the driver of the Lada Niva. S.N. had been interviewed for the first time about a year after the accident, which had allowed him to concoct a favourable version of the events. No efforts had been made to verify S.S.\u2019s statement by, for instance, checking whether the BMW\u2019s spare tyre was missing. All expert reports had been ordered belatedly and had accordingly been unable to arrive at reliable conclusions. No serious efforts had been made to trace S.N. when he had gone missing between 1997 and 1998. No attempt had been made to test I.M.\u2019s and I.I.\u2019s statements. The emergency medical doctors and nurses had not been interviewed, and the BMW had not been inspected and preserved for further testing. None of these deficiencies had been rectified by the court hearing the application for judicial review of the decision discontinuing the proceedings because of the stance that it had taken as to its competence in such proceedings.

The Court has held, in relation to the medical sphere, that in case of deaths of patients in care, whether in the public or private sector, the above obligation calls for an effective judicial system which can determine the cause of death and bring those responsible to account (see Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002I; Vo v. France [GC], no. 53924/00, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2004VIII; and \u0160ilih v. Slovenia [GC], no.\u00a071463/01, \u00a7 192, 9 April 2009).

The Court must then take a comprehensive look at the procedures that were available to the applicant in relation to her son\u2019s death. There were two such procedures. The first was the criminal investigation opened by the prosecuting authorities; the applicant took part in it and brought a civil claim (see paragraph 24 above).

The authorities were faced with two conflicting versions on that point. The first was that of a direct eyewitness, P.P., who was not related to the accused and asserted that it was he who had been driving the car. The second was that of the accused, supported by three witnesses, I.M., I.I. and S.S., who were friends of his and were not direct eyewitnesses (see paragraphs 2529 above). It is beyond doubt that it is for the domestic authorities to determine such factual issues. The question, however, is whether they made a reasonable attempt to do so.",

While there was nothing inherently wrong with the stay (see Byrzykowski, \u00a7 116, and \u0160ilih, \u00a7 205, both cited above), the underlying delays in the criminal investigation were, as already noted, problematic (ibid., as well as, mutatis mutandis, Djangozov v. Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, \u00a7 38, 8 July 2004, and Todorov v. Bulgaria, no. 39832/98, \u00a7 48, 18 January 2005). As the Court observed above, the requirements of Article 2 cannot be met if the available remedies do not operate effectively within a reasonable time. Indeed, while the proceedings were stayed the applicant could not adduce any evidence, while at the same time, with the passage of time, the availability of such evidence greatly diminished. As noted above, the delay with which the criminal investigating authorities acted prevented the experts appointed by them from elucidating a vital aspect of the case. It is true that after the proceedings were resumed, the applicant did not take part in them and did not try to adduce evidence in support of her claim. However, it would not be realistic to expect her to do so after so much time had elapsed since the events.",

Romania, no. 32146/05, \u00a7 90, 16 February 2010). It is true that the court\u2019s approach could be explained by the applicant\u2019s failure to pursue diligently her civil claim after the proceedings were resumed, with the result that the court did not have before it any other evidence on which to base its ruling. It is also true that in an appeal against the trial court\u2019s judgment the applicant would probably have been able to obtain from an appeal court a ruling that the case should be examined on the basis of all the evidence, because under Bulgarian law a civil court is not formally bound by the findings that the prosecuting authorities make when discontinuing a criminal investigation (see paragraphs 6468 above, as well as Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 112, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII, and, in contrast, Tarariyeva v. Russia, no. 4353/03, \u00a7\u00a0101, 14 December 2006). However, it cannot be overlooked that an appeal would have consumed even more time, and that the applicant would have faced even greater \u2013 possibly insuperable \u2013 difficulties, many years after the events, to produce convincing evidence in support of her claim (see, mutatis mutandis, Atanasova v. Bulgaria, no. 72001/01, \u00a7 46 in fine, 2 October 2008, and Dinchev, cited above, \u00a7 50 in fine). In as much as the criminal investigation failed to shed sufficient light on the facts surrounding the death of the applicant\u2019s son, in practice the applicant was deprived of access to the effective judicial system required by Article 2 of the Convention (see paragraphs 72 and 73 above).
