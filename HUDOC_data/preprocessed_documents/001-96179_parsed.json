The more recent case submitted by the Government (the Ciorap case) does not change that conclusion, since it was not argued that the court could have ordered an immediate improvement of the conditions of detention. The proceedings would certainly have taken longer than the five days during which the applicant was detained. It is also noted that in the case mentioned above Mr Ciorap lodged an application with the Court (no.\u00a07481/06) in respect of what he considered to be a very low level of compensation awarded to him (3,000 Moldovan lei (MDL), equivalent of 181 euros (EUR) at the time) for confirmed acts of torture, failure to provide medical help and inhuman conditions of detention. In such circumstances and since Mr Ciorap's application is still pending, the Court cannot accept this case as clearly establishing a consistent domestic practice of effectively redressing any damage caused by violations of Article 3 of the Convention. Finally, the Court notes that in Malai v. Moldova (no. 7101/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045-46, 13\u00a0November 2008), it found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention on account of lack of effective remedies in Moldova against inhuman and degrading conditions of detention.

The Government submitted no evidence to substantiate their claim that \u015etefan-Vod\u0103 police station was different from all the other similar stations which the CPT had visited. The fact that the situation was generally bad throughout the country was confirmed by the CPT finding in its 2004 report that the budget allocated for feeding each detainee was EUR\u00a00.28 per day or 30% of the minimum calculated by the domestic authorities themselves. Again, this coincided with the applicant's claim that he had received very little food of very poor quality, and was moreover prevented from receiving any food from his family. In this latter respect the case was different from the case of Gorea v. Moldova (no. 21984/05, \u00a7\u00a7 47-51, 17 July 2007). Moreover, in that case the applicant was able to see his family and to benefit from a minimum of hygiene, which was totally absent in the present case. Finally, unlike in Gorea, the applicant in the present case suffered considerably from being unable properly to honour his mother's death in a church service and worried for the health of his family as he was its only breadwinner and they were very ill.",

More importantly, it follows from the statement made by the Government in response to the CPT report of 2007 that in 2008 the detention centre of \u015etefanVod\u0103 police station was one of those which had to be closed down by the Ministry of Internal Affairs since it did not correspond to legal requirements (see paragraph 31 above).

However, the applicant was detained there for five days. In this respect the present case is to be distinguished from Gorea, cited above.

He asked for witnesses to be heard and for the audio record and transcript of the hearing to be examined in order to verify his claim. However, the courts refused without giving any reasons for considering that I.M.'s version was true and without hearing a single witness. The Court considers that, in ignoring the evidence adduced to support the applicant's submissions and thereby to show that he had not insulted I.M., the finding of the Moldovan courts that he had uttered such insults could not be justified as necessary in a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7\u00a045-46, ECHR 2001II; Savitchi v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 11039/02, \u00a7 59, 11 October 2005, and Busuioc, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088).",

It recalls that it has previously found that terms such\u00a0as\u00a0\u201cneo-fascist\u201d, and \u201cNazi\u201d do not automatically justify a conviction for defamation on the ground of the special stigma attached to them (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v. Austria, no.\u00a039394/98, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2003XI). In Bodro\u017ei\u0107 v. Serbia (no. 32550/05, \u00a7 51, 23 June 2007), the Court repeated its view that the generally offensive expressions \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cfascist\u201d may be considered to be acceptable criticism in certain circumstances (see Bodro\u017ei\u0107, cited above; Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria (no.\u00a02), judgment of 1\u00a0July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV; Feldek v.\u00a0Slovakia, no.\u00a029032/95, ECHR 2001VIII). It further observed in the Bodro\u017ei\u0107 case that calling someone a fascist, a Nazi or a communist cannot in itself be identified with a factual statement of that person's party affiliation (see, mutatis mutandis, Feldek v. Slovakia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a086).",

Since the applicant participated in the meeting and saw that his family risked being refused once more the much-needed financial assistance, and despite having submitted all the required documents confirming their right to obtain it, he must have been in a state of despair and anger. His intervention shortly after that of I.M. was akin to one \u201cmade in the course of an oral exchange and not in writing, after careful consideration\u201d (see Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 48, 29 February 2000 and Raichinov v. Bulgaria, no. 47579/99, \u00a7 51, 20 April 2006). These considerations did not form part of the domestic courts' analysis.",

It must also be noted that the council meeting was held in camera, and there had been no media coverage of the incident. The Court recalls that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as regards a politician than as regards a private individual. In any event, the effect of his speech must in the circumstances have been minimal, especially given that all those present were well aware of the tensions between the applicant and I.M. and had heard the statements which had provoked the applicant's reaction (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikula v. , no. 31611/96, \u00a7 52 in limine, ECHR 2002II).",
