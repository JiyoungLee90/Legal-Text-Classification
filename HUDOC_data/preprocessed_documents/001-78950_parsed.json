The Court also notes a delay of approximately fifteen months caused by the stay in the proceedings awaiting the opinion of the  (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). The Court is not called upon to determine the reason for the delay in the preparation of the Constitutional Court's decision, because Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. , no. 30546/96, \u00a7\u00a057, 3 October 2000).
