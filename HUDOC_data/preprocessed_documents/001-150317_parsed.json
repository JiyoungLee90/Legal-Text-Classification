The indictment stated that the applicant had deceived M.K. into believing that he could assist her in preventing her husband from claiming ownership of her share of their joint property, namely the family house. The applicant had taken advantage of M.K.\u2019s age and naivety and persuaded her to sign a fictitious loan agreement stating that he would lend her 50,000 German marks (DEM), equivalent to 4,691,500 Slovenian tolars (SIT), which was to be secured with a mortgage on her share of the family house, despite the fact that M.K. did not owe him anything, which he was well aware of. For this purpose, the applicant had M.K. sign an authority form authorising him to take all measures necessary for the execution of the loan agreement. On that basis, the applicant had the mortgage against M.K.\u2019s property entered in the land register, prejudicing the value of her property in the amount of SIT 4,691,500. Moreover, M.K. paid the applicant SIT 225,000 in several instalments for the \u201cfavour\u201d he had done her.",

The objection was rejected by the pre-trial panel on 7 July 2000. The latter noted in its decision that the criminal offence should be reclassified as attempted fraud under Article\u00a0217\u00a0\u00a7 1 in conjunction with section 22 of the Criminal Code, as the value at issue did not reach the statutory threshold of significant pecuniary damage.

Thus, the legal requirements for trial in absentia had been met. The court examined M.K. and the two witnesses who had already been questioned during the investigation; their accounts corresponded to their previous statements. In her concluding remarks the district state prosecutor modified the indictment, reclassifying the offence to the actual criminal offence of fraud, rather than attempted fraud. She also added some details to the facts on which the indictment was based, in particular the allegation that the applicant had lied to M.K. that there would be expenses with regard to the entry of the mortgage in the land registry, for which she had paid him a total of SIT\u00a0225,000.",

It noted that the accused had the right to attend the summary proceedings, but that he was not obliged to do so. The court noted that the applicant had been heard during the investigation, had received the indictment and had been duly summoned to the hearing, where he would have had the opportunity to make a statement and examine witnesses against him. However, given that the facts of the case had been clear and fully established, the higher court took the view that the applicant\u2019s presence at the hearing had not been necessary. In this connection, the court held that a hearing should only be discontinued if the description of the criminal offence in the indictment, albeit based on the same factual elements as before, was substantially changed. In such a case, the defendant ought to be informed thereof and summoned to attend a new hearing. However, this was not the case in the circumstances complained of by the applicant.",

Furthermore, the hearing before the court did not bring to light any new information that had not already been uncovered during the investigation. Referring to section 442 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which sets out the conditions for conducting a hearing in absentia, the Supreme Court noted that the defendant had the right to attend the hearing, but that this right could under certain circumstances be waived. It also noted that the applicant had been duly summoned and warned that the hearing could be held in his absence. As regards the examination of witnesses during the investigation, the Supreme Court noted that while there were no indications in the case file that the applicant had been notified of it, this procedural breach had been remedied by the hearing at which M.K. and the other two witnesses had been re-examined. The applicant had had the opportunity to attend the hearing, but had waived his right.",

They both charged the applicant with misleading M.K. into concluding a fictitious agreement with him with the intent of acquiring illicit pecuniary gain. Observing that the indictment had been modified at the hearing, the Constitutional Court held that although the offence had been reclassified as actual fraud, and no longer as attempted fraud, the charge had remained the same in terms of content as regards the applicant\u2019s conduct and the circumstances in which the offence had been committed. Having regard to that, as well as the fact that the applicant had been duly summoned to the hearing and had failed to provide any valid reason for his absence, the Constitutional Court held that the local court had had no obligation to ensure the applicant\u2019s presence at the hearing. Moreover, the Constitutional Court observed that the applicant had not even alleged that the criminal offence which was the subject of the investigation was different from the one examined at the court hearing. He had merely drawn attention to the fact that \u201ca prosecutor may file an indictment for a completely different criminal offence after the investigation is completed\u201d. It was also found that the applicant could have requested an adjournment of the hearing, but did not do so, and instead had failed to appear without specifying any valid reason.

The request, initial indictment and the decision of the pre-trial panel had all been served on the applicant. The modified indictment, however, which the applicant had not been acquainted with but which had served as the basis for his conviction, charged the applicant with the offence of fraud (Article 217 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code).

As the applicant had raised an objection to the indictment, he had also been served with the decision of the pre-trial panel of the Ljubljana District Court establishing that the amount of unlawful advantage allegedly secured by the applicant could not constitute an offence of attempted aggravated fraud, but only attempted fraud under Article 217 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 22 of the Criminal Code, and that hence the jurisdiction over the case was therefore to be transferred from the Ljubljana District Court to the Ljubljana Local Court.

He had not provided any justification for his absence, nor had he proposed an adjournment of the hearing, although he had been warned in the summonses that the trial could be conducted in absentia.

Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on written notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him (see Kamasinski v. Austria, judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 168, pp. 36-37, \u00a7 79). The Court also points out that the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) must in particular be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In criminal matters the provision of full, detailed information concerning the charges against a defendant, and consequently the legal characterisation that the court might adopt in the matter, is an essential prerequisite for ensuring that the proceedings are fair (see P\u00e9lissier\u00a0and\u00a0Sassi v.

In this decision the offence he was charged with was reclassified to attempted fraud and the case was referred to the Ljubljana Local Court (see paragraph 9 above). Thus, the Court considers that the applicant could reasonably have expected to be summoned to appear before the latter court, regardless of the fact that the proceedings were commenced before the Ljubljana District Court. Moreover, the applicant himself acknowledged that the summonses to the hearing had included reference to the allegedly violated provisions of the Criminal Code, which had already been included in the decision of the pre-trial panel. In view of this, the Court is unable to accept the applicant\u2019s argument that he had lacked knowledge of what proceedings the summonses were referring to, especially since he did not allege that any other set of criminal proceedings concerning the same charge was pending against him at the time. In any event, the Court notes that the applicant received the summonses almost two months before the date of the hearing (see paragraph 11 above), and could therefore have brought any matter of controversy to the local court\u2019s attention sooner than one day before the hearing was to take place.",

In this connection, the Court notes that the distinction between attempt and completion of the criminal offence of fraud is whether the unlawful actions have or have not led to the acquisition of pecuniary benefit. In the context of the present case, the characterisation of the applicant\u2019s actions as either an attempted or an actual offence depended solely on whether or not his mortgage-secured claim giving rise to repayment obligations was considered an acquisition of a benefit. Thus, while the legal characterisation of the offence was changed at the trial, its factual description remained essentially the same. Moreover, considering the findings of the domestic courts as to the scheme executed by the applicant in order to make an unlawful gain (see paragraphs 8 and 12 above), in the Court\u2019s view there was little difference in the gravity of the initial and reclassified charge (see, a contrario, Miraux v. France, no.\u00a073529/01, \u00a7 36, 26\u00a0September 2006). Also, the Court observes that the reclassified charge did not aggravate the applicant\u2019s situation, as under domestic law an attempted offence was punishable within the limits of the sanction provided for a completed offence, although a lesser sanction could be imposed (see Article 22 of the Criminal Code in paragraph 20 above).",

In this connection, the Court is satisfied that all its relevant legal and factual aspects could be challenged on appeal and that, even if no hearing was held before the Ljubljana Higher Court, the applicant could have sought leave to attend the session of the panel in order to explain his views (see Articles 370 and 378 of the Criminal Procedure Act in paragraph 21 above). However, the applicant made no such request. Neither did he allege that the classification of his actions as presented at the hearing had been erroneous, nor did he complain that the reclassification of the charge had violated his rights of defence. In both his appeal (see paragraph 14 above) and appeal on points of law (see paragraph 16 above) the applicant merely argued that the statement he had given during the investigation did not suffice for the purposes of trial in absentia, as at the time an indictment against him had not yet been lodged. Hence, the appeal courts limited their examination to establishing whether during the investigation the applicant had been able to state his case on all the relevant facts which were the basis for the indictment. It follows from the Constitutional Court decision that in his constitutional complaint the applicant also reiterated his argument as above, but did not challenge the reclassification of the charge at trial. Having regard to this, and noting that the facts underlying the charge had not changed, the Constitutional Court confirmed that the applicant\u2019s presence at the hearing had not been necessary.",
