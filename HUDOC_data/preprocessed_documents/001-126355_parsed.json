In that connection they referred to the CT scan of 22 July 2004, which indicated the existence of an unidentified object in the applicant\u2019s left orbital area. The Court notes, however, that in its decision of 21 January 2009 the Supreme Military Administrative Court made no reference to that medical report. In its decision, the court merely stated that the applicant should have brought his case within five years of the commission of the act and did not take into consideration the date on which the applicant had learned of the damage (see paragraph 9 above). As a result, whether the applicant had learned of the bullet in his head in 2004 or 2007 had no effect on the domestic court\u2019s conclusion, as it was concluded that the time-limit for instituting compensation proceedings had expired on 25 September 1995.",

In this connection the Court notes that it is undisputed between the parties that the bullet in the applicant\u2019s head had not been noticed when he was wounded and was discovered only after he developed severe headaches.",

In the Court\u2019s view, in personal injury compensation cases, the right of action must be exercised when the litigants are actually able to assess the damage that they have suffered. Accordingly, as far as the Court is concerned, the applicant could not have submitted a compensation claim within five years of the incident, since the damage was determined only at a later date.",
