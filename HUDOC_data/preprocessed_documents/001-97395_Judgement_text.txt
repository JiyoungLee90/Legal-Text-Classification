On 18 April 2003 the Cherkassy Regional Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of 11 December 2002 and the additional judgment of 27 January 2003 and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh consideration.

On 8 July 2004 the Cherkassy Regional Court of Appeal upheld that judgment.
The applicant lodged an appeal in cassation with the Supreme Court against the judgment of 16 April 2004 and the ruling of 8 July 2004. According to the applicant’s submissions, he also challenged a number of the procedural decisions taken by the lower courts before the Supreme Court.
On 22 December 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal in cassation.
In respect of the applicant’s appeals in cassation against the procedural decisions, the Supreme Court informed him that they were not subject to appeal according to the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.

His efforts were to no avail.
