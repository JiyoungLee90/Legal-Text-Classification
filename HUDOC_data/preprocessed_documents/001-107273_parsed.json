Assessors who were vested with the authority to exercise judicial power were in principle governed by the provisions of the 2001 Act applicable to judges, subject to the exclusions enumerated in the same Act. Second, assessors adjudicated solely on the basis of the provisions of the law and within the framework set out by the applicable procedures. Decisions issued by them were legally binding and could not be challenged, reversed, remitted for re-examination or suspended by any organ of the executive. Furthermore, assessors had to meet the same requirements in respect of their integrity as judges and respect the principles of judicial ethics. Moreover, they took an oath before the Minister of Justice which was similar to the oath taken by judges.

It recalled that the \u201cofficer authorised by law to exercise judicial power\u201d was not identical with the \u201cjudge\u201d but had to nevertheless have some of the latter\u2019s attributes, that is to say he had to satisfy certain conditions each of which constituted a guarantee for the person arrested.

The Court went on to observe that this interpretation corresponded to the rationale of the judicial protection of an individual arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence which served to provide effective safeguards against the risk of ill-treatment and against the abuse of powers bestowed on law enforcement officers or other authorities (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 32, ECHR 2006X).",

Those elements, together with the nature of the charges brought against the applicant, appear to justify the media and political interest in the case against him (see Craxi v.

The Court does not accept this argument. It is true that in the context of a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention the possibility exists that a higher or the highest court might, in some circumstances, make reparation for defects that took place in the first-instance proceedings (see De Cubber v. Belgium, 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 86, and Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7 134, ECHR 2005XIII). However, the Court finds that the doctrine of rectification of defects which occurred at the first-instance level does not apply to the judicial control of a person\u2019s arrest or detention on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The logic and the rationale of the Article 5 \u00a7 3 review requires that it is the judicial officer who has to satisfy the various conditions as defined in the Court\u2019s case-law under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, in particular he must offer the requisite guarantees of independence from the executive and the parties (see Schiesser v. Switzerland, \u00a7\u00a7 31-32; McKay, \u00a7\u00a035; and Miros\u0142aw Garlicki, \u00a7 115, all cited above) This is supported by the fact that decisions on detention made by the \u201cjudge or other officer\u201d under Article 5 \u00a7 3 are normally enforced instantly, for which reason deficiencies cannot be effectively rectified on appeal. In addition, the Court notes that the applicant raised the issue of the status of the assessor and invoked Article 5 \u00a7 3 in his appeal against the detention order of 21\u00a0December 2007; however the  dismissed it.",
