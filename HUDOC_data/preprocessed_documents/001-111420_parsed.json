According to legal doctrine, where such clauses had not expressly been set out in the contract, there was a custom or implicit assumption that the lessee had a right to extension of the contract unless the lessor had an objective ground for refusing renewal. Some lease contracts contained clauses which gave the lessor a right to increase the rent at intervals, in order to compensate for inflation. However, pursuant to two Supreme Court judgments of 1988, such a right was granted even in the absence of any explicit contract clause to that effect.",

In the post-war area, limited resources for the purchase of real estate was one factor that made ground lease arrangements attractive for people who wanted to own a permanent home or a holiday home. For property owners, it was an expedient way of obtaining a steady income from their land without making any investments and an attractive alternative to selling the land, in a country with a small population on a vast territory and with moderate price levels. This might explain why such arrangements became so popular. There exist between 300,000 and 350,000 ground lease contracts (sixty percent for permanent homes and forty percent for holiday homes) in a population of 5 million people, the majority of contracts being for private homes (Proposal No.\u00a041 to the Odelsting (2003-2004), p. 11).",

However, this began to change around 1980, when real-estate prices started soaring. This was especially the case from the second half of the 1980s for property around the larger cities and in popular areas for recreation, but prices have continued to rise, in all parts of the country. A number of lessors then used the opportunity under the law to demand redemption, which resulted in many lessees being put in a difficult financial position (paragraph 46 of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 21 September 2007 in the leading case referred to at paragraph 16 below). Because of the dramatic increase in pressure on real-estate prices the legislator thought it necessary to intervene to protect the lessees\u2019 interests. This was done in 2004 by regulating the level of possible rent increases so that they could only reflect general inflation, not the rising cost of land.",

This was also the view of the legislators, see Proposal No.\u00a041 to the Odelsting (2003-2004), p. 55, quoted above, which assumes that the question of constitutionality must be decided by reference to Article\u00a097. A central point in this context is that the rules on extension intervene with a regulatory effect in a situation created by the parties themselves through the contract of ground lease. The agreement makes it necessary for the lessees to be permitted to maintain their buildings on the plot for a very long period of time after the agreed term of lease has expired. The statutory provision represents a regulation \u2013 with retroactive effect \u2013 related directly to the agreement, or, more precisely, to the restrictions contained in the agreement. In our legal tradition a subsequent regulation of this nature relating to a contractual relationship between the parties is assessed in relation to Article 97 of the Constitution, not in relation to Article 105. This is the case even where a regulation has resulted in a transfer of rights and obligations between the parties. This view must also be applicable in a case such as ours, even though the intervention in the agreement entails a transfer of disposal.\u2019",

They maintain that the insertion of such a clause would have been unnecessary had they anticipated that price regulation would follow index linkage. In my view, however, much weight cannot be attached thereto. In the 1960s it was difficult to predict that the prices of plots of land for holiday houses would increase considerably more than general inflation would indicate. It is most likely that when entering into the contract, the parties did not have any clear conception of what the material basis for regulating the ground rent should be.\u2019",

In my view, however, there is a crucial difference between the two situations: I refer to the elements already emphasised. In this connection, I especially note that concerning ground leases, such as those in question, where the life span of the building clearly exceeds the duration of the ground lease contract, the lessor has all along been aware that the extension of the contract would become an issue. When negotiating the terms of the extension of the contract, a lot would be at stake financially for the lessee. Despite the authority to expropriate in the Expropriation Act, there was a risk, as also indicated in Ot.prpr. no.\u00a041 (2003-2004), p. 54, second column, that the lessor would impose some quite oppressive conditions on the lessee. In such cases the lessors could not expect the legislator to refrain from price regulation when renewing ground lease contracts. I recall that when the ground lease contracts at issue were entered into, the establishment of ground lease contracts was price-regulated, and an increase in the ground rent required approval from the Price Board [prisnemnda].",

The case was occasioned by the enactment by the UK Parliament of a statute \u2018The Leasehold Reform Act 1967\u2019 which granted residents the right to redeem contracts for \u2018building lease\u2019 and \u2018premium lease\u2019. The former types of agreement had major similarities with Norwegian ground leases, the difference being that under these contracts, the house too belonged to the landowner. However, the residents had defrayed the cost of erection and paid a charge for the plot to the landowner. The new act provided that in the event of redemption, the residents should pay only for the value of the land. The plot would not be valued as a plot where a right of title to the house and land were grouped, but rather on the basis of what the landowner could be expected to sell it for with the encumbrance of a leasehold of at least 50 years\u2019 duration, should anyone else purchase the plot.

There were several arguments in favour of this. After the former rent control system was repealed on 1 January 2002, many lessees had been faced with dramatic unexpected rent increases. Although the contracts had initially been entered into on the basis of possible upward adjustment of the ground lease rent to reflect increases in the value of the property, the long period with a system for public rent control in force had led to a situation where lessees were used to a gradual increase in rent in accordance with the consumer price index. The increasing discrepancy between ground lease rents subject to rent control and those indexed to the increase in property prices made dramatic inroads into the household budgets of numerous families and single people, subject to the regime introduced on 1 January 2002. This price trend was also seen in the rental market, but in the rental market the increase was more gradual, and there was at any rate a difference between the ordinary rental market and the ground lease market in that the lessee had built his or her own house upon the ground in question for his or her own use.",

Limitations to the freedom of contract principle will be more noticeable in those older contracts containing ground value clauses. In most such contracts, which have been the subject of public regulation since the entry into force of the new Ground Lease Act 1 January 2002, the aforementioned proposed amendment to the act will entail downward adjustment of payable ground rent, bringing the rent back to its level at the time of the rent control scheme prior to 1 January 2002. A downward adjustment would undoubtedly be noticeable for lessors who have already adjusted the rent upwards to reflect the increase in property prices and also made arrangements accordingly. It should also be part of the overall consideration that section 15 of the Ground Lease Act has enabled more lessors to make profit on property that for years has accrued very low income in terms of ground lease rent because of the previous rent control scheme. The Ministry would also like to add that the survey undertaken in 2003 shows that the average level of rent charged, including rent subject to adjustment after 1 January 2002, corresponds to what was foreseen when section 15 was amended in 2000. The Ministry will therefore not support the introduction of a mandatory adjustment scheme linked to the consumer price index for older contracts on the basis of the rent charged at the time the contract was entered into.",

Since the Ground Lease Act entered into force a number of disputes have arisen regarding the interpretation of adjustment provisions in ground lease contracts. Part of the problem seems to be that many contracts were entered into without any party having envisaged the possibility of the dramatic increase in property prices that has been seen in recent decades, and its consequences for rent levels. In older contracts entered into by non-professional parties in particular, the wording of the contracts appears often to be haphazard and imprecise and thus of little use in determining questions that were not anticipated at the time. Such cases can naturally be left to the decision of the judiciary, but from the perspective of social economics it seems unfortunate to allocate such substantial resources to the settlement of such disputes, in terms of free legal aid and the workload on the courts. As the cases concern a significant social asset, namely the permanent or holiday homes of the lessees, considerable uncertainty may also be a source of unnecessary personal strain.",

[...] Such random effects can be avoided by introducing a provision that entitles the lessor to adjust the rent upwards once in accordance with the original contract and subject to limitations already in force under section 15, before the consumer price index adjustment scheme comes into effect. In this way the rent charged in the transition period is brought, by way of a one-off operation, to a level higher than that established under the prior rent control scheme repealed when the Ground Lease Act entered into force 1 January 2002. For more recently agreed ground lease contracts it will still be possible to agree upon a rent that reflects the value and appreciation of the land, but rent adjustment will subsequently be linked to changes in the consumer price index. Such a provision for older contracts will respect what has been agreed upon, while at the same time helping to achieve a uniform system of rent adjustment based on the consumer price index over time. This, it must be assumed, will result in fewer legal disputes and not give rise to unforeseen radical upward adjustments of ground rent.",

In the absence of absolute rules, the lessors will be faced with the choice between redemption, termination or continuation [of the ground lease contract].

The Ministry has considered whether the landowner should have a right to set new conditions in the agreement, but has found that the lessee should be able to continue the lease agreement on the same terms. According to the Ministry\u2019s assessment, social policy considerations on the side of the lessee should be decisive. If the lessor were to have the possibility to adjust the ground lease rent up to the market level, the lessees would in principle find themselves in the same financial straits as in the event of redemption where the costs of a loan exceed the annual ground lease rent.\u201d",

From a survey carried out by the Ministry of Justice and Police Affairs in 2002, it emerged that the repeal on 1 January 2002 of the rent control system under the former version of section 15 had resulted in many lessees seeing a dramatic, unexpected increase in the rent payable under contracts with ground value clauses. This had made drastic inroads into a number of families\u2019 and single persons\u2019 household budgets. It was further observed that clauses linking rent adjustment to the increase in property prices had often been conducive to conflict and might have ramifications unforeseen by the parties, hence the interest in avoiding legal disputes and ensuring foreseeability.

In the Government\u2019s submission, this significant political compromise should be taken into account by the Court, it being an example of democratic deliberation wholly in line with the ideal of an effective political democracy, which according to the Court in its 1998 judgment in the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, (30 January 1998, \u00a7 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I) was \u201cthe only political model contemplated by the Convention, and, accordingly, the only one compatible with it\u201d.",

In so doing the lessor would renounce the possibility of using the property for financial gain by any other means than by receiving the said rent.

That version, like its successor, contained a general rule, according to which adjustments to the rent should take into account developments in the consumer price index, and an exception to that rule (for lease agreements concluded on or before 26\u00a0May 1983) providing for upward adjustment according to other factors, notably the value of the land (so-called ground rent clauses), where this had been expressly agreed on between the parties, and fixing ceilings to such upward adjustment. Experience had shown that, in the period thereafter, many lessees had seen a drastic upward adjustment of their ground lease rents for which they were unprepared. As mentioned above, as the gap between rents subject to rent control and price increases in the housing market widened over time, this (partial) lifting of rent control had made substantial inroads into the household budgets of many families and single persons. In the Bill to Parliament special attention was given to the particular provision in section 15 governing rent adjustment under contracts containing ground value clauses, which, it was observed, concerned a minority of ground lease contracts. The solution favoured by the Ministry and adopted by Parliament was a rule permitting a one-off upward adjustment for contracts with ground value clauses, followed by the introduction of an adjustment scheme linked to changes in the consumer price index. In the Ministry\u2019s opinion balancing the interests of the lessors and those of the lessees required that there should be no intervention in rent adjustment clauses in existing contracts other than what would follow from this proposal.",

Although it was for the lessee to pay the tax, as if he or she owned the property, the comparison nonetheless illustrates the striking contrast. Any adjustment to the rent would be limited to taking into account changes in the consumer price index.

However, in the first place, it is unable to share the latter\u2019s view that the following question ought to be taken as the starting point for this assessment: \"[W]hether the fact that in the event of an extension the lessor does not have the right to regulate the ground lease upwards to an amount that reflects the actual land value means that the arrangement contravenes this Convention provision\" (paragraph 125 of the judgment). While this reflected a demand put forward by lessors in negotiations with lessees prior to the amendment of section 33 of the Ground Lease Act, it did not reflect the contents of this provision. This was so because section 33 in effect prohibited any rent increase (beyond what followed from consumer price index regulation in accordance with section 15). The lack of proportionality in this case was caused by the various factors highlighted in the Court\u2019s reasoning in paragraphs 128 to 134 above, not by the fact that the lessors could not claim market rent in the case of an extension of the lease contract. Secondly, the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis seems to have been based essentially on the Court\u2019s judgment in James and Others (cited above). However, that judgment dealt with a situation which in many respects was different from that at issue in the instant case. In its reasoning above, the Court has relied on it only in so far as it has deemed it relevant to the concrete circumstances of the case and has had regard also to several more recent rulings referred to from its case-law, representing jurisprudential developments in the direction of a stronger protection under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",
