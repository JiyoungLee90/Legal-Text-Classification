The CPT has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when, as is frequently the case, the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions ... Large\u00adcapacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.",

Even if the applicant, who at the relevant time was still being held in detention on remand, had been successful, it is unclear how the claim for damages could have afforded him immediate and effective redress. In the absence of such evidence and having regard to the above-mentioned principles, the Court finds that the Government did not substantiate their claim that the remedy or remedies the applicant had allegedly failed to exhaust were effective ones (see, among other authorities, Kranz v.

The existence of such a deplorable state of affairs in IZ-33/1 may also be inferred from the information contained in Order No. 7 of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences of 31\u00a0January 2005 (see paragraphs 104-106), which expressly acknowledges the issue of overcrowding in IZ-33/1 and states that, on 1 July 2004, the detention centre had a capacity of 507 inmates and in reality housed 1,009\u00a0detainees.",

In this respect, the Court cannot accept the certificate of 19 March 2008 issued by the prison administration as sufficiently conclusive, as it lacks any reference to the original prison documentation and is apparently based on personal recollections and not on any objective data (see Igor Ivanov v. Russia, no. 34000/02, \u00a7 34, 7 June 2007, and Belashev v. , no. 28617/03, \u00a7 52, 13 November 2007). Furthermore, it finds irrelevant the Government's reference to the conclusions of the domestic courts made in the course of the detention and trial proceedings (see paragraphs 84, 86 and 89), as the domestic courts in those proceedings were not empowered to make any factual findings in connection with the applicant's complaints about his conditions of detention and it does not appear that they even attempted to make any such findings.",

The investigation of the case involved investigative activity with forty witnesses and five victims and resulted in a case file running to fifteen volumes. Moreover, there was a risk that the applicant would abscond from the investigation and trial in view of the gravity of the charges against him for offences punishable with long custodial sentences. The courts had also taken into account that the applicant had no permanent place of residence in Russia, that he was an Azeri national and that he had no personal ties or steady income in . Less stringent preventive measures, such as compulsory residence, could not be applied in the absence of any permanent place of residence.

However, the Court has repeatedly held that, although the gravity of the charges or the severity of the sentence faced is relevant in the assessment of the risk of an accused absconding, reoffending or obstructing justice, it cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. , no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80 and 81, 26\u00a0July 2001). This is particularly true in the Russian legal system, where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of whether the evidence obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 180).",

As the Court has previously observed, the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of criminal activities may be accepted as the basis for detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (see Ku\u010dera v. , no.\u00a048666/99, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2007...

However, after the evidence has been collected, that ground becomes less justified. In particular, as regards the risk of pressure being put on witnesses, the Court reiterates that for the domestic courts to demonstrate that a substantial risk of collusion existed and continued to exist during the entire period of the applicant's detention, it did not suffice merely to refer to an abstract risk unsupported by any evidence. They should have analysed other pertinent factors, such as the advancement of the investigation or judicial proceedings, the applicant's personality, his behaviour before and after the arrest and any other specific indications justifying the fear that he might abuse his regained liberty by carrying out acts aimed at falsification or destruction of evidence or manipulation of witnesses (see W. v.

It is however necessary, among other conditions, for the danger to be a plausible one and for the measure to be appropriate, in the light of the circumstances of the case and in particular the past history and the personality of the person concerned (see Clooth v.\u00a0Belgium, 12 December 1991, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 225). On the facts, nothing in the criminal case or the applicant's personal profile indicated that he had been previously involved in any criminal activity or that, given the nature of criminal charges brought against him and the fact that all presumed members of a criminal group were being tried along with the applicant, he was likely to continue his criminal activities.

The Court also observes that the authorities were largely inactive in 2005, that hearings were rare from December 2005 to February 2006 and that the period between May and November 2006 remained unaccounted for. Furthermore, the appeal proceedings were pending for more than seven months. Although the Court does not underestimate the danger of organised crime, especially when it concerns aggravated robbery, and the overall complexity of this particular case, it cannot but conclude that the length of the proceedings is attributable primarily to the lack of diligence and expedition on the part of the domestic authorities in dealing with the case (see also the Court's conclusions under Article 6 in paragraphs 173-180 below).",

At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, if the detention is confirmed by a court it must be considered to be lawful and not arbitrary, even where an appeal is available (ibid.). Subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention (loc. cit.). Therefore, the Court is less concerned about the speediness of proceedings before the court of appeal where the detention order under review has been imposed by a court, provided that the procedure followed by that court was of a judicial nature and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees.",

However, in the absence of any concrete and specific evidence justifying the delays point by point, the Court is not persuaded that such obligations should have required periods of up to three months, as they did in the present case. The Court considers that such delays cannot be considered compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 108; Mamedova, cited above, \u00a7 96; and Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 198 and\u00a0204).

The case was returned to the prosecutor on two occasions. One of the co-accused, D.G. K., was seriously ill and it was impossible to proceed with examination of the case in his absence. In addition, delays had been caused by the need to secure the attendance of Russian to Azeri translators, the occasional illnesses of five\u00a0different lawyers representing the co-accused (fifty-three days in total), the occasional illnesses of three of the co-accused, including the applicant, and the acts of co-accused G., who had deliberately protracted the proceedings by slashing his wrists and whose mental health thus had to be examined.",

Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7 88, 7 April 2005). The Court cannot uphold the Government's argument that the applicant went beyond the limits of legitimate defence by lodging unsubstantiated requests.

The Court also observes that only one fully fledged hearing was held in 2005, that there were few hearings between December 2005 and February 2006 and that the Government failed to account for the period between May and November 2006.
