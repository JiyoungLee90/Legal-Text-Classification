The case originated in four applications (nos. 2982/05, 5991/05, 9546/05 and 24130/06) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Russian nationals (“the applicants”). The applicants’ details and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants complained, inter alia, of the quashing of binding and enforceable judgments in their favour by way of the supervisory review procedure in force between 2003 and 2008.
On various dates indicated in the Appendix these complaints were communicated to the respondent Government.
By letter of 4 October 2007, the widow of Mr Valentin Aleksandrovich Kvitov, Ms Dolores Fedorovna Kvitova, informed the Court that her husband had died on 11 April 2007 and that she wished to pursue the application on his behalf.
By letter of 4 December 2008, the mother of Mr Viktor Vyacheslavovich Markov, Ms Nela Alekseyevna Markova, informed the Court that her son had died on 6 June 2008 and that she wished to pursue the application on his behalf.
On various dates the applicants brought civil actions against the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, seeking to recover the monetary value of State promissory notes for purchases of Russianmade cars.
The first-instance courts found in the applicants’ favour. Those judgments were upheld on appeal and became final. They were subsequently quashed by supervisory review courts upon applications lodged by the Ministry of Finance on the grounds of incorrect application of substantive law (for more details, see the Appendix).
All the judgments in the applicants’ favour remained unenforced until the date of their quashing.
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure in force between 1 February 2003 and 7 January 2008 is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
