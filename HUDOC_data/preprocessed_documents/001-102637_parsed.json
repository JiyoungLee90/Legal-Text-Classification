Neutral material or material damaging to the defendant need not be disclosed and should not be brought to the attention of the court. Only in truly borderline cases should the prosecution seek a judicial ruling on the disclosability of material in its hands. If the material contains information which the prosecution would prefer that the defendant did not have, on forensic as opposed to public interest grounds, that will suggest that the material is disclosable.

Entrapment ... is an instance where such misuse may occur. It is simply not acceptable that the State through its agents should lure its citizens into committing acts forbidden by the law and then seek to prosecute them for doing so. That would be entrapment. That would be a misuse of State power, and an abuse of the process of the courts. The unattractive consequences, frightening and sinister in extreme cases, which State conduct of this nature could have are obvious. The role of the courts is to stand between the State and its citizens and make sure this does not happen.\u201d",

In the present case, the decision of the disclosure judge to hear the prosecution's ex parte application for non-disclosure had been made after a full inter partes hearing. At the inter partes hearing the disclosure judge had invited the applicant and his co-accused to provide him with information as to the nature of their defence. In his ruling of 13 September 2002 the disclosure judge had also made it clear that he would be prepared to reconsider the question of disclosure in light of the defence case as it had been presented. The applicant had not given evidence and no other evidence was called on behalf of the defence. This was significant because the prosecution case was based on depositions which had been served on the defence in advance of trial and which had been seen by the disclosure judge. The sole issue in the case always had been whether the applicant had been in possession of the items in question when the police began their pursuit of the vehicle or whether he had been entrapped (or, more accurately, \u201cset-up\u201d) by the police. The disclosure judge had full regard to the applicant's right to a fair trial and fully understood the nature of the defence case; he had found that there was nothing relevant in the non-disclosed material. The defence case at trial was the same and nothing was advanced that might have prompted reconsideration of disclosure. The position at the end of the trial was no different from the position as it had been before the disclosure judge. It was incorrect to suggest, as the applicant had, that further disclosure was in the hands of the prosecution; the defence too could have applied for review of the decision not to order disclosure under section 14A of the 1996 Act. Further safeguards, such as providing the disclosure judge with daily transcripts, were not necessary as they would only have catered for the speculative possibility that a new line of defence may have emerged. In light of the disclosure judge procedure, the applicant's trial was fair even though special counsel had not been appointed; as the disclosure judge had found (and the Court of Appeal had agreed) the appointment of special counsel had not been necessary. The Government therefore submitted that the case bore a strong similarity to Jasper and Fitt, both cited above; Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247B; and I.J.L. and Others v. the , nos. 29522/95, 30056/96 and 30574/96, ECHR 2000IX. In those cases no violation of Article 6 had been found on the basis that the question of disclosure in each case had been determined by a court fully apprised of the issues and after hearing detailed submissions from the defence.",

This Court had referred to the ability of the Court of Appeal to remedy defects in disclosure at first instance, for example in Atlan v. the , no. 36533/97, 19 June 2001; Edwards, Dowsett, and Botmeh and Alami, all cited above.

The need for disclosure was at all times under assessment by him (see paragraph 56 of the Jasper and paragraph 49 of the Fitt judgment).",

Where the trial judge is not able to rule on the disclosure issue, the lack of fairness at first instance can be remedied on appeal only where the Court of Appeal orders full, or virtually full, disclosure to the defence. Thus the Court found no violation of Article 6 in Edwards and I.J.L. and Others, both cited above, because, although the prosecution did not disclose material evidence at the trial, there was full disclosure to the defence before the appeal hearing and the Court of Appeal considered the impact of the new material on the safety of the conviction and did so in the light of detailed argument from the applicant's lawyers. The same conclusion was reached in Botmeh and Alami, cited above, where undisclosed material in the hands of the United Kingdom Security Service had not been made available to the prosecution or trial judge. The undisclosed material had been first considered by the Court of Appeal in an ex parte hearing, a summary of the material had then been disclosed to the applicants well in advance of the appeal hearing and the applicants had been able to make submissions on the basis of it. The Court of Appeal had also been able to observe that there was nothing of significance before it that had not been placed before the trial judge (paragraph 43 of the judgment) and had been able to consider the impact of the new material on the safety of the applicants' convictions (paragraph 44 of the judgment).",

Finally, even where the necessity of disclosure is determined by the trial judge, the requirements of Article 6 will not necessarily be satisfied. For example, in Edwards and Lewis, cited above, each applicant complained that he had been entrapped into committing the offence by one or more undercover police officers or informers, and asked the trial judge to consider whether prosecution evidence should be excluded for that reason. In each case the judge, who subsequently rejected the defence submissions on entrapment, had already seen prosecution evidence which might have been relevant to the issue. In Mr Edwards' case, the evidence produced to the trial judge and Court of Appeal in ex parte hearings included material suggesting that Mr Edwards had been involved in drug dealing prior to the events which led to his arrest and prosecution. During the course of the criminal proceedings, the applicant and his representatives were not informed of the content of the undisclosed evidence and were thus denied the opportunity to counter this allegation, which might have been directly relevant to the conclusions of the trial judge and another judge who considered the matter that the applicant had not been charged with a 'State-created crime' (a requirement of entrapment). In Mr Lewis' case, the nature of the undisclosed material had not been revealed, but the Court considered that it was possible that it was also damaging to the applicant's submissions on entrapment. Under English law, where public interest immunity evidence was not likely to be of assistance to the accused, but would in fact assist the prosecution, the trial judge was likely to find the balance to weigh in favour of non-disclosure. In those circumstances, the Court did not consider that the procedure employed to determine the issues of disclosure of evidence and entrapment complied with the requirements to provide adversarial proceedings and equality of arms or incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the accused. It therefore found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in each case (see paragraph 46\u201348 of the Grand Chamber's judgment, reproducing and endorsing paragraphs 42\u201359 of the Chamber's judgment).",

In applying those principles to the present case, the Court recognises the specific circumstances of criminal justice in , the need for Diplock courts and the procedures which have evolved in a system where the trial judge is both tribunal of fact and tribunal of law. It also considers that, subject to appropriate appellate review, the appointment of a disclosure judge would, in principle, meet the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In particular, the strength of the disclosure judge system is that it avoids the prejudice that would arise if the trial judge were required to consider undisclosed material yet does not leave the question of disclosure entirely to the discretion of the prosecution. The Court also notes that the disclosure judge system avoids the problem, highlighted in Edwards and Lewis, of the trial judge making a finding of fact on a defence submission of entrapment having already seen prosecution evidence which might be relevant to the issue.",

The Court considers that this was an appropriate course of action for him to take, not least because the statement of reasons did not disclose the contents of the undisclosed material. No criticism can therefore be made of the trial judge who took care to ensure he did not see anything which might be prejudicial to the defence. Indeed, the Court observes that the applicant himself does not complain that his trial was unfair because the trial judge read the statement of reasons.",

It was only prosecuting counsel who had knowledge of both and who was in practice able to refer the matter back to the disclosure judge if he felt it necessary. This, the applicant submits, was an inadequate safeguard.",

First, in contrast to Rowe and Davis, Atlan, and Dowsett, cited above, in the present case, all documents which might reasonably be expected to assist the applicant's defence and for which public interest immunity was claimed were submitted by the prosecution to the disclosure judge. The defence were not only informed of this fact but at an inter partes hearing made detailed submissions on the facts of the case and on the nature of the defence case, namely that the applicant had been \u201cset-up\u201d by the police. At that hearing, the disclosure judge, who was fully aware of the issues in the case, concluded that none of the undisclosed material was relevant to the defence and that he did not anticipate any circumstances which would result in the material becoming of value to the defence. He noted that there were two types of material involved: the first could not assist the applicant since it was prejudicial to him; the second related to police procedures, was general in nature and content and did not relate directly to the applicant. Moreover, the disclosure judge was given an opportunity to reconsider his ruling when the case came before him to consider, inter alia, whether it would be necessary to appoint a special counsel. The Court notes that, after a further inter partes hearing, the disclosure judge reiterated that he could foresee no circumstances in which the undisclosed material would be of assistance to the defence and did not regard the case as requiring the appointment of a special counsel. Nonetheless, the disclosure judge was careful to note that, if the defence were to advance a proposition or raise an issue that might, by a remote possibility, touch on the undisclosed material and make it of use to the defence, the prosecution could be relied on to alert the trial judge with a view to referring the case back to the disclosure judge. In this connection, the Court notes that the defence case advanced at the trial was essentially that which had already been indicated to the disclosure judge. The applicant has been unable to point to any instance in the course of the trial where, as a result of any change in his defence, it would have been appropriate for the prosecution to have referred the matter to the disclosure judge. The Court further notes that there is nothing in the case-file to indicate that the applicant was hindered by the non-disclosure in his cross-examination of the numerous police witnesses with a view to establishing that he had been \u201cset-up\u201d.",

Both were found to be unnecessary to cater for the \u201cpurely speculative possibility\u201d that a line of defence might emerge. No new line of defence had emerged and nothing had appeared that suggested that material characterised by the disclosure judge as wholly irrelevant to the applicant's defence might suddenly have become relevant. The Court considers that the Court of Appeal was justified in finding that all steps necessary to safeguard the applicant's interests in relation to disclosure were taken. In view of the clear conclusion of the disclosure judge that there was nothing in the withheld material which could assist the defence, the Court considers that the fact that the absence of a continuous monitoring of the situation by persons other than prosecuting counsel to provide against a purely speculative possibility of a change in the situation did not result in any unfairness.",

Indeed, in the rather particular circumstances of this case, it may well have been desirable for the Court of Appeal to have examined the undisclosed material in order to satisfy themselves that no unfairness had arisen during the course of the trial by reason of the non-disclosure. However, for the reasons it has given, the Court does not consider that there were any such deficiencies in the course of the applicant's trial. Consequently, the fact that the Court of Appeal did not examine the undisclosed material cannot in itself amount to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1. Moreover, the Court accepts the Government's submission that the applicant did not invite the Court of Appeal to examine the material and thus the Court of Appeal cannot be criticised for failing to consider the undisclosed material of its own motion.",
