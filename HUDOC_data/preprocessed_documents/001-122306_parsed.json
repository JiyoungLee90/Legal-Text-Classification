On the other hand, the appeal judges rejected the requests to have other procedural steps declared void, including the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody and their subsequent placement under formal investigation. They considered that the applicants had not been detained in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In their view, the relevant international and national documents were vague about the nature and form of the coercive measures for which they provided, particularly in terms of detainees\u2019 rights and supervision by a judicial authority within the meaning of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1. However, they considered that the applicants had been taken into police custody and placed under formal investigation on the basis of evidence which did not result from their detention at sea. Moreover, they considered that Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention had not been violated, pointing out that the period of deprivation of liberty at sea had been justified by exceptional circumstances linked to the inevitable time required for the vessel to reach a French port. They added that the requirements of the investigations justified the individuals\u2019 placement in custody for forty-eight hours before being brought before a judge responsible for detention matters, given the number of persons concerned and the need for interpreters for the different acts and steps in the proceedings.",

In view of the length of that period, without judicial supervision, there was no justification for subsequently placing the applicants in police custody for the initial forty-eight hours; moreover, the specific circumstances of the case meant that the promptness requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention was even stricter than in a situation where the beginning of police custody coincided with the initial deprivation of liberty.
