It went on to say that Mr Ziri\u2019s death was potentially due to decompensation of pre-existing pulmonary and cardiac conditions in a context of acute alcoholism, stating that each of the pulmonary and cardiac lesions taken separately could have been a cause of sudden death, especially in association with inebriation.

In his report of 15 April 2011, Dr P. observed that the successive expert opinions had ruled out, on the one hand, a medical cause of death \u2013 either by decompression of pre-existing pulmonary and cardiac pathologies in a context of acute inebriation, or by an inhalation of the gastric contents into the bronchial system capable of creating acute asphyxia \u2013 and, on the other hand, a traumatological cause in spite of the multiple bruising, in the absence of major traumatism, notably cranial. He upheld the hypothesis of a cardiac repercussion of an acute hypoxic episode. He relied in this connection on the statements of the police, who said that they had been forced to immobilise Mr Ziri by acts of restraint. Such restraint was capable of leading to respiratory blockage and therefore a difficulty, or even an impossibility, of oxygenation during a certain period, likely to result, in an elderly person, a greater hypoxic repercussion than in a young person, as well as cardiac arrhythmia. According to the expert, the autopsy data and the anatomical pathology analyses made this hypothesis likely. He also took the view that the treatment of Mr Ziri at the hospital had been \u201cin accordance with normal practice\u201d. He concluded as follows:",

It further noted that the statements of A.K. to the effect that Mr\u00a0Ziri had sustained such acts of violence were not only contradictory but also contradicted by those of individuals who had been present at the time of the arrest and by those of a man who had met him in Argenteuil police station.

Relying on a skills-based pedagogical approach, these training courses, which are both theoretical and practical, cover professional situations and simulation exercises which put trainees in comparable situations to those that they will face in the course of their professional duties. ...\u201d",

Following those incidents, a National Police instruction \u2018concerning the removal by air of irregular migrants\u2019 prohibited the double-seated embrace. \u2018In order to prevent medical risks due to the state of excitation of the deportee and the need to restrain him in the aircraft, the practice of non-regulatory actions, including compression of the chest, bending of the torso, and binding-together of the limbs, is strictly prohibited. However, this text only deals with deportations. During a meeting with the ACAT in June 2015, an advisor from the office of the Minister of the Interior stated that, overall, \u2018the double-seated embrace technique is absolutely prohibited because it has irreversible consequences\u2019. He cited by way of reference a 2008 IGPN instruction which purportedly prohibited this technique in any police intervention. However, despite several requests, the ACAT has been unable to gain access to this instruction. In any event, the ACAT has been following several cases in which the double-seated embrace technique is suspected or established to have been used.

They observed that the Court of Cassation had defined as follows the \u201cserious fault\u201d required for that provision to be engaged: \u201cany deficiency established by a fact or a series of facts resulting in the inability of the public service of justice to fulfil its mission\u201d (Plenary Court, 23 February 2001, no. 99-16.165). They produced a judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal of 19 May 2015 which, upholding a judgment of the Paris tribunal de grande instance of 5 June 2013, found the State liable on that basis on account of the death of an individual in his cell while in police custody, noting that he had not been informed of his rights, including his right to request a medical examination, and indicating that the night-time surveillance had been insufficient. They also produced a judgment of the Bastia tribunal de grande instance of 22 March 2016 finding the State liable following the suicide of an individual in police custody, inferring a serious fault from the fact, combined with the lack of effective surveillance, that the person\u2019s shoelaces, which he had used to hang himself, had not been taken away from him. The Government argued that the applicant had sought to engage the responsibility of the State before the Court, and that, unlike the course of action provided for in Article\u00a0L.\u00a0141-1 of the Code of Judicial Organisation, the remedy that she had used, namely a criminal complaint against the police officers concerned, did not have the purpose of determining such responsibility but rather the criminal liability of the officers.",

In such cases, an applicant who has brought before the domestic courts a complaint based on those provisions, while seeking to join the criminal proceedings as a civil party, will in general meet the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies (see, for example, Tek\u0131n and\u00a0Arslan v.

France, no. 57671/00, \u00a7\u00a7 39-41, ECHR 2004IX; De Donder and De Clippel v. Belgium, no. 8595/06, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62, 6\u00a0December 2011; Tek\u0131n and Arslan, cited above, \u00a7 68-71; and, implicitly, Boukrourou and Others v. France, no. 30059/15, 16 November 2017). The Court thus finds that, where such a mechanism exists, an application to join the proceedings as a civil party before the investigating judge or the criminal courts is a logical and effective means of complaining about such facts. A civil party intervention is fully consistent with the logic of the specific procedural obligation that Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention impose on States, namely to conduct, of their own motion, an official and effective investigation capable of establishing the causes of death and identifying and punishing those responsible, in order to guarantee that the State agents or bodies responsible will be held to account (see paragraph 105 below). Moreover, the filing of a criminal complaint with the investigating judge, as a prospective civil party, triggers the opening of a judicial investigation. The search for evidence as to the facts complained of is then entrusted to an investigating judge who, for that purpose, has much more efficient means than those to which an individual may have access. This mechanism thus allows the victims of acts constituting a serious criminal offence to increase their prospects of obtaining redress for the damage thus caused to them (see De Donder and De Clippel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62).",

She took the view that it had not been \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d to use this technique; the police officers in the vehicle could have arrested him and called for back-up, which would have been adapted to the offence in question \u2013 resistance and rebellion \u2013 and would have put an end to the risk, especially as the police station was nearby. Referring to the judgment in Ta\u00efs v. France (no. 39922/03, 1 June 2006), she observed that the Government had not provided any means of establishing that the use of this technique was proportionate in the light of the circumstances (her father\u2019s age, the offence for which he had been arrested, his level of aggressiveness, the fact that he was already handcuffed). She pointed out that the burden of proof was on the authorities, who were required to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation. She observed, moreover, that the use of this technique had given rise to much controversy. She referred in this connection to the report entitled \u201corder and force, investigation into the use of force by law-enforcement officers in France\u201d published on 14\u00a0March 2016 by the ACAT (see paragraph 47 above), according to which that technique was capable of causing postural asphyxia and had been responsible for several deaths. The practice had thus been banned in France in the context of deportations. She further referred to a note from the National Police Inspectorate of 8 October 2008 (IGPN/BAD/SA/08-1577-D), which stated that any compression had to be for the shortest time possible and released as soon as the individual was constrained by the appropriate regulatory means, and that any face-down immobilisation had to be kept to a minimum, especially if the person was already handcuffed.",

On the first point, the applicant referred back to her previous arguments, comparing the case of her father \u2013 use of the double-seated embrace technique for about five minutes against a 69-year-old who was already handcuffed \u2013 with the case of the applicant in the Saoud case (cited above), who died after being held down on the floor for thirty-five minutes in a position likely to lead to death by \u201cpostural\u201d or \u201cpositional\u201d asphyxia. On the second point, the applicant indicated that her father\u2019s condition had been worrying when he arrived at the police station, as he had only been semi-conscious on account of his high alcohol level and his lack of oxygenation following the use of the impugned technique. The images taken from the video recording of his arrival at the police station purportedly showed this, and in the applicant\u2019s submission this was confirmed not only by the report of the National Commission for Security Ethics but also by the statements of two of the officers present. She pointed out that, nevertheless, the decision to transfer her father to hospital had not been taken until about thirty minutes after her arrival at the police station, during which time he had been left on the floor, with his arms handcuffed behind his back, lying in his vomit; he had then been kept in a stationary vehicle for forty minutes, still handcuffed behind his back; he had thus not arrived at hospital until 10.05 p.m. (according to the police officers) and 10.09 p.m. (according to the hospital register), thus one hour and twenty minutes after his arrival at the police station in a worrying condition.",

They indicated that his immobilisation had proved necessary on three occasions: when he was arrested, when he was being driven to the police station, and when he got out of the police vehicle on his arrival at the police station. They noted that three witnesses had testified to his aggressive behaviour and to the moderation shown by the police at the time of the arrest, and that A.K., who had been accompanying him, had acknowledged that he had not seen any blows. They observed that the maintaining of the applicant\u2019s father in the \u201cdouble-seated embrace\u201d position for part of the journey sought to counteract the danger that his aggressive attitude represented for both the police officers in the vehicle and other road users. They added that the video recording of the arrival at the police station showed that it was because of his resistance that he had been forcefully extracted from the vehicle, then carried onto the premises. In their view the officers had used technical immobilisation positions that were consistent with their training, and were necessary and proportionate.",

They observed that all the experts had put forward three contributing factors: age, a history of cardiac and respiratory weaknesses and a very high alcohol level. They added that it was impossible to assert that the immobilisation actions in the vehicle and at the police station had contributed to the death, especially in view of the fact that, as noted by the Investigation Division of the Rennes Court of Appeal in its judgment of 12 December 2014, all the police officers who were questioned, like the witness A.K., confirmed that he was alright until his arrival at hospital.",

They also noted that he was conscious when he was at the police station and on his arrival at the hospital to which the police took him when they saw that he was vomiting.

It explained that, after A.K. had spat at the driver, one of the police officers in the vehicle, fearing for the safety of all the occupants, forced down his head and chest; and that in so doing he left space between himself and Ali Ziri, who took advantage of this to try to head-butt him, thus triggering, for the same safety reasons, the intervention of one of the other officers who, turning round on his seat, grasped Mr Ziri under the armpits and held his head down against his knees. The Investigation Division emphasised that, while Ali Ziri was probably unsuccessful in his attempted head-butt, on account of his corpulence and the fact that he was handcuffed, the above-mentioned agitation was likely, in view of his drunkenness and restlessness. It added that his state of extreme agitation inside the vehicle was confirmed by the fact that the driver, unusually, had placed a call by radio to request the opening of the gate to the police station courtyard, which was normally opened by a member of the patrol who would get out of the vehicle to type in the access code, and that it was also confirmed by the testimony of the officer who was in the porch waiting for the patrol to arrive. It further indicated that the statement of the officer who had been driving the vehicle, and the audio recording of the messages exchanged, enabled the time during which A.K., then the applicant\u2019s father, were restrained in that way to be estimated at three to four minutes.",

A twenty-six-year-old man, upon his arrest, had been handcuffed with his arms in front of him and several police officers had used their body weight to keep him pinned to the ground on his stomach. Two police officers had held him by the wrists and ankles while a third had placed his outstretched arms on the man\u2019s shoulders and his knee in the small of his back.

She further observed that the discontinuance decision of 15 October 2012 had omitted a number of crucial elements: it did not mention that the double-seated embrace technique had been used against her father during his transfer to the police station or the conditions in which he remained for almost an hour and fifteen minutes inside the station, and it only cited Dr\u00a0P.\u2019s forensic assessment in ruling out the liability of the hospital staff whereas that report had been crucial as to the existence of a causal link between the death and the immobilisation actions taken by the police. She noted that the two judgments of the Investigation Divisions of the Courts of Appeal of Versailles and Rennes had not addressed these criticisms of the discontinuance decision. The applicant also noted that no investigating court or judge dealing with the case (investigating judges, investigation divisions and criminal division) or any of the parties (civil parties and public prosecutor) had viewed the video recordings of the arrival at the police station.",

In particular, while they did not dispute the fact that the investigating judge had not personally carried out the investigative acts, the Government took the view that the applicant had failed to show how the use of warrants for evidence to be taken on commission and the rejection of some of her requests had hindered the search for the truth. They emphasised that the investigative acts had been carried out by departments that were separate from that of the police officers involved in the arrest: the regional criminal investigation department (Direction r\u00e9gionale de la police judiciaire \u2013 \u201cDRPJ\u201d) of Versailles, and the National Police Inspectorate (Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la police nationale \u2013 \u201cIGPN\u201d). Thus, they observed, the three arresting officers had been questioned by the IGPN, whose role was precisely to ensure that police officers complied with the laws and regulations and with the code of ethics of the national police force. In their view, the applicant had failed to show how it had been necessary for them to be interviewed by the investigating judge in person, in the light of the interviews already conducted. The Government added that it had not been established that it would have been useful for the discovery of the truth for the video of the arrival at the police station to have been viewed in the manner suggested by the applicant. They observed in this connection that the images which had been extracted from the video recording (which lasted for one minute and twenty seconds) and had been added to the judicial investigation file \u2013 to which the applicant had had access \u2013 allowed the viewer to understand the sequence of events, and that the recording had been used by the IGPN when taking evidence under a warrant of 29\u00a0September 2009. The Government further pointed out that the use of domestic remedies had made up for the lack of reasons in the discontinuance decision and in the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 28\u00a0February 2013: the Court of Cassation had quashed the judgment for that reason and had remitted the case to another court, the Investigation Division of the Rennes Court of Appeal, whose judgment of 12 December 2014 had contained comprehensive reasoning.",

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. Since often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death in such cases are largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities, the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings, such as a criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings and proceedings for the exercise of remedies available to victims and their families, will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation, which must be independent and impartial (see, for example, Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no.\u00a050385/99, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2004XI).",

Secondly, the authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard.

The Court would observe, however, that all the acts were carried out under the authority and supervision of that judge. It further observes that the applicant has not called into question either the independence or the impartiality of the IGPN or those of its members who gathered evidence under the relevant warrants (see, mutatis mutandis, Fernandez Kerr v.\u00a0Belgium, no. 19328/09, \u00a7 70, 26 September 2013). It also notes that the investigating judge did play a proactive role in the investigation, as is attested for example by the fact that he requested a complementary autopsy following the report of Dr L. and Dr T. of 20 July 2009, and subsequently transmitted the file to the public prosecutor seeking a supplemental application for an extension of the investigation (see paragraphs\u00a024-25 above).",

The analysis of a video recording constitutes a line of investigation which is clearly important (see Armani Da Silva, cited above, \u00a7 234).

More generally, the proceedings lasted for a total of six years and eight months, when taking as the endpoint the judgment of the Court of Cassation of 16 February 2016.
