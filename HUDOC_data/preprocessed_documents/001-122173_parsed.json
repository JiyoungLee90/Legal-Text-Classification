Neither was there any concrete proof that he could exert influence on other parties to the criminal proceedings if released. Lastly, the applicant maintained that he had already been detained for eighteen months. For ten of those months he had been denied any contact with his wife and family. Although at the time of appeal, his wife could visit him for one and a half hours a month under the supervision of a guard, because of the applicant\u2019s status as a person charged with a crime (as opposed to a convicted person), conjugal visits were not allowed. Thus his status had placed him in a significantly worse situation than that of a convicted criminal. The applicant argued that long-term visits were physiologically necessary for both him and his wife, and that the lack thereof amounted to torture and was a method of extracting a confession.",

The appellate court observed that, although it was true that the detention had been lengthy and had already lasted more than eighteen months, the maximum statutory limit of eighteen months was only applicable to detention during pre-trial investigations. This case had been forwarded to the trial court for examination; the law did not provide for any limitation on the length of detention once a case was being examined by the trial court. As to the applicant\u2019s argument about breach of the presumption of innocence, the courts\u2019 findings that the applicant had been implicated in the criminal acts were not the conclusion as to his guilt, but merely statements that there was sufficient evidence that he had committed the crimes for the purpose of deciding whether he should be held in detention. The question of his criminal liability was to be decided later, when the trial court adopted an accusatory or exculpatory judgment. Lastly, given the seriousness of the charges against the applicant, the public interest prevailed against his right to presumption of innocence and his other rights. It followed that the applicant\u2019s argument that he had been discriminated against compared with a convicted person as regards the right to receive conjugal visits was unfounded.",

Nevertheless, on 15\u00a0June 2007 he had been returned to the Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison to be detained pending investigation. Observing that the Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison had refused his request on the basis of the Law on Pre-trial Detention, the applicant argued that the aim of pre-trial detention measures should be not to punish or correct a person, but to guarantee that the proceedings run smoothly. He reiterated his argument about his entitlement to the presumption of innocence and argued that as a convicted person, he had been entitled to conjugal visits under the Code on the Execution of Sentences. For the applicant, the provisions of the Law on Pre-trial Detention barring detainees from receiving conjugal visits were in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. On the merits of his complaint, the applicant added that the absence of physical contact with his wife had been causing him physical and mental suffering.

The court also noted that under point 124.2 of the Internal Regulations for Pre-trial Detention Facilities convicts who, like the applicant, had been transferred to a pre-trial detention facility from a prison pending pre-trial investigation in another case could receive conjugal visits.

Those regulations restrict some of his rights and freedoms with the aim of achieving a timely and unobstructed investigation of the criminal case by eliminating any possibility to convey information to other persons, which could obstruct the objective investigation of the case.

Lastly, even though in accordance with point 124 of the Internal Regulations for Pre-trial Detention Facilities, convicts who, like the applicant, had been transferred to a pre-trial detention facility from a prison pending pre-trial investigation in another case could receive conjugal visits, this right could be substituted by short visits if the remand institution did not have facilities for a conjugal visit.

In that connection, they also referred to the domestic courts\u2019 case-law, in which the Supreme Court had explicitly established that the unreasonable length of pre-trial detention could constitute its unlawfulness, and that the courts, in deciding on the unlawfulness of detention, should also examine the matter in the light of Article 5 \u00a7 3 requirements (see paragraphs 62\u201366 above). The Government pointed out that in that civil case, the Court of Appeal had awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by unreasonably long detention.

That being so, the applicant\u2019s detention had not been in breach of the above provision. The courts had given relevant and sufficient reasons for holding the applicant in custody. The Government recalled that the applicant had initially been suspected of only three counts of theft of high value property and of belonging to a criminal association. However, he had later been charged with further multiple episodes of theft and other criminal acts. The case was very complex and the case-file voluminous. The severity of the sentence that might have been imposed on the applicant also had to be taken into account, as well as the fact that the applicant had refused to give evidence and had denied the charges brought against him.",

Although in both sets of criminal proceedings the applicant was charged with somewhat similar crimes, they concerned different criminal associations and, except for D.S. and the applicant, different persons were accused and convicted. The Court also recalls that a period of an applicant\u2019s detention should be regarded as a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d as long as the detention has been effected in the same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions (see Ananyev\u00a0and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 78, 10\u00a0January 2012). Short periods of absence during which the applicant is taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no influence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant\u2019s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d. Complaints about the conditions of detention must be lodged within six months of the end of the situation complained about or, if there is an available domestic remedy, of the final decision in the process of exhaustion (see, most recently, Yefimenko v. , no. 152/04, \u00a7 72, 12\u00a0February 2013).",

On this point the Court reiterates the Convention organs\u2019 constant case-law to the effect that an action for damages cannot be seen as an effective remedy in respect of complaints under Article 5 \u00a7 3 about the excessive length of time spent on remand (see Woukam Moudefo v. France, no. 10868/84, Commission decision of 21 January 1987, DR 51, p. 73; Egue v. France, no. 11256/84, Commission decision of 5 September 1988, DR\u00a057, p. 60; Tomasi v.\u00a0France, judgment of 27 August 1992, \u00a7 79, Series\u00a0A no. 241A; Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v.

Slovakia, no.\u00a014893/02, \u00a7 38, 6\u00a0September 2007). In all those cases, the main basis for such a decision was that the right to obtain release and the right to obtain compensation for a deprivation of liberty in breach of Article 5 are two\u00a0separate rights, enshrined respectively in paragraphs 4 and 5 of that Article. That distinction is also relevant for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1. This line of reasoning is of particular importance where the person concerned is still in custody. In such circumstances, the only remedy which may be considered sufficient and adequate is one which is capable of leading to a binding decision for his or her release (see Gavril Yosifov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 74012/01, \u00a7 40, 6 November 2008).",

Accordingly, and whilst acknowledging that the civil law avenue was not an effective remedy to be exhausted while the applicant was still in pre-trial detention, given that that remedy could not have allowed his release pending trial, the Court is of the view that the applicant had to use that avenue once he had been convicted by the trial court on 19\u00a0June 2006, or at least after he had started serving his sentence on 1\u00a0September 2006, but, in any case, before lodging his application with the Court on 17\u00a0October 2006. Given that the applicant did not do so, the Court holds that his complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 about the reasonableness of the length of his pre-trial detention in the first set of criminal proceedings must be rejected under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 4 of the Convention for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies.",

Irrespective of such length of detention, under the domestic law a person being held on remand was not entitled to conjugal visits. For the applicant, it was remarkable that Lithuanian law allowed persons who had already been convicted, even those sentenced for the most serious crimes, such a right. In his view, a person in pre-trial detention should be entitled to the presumption of innocence until proved guilty by a court. However, in his case the opposite was true: his guilt had not yet been established, but he had had to face much more serious restrictions than those already convicted, and thus had been punished without conviction.",

The authorities had to make sure that the suspect would not obstruct the investigation by tarnishing the evidence and intimidating witnesses, and that the circumstances of the criminal acts were identified. The restrictions were also necessary so that the suspect would not abscond or commit further crimes. That was why a suspect\u2019s contacts with the outside world could be subjected to more or less severe restrictions, depending on the complexity of the case and the seriousness of the criminal acts under investigation. As to a convicted person, the circumstances of his criminal case and the evidence given by witnesses were to be considered as established once the court judgment had entered into force. Thus a convict could enjoy less restricted visits from his family, as an objective and unhindered investigation was no longer at stake. Accordingly, given the different purposes of pre-trial detention and deprivation of liberty after conviction, the fact that national law provided for different entitlement for remand prisoners and convicts was objectively and reasonably justifiable.",

That being so, it also observes that Article 10 \u00a7 2 (a) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires, inter alia, that accused persons should, save in exceptional circumstances, be subject to separate treatment appropriate to their status as unconvicted persons who enjoy the right to be presumed innocent (see paragraphs 71 and 72 above). The 1987 European Prison Rules contain an analogous rule (paragraph 74 above, point 91). Similarly, the 2006 European Prison Rules, which were adopted shortly before the applicant had requested a conjugal visit (paragraph 36 above), provide that unless there is a specific prohibition for a specified period by the judicial authority in an individual case, untried prisoners are to receive visits and be allowed to communicate with family members in the same way as convicted prisoners (see paragraph 76 above, point\u00a099). This approach appears to be supported by the CPT in its report on visit to Lithuania, which considered that any restriction on a remand prisoner\u2019s right to receive visits should be based on the requirements of the investigation or security considerations, be applied for a limited period and be the least severe possible (see paragraph\u00a077 above). Lithuanian legislation, however, restricts remand prisoner\u2019s visiting rights in a general manner and to a greater extent than those of convicted persons placed in a correctional home, as in the applicant\u2019s case. In this regard the Court has already had occasion to hold that, inasmuch as it concerns particular restrictions on a detained person\u2019s visiting rights, the aim of protecting the legitimate interests of an investigation may also be attained by other means which do not affect all detained persons regardless of whether they are actually required, such as the setting up of different categories of detention, or particular restrictions as may be required by the circumstances of an individual case (see Laduna, cited above, \u00a7 66).",

However, it also finds that the security considerations relating to any criminal family links were absent in the instant case (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, ECHR 2000X). Namely, the applicant\u2019s wife was neither a witness nor a co-accused in the criminal cases against her husband, which removed the risk of collusion or other forms of obstructing the process of collecting evidence (see, in contrast, mutatis mutandis, Silickien\u0117 v. , no. 20496/02, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 29, 10\u00a0April 2012). Nor has the Court any information to the effect that the applicant\u2019s wife was involved in criminal activities. Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that there was a particular reason to prevent the applicant from having conjugal visits with his wife (see, by contrast, Ku\u010dera v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 48666/99, \u00a7 130, 17 July 2007; Bagi\u0144ski v. Poland, no.\u00a037444/97, \u00a7 92 et seq., 11 October 2005; and Klamecki v. Poland (no.\u00a02), no. 31583/96, \u00a7 135, 3 April 2003). Above all, the Court notes that in justifying the prohibition on the applicant having conjugal visits when placed in pre-trial detention, the Government, like the Lithuanian administrative courts, in essence relied on the legal norms as such, without any reference as to why those prohibitions had been necessary and justified in the applicant\u2019s specific situation.",

The Court also considers that such limited physical interaction was further compounded by the fact that the detainee and the visitor were under the constant observation of a guard (see paragraph 58, points 131 and 138 above). As to the lack of direct contact with visitors, the Court observes that in a previous case it held that a person detained pending trial who had been physically separated from his visitors throughout his detention for three and a half years was, in the absence of any demonstrated need such as security considerations, not justified as regards the effective enjoyment of the right to one\u2019s private and family life (see, Moiseyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0258-59, and, mutatis mutandis, Laduna, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053). The Court therefore considers that the particularly long period of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention (two\u00a0years at the moment when the applicant had first asked for a conjugal visit) reduced his family life to a degree that could not be justified by the inherent limitations involved in detention. In this context the Court also notes that the Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison authorities\u2019 refusal to grant the applicant a conjugal visit had been based not only on theoretical security considerations, but equally on the lack of appropriate facilities (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above), a reason which cannot withstand the Court\u2019s scrutiny (see paragraph 72 above, point 4). It therefore finds that by having restricted the applicant from receiving conjugal visits when detained on remand the authorities failed to provide a reasonable and objective justification for the difference in treatment and thus acted in a discriminatory manner.",
