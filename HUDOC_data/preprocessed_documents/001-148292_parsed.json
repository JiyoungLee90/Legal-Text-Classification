The members of the gang were suspected of numerous thefts of goods and foodstuffs from various storage facilities. One of the episodes under investigation was a fraudulent attempt by the members of the gang to sell scrap metal, which belonged to a private company, to a scrap metal processing plant. According to the official version, the attempt to sell the scrap metal was carried out by V., the applicant, who was also a high-ranking police officer at the time, and G., another member of the gang. On an unspecified date in November 2000 V., the applicant and G. met with M., a director of the scrap processing plant, and fraudulently represented to him that the scrap metal belonged to K. and that they were acting on her behalf. M. agreed to purchase the scrap metal and on 23\u00a0November 2000 he sent a group of workers to the company\u2019s site in order to have the scrap metal removed. G.\u2019s boyfriend Yer., another member of the gang, was also present at the site at the time. The removal of the scrap metal was interrupted by B., one of the private company\u2019s directors. Yer. phoned G., who told him to go to the police station to notify V. of the incident. Then both Yer. and G. returned to the site to settle the issue with B., who had complained to the police about the attempted theft of the scrap metal. B. also informed Vosh., the company\u2019s managing director, of the incident. Acting in his official capacity, V. assigned the investigation into the attempted theft of scrap metal to Yem., who decided to question M. However, V. interviewed M. himself and brought Yem. M.\u2019s statement. Yem. questioned K., who submitted that she had nothing to do with the removal of the scrap metal from the company\u2019s premises.",

They submitted that the applicant had not asked the trial court to summon witness M. but had merely objected to the prosecutor\u2019s request to have M.\u2019s earlier statement read out at the court hearing. In their opinion, the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been fair. M.\u2019s statement had not been the only evidence against the applicant. As regards the applicant\u2019s guilt, the trial court also based its findings, on Yer.\u2019s testimony. Yer. had confirmed that the applicant and his co-defendants V. and G. had conspired to commit the theft and that G. had acted pursuant to the instructions given by V. and the applicant. Furthermore, the trial court had taken all the measures necessary to ensure M.\u2019s presence in court. It had served process on M. Neither the prosecution nor the defence had asked the court to compel M. to appear. The trial court had taken into consideration M.\u2019s absence due to a business trip that was ongoing at the time and had decided to read out his earlier statement. The Government pointed out that, even after M.\u2019s statement had been admitted as evidence, the applicant had had ample opportunity to insist on M.\u2019s being questioned in person. When upholding the verdict, the appeal court had taken into consideration the fact that M. had not appeared before the trial court.",

The applicant further considered that the trial court had failed to verify whether the telephone call had actually been made by M.\u2019s wife and whether M. had really been away. In any event, the trial court had failed to take any further steps to ensure M.\u2019s presence in court. Lastly, the applicant asserted that the trial court\u2019s decision to read out M.\u2019s statement had been in contravention of the national rules of criminal procedure which clearly delineated the extraordinary circumstances allowing the court to dispense with questioning a witness and reading out an earlier statement made by him or her instead.",

They do not testify under oath, that is to say they testify without any affirmation of the truth of their statements which could render them punishable for perjury for wilfully making untrue statements. The Court has already held on a number of occasions that for the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention to be respected on account of the admissibility of a guilty plea by a co-accused, such a plea should only be admitted in order to establish the fact of the commission of a crime by the person making the plea, and not by the other defendant. A judge should make it clear that the guilty plea by the co-accused, as such, does not prove that the defendant was involved in that crime (see, for instance, Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no.\u00a041461/02, \u00a7 102, 24 July 2008, with further references). The Court, therefore, considers that G. and Yer. were not material witnesses whose evidence was crucial for the applicant\u2019s conviction. Accordingly, it is the Court\u2019s view that the statements made by M. during the pre-trial investigation and read out by the Town Court constituted, if not the sole, then at least the decisive evidence against the applicant. It was obviously evidence of great weight and without it the chances of a conviction would have significantly receded.",

To put it differently: the fact that there were no good reasons for admitting the evidence of an absent witness (or that \u201cthe authorities failed to make a reasonable effort to secure [the witness\u2019s] presence in court\u201d) is sufficient, as such, to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.

Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to balance in the scales, to use the words of Lord Mance in R. v.

It is one thing to say that if there is no good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness, this element alone is sufficient to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention; and yet another thing to examine whether all the above three requirements are met in a given case before being able to conclude that the trial was not fair.

In such a way the Court has considered everything and there is no room for doubt about the finding of a violation. Then what is the problem? The problem is that if (repeatedly) applied without any qualification or further explanation, the approach adopted by the present judgment could be interpreted a contrario by the national judicial authorities, thereby giving a wrong signal. If one does not have the global picture of the case-law of the Court in respect of absent witnesses, such an a contrario interpretation of the present judgment could be that it would be possible for a domestic tribunal to rely on evidence by absent or anonymous witnesses. Only when such testimony is the sole or decisive element for the conviction of the accused and no \u201ccounterbalancing factors\u201d exist, only then there would be a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d).

Greece (no.\u00a063117/09, 3 July 2014), the Court found a compromise solution where it held at the end of \u00a7 35 that: \u201cPar cons\u00e9quent, aucun \u00ab\u00a0motif s\u00e9rieux \u00bb n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 pour justifier ce manquement aux droits de la d\u00e9fense.

It then proceeded to examine the other considerations. Such approach permits to reaffirm the traditional case-law of the Court and thus to avoid any possible misinterpretation of the requirements in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, and at the same time it gives the opportunity to insist, also for pedagogical reasons, on the series of flaws of the procedure as a whole, so as to produce a convincing and solid judgment in the circumstances of a particular case. I believe that this combined approach could have been followed in the present case, simply by adding some considerations along the lines in the case of Nikolitsas. Be it as it may, there are apparently (at least) two schools of thought in the Court\u2019s judgments in relation to the interpretation and application of the test in Al-Khawaja and Tahery.
