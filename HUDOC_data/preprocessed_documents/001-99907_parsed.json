The Court cannot accept the argument put forward by the Government to the effect that the applicant could not meet a lawyer in order to provide a power of attorney for the Court because that lawyer did not have a power of attorney to meet the applicant in the first place. Because of this initial administrative obtuseness, the Court considers that the application was put in jeopardy, since the applicant could not sign a power of attorney and provide more detailed information concerning the alleged risks that he would face in . The Court thus concludes that the effective representation of the applicant before the Court was seriously hampered. In the Court's view, the fact that the applicant was subsequently able to meet a lawyer, sign the authority form and provide information regarding his situation in Iran does not alter the fact that the lack of timely action on the part of the authorities was incompatible with the respondent Government's obligations under Article\u00a034 of the Convention.",
