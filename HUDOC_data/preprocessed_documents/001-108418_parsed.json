Section 9 provides that presidents of appellate and regional courts shall appoint supervising judges for the purposes of the administrative supervision from among particularly knowledgeable judges. Under section 12, the supervising judges shall carry out their tasks by conducting supervision audits in courts; by attending hearings and submitting their observations to judges and administrative staff concerned; by participating in deliberations and judicial trainings, by suggesting that disciplinary proceedings be instituted in respect of judges and by examining whether complaints about the administrative aspects of judicial work are well-founded.

The Court has thus distinguished between a subjective approach \u2013 that is, endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a given judge in a particular case \u2013 and an objective approach \u2013 that is, determining whether he or she offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium, 1\u00a0October 1982, \u00a7\u00a030, Series A no.\u00a053, and Grieves v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a057067/00, \u00a7\u00a069, ECHR\u00a02003XII (extracts)).",

As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will or has arranged to have a case assigned to himself for personal reasons (see\u00a0De\u00a0Cubber v.\u00a0Belgium, 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7\u00a025, Series A no.\u00a086). The principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long-established in the case-law of the Court (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v.\u00a0Belgium, 23\u00a0June 1981, \u00a7\u00a058, Series A no.\u00a043).",

In other words, the Court has recognised the difficulty of establishing a breach of Article\u00a06 on account of subjective partiality and for this reason has, in the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues, focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between the two notions, since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (the objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (the subjective test) (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus, [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2005XIII).",

In this respect, even appearances may be of some importance (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28\u00a0October 1998, \u00a7\u00a045, Reports 1998VIII; Morel v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a034130/96, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2000VI and Kyprianou v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a0118, ECHR 2005XIII).
