Where a judgment is against the State, the defendant State authority must be duly noti\ufb01ed thereof and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for compliance (see Akashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a030616/05, \u00a7 21, 12\u00a0June 2008). The complexity of the domestic enforcement procedure or of the State budgetary system cannot relieve the State of its obligation under the Convention to guarantee to everyone the right to have a binding and enforceable judicial decision enforced within a reasonable time (Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a070).",

The amount of the main debt was based on the calculations made by the defendant authority in accordance with Order No.\u00a0463 of 13\u00a0November 2003 of the head of the respondent military institute (see paragraph 15 above). The applicant enclosed the copies of those calculations. The amount of the loss of value of the judgment debt was calculated using the consumer price index for the reference period (the amount of the main debt multiplied by the consumer price index). The applicant submitted a letter from the Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Department of the State Statistics of 2\u00a0October 2015 showing the consumer price index during the reference period in the Republic of North Ossetia.
