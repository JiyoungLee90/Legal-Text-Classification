According to the bill, entering into a registered partnership was to create rights similar to those flowing from a marriage in respect of succession, health and social insurance and taxation. Following a long debate and having aroused considerable controversy over most of its provisions, the bill was eventually referred to Sejm at the end of 2004. It did not have any follow-up in Sejm, which had not started its reading before the dissolution of Parliament in\u00a0connection with general elections held in 2005. Since then, there have been no further similar legislative initiatives in Parliament.",
