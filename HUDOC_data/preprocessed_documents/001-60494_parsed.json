The Regional Court therefore upheld the view of the first instance court according to which the District Office in Bardejov had acted in accordance with Section 251 of the Labour Code. The Regional Court had also regard to the supplementary evidence which the District Court had taken on 4 November 1994 and which indicated that the money which had been paid to the applicant had been derived from the budget of the Ministry of the Interior. The Regional Court concluded that the applicant had not become an employee of the District Office. Accordingly, the notice in question was in conformity with Section 46 (1) (b) of the Labour Code.",
