In support of his decision the investigator referred mainly to the testimony of the colony officials, who had denied any ill-treatment. Their major argument was that if the applicant had been beaten or ill-treated, other convicts would have learnt of it, and that would represent a serious security issue, maybe even cause a riot. They all claimed that nobody had heard the noise of beatings or screams. The convicts questioned by the investigator testified that they had not heard the screams, neither had they seen traces of torture or beatings on the applicant. The investigator also referred to the testimony of the doctors who had examined the applicant as part of the official inquiry and who had confirmed their findings that the applicant had suffered from a fungal infection which could lead to the \u201cdeformation of, or damage to the nails\u201d. They had also not detected any signs of the forceful extraction of the nails. The investigator considered that the expert examinations carried out by Granat and by Ms M., hired by the applicant\u2019s lawyer, were unreliable, since they had been conducted \u201cby inappropriate persons using extra-procedural methods\u201d. The investigator also summarised the applicant\u2019s medical history. That summary states that the fungal infection was not detected before the examination of the applicant on 15 February 2010.

Thus, he referred to the testimony of the colony officials, all of whom denied ill-treatment and characterised the applicant\u2019s allegations as \u201clies\u201d, \u201cfairy-tales\u201d, \u201cdelirium\u201d, and so on. The colony officials excluded any possibility of the unlawful use of force by a colony official and or by a \u201cloyal\u201d convict in respect of another convict, since this would not have passed unnoticed by other detainees, and would have provoked a riot. This phrase, with minor variations, was repeated in the statements of at least seven colony officials and three convicts. They denied having seen the applicant being ill-treated or having heard of anything of that kind. The investigator also referred to the expert reports which attributed the absence of the applicant\u2019s finger and toenails to mycosis (reports of 15 and 19\u00a0February 2010) and described the bruises on his body as not having been received before 4 February 2010.

In the operative part of the judgment, the Town Court held, with reference to the provisions of Article 13 of the European Convention, that the applicant\u2019s arguments about the ineffectiveness of the inquiry were convincing, that the investigator had failed to establish with certainty the existence of grounds precluding further criminal investigation, and that the expert opinions should have been obtained by the investigator in full compliance with the law, in particular, by complying with the obligation to inform the experts about criminal liability for perjury. The Town Court added that the information thus obtained (that is, not in accordance with proper procedure) was unfit for confirming or rebutting the applicant\u2019s allegations. The Town Court also noted that it was incapable of addressing the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the reliability of the information collected during the inquiry, since it was not the court\u2019s role to predetermine the possible conclusions of a future criminal case. The case was thus referred back to the investigator. That decision was confirmed by the Tula Regional Court on 16\u00a0February 2011.",

The applicant\u2019s behaviour and attitude had created a conflict situation in the colony. On 27\u00a0January 2010 he had asked the colony administration to transfer him to a \u201csafe place\u201d, which, in the Plavsk Colony, was cell no. 203 in the SHIZO, where he had been detained until 17\u00a0February 2010.

Furthermore, the questioning of twenty-two colony officers and nine convicts had not confirmed the applicant\u2019s story. Following a medical examination of the applicant on 19\u00a0February 2010, as well as following his examination by the Dermatovenerology Clinic, it had been established that the applicant suffered from a fungal infection which had caused the deformation of his finger and toenails.

The Court observes in this respect that in the case of Kelly and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0114) the Court was not satisfied that the investigation had been conducted jointly with police officers connected with the operation under investigation. In the circumstances of the present case, although the examination was conducted by a formally independent officer (investigator Kn.), the fact that he was accompanied by those officers inevitably raises reasonable doubt as to his independence.\u00a0In sum, the examination of 16 February 2010 was conducted in such a way that deprived it of any useful effect.",

However, the case was again put into the hands of investigator Kn., who, on 21 March 2011, refused to proceed with it, relying essentially on the same reasons and information as before. By that time more than a year had elapsed since the opening of the first inquiry. In such circumstances the Court does not have reason to believe that yet another round of inquiries would have redressed the earlier shortcomings and rendered the investigation effective (see Vergelskyy v. , no. 19312/06, \u00a7 100, 12 March 2009).

Having examined the medical documents in its possession, the Court cannot find it established with sufficient certainty that the applicant suffered from a fungal infection prior to his transfer to the SHIZO on 27 January 2010. Thus, the transcript of the applicant\u2019s medical record prepared in May 2010 in reply to a request for factual information by the Court did not mention any fungal infection in the entries prior to 15 February 2010 (see paragraph 13 above). Indeed, according to some documents in the case file, in particular the two certificates issued by Dr Pr., the applicant was diagnosed with mycosis in 2009 (see paragraph 14). However, the credibility of those documents is doubtful. First, Dr Pr. was accused by the applicant of having participated in the ill-treatment, so he was not a disinterested witness. Secondly, during the first questioning Dr Pr. did not mention that in 2009 the applicant had been diagnosed with a fungal infection (see paragraph 29 above). Thirdly, there is no information about any specific medical follow-up and treatment of the applicant\u2019s \u201cmycosis\u201d since January 2009 (except for a very general reference to some \u201cointment\u201d, the veracity of which was contested by the applicant \u2013 see paragraph 92 above). Fourthly, when the applicant\u2019s lawyer tried to challenge the veracity of those records, the domestic courts did not address his complaint properly (see paragraph 93 above). Lastly, and most importantly, the doctor who examined the applicant on 27 January 2010 (see paragraph 13 above) did not record any injuries or abnormalities on the applicant\u2019s hands or feet. In such circumstances the Court finds strength in the applicant\u2019s argument that at least some of the documents mentioning fungal infection or mycosis in 2009 might have been issued or amended much later, in order to support the conclusions of the official inquiry.",

If the applicant\u2019s condition was so bad that he risked losing all his nails, the question arises why his medical file did not contain more detailed information about that and about the treatment he received.

Furthermore, the expert appointed by the investigator did not exclude that the extraction had been \u201ctraumatic\u201d in origin (see paragraph 66 above).

Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicant was quite uncooperative during the inquiry, which is, however, understandable in the light of the allegations made by him. Also, the degree of violence described by the applicant, the sophistication of its methods and its institutionalised character beggar belief, at least in a civilised society. However, even assuming that a part of the applicant\u2019s story cannot be verified, or some extra details have been added, the applicant\u2019s allegations were tenable, whereas the answer given by the authorities was clearly unsatisfactory.
