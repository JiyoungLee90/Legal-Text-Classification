On the latter point the Court reiterates that Article 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between them; indeed in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of the Article (see Case \u201crelating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\u201d (merits), 23 July 1968, \u00a7 10, Series A no. 6; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2006VI; and Mu\u0148oz Diaz v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a049151/07, \u00a7\u00a048, ECHR 2009).

Such a situation may amount to \u201cindirect\u00a0discrimination\u201d. This is only the case, however, if such policy or measure has no \u201cobjective and reasonable\u201d justification (see, among other authorities, Baio v.

Accordingly, as a result of a restrictive interpretation of the concept of \u201cfamily member\u201d only homosexual couples faced an insurmountable obstacle to obtaining a residence permit for family reasons. Nor could they obtain a form of legal recognition other than marriage, given that at the material time the Italian legal system did not provide for the possibility for homosexual or heterosexual couples in a stable relationship to enter into a civil partnership or a registered partnership certifying their status and guaranteeing them certain essential rights. The Court refers, further, to its observation in Oliari and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0170) that, despite developments in the relevant domestic case-law (set out by the parties in the present case in paragraphs 64, 66 and 69 above), the situation of same-sex couples in Italy remained uncertain in certain areas.

Having regard to the manner in which the applicants\u2019 complaint was formulated, the Court will confine itself to assessing whether, in the specific context of the refusal to grant the second applicant a residence permit, there was objective and reasonable justification for the decisions of the Italian authorities given that the application of the provisions of Legislative Decree no. 286 of 1998 prevented the applicants from pursuing their family life and their stable and committed relationship in Italy. Admittedly, Italian law did not treat unmarried heterosexual couples differently from unmarried homosexual couples (see paragraph 82 above), and restricted the concept of \u201cfamily members\u201d to heterosexual married partners. However, applying the same restrictive rule under Legislative Decree no.\u00a0286 of 1998 to heterosexual couples who had not regularised their situation and to homosexual couples, with the sole aim of protecting the traditional family (see paragraph 93 above), subjected the applicants to discriminatory treatment. Without any objective and reasonable justification the Italian State failed to treat heterosexual couples differently and take account of their ability to obtain legal recognition of their relationship and thus satisfy the requirements of domestic law for the purposes of granting a residence permit for family reasons, an option that was not available to the applicants (see Thlimmenos, cited above, \u00a7 44).",

On the contrary, if States decide to exclude same-sex couples from being able to marry, such a decision may have consequences when this Court is called upon to examine a claim of unjustified discrimination within a specific context that falls within the ambit of the right to respect for family life under Article 8 taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention.",

It follows that the impossibility in Italy at the material time for same-sex couples to acquire marital status or other legal recognition of their relationship could not, under any reasonable interpretation of Article 8 taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention, have made their relationships any less worthy of being treated as constituting a family unit within the particular context of immigration proceedings. The judgment does nothing more than require Italy to take due account of the existence of a serious and stable same-sex relationship in this specific context. The Court thus firmly rejects the argument that States can legitimately invoke the concept of the \u201ctraditional family\u201d as a basis for denying a request for a residence permit made by a foreign national who is in a relationship with a citizen of the same sex.",

As also appears in the cases referred to in the passage cited above, that distinction reflects a consistent interpretation in the Court\u2019s case-law. The Court has repeatedly found, in cases concerning a wide range of personal, economic or social matters, that the institution of marriage creates a special regime in favour of the persons concerned. Marriage is characterised by a corpus of rights and obligations that differentiate it markedly from the situation of a stable couple who are cohabiting without being married. That established principle in the Court\u2019s case-law was also summarised by the Grand Chamber in a case concerning welfare benefits, which raised a very different question from that of second-parent adoption. Thus, in the case of \u015eerife Yi\u011fit v. Turkey [GC], no. 3976/05, 2 November 2010), the Court observed as follows:",

In that connection reference should again be made to the above-cited judgment X and Others v. Austria. In that judgment the Grand Chamber adopted a position which appears to be completely at odds with the one adopted by the Court in the present judgment since it compares the situation of the applicants \u2013 an unmarried stable homosexual couple \u2013 to that of an unmarried stable heterosexual couple (see X and Others v.\u00a0Austria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0111-12):",

I do not find such an approach convincing, however, for a number of reasons. The first is on grounds of pure logic. Both assertions contained in the two above-mentioned passages of the judgment X and Others v. Austria cited above are two sides of the same coin. To say, firstly, that the situation of married and unmarried couples is incomparable, and then to affirm that unmarried stable homosexual or heterosexual couples are in a similar situation seems perfectly consistent. Each assertion is the logical sequitur of the other and they are complementary. This perception is corroborated by another important and more recent judgment of the Grand Chamber, Vallianatos and Others v.\u00a0Greece ([GC], nos.\u00a029381/09 and 32684/09, ECHR\u00a02013 (extracts)), concerning \u201ccivil unions\u201d which, under Greek law in force at the time (and since amended), were reserved to heterosexual couples. Examining the dispute in its context, the Court again stated that the situation of unmarried heterosexual couples was comparable to that of unmarried homosexual couples (see Vallianatos and Others v.\u00a0Greece, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072):",

The first argument consists in stating that the two situations are different from the point of view of obtaining a residence permit in Italy because heterosexual couples are able to marry and therefore \u201cregularise\u201d their situation under the relevant provisions of Italian law, whereas homosexual couples are not (see paragraph 83 of the judgment). That argument could be applicable mutatis mutandis in a number of other cases, thus seriously undermining, as we have seen, the special status of marriage under the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law (see above). Moreover, the argument in question is tantamount to asserting in substance that a heterosexual couple of which one member wishes to obtain a residence permit is obliged to marry nolens volens, which is not the case of a homosexual couple. If we accept that argument, however, it is likely that in the future an application will be brought before the Court by a heterosexual couple relying on that difference of treatment to support their submission that they have suffered discrimination. We therefore risk losing our way amongst syllogistic meanderings that lead to somewhat complex results that are difficult to follow.",

It should be borne in mind, though, that the applicants married on 8\u00a0May 2010, that is, after the period under examination, when they were no longer in Italy.

Consequently, it is not necessary to address the part of the judgment concerning the question whether or not there was objective and reasonable justification (see paragraphs 87 et seq. of the judgment).

Whilst it is true that the Convention does not guarantee the right of a foreign national to enter or to reside in a particular country (see, among other authorities, Nunez v. Norway, no. 55597/09, \u00a7 66, 28 June 2011, and Jeunesse v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 12738/10, \u00a7 100, 3 October 2014), the Court has acknowledged that, in certain circumstances, the removal of non-nationals may result in a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, and has provided a set of criteria in that regard (see, inter alia, \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, \u00a7\u00a7 54-60, ECHR 2006XII).

Having regard to the materials in the present case, it will be noted that ECSOL, as a third-party intervener, submitted a comparative-law survey of the possibility for same-gender partners to obtain a residence permit in the host country (see paragraph 79 of the judgment), showing that there was a significant trend in that direction. That survey also shows that at least 24 States do not discriminate in any way on grounds of sexual orientation when granting residence permits (ibid.). The applicants and the other third-party interveners also submitted comparative-law material supporting that conclusion (see paragraphs\u00a072 and 75 et seq. of the judgment). It is also noteworthy that Directive 2004/38/EC ... gives a wide definition of the concept of \u201cfamily member\u201d, encompassing, in addition to spouses, the \u201cpartner\u201d of EU citizens moving freely within the Union, with no distinction based on sexual orientation. A resolution of the European Parliament of 2\u00a0April 2009 ... recommended an extension of the scope of application of the directive in question, following, in particular, the judgments of the CJEU in the cases of Metock, Jipa and Huber. Similarly, the PACE Recommendation 1686 (2004) on human mobility and the right to family reunion ... recommends, among other things, that the Committee of Ministers \u201capply, where possible and appropriate, a broad interpretation of the concept of family and include in particular in that definition members of the natural family, non-married partners, including same-sex partners ...\u201d. All those factors give force to the idea that there is an increasingly significant trend towards allowing family reunification and granting a residence permit not only to spouses but also to partners, with no distinction based on sexual orientation.
