Furthermore, in a binding interpretative judgment delivered in 2005, the Supreme Court of Cassation had made clear that where administrative bodies including the police were implementing measures ordered by the judicial authorities, an action for damages against the State could be brought only against the latter and on the basis of section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act.

It noted in particular that, with the exception of the very specific case of death threats, the Bulgarian Criminal Code did not provide for the criminalisation of acts by police officers giving rise to this kind of suffering, resulting, for example, from an aggressively conducted search, seizure and arrest operation. Hence, unless a complainant alleged that he or she had sustained physical injury at the hands of the police, the authorities could not be required to commence criminal proceedings in relation to the acts complained of. The Court noted that this deficiency in the criminal law allowed those responsible for inflicting psychological trauma to escape criminal accountability for their actions.",

It follows that the criminal-law remedy that was normally available and effective in cases of physical violence inflicted by the police was bound from the outset to fail in the particular circumstances complained of by the applicants.

The Court reiterates that the six-month rule is closely linked to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as the six-month period runs from the date of the decision considered as final for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see, among other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a046477/99, 7 June 2001). Nevertheless, where no adequate remedy is available in domestic law, the six-month period in principle starts to run from the date on which the act complained of took place (see Gongadze\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 34056/02, \u00a7 155, ECHR 2005XI).",

This assertion is corroborated by the statements made by Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi, according to which they were woken by shouts and knocking at the door of the house (see paragraph 15 above). Mr Gutsanov stated that he had gone down to the first floor of the house to fetch the two children before going back up to the bedroom on the second floor.

The Court is not in a position to determine whether Mr Gutsanov was arrested inside the bedroom on the second floor of the house, as he claimed, or on the second-floor landing after he had come out of the bedroom of his own volition, as claimed by the Government. Nor has it been established beyond any reasonable doubt that the police officers spoke to Mrs Gutsanova and asked her to cover the children with the duvet. In any event the Court observes that, according to the witness evidence given by the special officers (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above), they saw Mr\u00a0Gutsanov\u2019s wife and children inside the bedroom when they went up to the second floor of the house in pursuit of Mr Gutsanov. The Court accepts that Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters also saw the armed and masked men, if only through the bedroom door.",

As regards the handcuffing, it is not disputed that the special officers placed handcuffs on Mr Gutsanov downstairs (see paragraph 16 above). However, the Court observes that neither of the parties specified the length of time for which Mr Gutsanov remained in handcuffs. In any event, it cannot but observe that there is no evidence in the file to demonstrate that the first applicant was made to appear in handcuffs before the cameras of the journalists who had gathered outside the entrance to the property that day. Furthermore, the photograph taken as he was leaving the house, at around 1 p.m., shows no signs of him being handcuffed ... Accordingly, the Court considers that the present case falls to be distinguished in that regard from the case of Miros\u0142aw Garlicki, (cited above, \u00a7 75), in which the applicant was arrested at his workplace in front of his colleagues and patients, placed in handcuffs and filmed.",

The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Treatment has been held by the Court to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000IV).

In this regard, it is of importance for instance whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or abscond, cause injury or damage or suppress evidence (see Raninen v. Finland, 16 December 1997, \u00a7 56, Reports 1997VIII). The Court reiterates in particular that any recourse by agents of the State to physical force against a person which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Rachwalski and Ferenc v. Poland, no. 47709/99, \u00a7 59, 28\u00a0July 2009). This strict proportionality test has also been applied by the Court in situations where the individuals concerned were already in the hands of the lawenforcement agencies (see, among other authorities, Klaas\u00a0v.

It emerges from the evidence in the file that the investigation in question had been opened five months previously, that there were several suspects in the case and that the authorities suspected the existence of a conspiracy (see paragraph 9 ... above).

Mrs Gutsanova consulted a psychiatrist on two occasions complaining of insomnia and acute anxiety and was prescribed tranquillisers (see paragraph 31 above). The two girls were also examined by a psychiatrist who observed that, when recalling the events, they reacted by crying or displaying acute anxiety (see paragraph 30 above). Mrs Gutsanova stated that her younger daughter, B., had started stammering again (see paragraph 28 above). As for S., the couple\u2019s elder daughter, the statements by her aunt and her schoolteacher indicated that she had been deeply affected by the police operation at her home and by her father\u2019s arrest (see paragraph 29 above). The Court also considers that the fact that the police operation took place in the early morning and involved special officers wearing masks, who were seen by Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, served to heighten the feelings of fear and anxiety experienced by these three applicants, to the extent that the treatment to which they were subjected exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 of the Convention to apply.
