The defence presented an extensive volume of evidence and pointed out that the applicant had been injured while in police custody and the circumstances of the injuries had not been explained. They submitted that there had been no other evidence in the file attesting to the applicant\u2019s guilt. The court had been under an obligation to assess the material in the criminal case against the police employees and not merely to rely on the fact that the case against them had been terminated. In the defence\u2019s submission, on 7 April 2004 they had appealed against the decision terminating that criminal case.

Like Article 2, Article 3 lies at the very core of the Convention \u2013 indeed, in some sense it can be considered as even more \u201cfundamental\u201d than Article 2 since, unlike Article 2, it admits of no exceptions or qualifications. Even in time of emergency, no derogation can be made to Article 3 (see Article 15 \u00a7 2). As was emphasised in El Haski v.\u00a0Belgium (no. 649/08), the use in criminal proceedings of statements obtained as a result of a violation of Article 3, irrespective of the classification of the treatment as torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, renders the proceedings as a whole automatically unfair and in breach of Article 6 (and this applies also for the use of real evidence obtained as a direct result of acts of torture \u2013 if the real evidence is obtained as a result of acts which are in breach of Article 3 but which fall short of torture, there would be a breach of Article 6 only if that real evidence had a bearing on the outcome of the proceedings against the defendant) (see \u00a7 85 of El Haski). The necessity for this stringent automaticity was explained in Othman (Abu Qatada) at \u00a7 264. It is true that in that case Article 3 was being considered specifically in the context of torture, and of statements extracted under torture, but to my mind the same reasoning applies if statements are extracted under duress amounting to inhuman or degrading treatment. Admitting statements \u2013 whether made by the accused or by third parties \u2013 obtained in these circumstances \u201cwould only serve to legitimate indirectly the sort of morally reprehensible conduct which the authors of Article 3 of the Convention sought to proscribe\u201d (ibid.)",

The Riga Regional Court said so in its judgment of 11 October 2004 (see \u00a7 33). This was confirmed by the executive branch of Government in its letter of 20\u00a0October 2011 to the Court admitting the breach of Articles 3 and 13 (see C\u0113snieks v. Latvia (dec.) (partial striking out), no. 9278/06, \u00a7 32, 6 March 2012). The Supreme Court was of a different persuasion. The pons asinorum appears to have been the distinction between the truthfulness of the applicant\u2019s statements (see \u00a7 40) and their admissibility or inadmissibility as evidence (see \u00a7 41). Now, it is true that at the time when the Supreme Court pronounced itself (for the first time) on 26 April 2005, there was as yet in force no provision to the effect that evidence obtained through ill-treatment would be inadmissible (\u00a7 49). However the 2005 Criminal Procedure Law had been adopted on 21 April 2005, even though it was to come into force only on 1 October 2005. The Supreme Court (like the Senate of that court which later dismissed a further appeal on formalistic grounds, \u00a7 45) must have been aware of the provisions of the new section\u00a0130 of that law. Nevertheless it forged ahead with its decision of 26\u00a0April 2005, in effect riding roughshod over the applicant\u2019s fundamental human rights. I find that extraordinary.",
