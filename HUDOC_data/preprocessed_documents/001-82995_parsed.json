Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Belevitskiy\u00a0v. , no.\u00a072967/01, \u00a7\u00a0101, 1\u00a0March 2007; Ilijkov v.

This is particularly relevant in the Russian legal system where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7 180, 8 November 2005).

The courts assumed that the gravity of the charges carried such a preponderant weight that no other circumstances could have obtained the applicant's release (see, for instance, the domestic courts' decisions cited in paragraphs 17 and 21 above). In this connection the Court reiterates that any system of mandatory detention is incompatible per se with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it being incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish and demonstrate the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty. In the present case the domestic decisions did not mention any such facts.",
