The appeal courts were required to apply the provisions concerning the filtering procedure in a way that met the requirements of basic and human rights (see the Constitutional Law Committee\u2019s opinion 35/2002 concerning the government bill HE 91/2002). The Supreme Court had also, in some difficult cases, decided not to apply the filtering procedure as it had not been clear that the district court judgment had been free from errors. The domestic legislation thus guaranteed the right to an oral hearing as well as the legal protection of an individual, by taking into account at the same time the right to a trial within a reasonable time.",

The Court\u2019s task is to ascertain whether the proceedings considered as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was taken, was fair (see Schenk v. , 12 July 1988, \u00a7\u00a046, Series A no. 140). The Court has held on many occasions that Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a particular witness (see Bricmont v. , 7 July 1989, \u00a7 89, Series A no. 158; Laukkanen and Manninen v. Finland, no. 50230/99, \u00a7\u00a035, 3\u00a0February\u00a02004). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Perna v.  [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7\u00a029, ECHR 2003V).",

The manner of application of Article 6 to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see, among many other authorities, Hermi, cited above, \u00a7 60; Ekbatani v.

The publicity requirement is certainly one of the means whereby confidence in the courts is maintained. However, there are other considerations, including the right to trial within a reasonable time and the related need for expeditious handling of the domestic courts\u2019 case-load, which must be taken into account in determining the necessity of a public hearing at stages in the proceedings subsequent to the trial at first instance (see Fejde v. Sweden, 29 October 1991, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 212C). Provided a public hearing has been held at first instance, the absence of such a hearing before a second or third instance may accordingly be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, although the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court (see Ekbatani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031).",
