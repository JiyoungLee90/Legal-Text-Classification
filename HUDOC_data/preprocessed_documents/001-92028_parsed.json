A civil court is unable to pursue any independent investigation and is incapable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings regarding the identity of the perpetrators of fatal assaults or disappearances, still less of establishing their responsibility (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-21, 24 February 2005, and Estamirov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).

For instance, the first applicant, who had witnessed her son\u2019s abduction, was questioned for the first time only on 23\u00a0September 2002 (see paragraph 51 above), which is almost two months after the commencement of the investigation. Moreover, Mr Ch. and Mr S. were questioned for the first time only after August 2007, following the communication of the present application to the Government (see paragraph 60 above). Although it is not clear from the Government\u2019s submissions when the investigators questioned Luisa Saydaliyeva, an eyewitness to the abduction, the fact that this interview was mentioned for the first time only in January 2008 gives grounds to assume that they did not do it promptly (see paragraph 63 above). It is obvious that the witnesses\u2019 statements, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

Inasmuch as it concerns the fact that the domestic investigation is still pending, the Court notes that the authorities\u2019 failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures undermined the effectiveness of the investigation in its early stages. Furthermore, the Government mentioned that the applicants had the opportunity to apply for judicial or administrative review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes in this respect that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged actions or omissions of investigating authorities before a court or a higher prosecutor. Furthermore, the investigation has been resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves owing to the need to take additional investigative\u00a0steps. However, they still failed to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations properly. Besides, after a lapse of time some investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out promptly could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedies relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the criminal law remedies relied on by the Government were ineffective in the circumstances of the case and rejects their objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust these domestic remedies.",

It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities\u2019 conduct (see Orhan v.

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, \u00a7\u00a064, Reports 1997III).",
