The Court has already found in the particular circumstances of a given case, that the fact that the domestic courts used as sole evidence transcripts of unlawfully obtained telephone conversations did not conflict with the requirements of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000-V, P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2001-IX and Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, \u00a7 89, 10 March 2009). Therefore, the question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair (see Heglas v. the Czech Republic, no. 5935/02, \u00a7 85, 1 March 2007).",

Turkey (no.\u00a02), no.\u00a060999/00, \u00a7 57, 8 July 2008). The lack of a legal basis for such interference leads the Court to conclude that the telephone recordings in question constituted unlawfully obtained evidence in the circumstances of the case. In any event, in their submissions to the Court, the Government also acknowledged that the evidence in question had not been obtained in accordance with the law (see paragraph 60 above). The Court further observes that the Ankara State Security Court cited the transcripts of the telephone conversations as evidence in its judgment. Although in its final judgment the court could not establish a causal link between those conversations and the terrorist acts committed in Turkey between February and August 1999 and therefore did not convict the applicant under Article\u00a0125 of the former Criminal Code, it nevertheless took those transcripts into consideration when convicting the applicant under Article\u00a0168 of the same Code. The Court therefore cannot accept the Government\u2019s submissions that the first-instance court had not used the transcripts as evidence.",

The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and to comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. In addition, Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all the material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see Rowe and Davis v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028901/95, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2000II, and Natunen v.

In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses at risk of reprisals or to keep police methods of investigation of crime secret, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused. In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see Rowe and Davis, cited above, \u00a7 61, Natunen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040, and Leas v. Estonia, no. 59577/08, \u00a7 78, 6 March 2012).",

Having taken account of the content of those transcripts, the court found it established that the applicant had issued instructions to members of the PKK to perpetrate acts of violence in Turkey (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). Therefore, the transcripts of the audiotapes constituted decisive evidence against the applicant.",

To this end, on at least ten occasions his lawyer filed petitions and made oral submissions to the trial court (see paragraphs 14, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 34, 39 and 44). The first-instance court allowed the request for a comparative voice analysis and dismissed all the other requests on each occasion. Subsequently, however, the applicant refused to take part in the comparative voice analysis. The Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether the applicant\u2019s reluctance to provide a vocal sample was legitimate. In the Court\u2019s view, given the applicant\u2019s reluctance, it was understandable that the first-instance court accepted that the transcripts in the case file contained conversations between the applicant and a number of persons designated as \u201cX\u201d. However, an examination of the question as to whether the transcripts included in the case file by the public prosecutor and those prepared by Mr L.B., the expert, were consistent with the content of the audiotapes was not carried out (see paragraphs 31, 32, 33 and 39 above). Besides, the applicant was not provided an opportunity to get of hold of all the elements that would have enabled him to challenge the reliability of the transcripts. In this connection, the Court observes that the first-instance court either dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests to obtain a copy of the audiotapes without providing any reason (see paragraphs 14, 23, 26, 27, 29 and 32 above) or failed to issue a ruling in respect of them (see paragraphs 28, 35, 39 and 45 above). In addition, the court did not play the audiotapes at the hearings in the presence of the applicant or his lawyer. As a result, the applicant\u2019s inability to have access to the originals of those audiotapes prevented him from effectively challenging the reliability of the transcripts. Moreover, as the applicant was not informed of the reason why the court considered it necessary to restrict his rights, he had no opportunity to argue against any such considerations. Lastly, the Court notes that the Court of Cassation also failed to consider the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning his inability to have access to evidence which had been used to secure his conviction.",

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2011, and also Luc\u00e0 v.

Accordingly, where a conviction was based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to balance in the scales and one which would require sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 147).",

According to that article, the National Intelligence Agency described the applicant as the person who incited PKK supporters to commit acts of violence in Turkey. However, there is nothing in the case file demonstrating that the National Intelligence Agency had actually made that statement and declared the applicant guilty for the offences in respect of which he had been arrested.
