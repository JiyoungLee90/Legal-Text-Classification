In the light of current [scientific] knowledge, the viability of an embryo cannot be certified unless it has been thawed, thus creating the paradoxical situation in which, once thawed, an embryo cannot be frozen a second time and if it is not immediately implanted into the uterus death will inevitably ensue. Hence, a tutiorist prospect of frozen embryos being stored for an indeterminate period. However, it can be assumed that advances in scientific research will make it possible to determine the criteria and methods for diagnosing death, or in any event loss of viability, of cryopreserved embryos. It will thus be possible to overcome the present \u2013 and legally inevitable \u2013 paradox of potentially indefinite cryopreservation. Pending those results, [it should be reaffirmed that] the explicit ban under section 14 of Law\u00a0no. 40 of 2004 on the destruction of embryos, including therefore frozen embryos, cannot be ignored. That is not all, for as regards the fate of surplus embryos, the authors of Law no. 40 opted for their storage and not their destruction, thus establishing as a principle that they should be kept alive even where their fate is uncertain.\u201d",

As in the case of research on infertility, stem cell research aims to alleviate severe human suffering. In any case, the embryos that have been used for research are required to be destroyed. Consequently, there is no argument for excluding funding of this kind of research from the Framework Programme of research of the European Union if it complies with ethical and legal requirements as defined in this programme.\u201d",

Accordingly, such an application cannot be a remedy whose exhaustion is required under the Convention (see, among other authorities, Brozicek v. Italy, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 167; Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7 42, ECHR 1999V; C.G.I.L. and Cofferati v.

Everyone has a right to respect for their dignity and their rights, regardless of their genetic characteristics. That dignity makes it imperative not to reduce individuals to their genetic characteristics and to respect their uniqueness and diversity. The human genome, which by its nature evolves, is subject to mutations. It contains potentialities that are expressed differently according to each individual\u2019s natural and social environment. The human genome in its natural state must not give rise to financial gains. The Declaration further states that no research or research applications concerning the human genome, in particular in the fields of biology, genetics and medicine, should prevail over the respect for the human rights, fundamental freedoms and human dignity of individuals or groups of people.

For the purposes of the report, the human embryo is examined in its early stages of development and before implantation in the uterus. If research is allowed on human embryos with the purpose of deriving embryonic stem cells, then it must be subjected to strict supervision and severe basic constraints, including full consent on the part of the donors and justification in terms of the benefit to humanity. Research for non-medical purposes would be clearly unethical, as would research which goes beyond the very early stages of embryonic development. The medical applications of the research must be well-identified therapeutic applications and not trivial or cosmetic non-medical desires, nor a fortiori for eugenic enhancement.

When authorisation of donations of supernumerary pre-implantation embryos from in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments for therapeutic embryonic stem-cell research is under consideration, attention should be given to the dignity and rights of both parental donors of embryos. Thus, it is essential that the donation be made only after the donors have been given full information as to the implications of the research and have given free and informed consent. Alternative technologies for obtaining human stem-cell lines, from genetically compatible sources for therapeutic research on transplantation, should be considered. In all aspects of research involving human embryos, particular importance should be given to respect for human dignity and the principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights of 1997.",

Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights.

Greenpeace eV (C-34/10). Regarding the interpretation of the term \u201chuman embryo\u201d, the CJEU acknowledged that the term entailed a broad concept that \u201cmust be understood in a wide sense.\u201d On that ground the Grand Chamber of the CJEU concluded that the term was intended to refer to any human ovum as soon as it has been fertilised, since that moment was crucial to the commencement of the development of the human being. That classification must also apply to a non-fertilised human ovum into which the cell nucleus from a mature human cell had been transplanted and a non-fertilised human ovum whose division and further development had been stimulated by parthenogenesis. The Grand Chamber ruled that the use of embryos for the purpose of scientific research was not patentable. However, it recognised the patentability of the use of embryos for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes when applied to a human embryo and useful to the embryo itself. Lastly, the Court established that patentability was also excluded when the implementation of an invention required prior destruction of the human embryo or their use as base material, whatever the stage at which that took place and even if the description of the technical teaching claimed did not refer to the use of human embryos. Since the embryo enjoyed human dignity from the moment of fertilisation, it was not possible to distinguish different phases of development from the time of fertilisation that would justify a lesser degree of protection of the embryo over a certain period of time. Being an \u201cautonomous concept of European law\u201d, the human embryo benefited from mandatory legal protection afforded by virtue of respect for its inherent human dignity, which precluded the possibility that member States of the Union would deprive the human embryo of its protection or provide a lesser degree of protection than that asserted by the crystal-clear decision of the judges of the CJEU.",

In the latter case, respect for human dignity requires regulation of embryo research and the provision of guarantees against risks of arbitrary experimentation and instrumentalisation of human embryos. The creation of embryos with gametes donated for the purpose of stem-cell procurement is ethically unacceptable when spare embryos represent a ready alternative source. Remote therapeutic perspectives must be balanced against considerations related to the risks of trivialising the use of embryos and exerting pressure on women, as sources of oocytes, and increasing the possibility of their instrumentalisation. Free and informed consent is required not only from the recipient. The donor should be informed of the possible use of her embryonic cells for the specific purpose in question before requesting consent.

The patent logical contradiction between the two statements is so obvious that it is irremediable. The only possible reading of this contradiction is that the majority were so divided that they could not decide whether the statement of principle in paragraph\u00a059 of Costa and Pavan should prevail over the opposite statement of principle in paragraph 228 of A, B and C v.

The reasoning in paragraph 157 of the present judgment is thus based on a rhetorical \u201cfallacy of the undistributed middle\u201d, according to which the majority assume that because they share a common property two separate categories are connected. In other words, in interpreting judgment no. 162, the majority assume that because the right to become a parent is an aspect of a person\u2019s private life, as is the right to have IVF treatment, both of these rights are unfettered in so far as they are rights to \u201cself-determination\u201d, thus forgetting that the exercise of \u201cself-determination\u201d of the progenitors in the latter case may impinge upon the existence of another human life: that of the non-implanted embryo. As the Italian Constitutional Court itself said in that judgment, \u201c[l]a libert\u00e0 e volontariet\u00e0 dell\u2019atto che consente di diventare genitori e di formare una famiglia nel senso sopra precisato, di sicuro non implica che la libert\u00e0 in esame possa esplicarsi senza limiti\u201d (the freedom and voluntariness of the act which permits a person to become a parent and form a family within the meaning defined above certainly does not mean that the freedom in question can be interpreted as having no limits). In sum, the Constitutional Court\u2019s reasoning in judgment no. 162 does not lend support to an unlimited \u201cright to self-determination\u201d or \u201cfreedom of choice of parties to IVF regarding the fate of embryos not destined for implantation\u201d. It is wrong to interpret the Constitutional Court\u2019s reasoning in favour of \u201cadoption for birth\u201d \u2013 that is, in favour of the embryo\u2019s life \u2013 as allowing parties to IVF to destroy the resulting embryos.",

The majority clearly overlook the fact that the embryo is a different biological identity from the person who has undergone IVF, although the embryo does contain that person\u2019s genetic material. The statement in paragraph 158 is unacceptable, both in ontological and biological terms. The majority forget that human dignity makes it imperative to respect \u201cthe uniqueness and diversity\u201d of each human being, as the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights puts it.

Again, this makes no sense to me. Issues related to the individual\u2019s existence or identity, namely to the beginning and end of human life, are per se heavily influenced by ethical and moral considerations. I would even go so far as to say that most of the human rights contained in the Convention and its Protocols are intrinsically attached to ethical and moral questions that have been the subject of debate for many years. Thus, the intrinsically moral or ethical nature of a legal issue under the scrutiny of the Court should not be a factor limiting the latter\u2019s competence or determining the margin of appreciation to be afforded to States.

In Varnava and Others v. Turkey ([GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7\u00a7 159 and 161, ECHR 2009), it was stated in general terms that the time-limit does not apply to continuing situations. That is not quite accurate for, as subsequently explained in that judgment, in such situations the ongoing breach simply means a renewal of the start of the period each day, so the time-limit does in principle apply. When continuing situations cease, time begins to run uninterrupted for the whole six-month period. The difficulty in some cases lies in ascertaining the moment in time at which the situation has come to an end. As pointed out in Varnava (cited above, \u00a7 161), not all continuing situations are the same since the nature of the situation may be such that the passage of time affects what is at stake. It may, therefore, be necessary to examine how a situation has developed in order to assess the significance of events or the prospects of achieving a solution and to judge what would be reasonable by way of a starting point in the particular circumstances of the case. The Court takes a broad and practical view of such matters.",

I could not agree more, except to say that this not only \u201crelates\u201d to the right of self-determination but is an exercise of that right, which is the crux of the right to private life.

This case is about a very specific situation: what happens when legislation intervenes and impedes the exercise of that pre-existing right in regard to pre-existing embryos?

The quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of the measure is of particular importance in this respect, including to the operation of the relevant margin of appreciation (see Animal Defenders International v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, \u00a7 108, ECHR 2013).",

Moreover, the Law was enacted by a majority, amidst serious disagreement. The Italian parliamentary debate therefore differed from that considered in Animal Defenders International, cited above, where, among other things, there was cross-party support in Parliament. There is also no evidence that the applicant\u2019s rights or personal situation were taken into account; the Law contains a blanket ban that deprives the applicant of her right to freedom of choice. Contrary to the situation in Animal Defenders International, there could not be a domestic proportionality analysis in her case. Not only does this general ban disregard the applicant\u2019s right to self-determination with respect to an important private decision, it does so in an absolute and unforeseeable manner. The Law contains no transitional rules which would have enabled the proper authority to take into consideration the specific situation of the applicant, whose embryos obtained from the IVF treatment were placed in cryopreservation in 2002 and whose husband passed away in 2003, four months before the Law came into force.",

As mentioned above, the conditions required in that regard established in Hatton and Others and Animal Defenders International (both cited above) are not satisfied. In the absence of clear reasons arising from the parliamentary debate, it is only when the Government provide sufficient clarity that the Court can properly inquire into why the blanket ban on donation is necessary when weighed against the applicant\u2019s personal choice. The Court\u2019s citation from the preparatory works does not explain why a ban on donation is necessary for Italy\u2019s purported moral preference in favour of embryos in the circumstances of the present case. Since the Government cannot force a person to use her embryos to create a human being without her consent, a blanket ban on all other life-promoting uses (such as medical research) is not only overly restrictive of the individual\u2019s freedom of self-determination, it also disregards the constitutional values recognised in Article 33 of the Italian Constitution and the value system of the Convention, which recognises the interest of Article 10 in scientific research (see Mustafa Erdo\u011fan and Others v. Turkey, nos. 346/04 and 39779/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-41, 27 May 2014). More importantly, the protection of life cannot be relied on, not only because the meaning and weight of that argument remain contested in regard to the applicant\u2019s embryos but also because those embryos, notwithstanding their potential for life, have no chance of becoming human beings. As to embryos in general in Italy, the duty to protect the potential of the non-viable embryo cannot exist in absolute form in Italian law given that even a viable foetus can be aborted.",

This choice is driven by her desire to honour her late partner and to further invaluable medical research with the potential to save lives. According to expert testimony presented at the hearing (and to many other international medical and scientific sources), research deriving from embryonic stem cells is currently being used in clinical trials for spinal cord injuries, Parkinson\u2019s disease and other diseases that are currently incurable or difficult to cure. Countries which allow such research have developed sophisticated forms of informed consent and controls to ensure that the embryos are used in ethical ways. Such research uses the pluripotent (undifferentiated) cells created through the IVF procedure to develop a greater understanding of human development and discover new ways of treating diseases that have been devastating and incurable for many people around the world. The cells created through IVF are unique and valuable biological material, which the applicant wishes to put to use, rather than leave to lose viability as they remain frozen indefinitely.",

The judgment in this case lacks any sort of proportionality analysis and does not consider the important third-party interest in the health benefits arising from scientific discovery. By simply stating that there is no European consensus on whether embryos left over from IVF procedures should be used in scientific research, the Court departs from its well-established standards. There is of course a margin of appreciation regarding this issue, but that does not mean that the law may operate in whatever manner a government sees fit. The measure must still be proportionate to the interference with the applicant\u2019s rights.",

Even assuming, in view of Evans (cited above, \u00a7 81), that there is a wide margin of appreciation in IVF cases, \u201csince the use of IVF treatment gives rise to sensitive moral and ethical issues against a background of fast-moving medical and scientific developments\u201d, the interference still cannot be arbitrary. In Italy both abortion and research on foreign stem-cell lines are permitted. The Law disregards the interest in preventing actual human suffering through scientific research in the name of the protection of a potential for life which, moreover, cannot ever materialise in the circumstances of the case. I cannot see why preponderant weight is attached to the potential for life when Italian law does allow the abortion of a viable foetus, and in the particular circumstances of the present case, that potential cannot materialise, in the absence of the consent of the applicant. This attitude and the related explanation are not only inconsistent but plainly irrational and as such cannot be sufficient justification for the proportionality of the measure.",
