It rejected the remainder of the applicant company\u2019s complaint. It found the seizure lawful and, on this point, considered that a publisher/journalist could not, as such, be regarded as enjoying the privilege of non-disclosure (verschoningsrecht) under Article 96a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Statutorily, the persons referred to in Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and acknowledged as enjoying the privilege of non-disclosure were, amongst others, public notaries, lawyers and doctors. It considered that the right to freedom of expression, as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention, included the right freely to gather news (recht van vrije nieuwsgaring) which, consequently, deserved protection unless outweighed by another interest warranting priority. It found that, in the instant case, the criminal investigation interest outweighed the right to free gathering of news in that, as explained by the public prosecutor during the hearing, the investigation at issue did not concern the illegal street race, in which context the undertaking of protection of sources had been given, but an investigation into other serious offences. The Regional Court was therefore of the opinion that the case at hand concerned a situation in which the protection of journalistic sources should yield to general investigation interests, the more so as the undertaking to the journalistic source concerned the street race whereas the investigation did not concern that race. It found established that the data stored on the CD-ROM had been used for the investigation of serious offences and that it had been made clear by the prosecutor that these data were relevant to the investigation at issue as all other investigation avenues had led to nothing. It therefore concluded that the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity had been complied with and that the interference had thus been justified. The  did not find that the seizure had been rash, although more tactful action on the part of the police and the public prosecutor might have prevented the apparent escalation of the matter.",

This principle was overturned by the Supreme Court in a landmark judgment of 10 May 1996 on the basis of the principles set out in the Court\u2019s judgment of 27 March 1996 in the case of Goodwin v. the United Kingdom (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II). In this ruling, the Supreme Court accepted that, pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention, a journalist was in principle entitled to non-disclosure of an information source unless, on the basis of arguments to be presented by the party seeking disclosure of a source, the judge was satisfied that such disclosure was necessary in a democratic society for one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (Netherlands Law Reports, \u201cNJ\u201d) 1996, no.\u00a0578).",

Secondly, the interference must serve one of the aims mentioned in Article 10 \u00a7 2. Thirdly, the interference must be necessary in a democratic society for attaining such an aim. In this, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality play a role. In that framework it must be weighed whether the interference is necessary to serve the interest involved and therefore whether no other, less far-reaching ways (minder bezwarende wegen) can be followed along which this interest can be served to a sufficient degree. Where it concerns a criminal investigation, it must be considered whether the interference with the right to freely gather news is proportionate to the interest served in arriving at the truth.

The defining moment came when one of the ram raiders threatened a bystander with a firearm. Faced with so serious a threat to the public, the authorities had no longer any alternative but to do their utmost to bring the perpetrators to book. The make of the getaway car was known. Someone remembered an intercepted telephone conversation which had yielded the information that one of the suspected ram raiders had participated in an illegal street race. It was known that a photographer commissioned by the magazine Autoweek had taken pictures at the time; it was felt necessary to check whether the getaway car was the same as the car used by the suspected ram raider in the street race. The public prosecutor immediately ordered the pictures to be handed over. Autoweek\u2019s editorial team were not told what it was all about. All they were told was that there was an investigation ongoing into the illegal streetrace and it concerned a matter of life and death.",

As mentioned, the Chamber also considered that disquieting but attached more importance to the fact that ultimately a judge had given his prior opinion. The Grand Chamber\u2019s argument that that judge lacked all official powers in the matter does not convince me. I have every reason to believe that since the public prosecutor had agreed with Autoweek\u2019s lawyer to involve the judge, any opinion expressed by the latter to the effect that the photographic material was not to be handed over would have been respected and would have resulted in an immediate end to the attempts to seize the materials that evening. That said, I am convinced by the reasoning of the Grand Chamber in stressing the need, even if prior review is provided for, to set out a clear decision model requiring the judge to consider whether a more limited interference with journalistic freedom will suffice (paragraph 92). It certainly adds to the case-law to demand such a proportionality test (or subsidiarity test, if one will) so clearly and explicitly.",
