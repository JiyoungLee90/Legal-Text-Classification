The authorities had then organised transfer by air and sea to evacuate migrants from Lampedusa. The following day, clashes had taken place in the island\u2019s port between the local population and a group of foreigners who had threatened to explode gas canisters. The judge explained that there had thus been a situation which was likely to degenerate, and which was covered by the notion of \u201cstate of necessity\u201d (stato di necessit\u00e0) as provided for in Article 54 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 34 below).

The fact that a refusal-of-entry measure (respingimento) had been ordered in respect of the migrants, without judicial scrutiny, a few days after their arrival, was not unlawful in the judge\u2019s view. The calculation of a \u201creasonable time\u201d for the adoption of that measure and for the migrants\u2019 stay in the CSPA had to take account of logistical difficulties (state of the sea, distance between Lampedusa and Sicily) and of the number of migrants concerned.

Unaccompanied minors had been placed in temporary accommodation and no pregnant women had been transferred to the ships. The migrants on board had been able to receive medical assistance, hot water, electricity, meals and hot drinks. Moreover, as recorded in a press agency note of 25\u00a0September 2011, T.R., a member of parliament (MP) had boarded the ships in the port of Palermo, and had observed that the migrants were in good health, that they were receiving assistance and were sleeping in cabins containing bed linen or reclining seats (poltrone reclinabili). Some of the Tunisians had been taken to hospital, while others had been treated on board by medical staff. Accompanied by the deputy chief of police (vice questore) and by police officers, the MP in question had talked with some of the migrants. He had thus been able to observe that they had access to prayer rooms, that the food was satisfactory (pasta, chicken, vegetables, fruit and water) and that the Civil Protection Authority (Protezione civile) had provided them with clothing. Some of the migrants had complained of a lack of razors, but the MP had observed that this could be explained by a measure taken to prevent self-harm.",

While acknowledging that Article 10 of Legislative Decree no.\u00a0286 of 1998 (see paragraph 33 below) did not indicate any time-frame for the adoption of such orders, the judge took the view that a measure which by its very nature restricted the freedom of the person concerned had to be taken within a reasonably short time after the identification (fermo) of the unlawful migrant. To find otherwise amounted to allowing de facto detention of the migrant in the absence of any reasoned decision of the authority, which would contravene the Constitution.",

Such practices are strictly prohibited under international, regional and domestic human rights and refugee law and standards. Additionally human rights and refugee law and standards require that the removing State must provide an effective remedy against removal. Removing people without giving them the chance of exercising their right to challenge their removal through an effective procedure gives rise per se to a human rights violation.

The Chamber further noted that the Government had not provided any explanation for that delay and that there was no exceptional circumstance capable of exempting them from their obligation to raise an objection to admissibility in a timely manner (see paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Chamber judgment).",

However, it had no legal basis in Italian law. In that connection, the Chamber observed that Italian law did not provide for the detention of migrants placed in a CSPA. In addition, in his decision of 1\u00a0June 2012, the Palermo preliminary investigations judge had stated that the Agrigento police authority had merely registered the presence of the migrants in the CSPA without taking decisions ordering their detention. The Chamber explained that the existence of a practice of de facto detention of migrants in Italy had been confirmed by the reports of the Senate\u2019s Special Commission and the PACE Ad Hoc Sub-Committee. The April 2011 agreement between Italy and Tunisia had not been accessible to those concerned and its consequences had therefore been unforeseeable. In the Chamber\u2019s view, it could not be established that the agreement provided for satisfactory safeguards against arbitrariness. The Chamber concluded in the light of the foregoing that the applicants\u2019 deprivation of liberty had not been \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and that there had been a violation of that provision in the present case (paragraphs\u00a066-73 of the Chamber judgment).",

France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7\u00a073, ECHR 2010). The difference between deprivation of liberty and restrictions on freedom of movement under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 is merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance. Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task, in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7\u00a7 92-93, Series A no. 39).

The United Nations Human Rights Committee had interpreted Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as incorporating a requirement of lawfulness and a broader protection against arbitrariness. It had specified that additional factors such as lack of cooperation or the possibility of absconding had to be present in order for the detention of an irregular migrant to be in conformity with Article 9, and that the existence of other, less invasive, means had to be taken into account (the intervening party referred, inter alia, to C.\u00a0v.\u00a0Australia, Communication no. 900/1999, UN\u00a0document CCPRIC/76/D900/1999 (2002)).

The Government did not allege that such a decision had been adopted in respect of the applicants and, in his decision of 1 June 2012, the Palermo preliminary investigations judge stated that the Agrigento police authority had merely registered the presence of the migrants in the CSPA without ordering their placement and that the same was true for the migrants\u2019 transfer to the ships (see paragraphs\u00a025-26 above). Consequently, the applicants were not only deprived of their liberty without a clear and accessible legal basis, they were also unable to enjoy the fundamental safeguards of habeas corpus, as laid down, for example, in Article\u00a013 of the Italian Constitution (see paragraph 32 above).

The notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d under paragraph 4 of Article 5 has the same meaning as in paragraph\u00a01, such that a detained person is entitled to a review of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 \u00a7 1. Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 does not guarantee a right to judicial review of such a scope as to empower the court, on all aspects of the case including questions of pure expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority. The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the \u201clawful\u201d detention of a person according to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see E. v.

Proceedings concerning issues of deprivation of liberty require particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2003-IV), and any exceptions to the requirement of \u201cspeedy\u201d review of the lawfulness of a measure of detention call for strict interpretation (see Lavrentiadis v.\u00a0Greece, no. 29896/13, \u00a7 45, 22 September 2015). The question whether the principle of speedy proceedings has been observed is not to be addressed in the abstract but in the context of a general assessment of the information, taking into account the circumstances of the case (see Luberti v.

In principle, however, since the liberty of the individual is at stake, the State must ensure that the proceedings are conducted as quickly as possible (see Fuchser v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 55894/00, \u00a7 43, 13 July 2006, and Lavrentiadis, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

In the Chamber\u2019s view, the fact that the MP had been accompanied by the deputy chief of police and police officers did not, in itself, cast doubt on his independence or on the veracity of his account.

A similar influx had occurred before the \u201cArab Spring\u201d and the decision to restrict the initial accommodation of migrants to the island of Lampedusa had sought to give the public the impression of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of Italian territory, to be exploited for political ends.

In their submission, they had had to eat their meals while sitting on the ground, since the CSPA had no canteen, and the toilets were in an appalling state and were often unusable.

In their submission, a violation of Article 3 of the Convention could not be excluded either on account of the nature of the CSPA or in view of the short duration of their detention. The duration in question was only one of the factors to be taken into consideration in assessing whether treatment exceeded the threshold of severity required for it to fall within the scope of Article 3. The Court had previously found violations of Article 3 of the Convention even in the case of very short periods of detention where there were other aggravating factors such as particularly appalling conditions or the vulnerability of the victims (the applicants referred to Brega v. Moldova, no. 52100/08, 20 April 2010; T.\u00a0and A. v.

It acknowledged that the Court had rarely found a violation of that Article in cases of short-term detention, and only in the presence of aggravating circumstances. However, the vulnerability of the migrants, combined with conditions of detention that impaired their human dignity, was sufficient for a finding that the level of severity required by Article 3 had been reached.

As the Court found in Mursi\u010d (cited above, \u00a7 139), in cases where a prison cell measuring in the range of 3 to 4 sq. m of personal space per inmate is at issue, the space factor remains a weighty consideration in the Court\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of the conditions of detention.

The Grand Chamber examined the general reception system for asylum-seekers in Italy and noted deficiencies in terms of the insufficient size of reception centres and the poor living conditions in the facilities available. In particular, there were long waiting lists for access to the centres, and the capacity of the facilities did not seem capable of absorbing the greater part of the demand for accommodation. While taking the view that the situation in Italy could \u201cin no way be compared to the situation in Greece at the time of the M.S.S. judgment\u201d and that it did not in itself act as a bar to all removals of asylum-seekers to that country, the Court nevertheless took the view that \u201cthe possibility that a significant number of asylum seekers [might] be left without accommodation or accommodated in overcrowded facilities without any privacy, or even in insalubrious or violent conditions, [could] not be dismissed as unfounded\u201d.

The Court held that this constituted degrading treatment. It reached a similar conclusion in A.A.\u00a0v.\u00a0Greece (no. 12186/08, \u00a7\u00a7 57-65, 22 July 2010), which concerned the three-month detention of an asylum-seeker in an overcrowded facility where the cleanliness and conditions of hygiene were atrocious, where no facility was available for leisure or meals, where the poor state of repair of the bathrooms made them virtually unusable and where the detainees had to sleep in dirty and cramped conditions (see, to the same effect, C.D. and Others v.

By 21\u00a0September 2011, when the applicants were on the island, 55,298 persons had arrived there by sea. As indicated by the Government (see paragraph 150 above), between 12\u00a0February and 31 December 2011, 51,573 nationals of third States (of whom about 46,000 were men and 26,000 were Tunisian nationals) landed on the islands of Lampedusa and Linosa. The arrival en masse of North African migrants undoubtedly created organisational, logistical and structural difficulties for the Italian authorities in view of the combination of requirements to be met, as they had to rescue certain vessels at sea, to receive and accommodate individuals arriving on Italian soil, and to take care of those in particularly vulnerable situations. The Court would observe in this connection that according to the data supplied by the Government (ibid.) and not disputed by the applicants, there were some 3,000 women and 3,000 children among the migrants who arrived during the period in question.",

An excessive burden might be imposed on the national authorities if they were required to interpret those numerous factors precisely and to foresee the scale and timeframe of an influx of migrants. In that connection it should be observed that the significant increase of arrivals by sea in 2011 compared to previous years was confirmed by the report of the PACE Ad Hoc Sub-Committee. According to that report, 15,527, 18,047, 11,749 and 31,252 migrants had arrived on Lampedusa in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively. The number of arrivals had diminished in 2009 and 2010, with, respectively, 2,947 and 459 individuals (see, in particular, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10 of the report, cited in paragraph 49 above). That reduction had been significant enough for the authorities to close the reception centres on Lampedusa (see, in particular, ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 51). When those data are compared with the figures for the period from 12\u00a0February to 31\u00a0December 2011 (see paragraphs\u00a0150 and 179 above), which saw 51,573 nationals from third countries arriving on Lampedusa and Linosa, it can be appreciated that the year 2011 was marked by a very significant increase in the number of migrants arriving by sea from North African countries on the Italian islands to the south of Sicily.",

In toilets and showers privacy was ensured only by cloth or plastic curtains placed in an improvised manner, water pipes were sometimes blocked or leaking, the smell from the toilets pervaded the whole area, and rainwater carried dampness and dirt into the living quarters.

However, the present case can be distinguished in various respects from those judgments. In particular, in the Brega judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a039-43), a forty-eight-hour period of detention had been combined with wrongful arrest, a renal colic attack subsequently suffered by the applicant, a delay in medical assistance, a lack of bedding, and a low temperature in the cell. In the case of T. and A. v. Turkey (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-99), the personal space available to the first applicant for the three days of her detention had been limited (between 2.3 and 1.23 sq. m) and there had been only one sofa-bed on which the inmates took turns to sleep. Lastly, the Gavrilovici judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-44) concerned a longer period of detention than that endured by the present applicants (five days), with the aggravating factors that the four inmates were obliged to sleep on a wooden platform about 1.8 m wide, that there was no heating or toilet in the cell and that the cells in the \u015etefan-Vod\u0103 police station had subsequently been closed because they were held to be incompatible with any form of detention. The Court also has regard to the cases of Koktysh v.\u00a0Ukraine (no.\u00a043707/07, \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 91-95, 10 December 2009), concerning detention periods of ten and four days in a very overcrowded cell, where prisoners had to take it in turns to sleep, in a prison where the conditions had been described as \u201catrocious\u201d, and C\u0103\u015funeanu v.

As that facility was designed more as a transit centre than a detention centre, the authorities were under an obligation to take steps to find other satisfactory reception facilities with enough space and to transfer a sufficient number of migrants to those facilities. However, in the present case the Court cannot address the question whether that obligation was fulfilled, because only two days after the arrival of the last two applicants, on 20\u00a0September 2011, a violent revolt broke out among the migrants and the Lampedusa CSPA was gutted by fire (see paragraph 14 above). It cannot be presumed that the Italian authorities remained inactive and negligent, nor can it be maintained that the transfer of the migrants should have been organised and carried out in less than two or three days. In this connection it is noteworthy that in the Aarabi case (cited above, \u00a7 50) the Court found that the decision of the domestic authorities to transfer a certain number of individuals, including the applicant, to another detention centre had demonstrated their willingness to improve the applicant\u2019s conditions of detention in a timely manner. The relevant decision in Aarabi, however, had been taken thirteen days after the applicant\u2019s placement in the Mersinidi centre.",

France, 27 August 1992, \u00a7 110, Series A no.\u00a0241A; Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336; Aksoy v.\u00a0Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 61, Reports 1996-VI; and Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 87). In addition, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim (see Salman, cited above, \u00a7 100; Rivas v.\u00a0France, no. 59584/00, \u00a7\u00a038, 1 April 2004; Turan \u00c7ak\u0131r v.

In the absence of any such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government (see, among other authorities, ElMasri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0152). This is justified by the fact that persons in the hands of the police or a comparable authority are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (see, Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84; see also, in respect of persons in police custody, Salman, cited above, \u00a7 99).",

Russia, no. 3811/02, \u00a7 83, 12\u00a0February 2009, and Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7 85). Nevertheless, sound evidence alone, not mere hypothetical speculation, is necessary to call into question the assessment of the facts by an independent domestic court. The applicants have not, however, produced any evidence capable of showing that the press inaccurately reported the MP\u2019s statements. In addition, the police presence in the detention centre cannot be regarded as unusual and cannot, in itself, give rise to objectively justified doubts as to the reliability of the results of a visit to or inspection of such a facility. The Court would indicate its agreement with the Chamber\u2019s findings that the fact that the MP was accompanied by the deputy chief of police and police officers did not in itself mean that the MP\u2019s independence or the veracity of his account had to be called into question.",

The second and third applicants had already boarded planes for Tunis, while the first applicant was to do so the following day (29 September 2011 \u2013 see paragraph\u00a017 above).

It observed that the agreement between Italy and Tunisia of April 2011, which had not been made public, provided for the return of unlawful migrants from Tunisia through simplified procedures, on the basis of the mere identification by the Tunisian consular authorities of the person concerned.

Even though the similarity between the orders did not, in itself, lead to the conclusion that there had been a collective expulsion, it was an indication to that effect. In addition, in Sharifi and Others (cited above) the Court had found a violation of Article 4 of Protocol\u00a0No. 4 in respect of one of the applicants who had been expelled (Mr Reza Karimi) even though he had been identified, because there was no evidence that, at the time of the identity check, an interpreter or independent legal adviser had been present, those being indications of an individual interview. Where there was evidence of such an interview, however, the Court had excluded any violation of that provision in the cases of M.A. v.\u00a0Cyprus (no. 41872/10, ECHR 2013); Sultani v. France (no. 45223/05, ECHR\u00a02007-IV); and Andric v.\u00a0Sweden ((dec.) no. 45917/99, 23\u00a0February 1999). In the applicants\u2019 view, to exclude the need for an individual interview would render meaningless the procedural safeguard of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4, because an expulsion could be justified purely on the basis that the alien\u2019s nationality \u2013 that is, the fact of belonging to a group \u2013 had been established.",

In particular, \u201crefusal of entry at the border\u201d was a decision by the border guards to turn away aliens arriving at border crossings without papers and without meeting the requirements for admission to Italy. The \u201cdeferred refusal-of-entry\u201d procedure, ordered by the Chief of Police (questore), applied where an alien had entered the country illegally and had been allowed to stay temporarily to receive protection. Lastly, \u201cdeportation\u201d corresponded to a written and reasoned decision whereby the competent administrative or judicial authorities ordered the removal from the country of an alien who did not have, or no longer had, leave to remain in the country.

In addition, a number of people had been simultaneously summoned to the police station, in conditions that made it very difficult for them to contact a lawyer, and the political bodies responsible had announced that there would be operations of that kind. The applicants in the second case (Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, \u00a7 185) had not undergone any identity checks and the authorities had merely put the migrants, who had been intercepted on the high seas, onto military vessels to take them back to the Libyan coast. In Georgia v.\u00a0Russia (I) (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 170-78) the finding of a violation was based on a \u201croutine of expulsions\u201d, which had followed a recurrent pattern throughout Russia, the result of a coordinated policy of arrest, detention and expulsion of Georgians, who had been arrested under the pretext of examination of their documents, taken to Militia stations where they were gathered in large groups, and expelled after courts had entered into preliminary agreements to endorse such decisions, without any legal representation or examination of the particular circumstances of each case. In Sharifi and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 214-25), lastly, the Court, taking into consideration a range of sources, found that the migrants intercepted in Adriatic ports were being subjected to \u201cautomatic returns\u201d to Greece and had been deprived of any effective possibility of seeking asylum.",

However, the parties are not in agreement as to the conditions of the first identification. In the Government\u2019s submission, it had consisted of a genuine individual interview, carried out in the presence of an interpreter or cultural mediator, following which the authorities had filled out an \u201cinformation sheet\u201d containing personal data and any circumstances specific to each migrant (see paragraph 224 above). The applicants alleged, by contrast, that the Italian authorities had merely recorded their identities and fingerprints, without taking their personal situations into account and without any interpreter or independent legal adviser being present (see paragraph\u00a0214 above).

In that context, the Court also notes that, according to the report of the PACE Ad Hoc Sub-Committee (see paragraph\u00a049 above), interpreters and cultural mediators worked on Lampedusa from February 2011 onwards (see \u00a7 28 of that report).

In that context it is significant that, as stated by the Government (see paragraph\u00a0225 above) and the Palermo preliminary investigations judge (see paragraphs\u00a025 and 27 above), and not disputed by the applicants, seventy-two migrants held in the Lampedusa CSPA at the time of the fire expressed their wish to apply for asylum, thus halting their return and resulting in their transfer to other reception centres. It is true that the applicants stated that their individual circumstances did not allow them to invoke international protection (see paragraph 222 above). Nevertheless, in an expulsion procedure the possibility of lodging an asylum application is a paramount safeguard, and there is no reason to assume that the Italian authorities, which heeded the wishes of other migrants who sought to rely on the nonrefoulement principle, would have remained unreceptive in response to the submission of other legitimate and legally arguable impediments to their removal.",

Even though it was carried out by a representative of a third State, this later check enabled the migrants\u2019 nationality to be confirmed and gave them a last chance to raise arguments against their expulsion. The Government, whose claims on this point are not disputed by the applicants, substantiated them by pointing out that, after details as to their age or nationality had been established during their meetings with the Tunisian Consul, some of the migrants listed by the Italian authorities had not been removed after all (see paragraph 227 above).",

However, according to the case-law cited in paragraph 239 above, those two facts cannot in themselves be decisive. In the Court\u2019s view, the relatively simple and standardised nature of the refusal-of-entry orders could be explained by the fact that the applicants did not have any valid travel documents and had not alleged either that they feared ill-treatment in the event of their return or that there were any other legal impediments to their expulsion. It is therefore not unreasonable in itself for those orders to have been justified merely by the applicants\u2019 nationality, by the observation that they had unlawfully crossed the Italian border, and by the absence of any of the situations provided for in Article 10 \u00a7 4 of Legislative Decree no. 286 of 1998 (political asylum, granting of refugee status or the adoption of temporary protection measures on humanitarian grounds, see paragraphs 19 and 33 above).",

There is no evidence before the Court to cast doubt on the effectiveness of that remedy in principle. Moreover, the Government adduced two decisions of the Agrigento Justice of the Peace showing that, on an appeal by two migrants, the judge examined the procedure followed for the issuance of the refusal-of-entry orders in question and assessed the lawfulness of that procedure in the light of domestic law and the Constitution. The Justice of the Peace decided, in particular, that the orders should be declared null and void on the ground that an excessive length of time had elapsed between the identification of each irregular migrant and the adoption of the order (see paragraphs 3031 above). Like the Chamber, the Court sees no reason to doubt that, in the event of an appeal against a refusal-of-entry order, the Justice of the Peace would also be entitled to examine any complaint about a failure to take account of the personal situation of the migrant concerned and based therefore, in substance, on the collective nature of the expulsion.",

Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, \u00a7 448, ECHR\u00a02005III), independent and rigorous scrutiny of a claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see Jabari, cited above, \u00a7 50), and reasonable promptness (see Bat\u0131 and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 33097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7 136, ECHR 2004IV).

The Chamber then took the view that the reports of the Italian Senate\u2019s Special Commission, of Amnesty International and of the PACE Ad Hoc Sub-Committee corroborated the applicants\u2019 allegations about the overcrowding and general lack of hygiene in the CSPA, hence the finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in spite of the short length \u2013 two or three days \u2013 of the applicants\u2019 stay in the centre (see paragraphs\u00a0130-36 of the Chamber judgment).",

The judgment also emphasises the fact that, as the Government (see paragraph\u00a0225 of the judgment) and the Palermo preliminary investigations judge (paragraphs 25 and 27) pointed out, without this being denied by the applicants, seventy-two migrants in the Lampedusa CSPA at the time of the fire had expressed their intention to submit an asylum application, thereby halting the return procedure concerning them and resulting in their transfer to other reception centres. It is true that the applicants declared that their personal circumstances did not enable them to seek international protection (see paragraph 222 of the judgment), but, as noted by the Grand Chamber, the possibility of lodging an asylum application in the context of an expulsion procedure is a paramount safeguard and there is nothing to suggest that the Italian authorities, which were prepared to listen to migrants wishing to invoke the non-refoulement principle, would have remained unresponsive if they had been made aware of other legitimate and legally arguable impediments to the applicants\u2019 removal.",

The right of all aliens in a collective expulsion scenario is an autonomous procedural right. The said provision and the relevant case-law do not go to the merits of the case or to the results of compliance with the procedural obligation. Besides, according to the above passage, an alien can put forward his or her arguments against the measure taken by the relevant authority and this does not apply only when there is an effective possibility of submitting arguments against expulsion, for example in an asylum procedure. Without a personal interview, as was the case here, there is automatically a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4. It is immaterial what the applicants\u2019 lawyers said in the oral hearing, namely that \u201cthe applicants\u2019 individual circumstances did not enable them to rely on international protection or the non-refoulement principle\u201d (see paragraph\u00a0222 of the judgment). That cannot, in my view, undermine the applicants\u2019 case, because what was important for them was to have an interview and have the right to put forward their arguments against the measure taken, whether these arguments were valid or not, and whether or not they had any arguments at all, considering that they did not have, at the time, the assistance of a lawyer to explain their legal rights to them. Their lawyers in the oral hearing said that they were not in a position to say on which legal grounds their clients could have relied to justify their stay in Italy. And that was, of course, a genuine statement, since the applicants have not applied ex post facto for leave to remain in Italy or called for a remedy to that end.

Russia, no. 59261/00, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2006-III; and Kurt v.\u00a0Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7 125, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III). The lack of a proper record of an individual\u2019s arrest and detention is thus sufficient for the Court to find that there has been a violation of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2002IV, and Menesheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 87-89). If this formality of keeping an official record is indispensable for the guarantee of a non-absolute right, as it is for the right under Article 5 \u00a7 1, one may wonder why such a formality should not, all the more so, be indispensable for the guarantee of an absolute procedural right, as is the right secured by Article\u00a04 of Protocol No. 4.",

Nor did they specify how many of these eight specialists were interpreters and how many were cultural mediators. In any event, there were only eight such specialists, and the reference to any other specialist, like social operators, social workers and psychologists (see paragraph\u00a0246 of the judgment), was, with due respect, not only irrelevant, but also misleading, because the allegation of the Government as to who could have been present at the interview was confined only to an interpreter or a cultural mediator. Moreover, at the CSPA, at the relevant time, there were a considerable number of foreign nationals, as is indicated in the judgment (see paragraphs 180 and 182). It is thus possible that the number of interpreters or cultural mediators may not have been sufficient in order to attend to all the needs as required. In other words, the administrative infrastructure needed to properly process so many expulsions in a short period of time was not necessarily adequate. One does not know, after all, how many of these interpreters or cultural workers were working on the date when the personal interviews allegedly took place. Since the burden of proof that a personal interview was actually conducted is on the Government, and, since they could not name the person who conducted the alleged interview or offer the Court any evidence from him or her as to the content of the interview, any such allegation could only be speculative, without having any evidential weight, not even on the standard of the \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d. However, I believe that the standard of proof in such cases must be high and specifically \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d, since the procedural right guaranteed under Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 is absolute, and the procedural obligation of the respondent State thereunder is mandatory. In other words, a State which expels aliens en masse is presumed to be in violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 unless it can prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that it followed due process regarding every alien in the group, through a procedure involving personal interviews.",

In view of the facts of the case, and despite the vulnerable or difficult situation of the applicants, it is my opinion that the applicants were not afforded by the authorities an opportunity to have a personal interview or to raise any claim or to obtain legal assistance.

It is a sound rule of construction, which I believe applies also in regard to the Convention\u2019s provisions, to give the same meaning to the same words or phrases occurring in different parts of a legal instrument, unless it is otherwise made clear (see F.A.R. Bennion, Bennion on Statutory Interpretation: a Code, fifth edition, London, 2008, pp.\u00a01160 and 1217 and the relevant common law case-law cited therein). In accordance with a systemic interpretation and the principle that the Convention should be interpreted as a whole and its different parts should be understood noscitur a sociis, Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 4 should be read in conjunction and the phrase \u201ccollective expulsion\u201d should be interpreted in association with the other terms of Article 3 \u00a7 1 in their context and reading Protocol No. 4 as a whole.

It must be emphasised that the rights under Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol\u00a0No. 4 are both absolute rights, which apply without exception. As rightly put by Professor Feldman, human dignity \u201cmay need to be taken into account ... when interpreting the Convention rights themselves ...\u201d (David\u00a0Feldman, \u201cHuman Dignity as a Legal Value\u201d \u2013 part II, Public Law, Spring 2000, p. 75). Therefore it would not have been the intention of the drafters of the Convention to limit the procedural guarantee of Article 4 of Protocol\u00a0No. 4, underpinned as it is by human dignity, only to cases where the expulsion of people is numerically massive, and not also in the event of an arbitrary expulsion of smaller groups of aliens, not treating such people as a group under Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 and without requiring any reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each alien in a group on a case-by-case basis involving a personal interview. The procedural guarantee of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 is based on the idea that human herding and collective and indiscriminate removal diminish individuality and offend against personality, autonomy and human dignity. Thus, ultimately, it is human dignity that Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 seeks to protect. Again, it would be contrary to the idea of human nature and the purpose of the Convention for the Court to decide the issue in question on the basis of arithmetical considerations.",

The original draft of the Article had actually, in its first two paragraphs, contained wording similar to that now to be found in Article 1 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of Protocol No. 7, which deals expressly with individual expulsion of aliens lawfully resident in the territory of a State. But draft Article 4 of Protocol No. 4, in its third and last paragraph provided that: \u201cCollective expulsion is prohibited\u201d (ibid., pp.\u00a0447 and 454). This last paragraph, unlike the first two, was intended to apply irrespective of the nationality or residence of the persons expelled (ibid., pp.\u00a0481 and 505). The Committee of Experts ultimately decided not to include in Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 any provision concerning the individual expulsion of aliens lawfully residing in the territory of the State and it thus deleted the first two paragraphs, leaving only the expulsion of a group, but limiting it to aliens only, irrespective, of course, of the lawfulness of their residence (ibid., pp. 490, 505 and 507). The Committee excluded the collective expulsion of nationals from this provision, as they were to be covered by Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a04. It was not until Protocol\u00a0No. 7 came into force, about twenty-one years after the entry into force of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a04, that the individual expulsion of aliens lawfully resident in the territory of a State was finally regulated. However, as regards individual expulsions of aliens who are unlawfully within the territory of a State, there is no provision in the Convention or its Protocols specifically regulating such matters, and this omission may or may not have been intentional.",

Unlike, Article 4 of Protocol No. 4, which applies irrespective of the lawfulness of the residence of the applicants, Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 7 applies only to lawful residents in a State. Accordingly, in Sulejmanovic and Sultanovic v. Italy, no. 57574/00, 14\u00a0March 2002, the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 was rejected on the ground that the applicants were not considered lawfully resident in Italy, but the complaint under Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 was declared admissible.",

This guarantee is to be secured by all High Contracting Parties to everyone within their jurisdiction, as provided by Article 1 of the Convention. If a State, despite the conduct of personal interviews, nevertheless ignores the personal circumstances of each alien forming a group and proceeds with the simultaneous expulsions of all members of the same group merely on the basis of their nationality, religion or membership of a group, without considering the individual circumstances of each alien, it still violates Article 4 of Protocol No. 4, because it goes against the aim of the said provision. One should not confuse the prohibition of collective expulsion in Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 on a basis other than the personal circumstances of each of the aliens involved, which is a procedural guarantee and at the same the aim of the provision, with any arguable substantive right an alien may have to remain in a territory. Thus the circumstances surrounding the implementation of an expulsion decision, and the decision of implementation itself, play a role in the application of Article\u00a04 of Protocol No. 4 and must be considered as an additional requirement of its application.",

This, ultimately, would mean that the suspensive effect of a removal order will be dependent on the discretion of the immigration authorities, to assess, in advance and before an appeal decision is taken, whether an alien has an \u201carguable\u201d complaint that he or she faces a violation of Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention. However, even assuming that the above approach was correct, and the immigration authorities were convinced that there was a real risk of violations of rights guaranteed by Articles 2 and 3, the refusal-of-entry orders, based on the bilateral agreements between Italy and Tunisia, would probably remain unaffected, still prohibiting suspension of enforcement in the case of the lodging of an appeal.",

This section is entitled: \u201cCompliance with Article 13 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8\u201d. Accordingly, what is said in paragraph 82 in relation to compliance with Article 13 taken in conjunction with Articles\u00a02 and 3 of the Convention and Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 is said obiter, because the relevant issue there was compliance with Article 13 taken together with Article 8. The meaning of paragraph 82, as I understand it, is that Article 13 of the Convention can apply in conjunction with (i) Article\u00a02 of the Convention, (ii) Article 3 of the Convention, or (iii) Article 4 of Protocol\u00a0No. 4, independently and separately, without the latter depending on whether there is also an issue concerning Article 2 or Article 3.
