Under Article 8 of the Convention, however, he cited previous case-law which held that in such cases, generally, the interest of the local authority as landlord and of other persons in need of social housing had been taken into account by the applicable common law and legislation, and that, provided that the local authority had acted lawfully, it was not open to a court to put aside a claim for possession, except in exceptional circumstances where it appeared that the former tenant\u2019s Article 8 rights had not been properly considered. He noted the circumstances in which Mrs McCann had signed the notice to quit and observed that, if she had not been induced to sign it, the local authority would have had to apply for a possession order under section 84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 below). It would then have been open to the applicant to seek to persuade the court that it would not be reasonable to grant the order; he and Mrs McCann could have given evidence regarding the alleged domestic violence; and he could in addition have raised such issues as his own housing needs and the need to provide accommodation for the children when they visited. In the circumstances, the judge held that the local authority had not acted as required by Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and he dismissed the claim for possession.",

It concerns the relationship between the two paragraphs of Article 8. I have held that eviction of these appellants would constitute a prima facie violation of their right to respect for their homes. But this conclusion is not simply an instance of that everyday judicial process, the application of a statute\u2019s correct construction (here, Article 8 \u00a7 1) to a particular set of facts. Rather it has a purposive quality. The court has to arrive at a judicial choice between two possibilities, a choice which transcends the business of finding out what the legislation\u2019s words mean. The first choice ... would entail a judgment that the Convention requirement was met at the Article 8 \u00a7 1 stage ... The second choice (accepting a prima facie violation of Article 8 \u00a7 1), which I prefer, entails a judgment that the more rigorous and specific standards set out in Article\u00a08\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 have to be met if the court is to hold that the evictions are compatible with the appellants\u2019 Convention rights. The Convention is, as it were, much more remotely engaged in the fabric of our domestic law if the first, rather than the second, choice is taken. Part of the court\u2019s task is to decide how close that engagement should be in the context in hand. Thus I do not eschew the first choice merely because I take the view that the second more naturally reflects the ordinary sense of the words used in Article\u00a08 \u00a7\u00a01. I consider as a matter of substance that the vindication and fulfilment of the Convention rights, for which purpose [the Human Rights Act 1998] was enacted, require that the domestic law procedures involved in these appeals should be subjected to scrutiny for conformity with the Article 8 \u00a7 2 standards. Such a process is demanded by the fullness of our municipal law of human rights.\u201d",

In such a case, an Article 8 defence, if raised, should simply be struck out. However, in the light of the judgments in Connors and Ble\u010di\u010d it was necessary to emphasise that a person evicted might have a defence to possession proceedings in exceptional cases, namely (a) where he challenged the domestic law as itself being incompatible with Article 8 (as in Connors); or (b) where he challenged the action of the public-authority landlord on public law grounds, on the basis that the authority\u2019s actions constituted an abuse of power.",

In circumstances where the relationship between joint tenants had broken down, it was the local authority\u2019s policy to obtain a relinquishing form from the departing tenant (see paragraph 21 above). This policy was eminently sensible, since it permitted the local-authority landlord to regain control of its property and thus to manage scarce housing resources effectively. The procedural protection against the termination of a secure tenancy contained in sections\u00a082-84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above) were applicable only in circumstances where the landlord was seeking to terminate the tenancy. In the present case, the joint tenancy was brought to an end by the applicant\u2019s wife serving notice to quit.",

Moreover, it was now clear from the House of Lords\u2019 decision in Kay (see paragraphs 26-28 above) that an individual in the applicant\u2019s position would not need to commence proceedings by way of judicial review in order to raise this kind of public law challenge; such objections could now be raised by way of collateral challenge to possession proceedings in the County Court. The clarification in Kay served to underline the extent of the procedural protection provided to individuals in the applicant\u2019s position.
