Therefore the searching of lawyers\u2019 premises should be subject to especially strict scrutiny (see Elci and Others v. , nos. 23145/93 and 25091/94, \u00a7 669, 13 November 2003). To determine whether these measures were \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the Court has to explore the availability of effective safeguards against abuse or arbitrariness under domestic law and to check how those safeguards operated in the specific case under examination. Elements taken into consideration in this regard are the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure have been effected, whether they were carried out pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge or a judicial officer \u2013 or subjected to after-the-fact judicial scrutiny \u2013, whether the warrant was based on reasonable suspicion and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search was executed, and \u2013 where a lawyer\u2019s office is concerned \u2013 whether it was carried out in the presence of an independent observer to ensure that material subject to legal professional privilege is not removed. The Court must finally take into account the extent of the possible repercussions on the work and the reputation of the persons affected by the search (see Camenzind v. Switzerland, 16\u00a0December 1997, \u00a7 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VIII; Buck, cited above, \u00a7 45; Smirnov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a071362/01, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2007-...; and Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH v.

It follows from the text of the search warrants that the only piece of evidence submitted by the investigator in support of his application was the report by an expert who had been commissioned to compare the documents prepared by Mr S. and by the applicant with a view to determining whether they could have been prepared on the same printing device. The report indicated that no reliable finding could be drawn because the documents lacked any distinctive marks which could have permitted identification of the printing device (see paragraph 8 above). In his application, the investigator did not explain how the seizure of the printing device from the applicant\u2019s home or office could have furthered the investigation in the absence of any distinctive marks on the documents capable of ensuring identification of the specific device. The investigator did not refer to any evidence which could have corroborated his conjecture that the applicant was involved in the printing of the documents allegedly forged by Mr S. The District Court, for its part, merely acknowledged the existence of the report without analysing its contents and findings. Whilst acknowledging that the applicant was an advocate and that he had not been charged or accused of any criminal offence or unlawful activities, the District Court did not examine whether the material gathered by the investigation was capable of founding a reasonable suspicion that he was implicated in the fraud allegedly organised by Mr S. The Court finds therefore that the search warrants were not founded on \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons.",

They allowed the investigative authorities to carry out searches in the applicant\u2019s home and office in general and broad terms (compare Niemietz, cited above, \u00a7 37; Smirnov, cited above, \u00a7 47; and Ernst and Others v.\u00a0Belgium, no.\u00a033400/96, \u00a7\u00a0116, 15 July 2003). The subsequent judicial review confirmed that the search warrants had not referred to \u201cany concrete list of objects or documents\u201d and that the investigator therefore had unrestricted discretion in determining which documents were \u201cof interest\u201d for the criminal investigation (see paragraphs 16 and 18 above). Moreover, in issuing the warrant the judge did not touch upon the issue of whether privileged material was to be safeguarded, although he was aware \u2013 as was mentioned in the text of the search warrants \u2013 that the applicant was a bar member and could have possessed documents given to him by his clients. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, search warrants have to be drafted, as far as practicable, in a manner calculated to keep their impact within reasonable bounds (see Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria, no. 65755/01, \u00a7\u00a041, 22 May 2008, and Van Rossem v. Belgium, no. 41872/98, \u00a7 45, 9\u00a0December 2004). This requirement was manifestly disregarded in the present case.",

The Court notes that during the search there was no safeguard in place against interference with professional secrecy, such as, for example, a prohibition on removing documents covered by lawyer-client privilege or supervision of the search by an independent observer capable of identifying, independently of the investigation team, which documents were covered by legal professional privilege (see Sallinen and Others v. , no.\u00a050882/99, \u00a7\u00a089, 27\u00a0September 2005, and Tamosius v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a062002/00, ECHR 2002-VIII). The presence of two attesting witnesses obviously could not be considered a sufficient safeguard, given that they were laymen who had no legal qualification and were unable to detect privileged material (see Iliya Stefanov, cited above, \u00a7 43). Moreover, as regards the electronic data contained in the applicant\u2019s computers which were seized by the investigator, it does not seem that any sort of sifting procedure was followed during the search (see Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH, cited above, \u00a7 63).",
