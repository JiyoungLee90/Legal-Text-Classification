Mr K\u00f6ck had entered the public arena as he had been commissioned as an expert by the regional government and had, furthermore, repeatedly expressed his views on this subject in public. He had done so in an exceptionally provocative manner and the applicant had merely responded to those views. Given the nature of his commission, Mr K\u00f6ck should have been required to exercise particular restraint until the study was completed in order to avoid anticipating and forestalling its conclusions. Any expert who stated the direction his findings would take before he had concluded his report left himself open to a high degree of legitimate criticism. The applicant's statements had been value judgments with a sufficient factual basis, namely Mr K\u00f6ck's provocative public comments and his general conduct. The matter at issue was of the greatest public interest and the applicant had relied upon information which was already within the public domain. The applicant had also explained his principal reasons for concern, namely Mr K\u00f6ck's involvement in the creation of a private hospital management company with an abbreviated name (KABAG) confusingly similar to that of the holding company which operated Carinthia's regional hospitals (Landeskrankenanstalten\u2013Betriebsgesellschaft, KABEG). The statement that Mr K\u00f6ck intended to smash the Carinthian health system had to be seen in the whole context of all the statements. Obviously every reader would understand that Mr\u00a0K\u00f6ck was not accused of smashing the system himself but of recommending measures to that effect. The mere reference to another expert who had failed and had been pursued by the criminal justice could not be understood as an implied accusation of Mr K\u00f6ck. The applicant contended finally that the courts' decisions ordering him not only to refrain from further similar statements, but also to retract his comments had not been proportionate either.",

The Austrian courts had legitimately interpreted the statements in the sense normally attributable to similar reproaches. Even assuming that Mr\u00a0K\u00f6ck was to be considered as a person of public life, the impugned statements had transgressed the limit of acceptable criticism. The Austrian courts' orders had also been proportionate. In that regard the Government argued that the applicant had neither been convicted nor made to pay compensation. He had merely been ordered to refrain from making clearly defined incorrect statements of fact and by no means impeded from voicing his opinion in other less derogatory and defamatory words.

It is not in dispute either that the interference was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d and served a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the rights and reputation of others. The parties' argument concentrated on the necessity of the interference. As regards the general principles relating to the freedom of the expression and the question of assessing the necessity of an interference with that freedom, the Court refers to the summary of its established case-law in the case of Nilsen\u00a0and\u00a0Johnsen\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway ([GC], no. 23118/93, \u00a7 43, ECHR 1999-VIII).",

The applicant had further mentioned the previous employment, by Mr Haider, of another \u201calleged technical wonder-wizard\u201d who had ended up before the Public Prosecutor's Office.

It notes that the applicant stated his indignation at Mr K\u00f6ck's alleged intentions and thereby expressed his own opinion rather than an actual statement of fact. The Court further notes that there existed at the material time certain objective factors supporting the applicant's allegations concerning Mr K\u00f6ck's wishes \u201cto erase\u201d health institutions from the public landscape and \u201cto take them over\u201d himself. Mr K\u00f6ck had in fact advocated cutting down superfluous services and closing smaller hospitals and hospital departments. He had also recently founded a company whose purpose was to take over and run hospitals. While asserting that he was not focusing on Carinthian hospitals yet, he had not excluded this possibility in future. The applicant's assertion that this amounted to the \u201csmash[ing of] our public health system\u201d has to be considered as his - certainly exaggerated and polemical - value judgment on the above events. The subsequent reference made by the applicant to a previous expert employed by Mr Haider who had been the subject of criminal investigations undoubtedly constituted a statement of fact. However, unlike the domestic courts, the Court does not find that this statement actually implied any reproach of criminal conduct against Mr\u00a0K\u00f6ck. From the context in which this statement was made, it appears that this incident was rather cited as an example of the FP\u00d6 party's ways of choosing and supporting experts.",

Mr K\u00f6ck had been appointed by the Regional Government, against the will of the SP\u00d6 party, as an expert in this matter. He had repeatedly discussed this issue before the press and had thus entered the public arena. As a consequence, he had to bear a higher degree of tolerance (see, mutatis mutandis, Nilsen and Johnsen v. , cited above, \u00a752). The Court further notes that, apart from calling for cut backs, Mr\u00a0K\u00f6ck had also expressed harsh criticism of the actual functioning of the regional hospitals, stating that many unnecessary surgical operations were carried out and that the mortality rate due to medical negligence was relatively high. By doing so, Mr K\u00f6ck certainly had to expect indignation and protest by the applicant, who spoke in his capacity as chairman of the Workers' Committee of the Carinthian regional hospitals.",

In this regard the Court further reiterates that Article 10 also protects information or ideas that offend, shock or disturb (see Handyside\u00a0v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom judgment of 7\u00a0December\u00a01976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, \u00a7 49).
