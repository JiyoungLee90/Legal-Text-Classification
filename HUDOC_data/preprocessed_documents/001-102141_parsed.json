Instead, they appear to argue that the High Court's section 4(2) order imposed a civil obligation on them to refrain from reporting on the appeal proceedings and thus that they had a right to a hearing at which they could challenge the imposition of that obligation. However, in the Court's view, this is, in effect, an indirect challenge to the Commission's decision in Hodgson and others. The applicants have simply sought to re-cast the issue as one of obligations rather than rights. If, consistently with the decision in Hodgson and others, the right to report matters stated in open court is not a civil right, then an interference with that right cannot create a civil obligation within the meaning of Article 6. The mere fact of an interference by a State authority with the right to impart a certain kind of information cannot create a civil obligation where there is no corresponding civil right to impart that information. Consequently, the Court finds the applicants' submission to be, in effect, an invitation to depart from the Commission's decision in Hodgson and others. It is well-established in the Court's case-law that, in the interests of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law that it should not depart, without good reason, from precedents laid down in previous cases (see Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028957/95, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2002VI). The Court cannot find any good reason to depart from the Commission's decision in Hodgson and others. Indeed the wording of Article 6 \u00a7 1, which expressly allows for the exclusion of the public and press from court proceedings on certain, limited grounds, would appear to preclude any applicant from asserting a right to report court proceedings, still less from asserting that such a right were civil in nature: a general reporting restriction must be regarded as the exercise of a public authority prerogative and can in no way be regarded as decisive for the private rights and obligations of any one media outlet. The Court therefore confirms the Commission's finding in that case that the right to report matters stated in open court, cannot be described as a right which is \u201ccivil\u201d in nature for purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1. The applicants' complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 must, therefore, be rejected as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

The present case was different from BBC Petitioners. In that case, BBC Scotland had applied for the recall of a section 4(2) order and, after a hearing, the application was refused. There was no remedy then available other than by petition to the nobile officium. In the present case, because the application made by the letter of 15 February was still pending, the High Court would have been compelled to reject any petition to the nobile officium.",

Nor does the 'authority' referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see, among many other authorities, the Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 42, \u00a7 113, and the Chahal v. the United Kingdom judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, pp. 1869-70, \u00a7 145).\u201d",

The enactment of section 159 enabled the Commission to decide that a friendly settlement had been concluded in that case (see G. Hodgson, D. Woolf Productions Ltd. and National Union of Journalists v. the United Kingdom and Channel Four Television Co. Ltd. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 11553/85 and 11658/85, Commission's report of 15 July 1987, unreported). It is not for this Court to second guess Parliament's decision not to extend section 159 to Scotland. Nevertheless, the Court notes that the Government have sought to defend the decision not to extend section 159 to Scotland by submitting that the practice of the Scottish courts since Galbraith and the existence of the nobile officium make it unnecessary to do so. Accordingly, the Court must consider whether these remedies, either separately or cumulatively, provide an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 read in conjunction with Article 10.",

However, it is not the task of this Court to determine whether the applicants' fax of the afternoon of 15 February constituted proper notification of their intention to contest the interim order made by the High Court. Moreover, it is not for the Court to determine whether, if the fax did constitute proper notification, this had the effect of preventing the interim order from becoming final on 17 February 2005. The Court does, nevertheless, note that the dispute between the parties as to these two issues has arisen due to the informal nature of the practice which has evolved in respect of challenges to section 4(2) orders since Galbraith.",

The Court has no doubt that, at any such hearing, a Scottish court would give appropriate consideration to any submissions made on the basis of Article 10 of Convention and that it would apply the guidance set out in Galbraith as to when section 4(2) orders can be made in conformity with Article 10. Nevertheless, the fact remains that, under the present system, any Scottish court which makes a section 4(2) order is under no obligation to hear representations from the media and, even where it does hear such representations, there is no obligation upon it to do so within a reasonable period of time and in any event prior to the proceedings to which the section 4(2) order relates. Instead, the practice since Galbraith appears to depend entirely upon the media making informal contact with court officials to arrange an appropriate hearing. It further appears that the reply received by court officials is the only basis upon which the media will know if a hearing is to be held and when that hearing is to take place. This approach may have the advantage of flexibility but the potential shortcomings are self-evident. The Court has repeatedly stated that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that, in that context, the safeguards guaranteed to the press are particularly important (see, as recent authority, Financial Times Ltd and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 821/03, \u00a7 59, 15 December 2009). When proper consideration is given to what is at stake for the media when section 4(2) orders are imposed, it becomes apparent that current Scottish practice provides too slender a basis for the safeguards which are required in this context.",

Poland, no. 1543/06, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83, ECHR 2007VI).

The Court observes that it does not appear to be in dispute that, for a petition to the nobile officium to have been available to the applicants, the High Court's section 4(2) order would have needed to have become final on 17 February 2005. However, the very essence of the dispute between the parties is precisely whether the High Court's section 4(2) order became final or whether the applicant's fax of 15\u00a0February 2005 was a valid application for recall or variation which prevented the order from becoming final (see paragraphs 11 and 32 above). As it was, the applicants were informed that no hearing would be held before 18 February 2005 but were never told whether the order had become final or whether they had made a valid application for its recall or variation. Even assuming, therefore, that the Government are correct and the order became final on 17 February 2005, the Court considers that the applicants were entitled to conclude that, by their fax of 15 February 2005, they had made a valid application for recall or variation of the section 4(2) order and that the High Court of Justiciary remained seized of that application until the conclusion of the appeal. Thus, they were entitled to conclude that a petition to the nobile officium was not available to them at that stage. Accordingly, even assuming that such a petition could in other circumstances be regarded as an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention, the Court finds that it was not such a remedy in the circumstances of the present case.",
