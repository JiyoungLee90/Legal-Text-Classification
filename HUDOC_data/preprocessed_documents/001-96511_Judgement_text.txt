On 22 September 1995 the prosecution approved the bill of indictment. The case was transferred to the court.

On 29 January 1997 a new set of criminal proceedings was opened. The applicant was accused of selling or hiding property that could have been used for the repayment of his loans (Article 316 § 1 of the Criminal Code).

On 28 October 2002 the Kėdainiai District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for a supplementary audit examination to be executed and for certain supplementary documents to be obtained.

On 11 May 2006 the Court of Appeal quashed the above decision and remitted the case for a fresh examination.
On 25 January 2006 the applicant, invoking, inter alia, Articles 6.246 and 6.272 of the Civil Code, lodged a complaint with the Vilnius Regional Court claiming redress in the total amount of LTL 6,015,423.17 for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, which he alleged to have sustained “due to the unlawful actions of the court when that court had been adjudicating the civil case”. In particular, the applicant noted that since 1990 he had been the owner of a personal venture “Nida”. From 1993 to 1996 the authorities brought a number of criminal charges against him. Moreover, a number of civil claims had been lodged against that company. On 30 March 1998 the Turto bankas took over the creditor’s claim. The applicant observed that, by a decision of 13 September 2005, the Panevėžys Regional Court granted the Turto bankas’ claim in the sum of LTL 3 015 423.17. In the applicant’s view, that decision had been unfounded. The applicant further noted that:
“from 1993 to 2003 I had been defending my rights in courts against unlawful claims of [the creditors]. Moreover, for 10 years corrupt law enforcement officials unlawfully continued to criminally prosecute me and attempted to break me down psychologically and morally. ... However, after 10 years, justice had been done and by the judgment of 14 October 2003 I had been acquitted in the criminal case and the unlawful civil claims had been left unexamined. ... Nonetheless, by a decision of 13 September 2005, the judge of the Panevėžys Regional Court openly mocked the above judgment, which had already entered into force, as well as my ten-year struggle to achieve justice in the Lithuanian courts, and by unlawfully granting the [Turto bankas’] creditor’s claim in the sum of LTL 3 015 423.17 performed an act of Judas ...”
The applicant concluded that, in addition to pecuniary damage, the Panevėžys Regional Court’s decision of 13 September 2005 had caused him non-pecuniary damage, given that that decision had humiliated him and caused him psychological suffering. As compensation for non-pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed LTL 3 000 000 from the State of Lithuania.
On 26 January 2006 the  accepted his lawsuit for examination.
By a decision of 21 June 2006, the  suspended the civil proceedings until the creditors’ claims were resolved in the civil case against the personal venture of the applicant. The court noted, inter alia, that:
“The plaintiff Donatas Šulcas submitted a lawsuit, the object (ieškinio dalykas) of which is the damage caused by the Panevėžys Regional Court’s [allegedly] unlawful decision [of 13 September 2005] by which that court granted the Turto bankas’ creditor’s claim in Donatas Šulcas’ personal venture’s “Nida” case. ...”.
By a decision of 30 June 2006, the  granted the Turto bankas’ creditor’s claim in the amount of LTL 97,536.60.
The Court has no information as to the outcome of the civil proceedings for damage.
Article 135 § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a lawsuit must contain a plaintiff’s claim (the subject matter of the lawsuit (ieškinio dalykas)). Pursuant to Article 138, if a lawsuit does not meet the requirements of Article 135, a judge may order the plaintiff to rectify it.
Article 6.272 § 1 of the Civil Code allows a civil claim for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage arising from the unlawful actions of investigating authorities or courts in the context of a criminal case. The provision envisages compensation for an unlawful conviction, an unlawful arrest or detention, the application of unlawful procedural measures of enforcement, or an unlawful administrative penalty. According to recent domestic case-law, this provision may also allow claims for damages arising from the excessive length of criminal proceedings. In particular, by a judgment of 6 February 2007 the Supreme Court awarded an individual damages under this provision on account of the excessive length of criminal proceedings which had been instituted in 1998 and discontinued in 2004 (see Norkūnas v. , no. 302/05, § 26, 20 January 2009). Other relevant domestic law concerning domestic remedies for the excessive length of civil proceedings is reproduced in the judgment of Četvertakas and Others v.  (no. 16013/02, § 22, 20 January 2009).
