The boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In particular, in both instances regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the competing interests; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation Odi\u00e8vre v.

The Court has repeatedly found that in cases concerning a person\u2019s relationship with his or her child there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter. This duty is decisive in assessing whether a case concerning access to children had been heard within a reasonable time as required by Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention and also forms part of the procedural requirements implicit in Article\u00a08 (see Kaplan v.

It is true that the case was of some complexity and the applications filed by the applicants during the proceedings may have contributed to their length, but this is not sufficient to explain the total length. On the other hand, before the District Court, notwithstanding the applicants\u2019 repeated requests for the acceleration of the proceedings, the proceedings progressed particularly slowly and, on two occasions, namely between March 2002 and December 2002 (see paragraphs\u00a012-13 above) and between February 2003 and April 2004 (see paragraphs\u00a015-18 above), they came to a standstill, for which no satisfactory explanation has been furnished by the Government.",

At the beginning of the proceedings the Vienna Youth Welfare Office recommended that because of the long-lasting relationship between F. and the applicants a right to access should be granted, and the District Court, in its decision of 9 November 2004, indicated that if the decision had been taken earlier there would have been good reasons to grant the request. Eventually, the District Court, basing itself on reports by the Youth Office of the M\u00f6dling District Administrative Authority and the Nieder\u00f6sterreich Child and Youth Psychological Consulting Office drawn up in 2004, dismissed the applicants\u2019 request. From its decision it is apparent that the passing of time was crucial for the District Court. It noted that F. had not had contact with his former foster parents for more than three years, that meanwhile he had re-established a positive relationship with his biological mother and that it was not in his interests to put him in a situation of divided loyalties between her and his \u201cformer family\u201d, namely the applicants.",
