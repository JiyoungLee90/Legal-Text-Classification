The mother was to assume responsibility for transporting their daughter to these meetings and for bearing the transportation costs. The court considered that the visits should be supervised owing to the fact that the applicant and the child had not met regularly for two years. One of the factors that contributed to this conclusion was that the applicant had allegedly tried to abduct the child. Further, as to the view of the Social Welfare Board that access should be granted twice a month for three hours at a time, the court found that three hours was too short a period in order to develop a trusting relationship between the applicant and his daughter and accordingly, it ordered that the visits should last six hours at a time.
