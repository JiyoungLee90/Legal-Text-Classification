This is an important border crossing point, where migrants may be arrested and detained, both those who are trying to enter Turkey, and those who are in transit. The fact that Turkish authorities claim that the \u201cproblematic passenger room\u201d is under the authority of a private company, and not within the jurisdiction of Turkish authorities, is of great concern to the Special Rapporteur: this \u201cproblematic passenger room\u201d, despite its name, is a place of detention, as the persons held there are not free to leave. Moreover, the transit zone is Turkish territory for which Turkish authorities are responsible. The difficulties the Special Rapporteur had getting access to the \u201cproblematic passenger room\u201d, with the Government claiming that they did not have jurisdiction, reflects what the Special Rapporteur heard from lawyers, civil society and international organizations concerning their limited access to this place. The Special Rapporteur is further alarmed at reports of persons being detained there for lengthy periods of time. He is troubled that the Turkish authorities do not appear to be monitoring effectively how migrants are treated in the transit zone, and encourages them to do so systematically.\u201d",

Subsequently, on 17 April and 2 July 2012, the Court sent two letters to Mr\u00a0Y\u0131lmaz asking him to submit an authority form regarding the second applicant and explicitly warning him that failure to do so could lead the Court to declare the application inadmissible (see paragraph 36 above).

They maintained in this connection that under Article 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the police custody period in such circumstances was twenty-four hours and that the applicant\u2019s detention had exceeded the period prescribed by law. The Government considered that as a person who had not been brought before a judge at the end of the legal custody period, the applicant was eligible for compensation pursuant to Article 141 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 5271). They further argued, in relation to the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, that had she not been informed of the reasons for her detention, the applicant could have requested compensation under Article 141 \u00a7 1 (g) of Law no. 5271.

In this connection, the Court first observes that on 9 November 2010 the police took the applicant to the \u201cproblematic passenger room\u201d, which is described as a detention facility where foreign nationals are held at Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). The Court further notes that although the police reports drafted at 4 p.m. on the same day refer to the \u201capprehension\u201d of the applicant, according to those reports, public prosecutors had not ordered her detention in police custody (see paragraphs\u00a011 and 12 above). Indeed, when the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged a criminal complaint against two officers alleging that they had deprived the applicant of her liberty unlawfully and abused their power, the officers in question maintained before the public prosecutor that the applicant had been kept in detention pending her transfer to the Kumkap\u0131 Foreigners\u2019 Removal Centre (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). Hence, the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor considered that the applicant had been subject to a criminal investigation but held within the context of immigration controls in a foreigners\u2019 detention centre, and he therefore declined to bring criminal proceedings against the police officers (see paragraph 25 above). Lastly, in the decision dated 16\u00a0February 2011, the Istanbul security directorate noted that the applicant had not been in police custody but had been held in the foreigners\u2019 detention centre at the airport (see paragraph 28 above). The Court also observes that the judgment of the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Assize Court in the case brought by A.C.U., submitted by the applicant, appears to point in the same direction (see paragraph 54 above).",

In this regard, the Court attaches weight to the decisions of the Bakirk\u00f6y public prosector and the Istanbul security directorate concluding that the applicant was held by the police in the context of immigration controls and not in police custody. The Court also stresses that the Government have failed to provide any examples in which Article 141 (b) or (g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been applied successfully in situations similar to the applicant\u2019s. On the contrary, the applicant himself submitted a judgment of the Bakirk\u00f6y Assize Court in the case brought by A.C.U. which appears to point in the opposite direction (see paragraph 54 above). The Court considers that, in the circumstances, the applicant cannot be blamed for not having sought compensation under Article 141 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
