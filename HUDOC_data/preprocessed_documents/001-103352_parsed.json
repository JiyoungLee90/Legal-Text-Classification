No copies of original records specifying the allocation of inmates to the cells were submitted.

The Court observes that they did not specify the design capacity of the cells and a number of available beds. Nevertheless, referring to the certificate by the prison governor and the prison officers' statements, the Government claimed that the applicant had been provided with an individual sleeping place. The Court finds that the officers' statements appear to be based on their personal recollections and do not reflect objective data. As to the certificate, it is not supported by the original records. In these circumstances, the Court finds no justified reason to attach greater weight to these documents compared to the statements of the applicant. Besides, the Court takes cognisance of the findings made in February 2005 by the Prosecution Office of the Altay Region that the shortage of individual sleeping places in the facility in question was a known problem and that the applicant did not have an individual bed (see paragraph 11 above). The Court also notes that the respondent Government refrained from any comments on this document.",
