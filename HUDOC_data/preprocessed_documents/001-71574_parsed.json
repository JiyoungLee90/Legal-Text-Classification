However, the Court reiterates that it is not open to a State authority to cite the lack of funds or other resources, such as housing, as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt (see Malinovskiy v. Russia, no. 41302/02, \u00a7 35, 16\u00a0June 2005; Plotnikovy v. Russia, no. 43883/02, \u00a7 23, 24 February 2005). Admittedly, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances, but the delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01. The applicant should not be prevented from benefiting from the success of the litigation on the ground of alleged financial difficulties experienced by the State (see Burdov v. , no. 59498/00, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2002III). In the present case, the judgment has remained without enforcement to date, that is for more than three years since it was issued. The Government did not offer a plausible justification for that omission. There is no evidence that the Kirovskiy District Administration has taken any measures to comply with the judgment.",

In particular, the flat was not appropriate for accommodating five persons, as required by the judgment. The Court does not accept the Government\u2019s argument that after the death of the applicant\u2019s mother a flat for four persons would have been sufficient. It clearly follows from the operative part of the judgment of 19\u00a0December 2001 that the Kirovskiy District Administration was to allocate a flat for five persons. The new determination of the current number of the applicant\u2019s family members would amount to re-examination by a State agency of the matter already settled by a final and binding court judgment. In any event, the applicant\u2019s mother died more than a year and seven months after the judgment of 19\u00a0December 2001 had become final.",
