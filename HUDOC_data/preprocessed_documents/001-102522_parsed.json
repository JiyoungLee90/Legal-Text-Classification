As to the conduct of the applicant, the Court sees no substantial delays for which he could be held responsible. On the other hand, the Court is of the view that the proceedings were delayed mainly because of the repeated reconsiderations of the case by the courts (see paragraph 8 above). It concludes, therefore, that the main responsibility for the protracted length of the proceedings rested with the domestic authorities.",
