The applicant was unfit to work for over nine days.

For all the above considerations, the Court concludes that the ill-treatment combined with the applicant\u2019s feelings of fear and helplessness was sufficiently serious to reach the level of severity under Article 3 of the Convention, and thus gives rise to the Government\u2019s positive obligation under this provision (ibid., \u00a7 70).",

The offence of inflicting bodily harm under Article 89 of the CC is investigated by a prosecutor only after a complaint by the injured party, whereas for the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under Article 88 of the CC the prosecutor\u2019s office retains the right to open a criminal investigation of its own motion. Furthermore, the Court notes that other offences attributed by the applicant to S.N., such as malicious use of telephone calls, threat, self-administered justice and so on are also defined as specific offences under the Criminal Code. The Court is thus satisfied that Albanian law provided a sufficient regulatory framework to criminally pursue the crimes attributed by the applicant to S.N.",

Thus, and in as much as it concerns the circumstances of the instant case, it is not for the Court to speculate whether the prosecutor should have pursued the criminal investigations under other articles of the Criminal Code as suggested by the applicant (see paragraphs 31 and 77 above, and Valiulien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 85). Be that as it may, the fact remains that the circumstances of the present case were never established by a competent court of law. In this connection the Court notes that one of the purposes of imposing criminal sanctions is to restrain and deter the offender from causing further harm. Further, the Court has held that in cases concerning torture or ill-treatment, amnesties and pardons should not be tolerated (see Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos.\u00a010865/09 and 2 others, \u00a7 326, ECHR 2014 (extracts). In that sense the Court concludes that although the legal framework in place may have had a sufficiently deterrent effect, the latter was erased by the subsequent amnesty law.",

The Court notes that the prosecutor took immediate steps to bring S.N. to justice. However, given the lack of evidence he decided not to bring the case to trial. Following persistent appeals by the applicant, the domestic courts annulled the prosecutor\u2019s decision for lack of thoroughness (see paragraphs 51-55 above).

It is not merely the General Amnesty Act that should be criticised, but also, and more importantly, the characterisation of the criminal acts by the prosecutor in such a way that they would fit within the scope of that Act. The case is a clear example of how the deterrent effect of the criminal-law framework has been completely destroyed.",
