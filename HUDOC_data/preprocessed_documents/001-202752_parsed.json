The Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court took into account, in particular, that M.R., V.R., the victim\u2019s lawyer and two bank employees had consistently testified that the purchase price of the company had been raised from EUR\u00a05.2\u00a0million to EUR\u00a05.4 million on the understanding that after the completion of the sale there would be EUR\u00a0210,000 in the company\u2019s bank account. That had been confirmed by several documents in the case file. Thus, the appellate court dismissed the applicant\u2019s assertions that the price had always been set at EUR\u00a05.4\u00a0million and that it had been she who had covered the company\u2019s loan to the bank. The appellate court also noted that both during the confrontation in the pre-trial proceedings and during the appeal hearing the applicant had acknowledged that she had failed to inform M.R. of the money transfer from the victim company\u2019s account to her private account. With respect to mens rea, the appellate court inferred an intent on the part of the applicant to misappropriate the funds from certain aspects of her conduct (such as filing the request to transfer the money from the victim company\u2019s account to her private account at such a moment that ensured it would be effected when she no longer represented the company; requesting the transfer in contravention of the conditions of the loan agreement between the bank and the victim company; and failing to inform either M.R. or the auditor of the request). Finally, the applicant was found guilty of money laundering on the basis of the fact that she had used the misappropriated funds to purchase the Deutsche Bank cheque, which she later used to purchase a property in France.",

Mr Markus challenged the Criminal Law provision that imposed that punishment for the crime of bribery. While the Constitutional Court found that there were \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d in the legal regulation for imposing and enforcing the punishment, as well as divergences in its application, it considered that those issues could not be resolved by reviewing the specific provision of the Specific Part of the Criminal Law in isolation. Instead, the confiscation punishment had to be assessed by analysing the provisions of the General Part of the Criminal Law. Since the applicant had not challenged the pertinent legal provisions, the Constitutional Court by its decision of 6\u00a0January 2011 discontinued the proceedings (for more details on the Constitutional Court\u2019s reasoning see Markus v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01523).

Furthermore, it is not sufficient for defendants to complain that they have not been allowed to question certain witnesses; they must, in addition, support the request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Murtazaliyeva, cited above, \u00a7 140). It has to be shown that the testimony can reasonably be expected to strengthen the position of the defence. The stronger and weightier the arguments advanced by the defence, the closer must be the scrutiny and the more convincing must be the reasoning of the domestic courts if they refuse the defence\u2019s request to examine a witness (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 166). Finally, the Court has to determine whether the domestic court\u2019s decision not to examine a witness undermined the overall fairness of the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 141 and 158).",

In particular, there is no indication that the defence requested M.R. to be summoned to the appeal hearing prior to its closing arguments or that at any stage of the proceedings they requested the allegedly contradictory pre-trial statements to be read out.

In particular, the pretrial statement the applicant\u2019s lawyer referred to in his request was not at odds with the testimony that M.R. had given before the first-instance court (compare paragraphs 16 and 21 above). The fact that the applicant had informed M.R. that she was taking the loan out on behalf of the victim company was not contested in the criminal proceedings. Instead, it was her failure, inter alia, to inform M.R. of the subsequent transfer of that money to her private account that led to her conviction (see paragraph 23 above). Accordingly, in view of the limited arguments advanced by the defence, the Court considers that the reasons given by the appellate court when refusing to summon M.R. were sufficient in the circumstances of the case (see Murtazaliyeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 160-66, and \u00a7\u00a7 169-74; see also, a contrario, Vidal v.

Having reassessed the evidence, the appellate court concluded that an intent on the part of the applicant could be inferred from her actions (see paragraph 23 above).

Having pointed to the deficiencies in the domestic regulation identified by the Constitutional Court in the Markus case (see paragraph 32 above) and a research report cited in its judgment, the applicant noted that the compulsory punishment of property confiscation had prevented the application of the principle of individualisation of the penalty. Where the strict conditions for applying a lesser sanction than the one provided for in law were not met, the courts were deprived of the possibility of assessing the particular situation and deciding whether the property confiscation had a legitimate aim and was proportionate.

In view of the applicant\u2019s claim that it was the lack of quality of the law that had led to the breach of her right of property, the Court finds that her grievance did not only concern the interpretation and application of the legal provisions, the content of which she had regarded as constitutional. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the \u201cquality of law\u201d did fall within the competence of the Constitutional Court.",

While the Constitutional Court terminated those proceedings owing to the manner in which the complaint had been formulated, it indicated that the constitutionality of the confiscation punishment ought to be assessed by analysing the provisions of the General Part of the Criminal Law. The Court considers that that decision, which was taken four months before the completion of the applicant\u2019s case, sufficiently indicated what kind of constitutional complaint ought to be brought in order to protect the right of property with respect to the punishment of property confiscation. The Court also notes that exactly that kind of challenge was brought before the Constitutional Court in case no. 2014-43-01 in which a judgment on the merits was delivered on 8 April 2015. The fact that the Constitutional Court found no violation in that case has no bearing on the effectiveness of that domestic remedy with respect to the applicant\u2019s case as, by that time, the domestic regulation had already been significantly altered (see paragraphs 27 and 32-33 above).",

A mere possibility that the domestic law could have been interpreted in compliance with the Convention does not absolve the applicant from the obligation to bring the proceedings before the Constitutional Court. Furthermore, had the applicant brought a constitutional complaint and had she been successful, she could have requested the criminal proceedings against her to be reopened and a new ruling to be made. In the renewed examination of the case the domestic courts would have been bound by the findings of the Constitutional Court (see Larionovs and Tess v. Latvia (dec.), nos. 45520/04 and 19363/05, \u00a7\u00a0166, 25\u00a0November 2014).
