It held that the applicant and his former wife had been living in separate houses when the flat in question was bought. Moreover, the applicant was unemployed and unable to provide even a basic level of financial support for his wife. It was concluded that, given his financial situation, the applicant could not have contributed enough to the purchase of the flat in question to be entitled to claim a share in it. The court further noted that, at the time of purchase, the legal matrimonial regime was the system of separation of property and the title deed of the flat was registered in the wife\u2019s name.",

The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\u00a0The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).",

Subsequently, the Izmir Family Court, to which the case file was sent, decided after thirteen months that it also lacked jurisdiction to examine the case. As a result, the first decision on the merits of the case was only rendered after five and a half years. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the absence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer at certain hearings cannot justify the prolongation of the proceedings. Although there were no substantial delays on appeal, the Court takes the view that five years and six months before one instance is too long. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the total length of the proceedings (in particular the period before the first-instance court) was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",
