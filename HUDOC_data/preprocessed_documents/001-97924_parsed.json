On 13 February 2009 an investigating judge from the Gostivar Court of First Instance (\u201cthe trial court\u201d) questioned the applicant, who was assisted by counsel. An investigation was opened on the grounds of reasonable suspicion of extortion of money from a minor. The investigating judge refused a request by the public prosecutor for the applicant to be detained in prison, but ordered, instead, thirty days' house arrest (\u043a\u0443\u045c\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440). That measure required the applicant to remain at home and to refrain from using any means of communication for the duration of the order. His passport was also seized and the police were ordered to check his presence in the house twice a day. The judge considered that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting the applicant of having committed the offence, but that in the light of his clean record and family circumstances, a non-custodial measure, such as house arrest, was preferable. The applicant's house arrest was ordered on all the grounds specified in section 199 of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraph 14 below). This decision was served on the applicant and his lawyer at 5 p.m.",

It further quashed the order for the confiscation of the applicant's passport. The panel found that there was a danger that the applicant would interfere with the investigation, in particular by putting pressure on witnesses who had not been heard yet and on the victim, who, being a minor, was vulnerable.

In such circumstances, the Court considers that the panel's decision of 14 February 2009 is to be regarded as a fresh detention order, different from the initial house arrest, which required the applicant to be given an opportunity to present his arguments orally before the panel (see, mutatis mutandis, Mancini v. Italy, no. 44955/98, \u00a7\u00a7 19 and 20, ECHR 2001IX).
