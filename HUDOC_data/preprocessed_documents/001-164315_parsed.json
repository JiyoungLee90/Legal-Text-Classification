Since the right to freedom of expression is, like the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the Vrtar case, guaranteed by the Croatian Constitution (see paragraph 16 above), and decisions imposing a fine for insulting the court constitute an interference with that right (see paragraphs 40 and 52 below), the Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion regarding the applicant\u2019s alleged non-compliance with the six-month rule in the present case.\u00a0It follows that the Government\u2019s objection to that effect must be dismissed.",

Consequently, the applicant\u2019s appeal against the suspension decision could only have been successful if he had managed to prove that one of the two conditions for suspension had not been fulfilled.

In the Government\u2019s opinion, by claiming that the judge had been stalling the proceedings by conducting them in an unprofessional and meaningless way, the applicant had called into question the judge\u2019s competence and professionalism, and had discredited him not only in the eyes of the other party, but also in the eyes of the public (the civil proceedings in question were public). Second, the applicant had accused the judge of \u201cgiving the impression\u201d that the proceedings were being conducted in a meaningful manner (see paragraph 10 above) although, according to him, that had not been the case.

That special role of lawyers, as independent professionals, in the administration of justice entails a number of duties, particularly with regard to their conduct. Whilst they are subject to restrictions on their professional conduct, which must be discreet, honest and dignified, they also enjoy exclusive rights and privileges that may vary from one jurisdiction to another \u2013 among them, usually, a certain latitude regarding arguments used in court (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0133).",

Nevertheless, their criticism must not overstep certain bounds. In particular, a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult. If the sole intent of any form of expression is to insult a court, or members of that court, an appropriate sanction would not, in principle, constitute a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (see Ska\u0142ka, loc. cit).",

Moreover, the remarks were conveyed in an appeal, a remedy against a suspension decision which went against the interests of his client by delaying the proceedings for three months (see section 217(2) of the Civil Procedure Act as cited in paragraph 18 above). In other words, they were made in a forum where his client\u2019s rights were naturally to be vigorously defended (see, mutatis mutandis, Ayhan Erdo\u011fan v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 39656/03, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 29, 13\u00a0January 2009). Hence, the remarks were confined to the courtroom, as opposed to criticism of a judge voiced in, for instance, the media (see Nikula, cited above, \u00a7 52; Steur, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041; and Ayhan Erdo\u011fan, cited above, \u00a7 29). Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument (see paragraphs 44-45 and 47 above), it was not an open and overall attack on the authority of the judiciary, but rather internal communication between the applicant as an advocate and the appellate court, of which the general public were not aware (see, mutatis mutandis, Rodriguez Ravelo v. Spain, no. 48074/10, \u00a7 48, 12 January 2016; Ska\u0142ka, cited above, \u00a7 40, and section 150 of the Civil Procedure Act as cited in paragraph 18 above). The Court considers that the domestic courts, in their examination of the case, failed to set the applicant\u2019s remarks within the context and form in which they were expressed (see, mutatis mutandis, Ayhan Erdo\u011fan, cited above, \u00a7 29).",
