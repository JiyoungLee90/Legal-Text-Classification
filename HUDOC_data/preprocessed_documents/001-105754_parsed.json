She also argued that the election of the  judges was a political rather than a legal issue. Therefore, Parliament\u2019s decision of 9\u00a0May 2008 constituted a so-called act of State (akt vladanja) in respect of which the scope of constitutional review was limited to compliance with procedural rules (that is, to formal constitutionality) and was thus very narrow.

She argued that because the election of the  judges was regulated by law, it was not a political but primarily a legal issue. Consequently, Parliament\u2019s decision of 9\u00a0May 2008 was not an \u201cact of State\u201d and was therefore justiciable, that is, capable of being challenged in legal proceedings.

As regards S.B.\u2019s request for an interim measure, the applicant, after having remarked that the Constitutional Court had granted it on the same day the request had been made, argued that under section 67(2) the Constitutional Court Act such a measure could not postpone \u201cthe effects of a contested decision\u201d but only its \u201cenforcement\u201d (see paragraph 25 below).

The main factual issue in the instant case was whether S.B. had the required professional experience to stand as a candidate for, and be elected to, the office of judge of the .

The Court therefore takes it as established that the applicant did not ask for an oral hearing before the . It must therefore be considered that she unequivocally waived her right to a hearing (see Schuler-Zgraggen, cited above, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 263; Zumtobel v.\u00a0Austria, 21\u00a0September 1993, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 268A; Fischer, cited above, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 312; D\u00f6ry, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038; Lundevall, cited above, \u00a7 35; and \u0160iki\u0107 v. , no. 9143/08, \u00a7 29, 15 July 2010).",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that in establishing whether the absence of a hearing before a second or third instance court may be justified depends on the special features of the proceedings at issue. Moreover, account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of such courts therein. Where the proceedings before higher courts involve only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, an oral and public hearing is generally not required, provided that such a hearing was held or waived at first instance (see, among many other authorities, Ekbatani v. Sweden, 26\u00a0May 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 31, Series A no. 134; Hermi v.  [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61, ECHR 2006XII, and D\u00f6ry, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040). In applying these principles to Constitutional Courts the Court has held that a hearing was normally not required in proceedings before such courts because, having been limited to an examination of constitutional issues, they had entailed an assessment not of points of fact but of points of law (see, for example, Zippel v. Germany (dec.), no. 30470/96, 23 October 1997; Siegl v. Austria\u00a0(dec.), no. 36075/97, 8 February 2000; Weh and Weh v. Austria (dec.), no. 38544/97, 4 July 2002; Breierova and Others v.

It is true, as already noted above (see paragraph 74) that the  also requested information on S.B.\u2019s professional experience. However, from the reasoning of its decision of 30\u00a0April 2009, in particular from the finding that the Administrative Court had acted ultra vires when it (re)assessed the evidentiary value of the documents S.B. had furnished as proof of her professional experience (see paragraph 20 above), it is clear that the Constitutional Court ultimately did not ascertain or review facts or (re)assess evidence. It follows that the proceedings before it were limited to an examination of the above-mentioned constitutional issue, that is, they entailed an assessment not of points of fact but exclusively of points of law. What is more, in contrast to the Kugler case, where the Court found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the lack of a public hearing before the Constitutional Court because the Administrative Court \u201chad no jurisdiction concerning the lawfulness of the area zoning plan\u201d and the Constitutional Court \u201cwas the only body which could have determined this aspect of the dispute\u201d (see Kugler, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50-53), in the present case both the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court dealt with the same (constitutional) issue.",
