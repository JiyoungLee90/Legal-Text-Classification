However, such a system carries with it the risk of imposing on landlords an excessive burden in terms of their ability to dispose of their property and must accordingly provide certain procedural safeguards so as to ensure that the operation of the system and its impact on a landlord\u2019s property rights are neither arbitrary nor unforeseeable (see, mutatis mutandis, Immobiliare Saffi, cited above, \u00a7 54). The Court must thus ascertain whether, in the instant case, the applicant was afforded sufficient guarantees as to be safeguarded against uncertainty and arbitrariness. ",

Although the order for possession was enforceable and the applicant had made a statutory declaration entitling her to priority in the grant of police assistance, she had no means of expediting the process, which depended almost entirely on the availability of police officers. The relevant authorities do not seem to have taken any action whatsoever in response to the statutory declaration by the applicant on 8 February 1995 that she needed the premises for her own use. ",
