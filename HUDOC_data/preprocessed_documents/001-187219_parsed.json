The court took the view, with reference to Article 6 of the Convention, that the President\u2019s status before the court would entail a breach of the equality of arms principle because, as a civil party, he could not, for the duration of his term of office, be the subject of any sanction for bringing unjustified proceedings or be prosecuted for malicious or rash accusations, or be questioned or confronted with the defendant (ibid., see also, paragraph 31 below).

On the second point, many civil or criminal courts, in particular in press-related matters, have, on many occasions, admitted proceedings brought by the serving President of the Republic, who in that capacity is also chair of the National Legal Service Commission, without at any time considering that he was in any way contravening his constitutional duties.\u201d",

The Advocate-General took the view that the fact that no proceedings could be brought against the President (for malicious, improper or de facto fanciful accusation), or that he could not be summoned to testify, had not created, in the circumstances of the case, any inequality between the parties, while acknowledging that this inability could cause serious difficulties in other proceedings if mainly based on accusations or evidence emanating from the President.

He nevertheless indicated that the fact of declaring inadmissible the President\u2019s application to join the proceedings as a civil party would have the effect of depriving him of his right of access to a court and concluded that it was necessary to opt for a compromise solution in the form of suspending any civil action brought by the President for the defence of his personal interests until the end of his term of office.",

Thus Mr\u00a0Sarkozy was its chairman from 2006 to January 2011. The Minister of Justice was then its vice-chair. The explanatory memorandum in respect of the draft Constitutional Law stated that the reform of the CSM required, in particular, the abolition of its chairmanship by the Head of State: \u201cThe evolution in the role played by the judicial authority in a modern democracy requires that it should cease to be chaired by the President of the Republic\u201d. Also prior to the 2008 reform, the CSM section for judges comprised, in addition to the President of the Republic and the Minister of Justice, five judges and a prosecutor, a conseiller d\u2019\u00c9tat, appointed by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, and three prominent citizens, not being members of parliament or of the ordinary courts, appointed respectively by the President of the Republic, the President of the National Assembly and the President of the Senate. In addition to its power to appoint judges (see paragraphs 22 et seq. below), this section operated as a disciplinary board and was then chaired by the President of the Court of Cassation.",

In a report published on 7 November 2012, the Commission looked for the first time at the President\u2019s position in terms of \u201cintervention\u201d, in other words the possibility for him to intervene as a civil party. It found that it was \u201cnecessary to call into question, in both criminal and civil proceedings, the immunity of the President of the Republic in respect of acts that [had] not been performed in his capacity as Head of State\u201d.

The Court of Cassation, sitting as a plenary court, its most solemn formation, nevertheless took the view that Article\u00a02 of the Criminal Code did not rule out a civil-party intervention by the President and decided that there was no need to refer a priority question of constitutionality to the Constitutional Council as to the compatibility of that provision with the principle of the separation of powers and the safeguards of a fair trial (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). The Court notes that at the time when the Court of Cassation delivered its judgment in the present case, new Article 65 of the Constitution had entered into force (see paragraph 17 above) and the Head of State no longer chaired the CSM. On that date also, the question of the status before the courts of the President of the Republic, who is protected from any judicial action but not prohibited from acting in proceedings in the form of a civil-party intervention, with regard to the principle of equality before the law, was not yet a matter of debate at national level (see paragraph 35 above).",

The Court further points out that it is not a matter of imposing on States a given constitutional model governing, in one way or another, the relations and interaction between the various State powers (Savino and Others v.\u00a0Italy, nos. 17214/05 and\u00a02\u00a0others, \u00a7 92, 28 April 2009). The choice of the French legislature in allowing the President to act in judicial proceedings during his term of office cannot therefore constitute in itself a subject of dispute before the Court. Although the notion of the separation of powers between the political organs of government and the judiciary has assumed growing importance in the Court\u2019s case-law, neither Article 6 nor any other provision of the Convention requires States to comply with any theoretical constitutional concepts regarding the permissible limits of interaction between the powers. The question is always whether, in a given case, the requirements of the Convention have been met (see Henryk Urban and Ryszard Urban, cited above, \u00a7 46, and Haarde, cited above, \u00a7 84).",

In those conditions, the Court sees no reason to consider that the President\u2019s intervention in the proceedings deprived the applicant of equal treatment as to the possibility of exercising the above-mentioned actions.

The Court finds that the same applies to the other criminal actions mentioned by the applicant, namely proceedings for malicious or fanciful accusations, that he clearly had no interest in bringing, as the President had only taken the initiative of complaining to his bank about fraudulent debits from his bank account, acts for which the public prosecutor considered that a judicial investigation should be opened.",

In addition, the collegial exercise of the CSM\u2019s power of \u201cproposal\u201d and \u201cbinding approval\u201d constitutes, in the Court\u2019s opinion, an essential safeguard against the risk of pressure on judges by the executive. This is, moreover, the position of the Venice Commission, which highlights the crucial role of judicial councils or commissions \u2013 as independent bodies \u2013 in the process of judicial appointment (see paragraphs 38 and 40 above), this being essential to the balance of a democratic society.",

Thus, at the relevant time, Mr Sarkozy was both Chairman of the CSM and civil party in the case. The President\u2019s intervention in the proceedings thus gave the applicant cause for concern about his influence on the future career of the judges to whose appointment he had contributed and who were dealing with a claim about his private interests. The Court takes the view, however, that such an impression does not suffice for a lack of independence to be established.",

The Court observes in this connection that the case before the judges did not bear any relation to the political duties of Mr Sarkozy, who had neither brought the prosecution nor provided any evidence to establish the applicant\u2019s guilt. In addition, the Court notes that it was on 15\u00a0June 2012 that the Court of Cassation delivered its judgment, in which it examined the applicant\u2019s complaints about the equality of arms and about the independence and impartiality of the tribunal, at a date when Mr\u00a0Sarkozy no longer chaired the CSM. The Court points out that, after the judgment of the Versailles Court of Appeal of 8 January 2010, the reform of the French Constitution (brought about by the Law of 23 July 2008) came into force. The chairmanship of the CSM was thereby transferred from the President of the Republic to the President of the Court of Cassation, in order to secure the independence of the judicial system.",

However, in the present case, having regard to the foregoing and taking account of the subject-matter of the dispute, the Court does not see any reason to find that the judges called upon to adjudicate on the applicant\u2019s case were not independent within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
