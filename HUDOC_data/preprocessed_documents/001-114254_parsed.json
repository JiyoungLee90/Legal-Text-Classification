He noted that the Government had not denied that on occasion he had been returned from the court-house to the remand prison after 10 p.m. He further noted that when there were hearings every working day, in April-May 2005, he had not in fact had an opportunity to catch up on his sleep the following day as the Government had suggested (see paragraphs 34-35 above). The applicant also drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that the pronouncement of the judgment had taken place at night. Regarding the issue of provision of food on the days he was transferred to the court-house, the applicant submitted that he had never been given any dry rations, and argued that the convoy area of Dzerzhinskiy District Court had not been equipped with any facilities for heating or eating food. He claimed that the two invoices of 11 and 20 May 2005 provided by the Government (see paragraph 36 above) had not been sufficient evidence to prove that he had been provided with food for two years on the days he was transferred to the court-house. He further challenged the validity of those documents and noted that while on 20\u00a0May 2005 the relevant invoice concerned the provision of dry rations to only one person, in reality on that day the applicant had not been the only person being transferred to the court-house.

The Court notes, however, that the applicant was on quite a few occasions taken to the court-house several days in a row, especially at the later stages of the trial, in the period between April and June 2005, which, when he was returned to the remand prison after 10\u00a0p.m., made any extra sleep the following day impossible (see paragraph 34 above). The Court is particularly mindful of the fact that the pronouncement of the judgment which started on 7\u00a0June at 8.30 p.m. lasted until 00.30 a.m. on 8 June 2005, and that the applicant had had to remain standing up (see paragraph 30 above).",

The most recent detention order that the Court may examine was issued on 26\u00a0October 2004.

The civil action for damages pursued by the applicant in 2005-06 for his unlawful detention between 30\u00a0May and 14\u00a0June 2004 had no bearing on the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01, as that court was not capable of ordering the applicant\u2019s release, and therefore the Court will not take that action into consideration for the calculation of the six-month time-limit (see Moskovets v. , no. 14370/03, \u00a7\u00a051, 23\u00a0April 2009, with further references). The Court therefore considers that in so far as the applicant\u2019s complaint concerns the detention orders issued before 26\u00a0October 2004 it has been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see, as a recent authority, Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR 2010). It is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law, and in particular, rules of a procedural nature, and the Court will not substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness. However, since under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention failure to comply with domestic law may entail a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see Toshev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 56308/00, \u00a7 58, 10 August 2006, and Shteyn (Stein) v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23691/06, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 94, 18 June 2009).",

Although the domestic court advanced certain reasoning for maintaining the custodial measure when it examined the applicant\u2019s application for release, it nevertheless failed to specify the period until which the custodial measure had been applied. It follows that until 30\u00a0November 2004, when Dzerzhinskiy District Court issued its subsequent detention order, the applicant remained in a state of uncertainty as to the time that he would have to spend in detention pursuant to the court order of 26\u00a0October 2004. The Court therefore considers that the decision of 26\u00a0October 2004 did not comply with the requirements of clarity, foreseeability and protection from arbitrariness, and therefore the applicant\u2019s detention pursuant to that decision was not \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

There had been no proof that during his absence the investigation authority had ever tried to summon him either at work or at home or inquire about his whereabouts. The applicant argued that he had not known about the institution of the criminal proceedings against him, or that he was being searched for, until 29\u00a0September 2003, following which he immediately made an appointment with the investigation department of the Volgograd Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office, where he had been arrested. Therefore, the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant \u201chad been hiding\u201d from the investigation was groundless. The applicant further argued that the reasoning advanced by the domestic court when applying to him the custodial measure had not been supported by any objective fact. Relying on Article 99 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he deplored the fact that none of the detention orders mentioned the circumstances pertinent to the assessment of his personality, family situation, health, occupation, and so on. In particular, the applicant was a widower with two minor dependent children and an elderly mother suffering from cancer. He had been a pilot who had received a Pilot Safety Award and Air Transport High Achiever Award, had excellent references, a scientific degree of Candidate of Technical Sciences in Air Transport Operation, was a Doctor of Philosophy and a Corresponding Member of the International Academy of Man in Aerospace Systems. He had no previous criminal record and was suffering from several medical conditions. The applicant also deplored the fact that the detention orders extending his detention pending trial had been taken simultaneously in respect of several individuals, namely the applicant and his three co-defendants, without a case-by-case assessment of their individual circumstances. Furthermore, the applicant noted that on 25\u00a0February 2005 his detention had been extended despite the fact that the prosecutor no longer deemed it necessary by then. The applicant further claimed that there had been no risk that he would exert pressure on victims and witnesses at the trial stage, as none of them had given statements to his disadvantage.",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a028, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per level of jurisdiction may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",
