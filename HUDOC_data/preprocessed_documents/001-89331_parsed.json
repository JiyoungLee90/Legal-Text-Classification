After the commencement of the trial the hearings had been scheduled at regular intervals, although many of them had been adjourned due to consistent failures by the defendants\u2019 counsel, including the applicant\u2019s lawyer, to attend hearings, and due to their repeated requests for adjournments on various grounds. After the pronouncement of the first-instance judgment the applicant had procrastinated in studying the trial record and submitting an additional statement of appeal.

The opening of letters by prison authorities can therefore hinder applicants in bringing their cases to the Court (see Klyakhin v. , no.\u00a046082/99, \u00a7\u00a7 118 and\u00a0119, 30\u00a0November 2004).",

The Court is not convinced by that argument. Given that the sender\u2019s and the addressee\u2019s names were indicated on the envelope, it was possible to register the letters without opening them. In such circumstances the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s fear that the letters were opened by the detention facility administration with the intention of reading them was objectively justified.",
