Although the purpose of such treatment is a factor to be taken into account, in particular the question of whether it was intended to humiliate or debase the victim, the absence of any such purpose does not inevitably lead to a finding that there has been no violation of Article 3 (see Peers v. , no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2001-III).",

On examination by an outside oculist on 15\u00a0March 2000, the applicant was diagnosed with \u201cmedium-degree myopia, retinal angiopathy and secondary glaucoma (essential hypertension)\u201d. This diagnosis was broadly confirmed by the head of the medical unit of IZ-26/1 on 16\u00a0March 2000, when the applicant was still being held in that facility, and after the applicant's transfer to a penitentiary facility and his release, in medical examinations of 8 June, 10 August, 18 and 22\u00a0September and 9\u00a0October 2001, 8 September 2003, 27 July and 9 and 24 December 2004 and 28 July, 10 and 28\u00a0November and 26 December 2006, all of which either diagnosed glaucoma or mentioned that it was suspected. The Court further notes, and it seems undisputed between the parties, that on several occasions during his detention in IZ-26/1 the applicant requested the prison authorities to arrange for surgery to his eyes. Since the prison authorities declined the request the question arises as to whether the refusal could be regarded as illtreatment falling within the ambit of Article 3.",

The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. On the facts, the Court notes that surgical intervention on the applicant's eyes was one of the recommended treatments (see, for example, paragraph 63 above). However, nothing in the case file suggests that the condition of the applicant's eyes was so painful and serious that it required urgent surgical treatment or that surgery was absolutely indispensable. In fact, none of the applicant's medical reports or certificates ever mentioned the need for either painkillers or any kind of immediate intervention. This conclusion is further corroborated by the conduct of the applicant, who not only refused an offer of inpatient treatment in the surgical department of the prison hospital after 24 September 2001 but also failed to undergo any kind of treatment in this respect even after his release on 6\u00a0September 2002. Thus, from the medical certificates submitted by the applicant and dated 2003, 2004 and 2006 it is clear that his glaucoma diagnosis remained essentially unchanged.",
