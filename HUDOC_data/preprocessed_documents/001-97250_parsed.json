The absence of Islam Dubayev and Roman Bersnukayev or of any news of them for several years supports this assumption.

Such a long postponement, for which no explanation has been provided, was liable per se to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It also appears that within the following months the applicants and some of their neighbours were questioned (see paragraphs 77, 78 and 80). The applicants were granted victim status in February and July 2001 respectively. However, it appears that after that a number of crucial steps, such as identifying and questioning the relevant officials were delayed (see paragraphs 81-83). It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",
