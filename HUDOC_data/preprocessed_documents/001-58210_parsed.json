The non bis in idem principle could not therefore apply in respect of a matter over which the police magistrate had no jurisdiction. The fact that he had nonetheless given a ruling was in all probability due to a misunderstanding between him and the district attorney in that, when the latter had sent the former the case file concerning a possible prosecution of the person injured in the accident, the police magistrate had taken it to be the file concerning the applicant.

It further observes that the offence provided for in section 5 of the Road Traffic Act represents only one aspect of the offence punished under Article\u00a081 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. Nevertheless, both impugned decisions were based on the same conduct.\u201d It is therefore undoubtedly the identity of the actus reus and, in particular, of the conduct that the Court held to be the criterion for identifying the \u201coffence\u201d within the meaning of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. I fully approve the Court\u2019s decision in that case.
