At the time those motions were made, his written motion to be released, lodged at the previous court hearing, was still lying on the judge\u2019s desk. As the judge retired to the deliberation room in order to decide on the two motions of the co-defendants, he expected the judge to examine his motion too. However, as the judge came back and pronounced his decision on the two co-defendants\u2019 motions only, he realised that his motion to be released had not been examined. The judge\u2019s behaviour caused considerable stress to him and his family members, who were present in the court room. As a result, a dispute broke out between him and the judge, which grew into a polemic involving all the co-defendants, their defence lawyers and the court audience. The court room became very noisy and the judge announced that he was going to adjourn the hearing. It was at that moment that he gave in to his emotions and announced that if the judge continued subjecting him and his family to psychological anguish, he would better never examine the motion. Immediately thereafter, the judge adjourned the hearing and left the court room. The judge apparently took his emotional announcement as an explicit request to withdraw the motion as he then decided to leave it without examination. In substantiation of his account of the events, the applicant attached written statements made to that effect by one of the co-accused, A.D. and his mother.",

Lithuania (no. 47679/99, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 67-68, 21 March 2002) and Nakhmanovich v. Russia (no. 55669/00, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 70-71, 2 March 2006). The same happened in his case as Judge A., together with the decision setting his case down for trial, ruled on extension of his detention during trial without specifying its time-limit. As to his motion to be released from detention lodged on 15 December 2004, firstly, Judge A.\u2019s decision to postpone its examination until the next hearing was unsubstantiated. Secondly, at the next court hearing of 27 December 2004 he did not request to withdraw that motion but made an emotional statement during the polemic that broke out in the court room. However, Judge A. took his statement for an explicit request and decided to leave the motion to be released unexamined. Thirdly, he had serious doubts as to the objective impartiality of Judge A. In particular, in the period when his trial was held, the Department of Protection of State Interests of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, headed by prosecutor T. who was one of the prosecutors maintaining his indictment at the trial, was leading a criminal case instituted in relation with the alleged unlawfulness of one of the judgments delivered by Judge\u00a0A. Lastly, the deficiencies of the first instance court were impossible to remedy as no appeal lay against a decision of the first instance court taken in respect of detention during the trial.",

Moreover, once the trial court decides on the accused person\u2019s detention during the trial, it is not obliged to refer to that issue on its own motion thereafter.

That was proved by the fact that Article 213 was included in Chapter 10 of the former CC and was entitled \u201cCrimes against the Regime\u201d. In Soviet Armenia the regime was run exclusively by the State. Consequently, any action against the regime was directed against the State. The only exception to that rule was an action directed against societal organisations which were specially mentioned in Article\u00a0213 of the former CC. Thus, the offence of which he was convicted did not comply with the corpus delicti of Article 213. Consequently, the Court of Cassation\u2019s interpretation of the notion of \u201cofficial document\u201d as contained in Article\u00a0325 of the new CC was inconsistent with the interpretation of that notion under Article 213 of the former CC. Even though Article 213 of the former CC clearly established the scope of its application, the domestic courts often applied it widely and arbitrarily to persons who had falsified official documents of trade organisations.

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Scoppola v.  (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, \u00a7 92, 17\u00a0September 2009; or Huhtam\u00e4ki v. , no. 54468/09, \u00a7 41, 6 March 2012). Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retroactive application of criminal law to the disadvantage of an accused. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to the detriment of an accused, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of \u201claw\u201d Article\u00a07 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, S.W. v. the United Kingdom and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, judgments of 22\u00a0November 1995, Series A no. 335-C, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35 and \u00a7\u00a7 32-33; and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see, among others, S.W., cited above, \u00a7 36; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050; and K.-H.

As was subsequently indicated by the Court of Cassation, any document to which the authorities attached legal significance, irrespective of whether it was issued by public authorities or commercial legal entities, fell within the notion of \u201cofficial document\u201d under Article 325 of the new CC. The Court does not consider that such interpretation of the notion of \u201cofficial document\u201d was inconsistent with the essence of the offence of falsification under Armenian law, or that, by adopting it, the domestic courts extended the notion of the offence to the extent that it manifestly fell out of its scope. It remains, therefore, to be established whether such interpretation of the offence of falsification could reasonably be foreseen by the applicant at the time of committing the offence.",

In view of the similarity of the interpretation and application of the criminal law between the former and the new Criminal Codes, the Court considers that the compliance with that law were adequately foreseeable by the applicant at the time of committing the imputed acts, if not as a matter of common knowledge, then with the assistance of a legal advice (compare Moiseyev v. , no. 62936/00, \u00a7\u00a0241, 9 October 2008). The fact that the applicant was not charged under Article 213 of the former CC when it was still in force cannot, in the Court\u2019s opinion, indicate conclusively that the applicant\u2019s acts did not objectively constitute an offence under that Article at the time when they were committed.",

Hence, there was no retroactive application of criminal law to the applicant\u2019s disadvantage in the present case. In any event, no penalty under Article 325 \u00a7 1 was imposed on the applicant as the criminal proceedings against him were discontinued in that part by the trial court under the statute of limitations (see paragraph 29 above).",
