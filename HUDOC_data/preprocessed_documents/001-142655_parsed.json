Since a number of witnesses (both civilians and police officers) had testified that the applicants had been drunk and violent at the time of their arrest, the national courts gave credence to the testimony of the accused officers and a number of other police officers who had claimed that the applicants had continued to behave violently at the police station and that the use of force against them had therefore been absolutely necessary.

Whatever the method of investigation, the authorities must act as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. Even when strictly speaking no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that ill-treatment has been used. The authorities must take into account the particularly vulnerable situation of victims and the fact that people who have been subjected to serious ill-treatment will often be less ready or willing to make a complaint (see Bat\u0131 and Others v.

The investigation must also be thorough: the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. Furthermore, the investigation must be prompt and independent. The investigation lacks independence where members of the same unit as those implicated in the alleged ill-treatment undertook the investigation (Mikheyev v.

However, it lacked independence since the officers conducting the investigation were subordinated to the same chain of command as those officers under investigation (see O\u011fur v.

The criminal limb of Article 6 is thus not applicable in this case. As to its civil limb, the Court notes that the applicants did not file a civil-party claim in the context of the criminal proceedings. In addition, as under the Serbian law, a criminal conviction is not a formal precondition for obtaining damages in civil proceedings (see paragraph 19 above; contrast Perez v. France [GC], no. 47287/99, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2004-1), the outcome of the criminal proceedings in issue was not decisive for the applicants\u2019 \u201ccivil rights\u201d. The civil limb of Article 6 is thus not applicable either in the present case. This complaint is, accordingly, incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 (a) and 4.",
