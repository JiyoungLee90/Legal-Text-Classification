Although the applicant\u2019s detention may have initially been justified based on these grounds, after a certain lapse of time the courts were obliged to give other express grounds for his continued detention. Instead, they either relied on the gravity of charges against him or did not advance any grounds at all (see paragraphs 8, 11-13 and 16 above).

As far as the domestic authorities are concerned, while certain delays could be attributed to them (two remittals of the case and the failure to secure the presence of witnesses and victims at the hearings), those delays were not such as to warrant the conclusion that there had been a violation, especially given the overall duration of the proceedings (see, for example, Shavrov v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 11098/03, 11\u00a0March 2008).",
