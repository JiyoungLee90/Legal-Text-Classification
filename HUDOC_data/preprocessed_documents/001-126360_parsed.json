Indeed, the release order issued by \u0160tip Prison was based on evidence that the fine had been paid and thus that the applicant had complied with the relevant court order (see paragraph 12 above).

According to the relevant legislation, in case of partial payment of a fine, the remainder which was not paid would be converted into a prison sentence. Subsequent payment of the remainder of the fine which had been converted into a prison sentence entailed termination of the execution of the sentence (see paragraphs 22 and 25 above). The Court sees no reasons, nor was it presented with any arguments, why those rules could not have been relied on in the circumstances of the present case, where the fine had been paid in full before the execution of the converted prison sentence started. On the facts of the case, it is evident from the release order issued by \u0160tip Prison that the applicant was released on the basis of evidence that the fine had been paid (see paragraph 12 above). In such circumstances, in the Court\u2019s view, the basis for the applicant\u2019s detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention ceased to exist as soon as he complied with the payment order, the relevant date being 13 February 2002 (see, mutatis mutandis, with respect to \u201cfulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law\u201d, Osypenko v. , no. 4634/04, \u00a7 57, 9 November 2010, and Lolova-Karadzhova v. , no. 17835/07, \u00a7 29, 27 March 2012).",

In the compensation proceedings, the trial court referred to that failure and concluded that no responsibility could be attached to the State for the applicant\u2019s subsequent arrest and detention. The Court is not convinced by that explanation. In this connection it observes that there was no statutory provision requiring the applicant to notify the court about the payment of the fine. Furthermore, the applicant was arrested and imprisoned on 28 October 2002, namely over eight months after the detention order had been issued and the applicant had paid the fine. During this time, the trial court was unaware that the applicant had complied with the payment order. As the Government admitted in their observations, there was no exchange of information between the trial court and the Ministry of Finance that the fine had been paid. In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s failure to notify the trial court that he had paid the fine cannot release the respondent State from the obligation to have in place an efficient system of recording the payment of court fines. The decision-making process in matters where a person\u2019s liberty is at stake should take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case. The importance of the applicant\u2019s right to liberty required the respondent State to take all necessary measures in order to avoid his liberty being unduly restricted.",

Section 141 of the Obligations Act set out the general principle of compensation of damages. Section 530(1) \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Proceedings Act provided for the right to compensation in the event of unjustified detention through the fault or unlawful conduct of a public body. In the compensation proceedings, which were apparently instituted pursuant to the procedural rules of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraphs 36-39 above), the applicant claimed inter alia that he had not been informed of the reasons for his arrest. The domestic courts dismissed his claim despite the fact that they had established that the applicant had not been informed of the reasons for his arrest (see paragraph 17 above). The Government admitted that it amounted to a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 5 \u00a7 5 of the Convention (see paragraph 71 above).",
