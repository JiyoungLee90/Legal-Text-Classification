In particular, according to the transcript, at the opening of the debate Member of Parliament V. Asadchev expressed his concern that, if rules of the Code concerning the transfer of land into private hands were to be adopted, this would create a few large landowners (\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0456\u0432) and transform the rest of the population into hired agricultural labour (\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438). In presenting the draft Code for the vote, Ms\u00a0K. Vashchuk, Chairwoman of the Parliamentary Committee for Land Affairs and Agriculture, stated that, in order to address concerns such as those expressed by the MP, the draft suspended the operation of all provisions concerning the sale of land until 2005, until laws on the creation of a land cadastre, land registration and others were passed and a State land bank was established.",

Thus, even if the original duration of the moratorium had been foreseeable, its subsequent extensions had not been. Enactment of the necessary legislation had been cited as the reason for each extension but it had not been enacted throughout all those years. For instance, the draft Land Market Act had been approved at the first reading in 2011 but no further progress had been made on that bill.

High land fragmentation also made this risk unrealistic (see paragraph 96 below). The risk of excessive concentration could be easily mitigated by introducing caps on the maximum amount of land owned, as the draft Land Market Act had envisaged (see paragraph 40 above). It was the prohibition introduced by the moratorium which had pushed the land transactions into the shadow and de facto created a non-transparent shadow land market. It had led to the very problems the Government referred to, in particular a high concentration of land in the hands of large agricultural companies. This was because the moratorium presented the landowners with only two options: either to cultivate the land themselves (which they often could not do due to their age, health, the remoteness of the land, or land fragmentation making cultivation not viable economically) or accept leases under the conditions proposed by the agricultural producers. This market dominance of the agribusiness companies had led to low rents (they cited the State Land Cadastre Agency\u2019s statistics set out in paragraph 35 above) and \u201cland devastation\u201d.",

Comparative law research demonstrates that in many of those States the authorities apparently pursue largely the same goals of ensuring the effective use of land for agricultural production and the avoidance of excessive concentration of land holdings, particularly in the hands of economic players not engaged in local rural life and farming. However, that research demonstrates that the authorities in those countries have at their disposal a wide range of other legislative tools which appear to adequately address those goals without the need to have recourse to a total ban on sales (see paragraphs 47 to 54 above).",
