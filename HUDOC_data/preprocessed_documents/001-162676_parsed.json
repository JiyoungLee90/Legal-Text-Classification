Thus, for example, Trial Chambers, before the amendment was adopted, accepted that a life-threatening illness or serious illness of the accused or immediate family members constituted exceptional circumstances justifying release, while illnesses of a less severe nature did not. As stated, the burden remained on an accused at all times to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Trial Chamber that such circumstances existed.

Trial Chambers seem to have taken two approaches to the new provision. Most Trial Chambers have continued to find that the amendment did not change the other requirements in the Rule and that provisional release was not now the norm. They considered that the particular circumstances of each case should be assessed in light of Rule 65(B) as it now stood. The burden still remained on the accused to satisfy the Trial Chamber that the requirements of Rule 65(B) had been met. This was justified by some given the specific functioning of the Tribunal and absence of power to execute arrest warrants. The second approach seems to have been the following. It has been concluded that based on international human rights standards, \u201cde jure pre-trial detention should be the exception and not the rule as regards prosecution before an international court.\u201d The Trial Chamber in question referred to the fact that, at the Tribunal, in view of its lack of enforcement powers, \u201cpre-trial detention de facto seems to be...the rule.\u201d In addition, it stated that one must take account of the reference to serious crimes. Nevertheless, it found that, \u201cany system of mandatory detention on remand is per se incompatible with Article 5(3) of the Convention (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria , ECourtHR, Decision of 26 July 2001, para. 84). Considering this, the Trial Chamber must interpret Rule 65 with regard to the factual basis of the single case and with respect to the concrete situation of the individual human being and not in abstracto.\u201d",

The domestic courts in particular relied on the fact that the crimes at issue provoked public condemnation and if the perpetrators remained at large, public order would be disturbed (see paragraphs 30-32, 46, 52 and 59 above). They justified such findings by the fact that those crimes had been committed against the Serbian minority in the relatively small community of Sisak, where the consequences of the war were still felt and the process of normalisation of the relations between the ethnic communities was still ongoing. In these circumstances, the domestic courts held that if the applicants, as persons suspected of having committed war crimes against the civilian population, were released from detention, it could cause public disturbance and diminish the public\u2019s trust in the judicial system, as well as undermine the process of securing a peaceful coexistence of the local population (see paragraphs 53, 55, 78 and 80 above).",

Croatia, no. 40523/08, \u00a7 103, 8 April 2010), they are generally seen as underlying reasons for ordering and extending pre-trial detention under Article 102 \u00a7 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 92 and 96 above). The Court also notes that the prevention of a threat to public order is commonly seen as a legitimate ground for detention (see paragraph 97 above), and as such is accepted in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for example, Pe\u0161a, cited above, \u00a7 101; and J.M., cited above, \u00a7 62), and in international criminal-law practice (see, for instance, paragraph 100 above). Indeed, given the specific nature of the charges of war crimes against civilian population, this ground for detention appears particularly pertinent to the cases involving charges of such grave breaches of fundamental human rights, which in the general public commonly provoke particular moral condemnation (see paragraph 92 above).",

In addition, detention will continue to be legitimate only if public order remains threatened; its continuation cannot be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 51; I.A., cited above, \u00a7 104; and Kemmache v.

Given that the national courts are best placed to assess the effects associated with the perpetration of war crimes against the civilian population on the public in the context of post-conflict reconciliation in a society, it is reasonable to assume that there was a risk of social disturbance and a threat to public order in the event that the alleged perpetrators of those crimes were released, which must have reasonably persisted during the period in which the applicants were detained pending trial (compare Tomasi v. France, 27 August 1992, \u00a7 91, Series A no. 241A). This is especially so given that the crimes at issue amounted to a negation of the very foundations of the Convention, which produce the long-lasting effects (see the approach in Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, \u00a7\u00a7 150-51, ECHR 2013; see further Margu\u0161 v. Croatia [GC], no.\u00a04455/10, \u00a7 133, ECHR 2014 extracts).",
