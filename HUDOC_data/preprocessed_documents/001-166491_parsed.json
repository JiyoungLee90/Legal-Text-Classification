The Court has, however, held that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence on an adult may raise an issue under Article 3 (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 97). A life sentence does not become irreducible by the mere fact that in practice it may be served in full. No issue arises under Article\u00a03 if a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a098, and Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 108). On the basis of a detailed review of the relevant considerations emerging from its case-law and from recent comparative and international-law trends in respect of life sentences, the Court has found in Vinter and Others that a life sentence can remain compatible with Article 3 of the Convention only if there is both a prospect of release and a possibility of review, both of which must exist from the imposition of the sentence (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104118 and 122). It further observed in that case that the comparative and international law materials before it showed clear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism guaranteeing a review no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of a life sentence, with further periodic reviews thereafter (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0120, see also Bodein v. France, no. 40014/10, \u00a7\u00a061, 13\u00a0November 2014). It is for the States to decide \u2013 and not for the Court to prescribe \u2013 what form (executive or judicial) that review should take (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099, and Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104 and\u00a0120). The Court has held that presidential clemency may thus be compatible with the requirements flowing from its case-law (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

                                                "content": "100.\u00a0\u00a0The Court has further found that a prisoner cannot be detained unless there are legitimate penological grounds for incarceration, which include punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation. While many of these grounds will be present at the time when a life sentence is imposed, the balance between these justifications for detention is not necessarily static and might shift in the course of the execution of the sentence. It is only by carrying out a review of the justification for continued detention at an appropriate point in the sentence, that these factors or shifts can be properly evaluated (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0111). The review required in order for a life sentence to be reducible should therefore allow the domestic authorities to consider whether, in the course of the sentence, any changes in the life prisoner and progress towards his or her rehabilitation are of such significance that continued detention is no longer justified on legitimate penological grounds (ibid., \u00a7 119). This assessment must be based on rules having a sufficient degree of clarity and certainty (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 129; see also L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar v. Hungary, no.\u00a073593/10, \u00a7 57, 20 May 2014, and Harakchiev and Tolumov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos.\u00a015018/11 and 61199/12, \u00a7\u00a7 255, 257 and 262, ECHR\u00a02014\u00a0(extracts)) and the conditions laid down in domestic legislation must reflect the conditions set out in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 128). Thus, a possibility of being granted a pardon or release on compassionate grounds for reasons related to illhealth, physical incapacity or old age does not correspond to the notion of \u201cprospect of release\u201d as formulated in the Kafkaris judgment (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0127, and \u00d6calan v. Turkey (no. 2), nos. 24069/03, 197/04, 6201/06 and 10464/07, \u00a7 203, 18 March 2014). A Chamber of the Court held in a recent case that the assessment must be based on objective, pre-established criteria (see Trabelsi v.\u00a0Belgium, no. 140/10, \u00a7\u00a0137, ECHR\u00a02014 (extracts)). The prisoner\u2019s right to a review entails an actual assessment of the relevant information (see L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057), and the review must also be surrounded by sufficient procedural guarantees (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 105, and Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 262). To the extent necessary for the prisoner to know what he or she must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, it may be required that reasons be provided, and this should be safeguarded by access to judicial review (see L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057, and Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0258 and 262). Finally, in assessing whether the life sentence is reducible de facto it may be of relevance to take account of statistical information on prior use of the review mechanism in question, including the number of persons having been granted a pardon (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 103; Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0252 and 262; and Bodein, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059).\u201d",

In finding that it did, the Court gave particular weight to the fact that the starting point for the calculation of the whole-life term under French law included any deprivation of liberty, that is to say, even the period spent in pretrial detention. Since the applicant in that case was thus able to apply for parole twenty-six years after the imposition of his life sentence, the Court concluded that the punishment in his case was to be considered reducible for the purposes of Article 3 (see Bodein, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061).",

The Court observes that both applicants have already availed themselves of this opportunity but their respective requests were rejected by the President of the Republic (see above \u00a7\u00a7\u00a010 and\u00a015). However, it is not those decisions to reject the applicants\u2019 pardon requests which are of concern to the Court. Indeed, no Article 3 issue arises if a life prisoner had the right under domestic law to be considered for release but this was refused, for example, on the ground that he or she continued to pose a danger to society (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0108). Once more, what is at stake before the Court is whether the legal framework in Hungary, from the very outset of the applicants\u2019 sentences, provided them with a mechanism or possibility for review of their whole life sentences (see, mutatis mutandis, Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0122). While it is true that seeking presidential clemency continues to be open to various groups of persons serving a prison term in Hungary, including the applicants, the Court has already found that this avenue did not provide de facto or de iure reducibility of a life sentence (see L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7 58).",

Such a long waiting period unduly delays the domestic authorities\u2019 review of \u201cwhether any changes in the life prisoner are so significant, and such progress towards rehabilitation has been made in the course of the sentence, as to mean that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds\u201d (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 119).",

The Court cannot but express a number of concerns relating to the remainder of the procedure provided by the new legislation. The Court notes that the general criteria to be taken into account by the Clemency Board in deciding on whether or not to recommend a life prisoner for pardon are now clearly set out in section 46/C of the new Act, which satisfies the requirement that any such assessment be based on objective, pre-established criteria (see Trabelsi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0137). However, it does not appear that they equally apply to the President of the Republic, who has the last say as to a possible pardon in every individual case. In other words, the new legislation does not oblige the President of the Republic to assess whether continued imprisonment is justified on legitimate penological grounds. What is more, the new Act failed to set a time-frame in which the President must decide on the clemency application or to oblige him or the Minister of Justice  who needs to countersign any clemency decision  to give reasons for the decision, even if it deviates from the recommendation of the Clemency Board. Indeed, the Court has already expressed its reservation concerning the pre-existing clemency system where neither the Minister of Justice nor the President of the Republic were bound to give reasons for the decisions concerning such requests (see L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

This is not so. True, I do find the caselaw pertaining to life imprisonment to be to some extent problematic. But only to some extent, and not in essence. What I find more problematic is how that case-law has been employed in the present case. The manner in which it has been employed renders the attribution of the actual violation to the respondent State not really proven.",

Like the majority, I also find this lengthy period difficult to explain in strictly penological terms. However, the expression \u201ccoupled with\u201d suggests that the two elements are cumulative. Therefore, the forty-year period in itself might not have sufficed for finding a violation of Article 3 and, vice versa, the \u201clack of sufficient procedural safeguards\u201d could possibly have been alleviated by a relatively short \u201cwaiting\u201d period. In my opinion, the manner in which these two elements have been cumulatively invoked in the present case is not unquestionable. For instance, a wholly impracticable period which a hypothetical applicant should complete in order to become eligible to request mandatory clemency could in itself render such a request \u2013 and, by extension, the possibility (and hence the hope) of release \u2013 illusory. Still, with regard to the two applicants in the present case this period is not impracticable (compare paragraph 6 below).",

I mention this only as an illustration of the sorts of difficulties which inevitably arise when the Court, indeed like a \u201creal\u201d legislator, creates an \u201cexact\u201d (albeit somewhat flexible) norm, a \u201cnumerical\u201d standard which, although nowhere to be found in the text of the Convention, is nevertheless applicable from now on in the Court\u2019s case-law and thus is imposed on the Member States. The latter are supposed to feel comforted by the reiteration of the assurance that they still enjoy some margin of appreciation in legislating on matters of penal policy (albeit a visibly narrower one than even a short time ago). Anyway, the difference between the twenty-five-year indicative term and the eleven years and six years actually served, respectively, by the applicants in the present case would be too obvious to be disregarded if the Court were to proceed to examine not only the legislative environment but also (and first of all) the factual situation of the applicants before it.",

I also take account of the fact that the counting of the maximum twenty-five-year indicative term from the imposition of the life sentence is justified by the ratiocination that it is from that day onwards that the life prisoner must know what he or she must do to be considered for release and under what conditions. The comparison of the time of actual deprivation of liberty after the imposition of the life sentence with the twenty-five-year maximum indicative term provided for in the preceding paragraph is not aimed at ignoring the aforementioned justification. (That said, I am not convinced by the reasoning whereby \u201cin cases where the sentence, on imposition, is irreducible under domestic law, it would be capricious to expect the prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether, at an unspecified, future date, a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release\u201d (emphasis added). This reasoning migrates from one case to another (see, for example, Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122; L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7 53; and Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0245) and thus uncritically makes personal self-improvement, in essence a moral phenomenon, virtually a matter of a legal trade-off, devoid of the element of sincere repentance. To say that expecting the prisoner to work towards rehabilitation if he or she is not promised the prospect of release is \u201ccapricious\u201d is, to put it mildly, an overstatement.
