He further submitted that the interim measure was contrary to A.\u2019s best interests. A lack of contact with his father and the paternal family \u2013 A.\u2019s grandparents, uncle, aunt and cousins \u2013 to whom he was very attached might cause A. psychological trauma. It might, moreover, result in A.\u2019s estrangement from his father or, given his very young age, even his forgetting his father altogether.

Before the applicant\u2019s separation from his former wife, A. had attended a nursery school in that neighbourhood. The applicant also had a countryside residence. Being the owner of his own business, he had flexible working hours and could therefore devote a lot of time to his son. He had always paid child maintenance and his income permitted him to give the child a good education. There was a strong personal attachment between the applicant and his son; A. was also very attached to his paternal family \u2013 especially his cousin, who was of the same age. The applicant had positive character references: he was calm, polite and affectionate towards his son. By contrast, Ch. was aggressive and irresponsible. She had physically assaulted him in front of A. and had been criminally convicted in connection with that incident. She had also been convicted of the administrative offence of leaving the scene of a road accident and had had her driving licence suspended for a year. As could be seen from the documents submitted by the applicant to the court, she lived in a severely polluted and criminally unsafe neighbourhood in the vicinity of an oil refinery plant and a prison. Moreover, Ch. shared her flat with her mother, who smoked and abused alcohol and could therefore have a bad influence on A. Until recently, Ch. had prevented the applicant and his relatives from seeing A., and currently she allowed occasional contact only.",

As the parents had been unable to agree about the child\u2019s residence arrangements, the domestic courts had had no choice but to grant the residence order in favour of one or other of them. The judge had ordered an expert psychological report and had also taken into account the opinion of the relevant childcare authorities. The judge had also examined the parents\u2019 income, living conditions and working schedule. The applicant had not proved that his financial situation had been better than that of his ex-wife or that his working schedule had been indeed flexible. His arguments regarding his superior living conditions (because he lived in a less polluted district of Moscow than his ex-wife) were unconvincing as, in the Government\u2019s opinion, all districts in Moscow were equally polluted. The applicant\u2019s and his ex-wife\u2019s flats were comparable in size and were both suitable for a small child. The applicant\u2019s allegations regarding the dissolute behaviour of his ex-wife\u2019s family had been confirmed only by the applicant\u2019s mother and sister, who were witnesses with an interest in the proceedings. By contrast, the applicant\u2019s unsatisfactory behaviour towards the teacher at A.\u2019s nursery school had been confirmed by independent witnesses. The Government further submitted that in 2014 and 2015 the applicant had been fined for traffic offences several times. As regards his ex-wife\u2019s criminal conviction, which had not been final at the time, the judge had considered that it could not constitute a decisive reason for granting a residence order in favour of the applicant. The judge\u2019s decision not to wait until the conviction became final had been justified by the need to settle the child\u2019s residence arrangements as quickly as possible. The applicant\u2019s allegations that the judges had been biased against him were unfounded. The judge had found that each of the parents had been capable of taking care of the child and that the child had been equally attached to both of them. The main reasons for granting the residence order in favour of the mother had been the child\u2019s extremely young age \u2013 three years \u2013 and the fact that he had already lived with his mother for some time and had an established way of life. A change in that way of life and a separation from the mother could be traumatic for him. The applicant\u2019s procedural rights had been respected.",

The applicant and his family had been granted contact rights by a judicial order. Russian law provided for a mechanism to deal with situations where a judicial contact order had not been complied with (see paragraph 45 above). There was, however, no evidence that the applicant\u2019s wife had not complied with the judicial contact order. According to the statement that she had given in July 2015, her relationship with the applicant had improved and contact between A. and his father and his paternal family had been even more frequent than that ordered by the court.

To that end the Court must ascertain whether the domestic courts conducted an in-depth examination of the entire family situation and of a whole series of factors, in particular of a factual, emotional, psychological, material and medical nature, and made a balanced and reasonable assessment of the respective interests of each person, with a constant concern for determining what the best solution would be for the child (see Neulinger and Shuruk v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 139, ECHR 2010, and Antonyuk v.\u00a0Russia, no. 47721/10, \u00a7 134, 1 August 2013).",

However, stricter scrutiny is called for as regards any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights of access, and as regards any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life.

Russia, no. 47721/10, \u00a7 121, 1 August 2013).",

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a013553/09, \u00a7\u00a071, 8 July 2014). In particular, the Court has competence to ascertain whether the domestic courts, when taking such a decision, conducted an indepth examination of the entire family situation and a whole series of relevant factors and made a balanced and reasonable assessment of the respective interests of each person, with a constant concern for determining what the best solution would be for the child (see the case-law cited in the General Principles section of the judgment). A failure to make a sufficiently thorough examination will amount to a violation of Article 8 (see Antonyuk, cited above, \u00a7 146). By contrast, if the domestic courts examined the question at issue with care and in line with the principles laid down by the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require very strong reasons to substitute its own assessment for that of the domestic courts.",

They considered, firstly, that by reason of his very young age, A. should live with his mother. Secondly, they referred to the fact that A. had lived with his mother for some time and that a change to his established way of life would have a negative impact on his psychological state.

The report stated that it was particularly important for a child to be raised by the mother until the age of five or six and that a lack of maternal care during that period could result in the child developing \u201cstubbornness, surliness, hysterical reactions and inadequate social adaptation\u201d. It is significant that the report was formulated on the basis of general assumptions, without any reference to the particular circumstances of the case and without any consideration of the situation of the family in question or the needs of A., the child in question. Although they based their decision on that report to a significant degree, the domestic courts failed to assess it and merely endorsed its findings. They made no meaningful attempts to verify whether the report had been prepared after a thorough examination of the entire family situation and of all relevant factors.",

They limited their examination of this issue to stating that the applicant\u2019s request for a residence order was premature because the child had not reached \u201ca conscious age\u201d. It is also revealing that even before beginning its examination of the case, in its decision on the interim measure, the district court forbade the applicant from contacting his son, finding that such contact \u201cmight complicate or make impossible the execution of the forthcoming judgment\u201d (see paragraph 11 of the judgment). I cannot but conclude that the domestic courts simply assumed from the very outset that women were able to take better care of small children and that it was therefore always in the interests of small children to reside with the mother rather than the father. Such an assumption fails to take into account the variety of family situations and their relevance for the assessment of the best interest of the child, and moreover indicates differing treatment on the basis of sex. Article 8 cannot, however, be interpreted as granting a preferential right to obtain child custody to one or other of the parents (see Don\u00e1t v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 43252/98, 19 October 1999), irrespective of the child\u2019s age.",

It is to be noted that the domestic authorities did not rely on any psychological or other expert evidence in support of their finding that a change of residence would be traumatic for A. It is significant that the experts found that after living with the mother, and separately from the father, for some time A. was still equally attached to both parents (see paragraph 21 of the judgment). Nor did the domestic authorities refer to any evidence showing that A. was more socially integrated at the mother\u2019s place of residence (where he had recently moved after his parents\u2019 separation) than at the father\u2019s place of residence (where he had lived and attended a nursery school during the first years of his life). It therefore appears that the domestic authorities judged that there was a risk of psychological trauma solely on the basis of the mere passage of time spent with the mother after the separation and while the residence order proceedings were pending. As the Court has held on many occasions, effective respect for family life requires that future relations between parent and child should not be determined by the mere passage of time (see the case-law cited in the General Principles section of the judgment). However this is what happened in the present case (compare Jucius and Juciuvien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 14414/03, \u00a7 32, 25\u00a0November 2008).",

It should be noted, in particular, that the criminal conviction entered into force eight days after the proceedings had been stayed.

They therefore considered that Ch.\u2019s criminal conviction, not final at the relevant time, was not a sufficient reason for making a residence order in favour of the applicant (see paragraph 38 of the judgment). It is not the Court\u2019s task to give a final ruling on the matter. However, one must note that Ch. was convicted of a violent criminal offence. It was established that she had physically assaulted the applicant in front of their child and, in particular, that she had snatched the child by force from the applicant before starting to hit the applicant (see paragraph\u00a020 of the judgment). It is also significant that this incident was one of the manifestations of Ch.\u2019s persistent refusal to allow any contact between the applicant and his son. Given the seriousness of the situation and the fact that it was directly relevant to the best interests of the child, the Court considers that it required a more thorough analysis and examination than can be found in the decisions of the domestic courts (see, for similar reasoning, M.S. v. Ukraine, no. 2091/13, \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 82, 11 July 2017).",

It is not the Court\u2019s task to take the place of the national authorities and to establish the disputed facts. I observe, however, that the applicant submitted a number of documents to the domestic courts in support of his arguments. Nevertheless, the domestic courts rejected them in summary fashion without making any meaningful attempt to analyse the applicant\u2019s and Ch.\u2019s respective incomes, living conditions or working schedules in the light of the adduced evidence, finding that those factors were irrelevant for their assessment. It is my humble view that these factors might have been relevant for determining the best interests of the child (see Antonyuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0134, and, mutatis mutandis, Neulinger and Shuruk v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 139, ECHR 2010). Accordingly, the domestic courts failed to safeguard the Convention right in question adequately, by omitting to duly consider factors that were relevant under the Convention (see, by contrast, Gruzdeva v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a013553/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a072-77, 8 July 2014, and Malinin v.

It follows that the decision-making process was deficient and did not therefore allow the best interests of the child to be established.

Thus, where a residence order has been made in favour of one of the parents, the child in question may in the course of time establish a routine involving that parent and have his personal bond with the other parent weakened. It might not be in his interests to disturb his established way of life by reversing a previous residence order. It follows that this is a domain in which there is an even greater call than usual for protection against arbitrary interferences (see, mutatis mutandis, W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062). I am not therefore convinced that a highly uncertain possibility of a future change in residence arrangements could absolve the domestic authorities from complying with their Convention obligation to conduct an in-depth examination of the situation before deciding on a child\u2019s residence arrangements.",
