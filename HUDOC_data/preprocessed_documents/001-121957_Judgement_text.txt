The case originated in an application (no. 69095/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Sándor Fehér (“the applicant”), on 22 November 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr G. Magyar, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
The applicant alleged that his detention in overcrowded cells amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment, in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.
On 5 September 2011 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Szolnok. When introducing the application, he was detained at Állampuszta Prison.
On 19 September 2006 the applicant was detained on charges of robbery and other offences. On 28 October 2009 he was finally convicted and sentenced to six years and eight months’ imprisonment.
Between 19 September 2006 and 23 October 2008 he was held in pre-trial detention at Szolnok Prison (Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok Megyei Büntetés-végrehajtási Intézet) in cells with ground surfaces ranging from 6.33 to 7.25 m2 for four inmates (that is, approximately 1.7 m2 per person on average).
The applicant stated that he could leave the cell for only one hour daily and submitted corroborating statements to that effect from two fellow inmates.
The Government submitted that, during almost one year and nine months out of this period, the applicant was allowed to spend three hours daily outside his cell and another hour outdoors.
Under section 239(2) of Decree no. 6/1996. (VII.12.) IM of the Minister of Justice, it is at the prison governor’s discretion whether or not to keep open during the day the doors of cells accommodating those in pre-trial detention.
After a short stay at Tököl Prison Hospital, the applicant was moved to Állampuszta Prison. Between 3 November 2008 and 23 July 2009 he was detained in cells whose ground surfaces were 24 m2 for ten inmates (according to the applicant; that is, 2.4 m2 per person) or 30.24 m2 for fourteen inmates (according to the Government; that is, 2.16 m2 per person). The inmates were free to leave their cells during the day.
Between 24 July and 21 December 2009 the applicant was held at Tiszalök Prison in good conditions.
Between 21 December 2009 and 10 September 2010 he was held at Budapest Prison (Budapesti Fegyház és Börtön) in a 25 m2 cell for ten inmates (that is, 2.5 m2 per person). He could freely move within the block during the day.
After a short stay at Fővárosi Büntetés-végrehajtási Intézet, the applicant was returned to Állampuszta Prison on 20 September 2010, where he has stayed ever since.
From 1 October 2010 on, he has been accommodated in a 30.24 m2 cell with ten other inmates (that is, 2.75 m2 per person). He can move around freely in the block during the day.
