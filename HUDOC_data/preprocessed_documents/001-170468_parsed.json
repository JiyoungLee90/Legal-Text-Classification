However, the applicants in all those cases were removed from Russia after the respective applications had been lodged and interim measures had been indicated to the Russian Government by the Court.

Against that background, and having regard to the information summarised in paragraphs\u00a096-99 above, the Court cannot but confirm that the illtreatment of detainees remains a pervasive and enduring problem in Uzbekistan (see Nizamov and Others v. Russia, nos. 22636/13 and 3 others, \u00a7 40, 7\u00a0May 2014).",

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7\u00a073, ECHR 2005I). It reiterates that where an applicant alleges that he or she is a member of a group systematically exposed to a practice of illtreatment, the protection of Article 3 of the Convention enters into play when the applicant establishes, where necessary on the basis of information contained in recent reports by independent international human rights protection bodies or nongovernmental organisations, that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice in question and his or her membership of the group concerned. In those circumstances the Court will not then insist that the applicant show the existence of further special distinguishing features (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 132, and N.A. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a025904/07, \u00a7\u00a0116, 17 July 2008). The Court notes in this connection that the applicant was charged and convicted in Uzbekistan of \u201cthe illegal establishment of public associations or religious organisations\u201d and of \u201cthe establishment of, management of, participation in religious extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or other proscribed organisations\u201d (see paragraph\u00a043 above). In the Court\u2019s view, those charges are, without any doubt, of a political and religious character (see Kholmurodov v. Russia, no.\u00a058923/14, \u00a7\u00a065, 1\u00a0March 2016). Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that the applicant belongs to a particularly vulnerable group, whose members are routinely subjected to treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention in the destination country.",

The Russian authorities have been alerted by both the Court and the Committee of Ministers to the recurrence of similar incidents of the unlawful transfer from Russia to States not parties to the Convention, in particular Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, of applicants subject to an interim measure indicated by the Court under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (for a summary of the relevant statements, see Savriddin\u00a0Dzhurayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0121-26, and Kasymakhunov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0136).

The Court considers that it would be too far-reaching, if not unwarranted, to find that the Russian authorities had any particular grounds to exercise special vigilance in respect of the applicant, who only became subject to interim measures after his abduction. To hold otherwise would suggest that there existed an obligation on the authorities constantly to supervise any Uzbek or Tajik nationals on Russian territory, which would not only impose an unrealistic burden on the State but would also run contrary to the notion of the personal autonomy of such foreign nationals, which is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantees of Article 8 of the Convention (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR\u00a02002III).",
