That statement nonetheless constitutes a complaint that was validly lodged in the manner laid down by the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 48 above).

They requested in particular that the Susurluk report (see paragraph 46 above) be accepted at this stage of the proceedings as new evidence supporting the complaints made in their initial application. In their submission, that report \u2013 which had been commissioned by the Prime Minister, who had confirmed its content and credibility in televised interviews \u2013 destroyed the Government\u2019s case. Although it did not enable those responsible for the relevant attacks to be identified, the report contained very serious admissions and an acknowledgment that attacks for which no one claimed responsibility and which were classified as \u201cfaili me\u00e7hul\u201d (unknown perpetrator) had in fact been ordered by senior figures in the security forces. That information was directly relevant to the incidents at the origin of the present case. Since it called into question the State\u2019s denials as to the implication of the State machinery in the killings of and assaults on journalists and sellers of newspapers such as the \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem, it deprived the statements made and evidence lodged by the Government earlier in the proceedings of all credibility. The Susurluk report was consequently of crucial importance in providing an answer to the question \u2013 which had been left open in the Commission\u2019s report (see paragraph 34 above) \u2013 whether the applicant and his uncle were victims of a campaign of violence waged with the State\u2019s connivance.",

Although Article 25 enables certain blood ties to be taken into account in construing the concept of who is a \u201cvictim\u201d, it is however necessary to ask oneself how far that approach can be taken without a risk of converting the right of individual petition into a sort of actio popularis. In the instant case, no one more closely related to the deceased (such as his wife or children) than the applicant, who was only his nephew, took part in the proceedings before the Convention institutions (see paragraph\u00a0123 of the judgment). It must not be forgotten that behind all these cases, which are similar and come from south-east Turkey, are to be found the Diyarbak\u0131r Human Rights Association and the Kurdish Human Rights Project from London, which bodies pursue political ends rather than defending the rights of alleged victims. In my opinion, it is therefore going too far to hold that the applicant was also a \u201cvictim\u201d of his uncle\u2019s death and that the application included that claim too.",
