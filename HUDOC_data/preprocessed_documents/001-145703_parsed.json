Furthermore, it ought also to protect the authorities and other persons concerned from being under any uncertainty for a prolonged period of time. The rule also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised (see, for example, Worm v. Austria, 29 August 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V). Where the alleged violation constitutes a continuing situation against which no domestic remedy is available, such as the non-enforcement of final and enforceable domestic judgments in the present cases, the six-month period starts to run from the end of the continuing situation (see Are\u017eina v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), nos.\u00a066816/09 et al., 3 July 2012).",
