Similarly, that interest will weigh heavily in the balance in determining, as must be done under paragraph 2 of Article 10, whether the restriction was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Thoma v.

Contrary to what the domestic authorities concluded, the Court considers that the impugned commentary, seen in its context, cannot be understood to have constituted a gratuitous personal attack on, or insult to Lech Kaczynski. It is true that it contained a sarcastic tone unsympathetic to the political ideology of the late President. However, the title of the article \u201cCompassion in Accordance with Protocol\u201d hinted at the dichotomy between the human elements of the late President\u2019s death and the journalist\u2019s view of his politics. The phrases employed in the article, such as \u201cthe russophobe, Lech Kaczynski [...] who was a symbol of a country where people who are not white heterosexual Catholic Poles were born as a punishment\u201d or \u201cI do not pity the Poles. I envy them\u201d may appear strong, yet they remain within the acceptable degree of stylistic exaggeration used to express the journalist\u2019s opinion concerning the political views that the late President had represented. The article accepted, in its first sentence, that the death of the former President was a human tragedy, and the Court does not consider that the final two phrases focused on by the national courts relate to that human tragedy. Rather, they continue the directly preceding commentaries on the former President\u2019s policies. In this connection, the Court is mindful that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 313, and Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.\u00a0Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7 59, ECHR 1999III).",
