According to the Court's case-law, it follows from the wording of Article 6 \u2013 and particularly from the autonomous meaning to be given to the notion of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d \u2013 that this provision has some application to pre-trial proceedings (see Imbrioscia v.\u00a0Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p.\u00a013, \u00a7\u00a036). It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an ongoing investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to an adversarial procedure. While national law may satisfy this requirement in various ways, whatever method is chosen should ensure that the other party is aware that observations have been filed and is given an opportunity to comment thereon (see, mutatis mutandis, Brandstetter v.
