However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant was arrested at his home in the presence of his mother. The arrest report drafted by the police on 26 May 2002 (paragraph 6 above) confirmed that the applicant's mother had been informed of his arrest and detention. Furthermore, the applicant was assisted by two different duty lawyers during and after the police custody period (paragraphs 8 and 12 above). Although he claims that the first lawyer had only witnessed the events during the on-site inspections and had not provided him with sufficient legal assistance, the second lawyer had lodged a complaint concerning the ill-treatment before the public prosecutor (paragraph\u00a014 above). However, that petition did not include any submission in relation to the alleged unlawfulness of the detention. Nor, were there any other authorities whom his mother or lawyers approached on his behalf concerning his Article\u00a05 grievances.",
