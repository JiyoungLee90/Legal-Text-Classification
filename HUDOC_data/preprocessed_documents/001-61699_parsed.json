The presumption was only rebuttable in very exceptional circumstances where even a hypothetical possibility of absconding, reoffending or collusion was excluded, due to serious illness or other exceptional factors. It was moreover incumbent on the detained person to prove the existence of such exceptional circumstances, failing which he was bound to remain in detention pending trial throughout the proceedings. The above principles were based on Article 152 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the CCP, as worded at the material time, and the Supreme Court\u2019s practice at that stage.",

It is true that in order to exclude the application of the exception of paragraph 2 of Article 152 of the CCP the prosecution authorities stated that there was a likelihood that the applicant would try to hide documents and suborn witnesses. However, they did not provide any reasoning in support of these findings which were, therefore, of a purely declaratory nature (see Nikolov, cited above, \u00a7 73). In this connection the Court recalls that \u201c[w]here the needs of the investigation are invoked in ... a general and abstract fashion they do not suffice to justify the continuation of detention (see Clooth v.
