It started by observing that it had to review the tacit refusal\u2019s lawfulness by reference to the factual and legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s request and the presumed reasons for its rejection. It went on to say that although the Constitution enshrined the right to obtain information from a State authority, that right was subject to limitations when, for instance, the information was classified. It was apparent from the relevant provisions of the Special Surveillance Means Act 1997 (see paragraphs 2324 below) that information relating to secret surveillance was classified. The refusal to provide such information was therefore compatible with the Constitution and Article 8 of the Convention. The applicant\u2019s argument that the refusal had been in breach of the legislation on protection of personal data was unavailing, because material gathered through secret surveillance fell outside that legislation\u2019s ambit, as did information on whether such surveillance had been authorised. The applicant\u2019s further arguments that the information that he sought was not a State or official secret within the meaning of the Protection of Classified Information Act 2002 and could be divulged because of the expiry of the twoyear timelimit for its remaining classified were likewise unavailing, because that Act did not apply retrospectively.",

The court went on to say that the fact that secret surveillance could be authorised solely by the presidents of the regional courts was sufficient to ensure independent judicial scrutiny of the executive\u2019s actions and provided a sufficient safeguard against undue interferences with individual rights. The court also held that the refusal to provide the information sought by the applicant had not been in breach of his rights under Article 10 of the Convention, because the second paragraph of that Article allowed limitations on the rights enshrined in its first paragraph. The interests set out in the second paragraph enjoyed a higher degree of protection than the right to obtain and impart information, and their protection justified certain curtailment of individual rights.",

By section 1(3) of the Classified Information Act 2002, \u201cclassified information\u201d includes information which is a State or official secret. Section 25 of the Act defines a \u201cState secret\u201d as the \u201cinformation set out in Schedule No. 1 [to section 25 of the Act], the unregulated access to which could endanger or prejudice the interests of the Republic of Bulgaria and which relates to national security, defence, foreign policy, or the protection of constitutional order\u201d. Schedule No. 1 sets out the categories of information which are liable to be classified as being a State secret. They include (a) information about the organisation, methods and means used in the performance of specific tasks carried out by the security services and law enforcement agencies in their informationgathering and intelligence operations, information about their special devices, information and objects obtained as a result of such operations, and information allowing the identification of persons who have helped or continue to help them in their operations (point 3 of part II of the Schedule); (b) information about the lawful use of special means of surveillance (technical devices or the way in which they are used) (point 6 of part II of the Schedule); and (c) intelligence obtained as a result of the use of such means (point 8 of part II of the Schedule).",

The explanatory notes to the bill referred to the Court\u2019s judgment and to the need to bring the Act into line with the requirements of the Convention. The bill was enacted on 15\u00a0December 2008 and came into force on 27 December 2008. Along with a host of other changes, the amendment created a National Bureau for Control of Special Means of Surveillance, an independent body whose five members were to be elected by Parliament and whose task was to oversee the use of special means of surveillance and the storing and destruction of material obtained through such means, and to protect individuals against the unlawful use of such means (new sections 34b(1), 34c and 34d). The Bureau was to be a permanently acting body having its own administration (new section 34b(3)). In carrying out its functions it could (a) ask the relevant authorities to provide it with information in relation to the use of special means of surveillance; (b) check whether those authorities kept accurate records; (c) access premises containing such records or material obtained though surveillance; (d) give mandatory instructions for improvements in the use of special means of surveillance and in the storage and destruction of material obtained though such means; and (e) inform the prosecuting authorities and the heads of the relevant authorities of instances of unlawful use of such means or of irregularities in the storage or destruction of material obtained though such means (new section 34g). The Bureau was to submit to Parliament an annual report setting out aggregated data on the matters that it was overseeing (new section 34b(5)). It was also to inform of its own motion persons who had been unlawfully subjected to surveillance, unless notification could jeopardise the purpose of the surveillance (section\u00a034h).",

In that latest report the commission said, inter alia, that it had received a number of complaints from individuals, and had taken measures to examine them. It had carried out inspections in seven towns, and had noted many irregularities, such as insufficiently reasoned applications for judicial authorisation of secret surveillance, failures to destroy material obtained through such surveillance within the statutory timelimits, and failures to report back to the court which had authorised surveillance. The commission went on to say that the lack of proper recordkeeping made it difficult to oversee the operation of the system as a whole. It also noted the very low percentage of refused applications for judicial authorisation of secret surveillance. The total number of requests in 2011 had been 13,846. Only 116 had been refused, chiefly on purely technical grounds. 7,881 persons had been subjected to surveillance. 747\u00a0requests had yielded material subsequently used in criminal trials. The analysis of the available data showed that the authorities were not using secret surveillance as a means of last resort, but routinely, mainly because it was an almost effortless way of gathering evidence. It was therefore necessary to tighten up the relevant regulations and to strengthen judicial control. The commission made a number of specific proposals in that respect.",

His supposition that he had been subjected to such surveillance, formed wrongly on the basis of random incidents, was erroneous. A perusal of his applications and requests showed that he had mistakenly interpreted certain facts. By law, the class of persons who could be subjected to surveillance was quite limited, as were the authorities which could request such surveillance. In that connection, it was not to be overlooked that in 200809 the Special Surveillance Means Act 1997 and the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 had been amended, reinforcing the relevant safeguards. The law now provided for judicial authorisation of secret surveillance and for written notification of those concerned in cases of unlawful surveillance.

It was not necessary to establish that he had in fact been subjected to such surveillance. The letter of the National Security Agency which said that it had no information that special means of surveillance had been used against the applicant was therefore irrelevant. In any event, that letter did not constitute full proof that the applicant had not been subjected to secret surveillance. When he had sought information on that issue in 2001 and 2003, the Special Surveillance Means Act 1997 had allowed a number of authorities to request the use of special means of surveillance against a person. The National Security Agency, which had been created long after that, in 2008, was the successor of only some of those authorities. A 2009 letter in which the Agency affirmed that it had no information that the applicant had been subjected to secret surveillance could not therefore show that other authorities had not sought to have the applicant subjected to such surveillance. Moreover, the law continued to be unclear as to the manner in which information about the use of special means of surveillance was to be recorded and stored. It was therefore difficult to accept that the Agency could provide full information on that point. Another reason why the information given by the Agency\u2019s director was of dubious reliability was that by law any information relating to the use of special means of surveillance was classified, and its disclosure to an unauthorised person amounted to a criminal offence. It was therefore hard to believe that the National Security Agency would make public accurate information about the use of special means of surveillance against the applicant. The only authority, apart from a regional court, that would have been able to give comprehensive and reliable information on that point was the National Bureau for Control over Special Surveillance Means, whose creation had been mandated by the 2008 amendments to the 1997 Act.",

The applicant drew attention to the Court\u2019s findings in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above), and laid particular emphasis on the Court\u2019s finding that under Bulgarian law it was not possible to obtain any information about the use of special means of surveillance. In the applicant\u2019s view, that impossibility was in breach of the Constitution, as interpreted by the , the Access to Public Information Act 2000, and the laws governing protection of personal data. The national courts\u2019 rulings in the three cases brought by him had disregarded those provisions, thus doing away with an important safeguard against the unlawful use of secret surveillance. It was also necessary to point out that in  there were no public reports on the overall operation of the system of secret surveillance, and that legal challenges aiming to obtain access to classified reports or statistical information about it had been unsuccessful. At the same time, the Bulgarian public had become aware, from scandals in the press, of a number of abuses of special means of surveillance on the part of the authorities.",

The Court went on to say that where there was no possibility of challenging the alleged application of secret surveillance measures at domestic level, widespread suspicion and concern among the general public that secret surveillance powers were being abused could not be said to be unjustified.

The Court must therefore examine the case by reference to the legal framework in force at the time when the applicant lodged his application (see Dumitru Popescu v.

There are two further reasons why it is not appropriate to examine in this case the compatibility of the 200809 legal developments with the Convention. First, the parties\u2019 observations, which were filed in September 2009, do not cover all of them and do not address in detail the question whether they are Conventioncompliant. Secondly, and more importantly, those developments are still under review by the Committee of Ministers in the exercise of its duty under Article 46 \u00a7 2 of the Convention to supervise the execution of the Court\u2019s judgment in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (see paragraph 32 above).

The Court found that the statutory procedure for authorising secret surveillance, if strictly adhered to, offered sufficient protection against arbitrary or indiscriminate surveillance. However, it went on to find problems with (a) the lack of review by an independent body of the implementation of surveillance measures or of whether the material obtained through such measures would be destroyed within the statutory timelimit if the surveillance had proved fruitless; (b) the lack of sufficient safeguards in respect of surveillance carried out on national security grounds and not in the context of criminal proceedings; (c) the lack of regulations specifying with an appropriate degree of precision the manner of screening of such material, or the procedures for preserving its integrity and confidentiality and the procedures for its destruction; (d) the lack of an independent body overseeing and reporting on the functioning of the system of secret surveillance; (e) the lack of independent control over the use of material falling outside the scope of the original application for the use of surveillance measures; and (f) the lack of notification of the persons concerned, even where such notification could be made without jeopardising the purpose of the surveillance (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 8591).

The Court was faced with the same argument in the case of GoranovaKaraeneva v. Bulgaria (no. 12739/05, \u00a7\u00a061, 8 March 2011). It observed that that provision had come into force long after the applicant had lodged her application, whereas the assessment whether effective domestic remedies existed was normally to be carried out with reference to the date on which the application had been lodged with the Court. The Court went on to say that even if it were to make an exception from that rule, it was not persuaded that the new point 7 could provide an effective remedy to the applicant, chiefly because the Bulgarian courts appeared consistently to construe amendments to the liability provisions of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 as conferring substantive rights and not having retrospective effect (see also paragraph 31 above). It was therefore highly unlikely that those courts would allow a claim in respect of events which predated the coming into force of point 7 by several years. The Court observed that the Government had not cited any examples to show otherwise, and concluded that in the circumstances of the case the possibility of bringing a claim under the new point 7 was not an effective remedy. The Court also noted that the Government had not referred to another remedy, and that it was not aware of any (see GoranovaKaraeneva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 6264).",

The Government have not provided any examples of awards of damages under that provision in relation to secret surveillance predating its coming into force \u2013 or, indeed, any secret surveillance; on the contrary, as recently as June 2012 they acknowledged that they were not aware of caselaw under that provision (see paragraph 32 above).",

It is true that under the new section 34h of the Special Surveillance Means Act 1997, as amended, a special parliamentary commission has to notify those unlawfully subjected to secret surveillance, if this can be done without harming certain countervailing interests (see paragraph 27 above). However, that cannot be taken into account, because that opportunity arose long after the lodging of the application, and because it is unclear whether it applies to past instances of secret surveillance. Moreover, there is no indication that that commission is under a duty to examine requests for information made by individuals (see paragraph 26 above).",

However, the Court does not consider that the points raised by the applicant should prompt it to make an award in respect of nonpecuniary damage, for several reasons. First, the breaches of Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention found in the case were based on the state of the law before the Court\u2019s judgment in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (see GoranovaKaraeneva, cited above, \u00a7 81).
