They submitted that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies because he had failed to appeal against the decision of 30 December 2004 in the part concerning the extension of the pre-trial detention. In any event, the applicant's detention from 4 to 13 December 2005 was duly authorised by the decision of 30\u00a0December 2004, compatible with the domestic procedural rules and free from arbitrariness. Given that the applicant remained in detention \u201cpending trial\u201d until the date of the receipt of his case by the prosecutor, Article 255 of the CCrP was applicable. In accordance with that provision, the applicant could have remained in detention \u201cpending trial\u201d for up to six months (see paragraph 22 above). As regards the five-day time-limit set out by the domestic court, it only concerned the remedying of the violations in the investigation file by the prosecutor, but not the applicant's pre-trial detention. The five-day time-limit set out for remedying the violations, in its turn, started running from the day the investigator received the file, which was 11\u00a0January 2005, immediately after the public holidays. Upon receipt of the case file, the investigator duly asked for an extension of the time-limit for the investigation and the applicant's detention pending the investigation. Such an extension was authorised by the 's decision of 13\u00a0January 2005. Therefore, the applicant's detention was lawful. The Government contended that under the judgment of 22 March 2005 the period between 4\u00a0and 13 January 2005 had counted toward the applicant's prison term.",

France, 19 March 1991, \u00a7 34, Series A no.\u00a0200). Turning to the application at hand, the Court notes that the applicant complains solely of the lawfulness of his detention during the period from 4 to 13 January 2005 whereas he does not dispute the legality of his detention either before or after these dates. Therefore, in the eyes of the Court the crux of the applicant's problem was not the extension of his detention after 30 December 2004 in itself, but the exact duration and the grounds for the detention after 4 January 2005, as well as the manner in which the authorities interpreted and applied the extension order of 30\u00a0December 2004. The Court notes that the applicant raised this issue in the court proceedings concerning the extension on 13 January 2005 and subsequently on appeal on 4 February 2005. In particular, he submitted in the grounds of appeal that his detention on 4-13 January 2005 had been unlawful. The domestic courts examined the substance of these arguments and rejected them as unfounded. In the Court's view, in these particular circumstances the applicant had exhausted the domestic remedies available to him (see, mutatis mutandis, Dzhavadov v. , no. 30160/04, \u00a7 27, 27\u00a0September 2007).

The Court notes the Government's submission that the period from 30 December 2004 to 11\u00a0January 2005, when the prosecutor received the file, was covered by Article 255 of the CCrP. They argued, in other words, that until the date of receipt of the file by the prosecutor, the applicant was detained \u201cpending trial\u201d and could be held in such detention for up to six months. The Court observes, however, that the order of 30\u00a0December 2004 did not refer to Article 255 of the CCrP.
