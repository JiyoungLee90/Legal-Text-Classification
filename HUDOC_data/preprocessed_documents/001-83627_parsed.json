It only confirmed that over ten years had elapsed from the day the crime had been committed, a fact that rendered the prosecution time-barred. It cannot therefore be accepted that the discontinuance of prosecution because of the time-bar constituted any acknowledgment, whether explicit or implicit, on the part of the national authorities that the applicant's case had not been heard within a reasonable time (see, mutatis mutandis, Eckle v. Germany, judgment of 15\u00a0July 1982, Series A no. 51, \u00a7\u00a066). Moreover, the Court has already determined the reasonableness of the length of proceedings which were discontinued because the action had become time-barred (see Stamoulakatos v. Greece (dec.), no. 42155/98, 9 November 1999).",

Neither is it persuaded that the applicant's challenge of judges added to the length of the proceedings, given that it was decided in a speedy manner (see paragraph 23 above). His unsuccessful requests for postponement (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above) did not affect the length of the proceedings, given that those hearings were held as scheduled. The applicant's three objections (see paragraph 27 above) repudiate the Government's argument that he had failed to undertake any measure to expedite the proceedings.

In this context, the Court reiterates that although it is not in a position to analyse the juridical quality of the case-law of the domestic courts, it considers that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Wierciszewska v. , no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25 November 2003). Moreover, it took nearly five years, of which nearly three years fall within the period under consideration, for the trial court to decide the applicant's case even though it had already been reconsidered on two occasions (see paragraphs 11 and 17 above). The frequent change of the trial judges also contributed to the length of the proceedings.
