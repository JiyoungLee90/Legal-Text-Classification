It noted that the applicant had not been aggressive to others or to himself during his detention. In that context, it welcomed the steps taken by S\u0103poca Hospital to place the applicant under guardianship, which it considered appropriate in the perspective of his release, given that the applicant had been rejected by his family (his brother, sister, former wife and daughters). Finally, the Board recommended that the social welfare services of the applicant\u2019s district of residence should be informed that they had to take the necessary action with a view to releasing him.",

The Committee emphasised that the national authorities had acknowledged that prison was not the appropriate environment for the author but that his imprisonment was warranted owing to the lack of alternatives and available social services. The Committee concluded that the person\u2019s detention had been ordered after the examination by the national authorities of the possible consequences of his intellectual disability, in the absence of any criminal conviction, which had made his disability the main reason for his detention, in breach of Article 14(1)(b) CRPD. In its findings the Committee further criticised the fact that the author had never had the opportunity to have the criminal charges against him determined and his status as an alleged sexual offender potentially cleared, owing to his intellectual disability. It observed that that situation had pointed to discriminatory treatment and amounted to a breach of the author\u2019s right of access to justice and the right to a fair trial.",

He argued that the forensic medical reports drawn up had perpetuated and consolidated the flaws in the initial detention order, which had referred to all the charges against him, whereas only one of those charges had been levelled by the prosecution at the end of the investigation, that is to say that relating to sexual corruption. He took the view that the constant references in those forensic medical reports to the offence of incest which he had allegedly committed had had a powerful stigmatising effect capable of influencing the doctors\u2019 and judges\u2019 perception of his potential dangerousness. Furthermore, the sexual corruption charge had never been the subject of a judicial review because of the closure of the criminal investigation instigated against him for lack of evidence and the suspect\u2019s lack of discernment. In support of his allegations the applicant cited, in particular, the argument put forward by Buz\u0103u County Court in its 29 August 2016 judgment concerning the antisocial acts he was alleged to have committed against members of his family (see paragraph\u00a064 above). The applicant took the view that not only did the aforementioned argument breach the principle of presumption of innocence, but it also nullified the effect of the two forensic medical reports drawn up during the proceedings which concluded with the aforementioned judgment, one of which reports had proposed releasing him and the other had stated that the continuation of his detention no longer had any basis in law.",

The applicant took the view that the lack of such a therapeutic plan merely reinforced the punitive aspect of the measure and eliminated the necessary preventive and medical aspects of psychiatric detention.

The notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d in paragraph 4 of Article 5 has the same meaning as in paragraph 1, such that a detained person is entitled to a review of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 \u00a7 1. Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not guarantee a right to judicial review of such a scope as to empower the court, on all aspects of the case including questions of pure expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority. The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the \u201clawful\u201d detention of a person according to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see E.\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway, 29 August 1990, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 181-A). The reviewing \u201ccourt\u201d must not have merely advisory functions but must have the competence to \u201cdecide\u201d the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the detention and to order release if the detention is unlawful (see Stanev, \u00a7 168, and Khlaifia and Others, \u00a7 128, judgments cited above).",

The Convention requirement that an act of deprivation of liberty be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny is of fundamental importance in the context of the underlying purpose of Article 5 of the Convention to provide safeguards against arbitrariness. What is at stake is both the protection of the physical liberty of individuals and their personal security (see Varbanov, cited above, \u00a7 58). In the case of detention on the ground of mental illness, special procedural safeguards may be called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental disabilities, are not fully capable of acting for themselves (see, among other authorities, Winterwerp, \u00a7 60, and Stanev, \u00a7 170, judgments cited above).",

The importance of what is at stake for him - personal liberty - taken together with the very nature of his affliction - diminished mental capacity - compel this conclusion (see Megyeri, cited above, \u00a7 23).
