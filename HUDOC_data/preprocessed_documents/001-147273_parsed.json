On the day of his visit, the applicant was sharing a cell with approximately ten other foreigners, all of whom were sitting on the floor with their backs against the wall and sharing three blankets between them. There were similarly ten to twelve people in the other cell. There was a small vent in the wall measuring approximately 30\u00a0x\u00a050\u00a0cm, which let in very little light. There was also a pile of rubbish outside it. During their meeting, the applicant also gave a detailed account of his detention conditions, which the lawyer noted as follows. The number of detainees in the cell varied between seven and fifteen. There were no beds, and there was no room for more than three people to lie down at the same time. They were only provided with three blankets and four small pillows to share, and there was no heating. The cell, which also lacked natural light and sufficient ventilation, was always cold and there was no provision for outdoor exercise. The food provided was also insufficient; they had to pay to receive more. It appears that the lawyer brought the applicant and some of the other detainees sandwiches after the meeting, as they had complained of being hungry.",

Although all law enforcement establishments received inspection visits by the competent public prosecutor on a more or less regular basis, the quality and thoroughness of such inspections frequently left much to be desired. By way of example, in a number of establishments, visiting prosecutors had certified by signature the accuracy of custody registers, without apparently having detected flagrant omissions and errors present in them. Further, it would seem that visiting prosecutors only rarely interviewed detained persons in private. To sum up, inspections by public prosecutors often appeared to be an empty gesture [footnote: The explanation given by the head of one of the AntiTerror Departments visited about the role of visiting prosecutors (\u201cWe work closely together and he is our superior in investigations. He does not record his visits. He uses the place like his office\u201d), is symptomatic of the situation observed by the delegation].\u201d",

Nor is there any evidence to suggest that he was taken into detention after the rejection of that request.

In the absence of further information as to the state of the facility after the flooding, including the number of detainees, the Court cannot give much weight to the findings of the public prosecutor. Thirdly, while the detention conditions in question could in theory be suitable to short-term detention in police custody, the length of the applicant\u2019s detention is a decisive factor in the Court\u2019s examination; it is, however, unclear whether the suitability of the police custody facilities for longer-term detention, such as in the applicant\u2019s case, figured in the public prosecutor\u2019s assessment. The Court therefore considers the public prosecutor\u2019s findings to be unreliable for the purposes of the present case. The Court\u2019s misgivings as to the merits of this inspection also find support from the CPT, which indicated in its 2009 report that the quality and thoroughness of such inspections frequently left much to be desired and gave the impression that they were often conducted as an \u201cempty gesture\u201d (see paragraph 41 above for more details).",
