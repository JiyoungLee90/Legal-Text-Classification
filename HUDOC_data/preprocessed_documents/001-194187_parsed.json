It held that, taking into account the information the authorities had had to hand at the relevant time, there had not been an immediate risk to A.\u2019s life. A barring order had been issued against E., which had required him to stay away from the marital home and the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 apartment, as well as the surrounding areas. E. had never acted aggressively in public before. Even though he had allegedly been issuing threats against his family for years, he had never acted upon them. He had complied with the barring order issued in 2010, and no further misconduct had been reported to the authorities after the incident in 2010 until the applicant had reported him to the police on 22\u00a0May 2012. There had not been any indications that E. had had a gun in his possession, or that he had tried to get one. Moreover, after the issuance of the barring order, E. had cooperated with the police and had not demonstrated any aggressive behaviour, so the authorities had been able to assume that there would be a reduction in tension. The court weighed the applicant\u2019s and her children\u2019s right to be protected against the rights of E. under Article\u00a05 of the Convention, and held that pre-trial detention should only be the ultima ratio. A less intrusive measure had been issued instead, namely the barring order with respect to both the residential premises. The court concluded that the public prosecutor\u2019s office had therefore not acted unlawfully or culpably by not taking E. into pre-trial detention.",

She presented statistics showing that the number of homicides committed between partners was significantly raised during the separation phase of a couple, the phase in which the applicant and E. had found themselves. The applicant asserted that the authorities had been aware that E.\u2019s violence against her had increased since February 2012. In fact, he had specifically threatened that he would kill the children in front of the applicant, and that he would kill her or himself. The applicant also argued that the domestic authorities were under a positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to protect her and her children\u2019s lives by making use of criminal law provisions and the respective measures therein, which, in her specific situation, could only have meant detention. The temporary restraining order as a \u201cless intrusive measure\u201d had not been sufficient as the police could not extend it to cover the children\u2019s school.",

It held that the public prosecutor\u2019s office had some discretion when deciding on whether to take a person into pre-trial detention. Official civil liability could only be established if the decision had not been justified under the particular circumstances. The starting point for the evaluation of such a decision was the specific information the authorities had to hand at the time the decision was taken. The public prosecutor\u2019s office had to decide on the basis of the specific information available and the facts of the case before it. In the absence of such information, any general knowledge concerning increased levels of homicides during divorce proceedings was not decisive. What mattered was the question whether at the pertinent time there had been serious reasons to suggest that there was a real and individual risk that E. would commit further serious offences against the applicant and her children. According to the information available to the public prosecutor\u2019s office at the time, and considering that a barring order had already been issued, there had not been sufficiently specific grounds to assume the existence of such a risk, in particular in the public area, for the reasons already set out by the St. P\u00f6lten Regional Court.",

However, they had only one dedicated morning per week for applicants who were not represented by lawyers, namely the public court consultation day every Tuesday (Amtstag). After the escalation of violence on Saturday 19 May 2012, she had seized the first opportunity to file for divorce on Tuesday, 22\u00a0May 2012. On the same day, she had also reported E. to the police and obtained a barring order with respect to the residential premises. The applicant submitted that she had already made an appointment with her counsellor from the Centre for the Protection from Violence for 25 May 2012 in order to make arrangements to apply for a temporary restraining order at the District Court, but had to wait until the following Tuesday to file such an application, which would have been 29\u00a0May 2012. Even if she had applied for a temporary restraining order earlier, that is on the same day she had filed for divorce, the court, in the applicant\u2019s view, probably would not have decided on the application within three days, and it was only three days later that her son was killed. In addition, the judge at the court where she had filed for divorce on 22\u00a0May 2012 had not informed her that she had that opportunity, despite the allegations she had made about her husband\u2019s violent and threatening behaviour.",

In this context the applicant submitted that on 22\u00a0May 2012 she and her children had been in need of immediate protection from further violence by her husband. The Court agrees with the Government that the applicant could have requested a temporary restraining order under section 382e of the Enforcement Act with respect to premises beyond the residences even as early as on 22 May 2012. She was informed of this possibility and had, according to her own submissions, planned an appointment with her counsellor in order to request such a measure. The Court is however not convinced that, even if the applicant had made the request on 22 May 2012, it would have provided her family with immediate protection. It had to be lodged separately with the District Court, and that court had up to four weeks to issue a temporary restraining order. Although it is not impossible, it is also far from certain that the court would have delivered a decision immediately. The Court is not convinced that such an application would have been an effective remedy against the alleged risk in the instant case. It therefore rejects the Government\u2019s argument.",

She had referred to several risk factors in the course of filing the report, namely his previous criminal convictions for dangerous threatening behaviour and bodily harm, the latter as a result of domestic violence against her; E.\u2019s long history of violence against the applicant and her children; the evidence of the injuries she had sustained during previous attacks; his relapse into gambling in February 2012 and his resulting increased aggression and financial problems; the continuous and very specific threats he had been issuing since March 2012; his non-acceptance of her wish to get a divorce and her resulting fear that he would act upon his threats; his gross trivialisation and denial of the use of violence; and the predictable escalation of the situation because of the divorce proceedings. E.\u2019s sense of ownership over his family had been threatened by the applicant\u2019s wish for a separation, which she had manifested by filing for divorce and reporting him to the police.

The applicant maintained that E. should have been taken into pre-trial detention, as the legal grounds for such detention had been satisfied (Article 170 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, see paragraph 38 above), particularly taking into consideration the risk that E. would reoffend or carry out an offence (Article 170 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(4)). In the alternative, as a more lenient measure, it would have been possible under Article 173 \u00a7\u00a05\u00a0(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the public prosecutor to order E. to stay away from the children\u2019s school. This was all the more the case as the police barring order could not be extended to cover such premises. However, neither of these measures was employed. This demonstrated the lack of knowledge by the authorities of the dynamics of violence in cases of intimate partner violence and the profiling of perpetrators. Furthermore, the fact that section 38a of the Security Police Act did not allow the extension of barring orders to childcare facilities, indicated a deficiency in the legislation.

Prior to the report filed on 22\u00a0May 2012, E. had only come to the attention of law-enforcement officials once, namely two years before, in 2010, on account of ill-treatment reported by the applicant. E. had thereafter complied with the barring order which had been issued against him, had undergone medical treatment, and the authorities had been made aware of no further misconduct. Furthermore, the applicant had only reported the alleged rape and choking by E. three days after the events, even though the police could be reached twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. When law-enforcement officials had interviewed her husband on 22 May 2012 he had presented himself as calm and cooperative. A medical examination of the applicant had been conducted, but no physical evidence of rape had been found. Given that E. had not appeared aggressive or otherwise conspicuous outside the family setting, the authorities had only had a limited set of facts at their disposal, on the basis of which they had had to assess the potential danger emanating from him. The level of knowledge had not suggested any risk for the children\u2019s lives, particularly in a public area, which is why they had not been expressly mentioned in the police report of 22 May 2012 (see paragraph 15 above) as \u201cendangered persons\u201d within the meaning of section 38a of the Security Police Act. Given that the reported episode of violence of 19\u00a0May 2012 had been directed only against the applicant, and not in any way against her children, the public prosecutor\u2019s office was not obliged to assume that a situation of acute danger existed as provided for in Article\u00a0170 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 41 above). The applicant had not mentioned any further violence occurring between the alleged crime and her reporting the matter to the police three days later.",

The grounds for arrest, namely catching the offender in the act, flight risk or suppression of evidence, did not exist (see Article\u00a0170 \u00a7\u00a01 (1)  (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, paragraph 41 above). The ground for arrest contained in Article\u00a0170 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(4), namely the risk that an identical offence directed against the same legally protected right would be committed by the alleged perpetrator, or that he or she would carry out the attempted or threatened act of which he or she was suspected, had been ruled out by the public prosecutor after carefully weighing the information available and the conflicting interests involved. The Government considered it justified to confine the measures applied to the issuance of a barring order with immediate effect, combined with the seizure of E.\u2019s keys to the residential property, and to focus on protecting the applicant rather than recognising the children as endangered persons themselves. Restricting E.\u2019s freedom of movement any further than provided for under the barring order would have been inconsistent with Article 5 of the Convention, as it would have been neither necessary nor proportionate. The Government submitted that the positive obligations under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention to protect victims of violence did not a priori include any measures that would obviously be inconsistent with Article 5. As the legal grounds for pre-trial detention had not been made out, an order by the public prosecutor for E. to stay away from the children\u2019s school, under Article\u00a0173 \u00a7\u00a05\u00a0(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was also not available. Against this overall backdrop, the Government concluded that the public prosecutor\u2019s office could not be blamed for assuming that, despite the barring order, E. did not pose a further risk, in particular with relation to the children. In the light of the circumstances, it appeared sufficient that a barring order \u2013 with which E. had complied in the past \u2013 was issued in respect of the applicant\u2019s and her parents\u2019 apartments and their vicinities.",

The Government submitted, however, that the legislator should not be blamed for having introduced these improvements in connection with the incident in question. It was in the nature of things that a set of legal provisions which has generally proven effective can also be developed further. Performing evaluations as soon as relevant experience caused them to be identified as necessary should not give rise to criticism. Finally, in the civil proceedings it had, in any event, not been demonstrated that a far-reaching barring order would have been regarded as necessary in the light of the facts that were known to the authorities on 22 May 2012.",

The Court reiterates that previously, in 2010, the police had issued a barring order against E. with respect to the residential premises, immediately after the applicant had made criminal complaints. E. was criminally convicted only six months after the applicant had reported him to the police, and despite her having made use of her right not to testify. In the following two years the applicant never reported any further incidents to the police. However in 2012, right after the applicant\u2019s report of domestic violence, the police again immediately issued a barring order, combined with a seizure of E.\u2019s keys, and another barring order with respect to the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 home. The police reported the incident to the public prosecutor right away, and on the same day the latter opened a criminal investigation into the allegations of domestic abuse and rape. Unlike in Talpis (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117), the Court finds that the authorities reacted immediately to the applicant\u2019s reports of domestic violence. While the authorities therefore complied with their duty to act without delay once they had learned of the allegations of violence, it remains for the Court to examine whether their actions in 2012 were also sufficient in the light of their knowledge concerning the risk posed by E.",

The Court is fully conscious of the difficulties encountered by the domestic authorities when deciding, as in the instant case, whether or not to issue a barring order against a suspect or even arrest him or her, on the basis of limited information available, often under time pressure and by nonetheless carefully balancing the rights of the person who poses a threat on the one hand, and the rights of the victim(s) on the other. It is therefore most relevant to recapitulate what was known to the authorities at the time when they decided which measures to take in respect of E., taking into account the competencies accorded to them by the law and a certain discretion offered by this law.",

The sentence had been suspended, but he was still within the threeyear probationary period of that conviction, and there was strong evidence that he had committed the very same offences again. In relation to the new allegations of bodily harm, there was physical evidence, namely haematoma on the applicant\u2019s neck and scratches on her chin. In addition, there was the accusation of rape, of which, however, no physical evidence was detected. The applicant gave a detailed account of the alleged rape to the police, while E.\u2019s statements contained several contradictions (see paragraphs\u00a018 and 21 above). However, before reporting the alleged rape the applicant had spent three more days in the apartment she shared with him. E.\u2019s alleged violent outbreaks before the killing of his son had been confined to the marital home, from which he had been effectively barred. Moreover, there were no indications that E. had a gun or any other weapon, or that he had tried to get one. When confronted by police officers, E. had remained calm and cooperative, had gone to the police on his own initiative and did not give the appearance of posing an immediate threat to anyone.

These threats, however, were partly ambiguous (for example, on the one hand E. had threatened to kill his children in front of the applicant, on the other he had threatened to take them to Turkey, but he had also threatened to commit suicide) and allegedly were issued on a daily basis over a period of two months without being acted upon.

His violent outbreaks had previously been limited to the vicinity of the home, which a barring order was capable of preventing, especially since he had fully complied with such a measure in 2010. Even though there were indications of a certain escalation of violence because of the pending divorce proceedings, this did not lead to the conclusion that there was a danger to the children\u2019s lives in a public place. In these circumstances, the real and immediate risk of a planned murder by E. obtaining a gun and shooting his son at his school was not detectable (see paragraph 25 above). The Court therefore sees no reason to depart from the domestic authorities\u2019 assessment that, considering all circumstances, given that a barring order that prohibited him from returning to the marital home, to the surrounding areas, to the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 apartment and to its surrounding areas had been issued on the basis that such an order had been effective two years before, no other incident had been reported in the period from July\u00a02010 until May\u00a02012 and it was not known that E. was in possession of a weapon, there was no discernible real and immediate risk to the children\u2019s lives.

In this respect, the Court refers to its reasoning above, that under the circumstances known to the authorities a risk to the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s life when he was at school was not discernible (see paragraphs 6776 above). Her argument that the amendment of section 38a of the Security Police Act, adopted after the events in question (see paragraph 35 above), had to be interpreted as a \u201crecognition\u201d of the alleged legal deficiencies and should consequently lead to an award of compensation in her favour, is inconclusive.

She remained in the marital home for three days after that incident before going to the authorities, and there are no indications that she was unable to seek police protection earlier. Furthermore, she knew that she could get a temporary restraining order from the competent district court under section\u00a0382b or section 382e of the Enforcement Act, and an order under the latter section could have banned E. from public places beyond the residential premises (see paragraphs 8, 17 and 48 above). The fact that she did not lodge such a request in the aftermath of her husband\u2019s violent outbreak indicates that she herself did not see an imminent need for such a measure. In this context the Court also notes that after the issuance of the barring order the applicant told her children that they could see their father whenever they wanted to (see paragraph 23 above). These considerations do not imply any criticism towards the applicant, but show that, although a legal framework for the applicant\u2019s and her children\u2019s protection existed, full use of it was not made because, tragically, a real and immediate risk for A.\u2019s life at school was not discernible at that time.",

Therefore the State authorities should react, with due diligence, to each and every act of domestic violence and take all necessary measures to make sure that such acts do not lead to more serious consequences. It follows that the duty to prevent and protect comes into play when the risk to life is present, even if it is not imminent. In other words, in a domestic violence case, the positive obligation to protect life can be violated even where the risk to life is not immediate. I fully share the view of my learned colleague Judge Pinto De Albuquerque expressed several years ago in his concurring opinion in the case of Valiuliene v. Lithuania (see Valiuliene v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 33234/07, 26 March 2013) that \u201c[r]ealistically speaking, at the stage of an \u201cimmediate risk\u201d to the victim it is often too late for the State to intervene. In addition, the recurrence and escalation inherent in most cases of domestic violence makes it somehow artificial, even deleterious, to require an immediacy of the risk\u201d. I am of the opinion that seeking to prove the immediacy of the risk to life in domestic violence cases in order to establish a violation of Article 2 would not be consonant with the scope of the due-diligence obligations of States in the field of preventing and combating domestic violence, particularly in the light of the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (the Istanbul Convention).",
