Romania, no. 29752/05, \u00a7 46, 9 July 2013).

The mere fact that neither the defence nor the prosecution was present during the questioning of the crucial witnesses cannot constitute an excuse for disregarding the applicant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses whose statements were of decisive importance for his conviction. Moreover, the police, as the prosecutor in the applicant\u2019s case, had already had the opportunity to question S.K. and Z.M. during the pre-trial stage of the proceedings (see paragraph 5 above).",

The trial court did not sufficiently consider the applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the existing discrepancies between the testimony of those two witnesses and the only other corroborating testimony. In that sense, the applicant was unable to test the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence of S.K. and Z.M. by means of cross-examination, despite the fact that it was the decisive evidence against him (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 162 and 165).
