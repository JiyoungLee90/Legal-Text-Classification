Subsequently, after sometimes undergoing a medical visit and a blood test, they were taken to detention centres for foreigners where they were detained for varying periods of time, taken by bus to airports in Moscow, and expelled to Georgia by aeroplane.

They also emphasised that the authorities concluded from these facts that Mr Togonidze had repeatedly used narcotics for a long period of time. As regards the needle punctures they pointed out that the injection mark at the bend of the left elbow stemmed most probably from the resuscitation attempts at the airport, in which intravenous drugs were given, and that the other two marks, on the lower third of the left shoulder, appear as a very unusual site for self-injection of drugs. They further indicated that methadone is usually taken in liquid form and only very uncommonly by injection. In addition, according to their opinion, the last few hours of Mr Togonidze\u2019s life did not coincide with the \u2018normal\u2019 death of a person dying from methadone intoxication. Being a sedative, people dying from methadone intoxication typically do so after a period of unconsciousness. Mr Togonidze, however, did not show any signs of drowsiness and was able to talk to the Georgian consul and walk a few steps before suddenly collapsing. Lastly they pointed out that the conclusion of repeated drug use was not confirmed by an analysis of a hair sample or finding any supporting evidence, such as needles, ampoules or syringes, on Mr Togonidze\u2019s corpse or in his cell.",

However, the issues involved are different where the direct victim dies before his or her complaint is brought before the Court. Although the locus standi of a victim\u2019s next of kin has been recognised where the victim had died or disappeared in circumstances which were alleged to engage the responsibility of the State, the Court\u2019s approach has been more restrictive in cases where the alleged violation of the Convention was not closely linked to disappearances or deaths giving rise to issues under Article 2. As regards complaints of ill-treatment of deceased relatives under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court has accepted the locus standi of applicants only in cases where the ill-treatment was closely linked to the death or the disappearance (see Karpylenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 15509/12, \u00a7\u00a7 104, 105, 11 February 2016, with further references).",

Persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them. Consequently, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see, among other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999). The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of an individual in custody is particularly stringent where that individual dies (Salman v.

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention.

Consequently, having regard to the circumstances of Mr Togonidze\u2019s death, the Court has to determine whether this submission constitutes a satisfactory and convincing explanation of his death during detention. The Court observes that the medical report submitted by the applicant indicates several inconsistencies regarding the finding of the Russian authorities and that the Government did not submit any comments \u2013 clarifying these inconsistencies \u2013 regarding the medical report (see paragraph 36-39). The Court notes in particular that the level of methadone in Mr Togonidze\u2019s blood had not been determined and that it was therefore impossible to determine the amount of methadone allegedly taken by Mr Togonidze. Furthermore, it notes that neither drugs nor drug related evidence were found on Mr\u00a0Togonidze and that there were no reports regarding drug use during his detention. In addition, the Court agrees with the findings in the medical report that the lower third of the left shoulder appears a very unusual site for selfinjection of drugs. Furthermore, it notes that establishing a long-term drug use from three injection marks seems improbable in the absence of any supporting evidence. The Court also observes that the Government submitted that Mr\u00a0Togonidze was searched before entering the bus and closely monitored during the bus ride and that it is therefore highly unlikely that he was able to buy or take drugs during the last 9-10 hours before his death. Finally, the Court notes that the specific circumstances of Mr\u00a0Togonidze\u2019s death and his conduct shortly before collapsing appear highly inconsistent with a methadone overdose.",

This requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.
