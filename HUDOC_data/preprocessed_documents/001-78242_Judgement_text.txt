The case originated in an application (no. 43138/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Vladimir Alekseyevich Prokhorov (“the applicant”), on 2 March 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Bychkovskiy from Miusinsk. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Yu. Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights.
On 8 November 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Krasnyy Luch, the Lugansk region.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 3 December 1999 and 6 February 2002 the Krasnyy Luch Court (Краснолуцький міський суд Луганської області) awarded the applicant UAH 1,380.34 and UAH 397.35 respectively in salary arrears and other payments against his former employer, the State Open Joint Stock Company “Krasnolutska Avtobaza” (ДВАТ “Краснолуцька автобаза” ДХК „Донбасантрацит”). These judgments became final and the enforcement writs were transferred to the Krasnyy Luch Bailiffs' Service (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Краснолуцького міського управління юстиції) for enforcement.
The applicant received the debt due to him by the judgment of 3 December 1999 on 1 November 2004 and on 14 February 2005 - by the judgment of 6 February 2002.
On 14 February 2005 the Bailiffs' Service explained to the applicant that the delays in the enforcement of the judgments in his favour had been caused by the debtor's reorganization, the holding of its assets in a tax lien and the statutory moratorium on the forced sale of State property.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, §§ 17-22, 26 April 2005).
In their observations, the Government contended that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
The applicant disagreed.
The Court recalls that it has already found violations of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in a number of similar cases (see, for instance, Sokur v. Ukraine, cited above, §§ 36-37 and Sharenok v. , no. 35087/02, §§ 37-38, 22 February 2005).
There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
Article 41 of the Convention provides:
“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”
The Government raised no objections against paying the aforementioned sum in the event of the Court's finding a violation.
The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.
