It has also held that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed. The combination of these principles means that while lawyers are entitled to comment in public on the administration of justice, their criticism must not overstep certain bounds. In that connection, account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved, which include the public\u2019s right to receive information about questions arising from judicial decisions, the requirements of the proper administration of justice and the dignity of the legal profession (see Sch\u00f6pfer v.

The criticism was directed at the prosecution strategy which, in the applicant\u2019s view, constituted \u201crole manipulation ... breaching his official duties\u201d. Although some of the terms were inappropriate, her criticism was strictly limited to T.\u2019s performance as the prosecutor in the case against the applicant\u2019s client, as distinct from criticism focusing on T.\u2019s general professional or other qualities. In that procedural context, the Court considered that T. had to tolerate very considerable criticism by the applicant in her capacity as defence counsel. (\u00a7\u00a051). It noted that the applicant\u2019s submissions were confined to the courtroom, as opposed to criticism of a judge or a prosecutor voiced in, for instance, the media, and that the applicant\u2019s criticism of the prosecutor, being of a procedural character, could not amount to a personal insult (\u00a7\u00a052).",
