The court held that Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 applied not only to the confiscation proceedings up to the making of the confiscation order, but also to any subsequent proceedings to enforce the order by the issue of a warrant of commitment to prison; such proceedings were part and parcel of the confiscation proceedings, which in turn were part and parcel of the original criminal proceedings. It rejected the argument that, because the defendant was under a continuing duty to satisfy the confiscation order, he or she had no right to have the enforcement proceedings completed within a reasonable time, and held that the reasonable time guarantee, together with all the other Article 6 \u00a7 1 rights, applied to all aspects of confiscation proceedings.

Thereafter, however, a period of four years, three months of almost total inactivity elapsed until Customs took any effective steps to enforce the order, by requesting a warrant for the applicant to be questioned about his financial circumstances. The Court agrees with the assessment of Mr\u00a0Justice\u00a0Sedley, that Customs' inertia during this time \u201cwas both inexcusable and, given that somebody's liberty was involved, unconscionable\u201d (see paragraph 19 above).",
