The reason for the vote cast is that I hold two and half months in detention pending trial (\u00a7 33 of the judgment), without proper justification provided by the domestic courts, quite sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

The applicant was subject to deprivation of liberty on two different but consecutive occasions: an initial period from 2 May to 20\u00a0July 2007, under a pretrial detention order, and a second period from 21\u00a0July 2007 to 12 March 2008, under house arrest. It should be noted that the applicant himself asked the Moldovan courts to place him under house arrest and, logically enough, the applicant did not therefore appeal against the house arrest order at any time. This fact raises a question as to whether the applicant actually exhausted the available remedies as required by Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, given that he failed to appeal against the order for house arrest that he himself had asked the Moldovan courts to impose. In any event, the total time in which he was in custody from 2\u00a0May 2007 to 12 March 2008 does not represent, in view of the circumstances of the present case, a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. When imposing the pre-trial custodial measures, the Moldovan courts clearly stated the reasons for them, which were neither unreasonable nor disproportionate, and which were based on their appreciation of the circumstances of the case and the state of the proceedings on each date. In that regard, the grounds for imposing the preventive measures included, inter alia, the risk of the applicant\u2019s collusion with other defendants who were not in custody at that time (5 May 2007), the fact that relevant documents had yet to be seized (22 May 2007) and the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding to the \u201cMoldovan Republic of Transdniestria\u201d (29\u00a0June 2007). The fact that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was changed to house arrest (at the applicant\u2019s request, and unchallenged by him) suffices to demonstrate that the preventive measures ordered by the courts were not the result of stereotyped or mechanical reasoning, but rather were made in response to the applicant\u2019s changing circumstances. In consequence, I do not believe that this Court should substitute its appreciation of those circumstances and the need to adopt preventive measures for the appreciation carried out by domestic courts, which had direct knowledge of the specific aspects of the case.",

On the contrary, he himself asked to be placed under house arrest and never appealed to the authorities of the Republic of Moldova against that measure. To my mind, it is clear that this should have led the Court to declare the part of the application concerning the applicant\u2019s house arrest inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies.",

They referred to, and substantiated, the risk of interference with the course of justice. This risk indisputably existed, as the authorities demonstrated, first of all on account of the relationship between the applicant and his sons (the decision of May 2007), who were about to be charged in the same case as the applicant (although at the time they had yet to be charged), and then in relation to the applicant\u2019s subordinates (June 2007). The national authorities provided factual and legal explanations as to how the applicant, a company manager and former politician implicated in corruption offences, could have influenced witnesses, and more broadly, the investigation of a highly complex offence of fraud. Moreover, the final case file ran to more than 100 volumes, indicating the complexity of the offence.",
