There was no reason for the applicant to believe that all ensuing procedures would not be finalised. The Government did not dispute the applicant\u2019s allegation that the property had never been entered in the land register and admitted that the applicant had been unable to take possession of it. They argued, however, that her property rights had not been violated as she could dispose of the plot as she wished. In any event, the municipal authorities had acted with due diligence and expedience \u2013 procedures for the property\u2019s registration in the land register and striking it out of the municipal property register had started shortly after the judgment of 1997. The delay in the registration had been due to technical errors in the 1995 plan and the fact that the applicant had not returned the compensation which her father had received in 1956 for the expropriated property (see paragraph 6 above). Furthermore, it was normal that the authorities needed time to enter the applicant\u2019s property in the relevant registers and maps, given that the events dated back forty years and that the cadastral and zone planning maps had been changed during that period.",

The municipality was under an obligation to register the property with the boundaries stipulated in the 1997 judgment. Instead of doing so in good time, it had initiated a procedure for an amendment to the land register only in 2004, seven years after the restitution of the property to the applicant. Despite these amendments, the property remained unregistered until today. Even assuming that following the 2004 amendments, the property was entered in the land register, there was a delay of seven years between this entry and the restoration, which could not be justified. Thus, although the applicant\u2019s ownership of the property had not been challenged by the municipality, the refusal to register the property in the land register infringed her rights under Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 because without this registration she could not obtain an upto-date plan of the property, which was necessary for the sale of the property or for the undertaking of any construction work on it.",

The Court, therefore, does not find it established that in the present case it was open to the applicant to seek and receive compensation for loss of rent in proceedings before the domestic courts. On the other hand, the Court is unable to speculate as to whether the applicant would have rented out the property and received rent for it during the whole period between 1997 and 2009 or, for example, would have preferred to use it for her own needs, sell it or not use it at all. It also takes into account that the rent calculation concerned the renting out of the whole property, while the applicant owns only part of it and therefore, would be entitled to the receipt of only part of the rent. Furthermore, the Court notes that even if the applicant had rented out the property, she would have probably incurred expenses for its maintenance and taxation, as any revenue from rent would also have been subject to taxation (see Popov v.
