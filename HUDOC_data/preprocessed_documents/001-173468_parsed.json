It also accepts the Government\u2019s submission that the decision of the Ocnita District Court of 26 May 2006 constituted a \u201cconviction\u201d for the purposes of the same sub-paragraph. At the same time, the Court notes that the proceedings as a result of which the applicant was placed in detention were not directly related to the proceedings concerning his breach of the traffic code but were new and entirely separate proceedings. In other words, the detention imposed on him by the Ocnita District Court on 26\u00a0May 2006 was not for speeding on a public road but for failing to pay an administrative fine in bad faith, conduct reprimanded under Article 26\u00a0(5) of the Code of Administrative Offences, a provision which is of general application to all failures to pay administrative fines. As a matter of fact, the Court considers, in the light of the above findings, that the proceedings ending with the decision of 26 May 2006 constituted a new set of criminal proceedings against the applicant, distinct from that concerning his breach of the traffic code.",

In the first place, there is no indication in the material of the case file and/or in the text of the Ocnita District Court\u2019s decision of 26 May 2006 that the applicant was even informed about the proceedings, let alone summoned to the hearing. He therefore had no chance to defend himself in any way. Moreover, the court\u2019s decision itself indicates that the procedure was treated as a simple formality, without any assessment of the specific circumstances of the case. In this connection, it is relevant to note that the judge merely filled in by hand a pre-existing template, as though it were of little importance. Nevertheless, the stakes for the applicant were significant. Moreover, when examining the applicant\u2019s appeal against that decision, the Court of Appeal dismissed it without even mentioning his argument that he had not been informed about the proceedings and had not been summoned to the hearing.",
