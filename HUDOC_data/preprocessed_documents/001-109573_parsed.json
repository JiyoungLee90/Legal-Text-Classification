The Court also observes that the applicant worked as a university professor and her salary was her source of subsistence.

As regards the applicant\u2019s conduct, the Court notes that she contributed to the length of the proceedings by failing to attend some of the hearings, requesting adjournments and lodging appeals and procedural requests. However, the Court is of the opinion that primarily responsibility for protraction of the proceedings rests with the domestic courts. In particular, it observes that the proceedings were prolonged by two remittals for which the applicant cannot be held responsible. The Court also notes that the courts were responsible for the adjournment of a number of hearings (see paragraph 12 above).",
