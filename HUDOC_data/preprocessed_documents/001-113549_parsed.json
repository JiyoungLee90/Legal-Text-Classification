Just as in Moskal (\u00a7 72) the majority concludes that the authorities, having discovered their mistake, failed in their duty to act in good time and in an appropriate and consistent manner, referring also to the principle of good governance (see \u00a7\u00a080 of the judgement).",

This, in our opinion, shows that the mistake was rather limited in time and space. While a common definition of the concept of good governance is not easy to find at European level, it seems to us that this principle, as well as appropriateness and consistency, would require the EWK policy to be applied in the same way throughout the territory of Poland, and that persons and families fulfilling the legal conditions for obtaining a pension should be granted one. This is all the more true when regard is had to the normally limited resources governments have at their disposal as far as social care is concerned and to the interests of other individuals, especially children in need of care and their parents who have to take care of them. In this regard we reiterate the concerns expressed in paragraphs 4 and 6 of the joint partly dissenting opinion in the Moskal case.",
