Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention on remand without a judicial decision would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 142).",
