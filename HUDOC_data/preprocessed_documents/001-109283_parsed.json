It went on to say that outlet channels and the river channel itself were abundantly overgrown with small trees and bushes, cluttered with debris and household waste and blocked by unlawfully built dams and various structures which all created a threat of flooding over an area of 15 square kilometres, with a population of over 5,000 people, in the event of the urgent release of a large quantity of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The decision called on the Vladivostok Administration, along with the Administration of the Sovetskiy District, to take measures to clean up and deepen the channel of the Pionerskaya river to ensure that its throughput capacity (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c) was no less than 30-40 cubic metres per second. The decision also ordered that the local population be apprised via the media of the possibility of the inundation of the floodplain adjacent to the Pionerskaya river in the event of urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the reservoir, and that the authority in charge of the Pionerskoye reservoir \u2013 the Water Company \u2013 restore the local early warning system to raise the alarm if there was a risk of a flood.",

The letter went on to say that, in accordance with the decision of the Vladivostok Emergency Commission dated 6 September 1999, it was necessary for the Administration of the Sovetskiy District to take urgent steps to clean up the Pionerskaya river channel.",

The report also noted that owners of private houses on the river banks had narrowed the channel by piling earth into the river in an attempt to enlarge the size of their plots of land. Moreover, earth was regularly excavated and removed from the river banks, with the result that the banks crumbled and were washed away.

At the same time, according to an expert report of 24 January 2003 (see paragraphs 72-80 below), the main reason for the flood of 7 August 2001 had been the poor state of the channel of the Pionerskaya river, and in particular the fact that it had been overgrown with trees and bushes and obstructed by various structures. On 24 January 2003 the investigating authorities accordingly ordered that separate criminal proceedings be brought under Article 286 (1) of the Russian Criminal Code (abuse of power) against officials of the Vladivostok municipal and the Primorskiy regional authorities in that connection.",

The court further examined an evaluation report drawn up in the fourth applicant\u2019s presence by a competent State authority (see paragraph 81 above). The court noted that the report was signed by the fourth applicant, who had never disputed the amount of the damage indicated therein. Moreover, she confirmed to the court that as a civil claimant in the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the incident of 7 August 2001, she had claimed the same amount. The court therefore granted the fourth applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damage in the amount reflected in the evaluation report and found the remainder of that claim, as well as the third applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damage, unsubstantiated, given in particular the fact that the third applicant lived in the fourth applicant\u2019s flat, and all the damaged possessions in the flat had already been listed and the resulting damage assessed in the aforementioned evaluation report.",

In particular, with reference to the relevant expert reports (see paragraphs\u00a071\u00a080 above), the Government argued that it had been impossible to avoid the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir, and that the rate of the release of water from the reservoir on 7 August 2001 had been close to optimal. If the Pionerskoye reservoir had not existed, on the date in question the rain flooding to the mouth of the Pionerskaya river would have reached a maximum volume of 440 cubic metres per second. The Government also contended that prior to the heavy rain on 7 August 2001 the Pionerskoye reservoir had had sufficient water storage capacity to hold the rainwater if the amount that fell had corresponded to the amount forecast, and therefore before 7 August 2001 there had been no need to evacuate water in smaller quantities over a longer period in an attempt to avoid the flood. Indeed, as pointed out by the Government, the Pionerskoye reservoir, which supplied drinking water to the city of , was usually only refilled over a limited period during the rainy season.",

Indeed, it is clear from the adduced materials that in the years preceding the flood, the authorities knew that it might be necessary urgently to release water from the reservoir. In particular, in his letter of 7 June 1999 the head of the Water Company informed the Vladivostok Administration that it might be necessary to evacuate water urgently from the reservoir in the event of heavy rain (see paragraph 15 above); and in a letter of 29 May 2000 the Vladivostok Administration admitted that the water level in the reservoir was close to critical and some of it would have to be evacuated (see paragraph 19 above).

The decision attested to the poor condition of the river channel, confirming, in particular, that the river channel as well as its outlet channels were abundantly overgrown with vegetation, cluttered with debris and household waste, and blocked by unauthorised dams and other structures which created a threat of flooding over an area of 15 square kilometres, with a population of over 5,000 people, in the event of the urgent large-scale release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The decision urged the authorities at the municipal and district levels to take the necessary measures, including cleaning and deepening the river channel to ensure that its throughput capacity was no less than 30-40 cubic metres per second. It was also prescribed that the local population be duly informed that the floodplain of the Pionerskaya river might be inundated in the event of the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir.

As a result, separate criminal proceedings were ordered against officials from the  municipal and Primorskiy regional authorities, presumably in that connection.",

Conversely, an individual may have a property right in a particular building or land, within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, without having sufficient ties with it for it to constitute a home under Article 8 (see Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a066, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996VI). In the present case, the applicants\u2019 complaints concerned damage done by the flood to their homes \u2013 of which the first, fourth and fifth applicants were owners and the second and sixth applicants were social tenants, and which the third applicant shared with the fourth applicant, her relative (see paragraphs 10-14 above) \u2013 and to their possessions in and around those homes. The Court considers it appropriate to examine the applicants\u2019 relevant complaints under both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that an applicant is deprived of his or her status as a victim if the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for, a breach of the Convention (see, for example, Scordino v.\u00a0Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 178-93, ECHR 2006V).",

Moreover, no such acknowledgement was made in the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the events of 7 August 2001, or in the civil proceedings which the applicants brought seeking compensation for their pecuniary losses. Also, even if the Court were prepared to regard the compensation in the amount of RUB 14,000 paid to the first applicant as an appropriate and sufficient redress, it clearly could not reach the same conclusion as regards the compensation in the amount of RUB 1,000 paid to the remaining applicants.",

The Court cannot accept this argument. It reiterates in this connection that, being sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and cautious about taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, the Court nevertheless is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and may depart from them where this is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, Matyar v. Turkey, no. 23423/94, \u00a7 108, 21 February 2002). In the present case, the Court has established in paragraphs 162-165 above that the flooding of 7\u00a0August 2001 occurred after the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir, the likelihood and potential consequences of which the authorities should have foreseen. The Court has furthermore established that the main reason for the flood, as confirmed by the expert reports, was the poor state of repair of the Pionerskaya river channel because of the authorities\u2019 manifest failure to take measures to keep it clear and in particular to make sure its throughput capacity was adequate in the event of the release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The Court has concluded that this failure as well as the authorities\u2019 failure to apply town planning restrictions corresponding to the technical requirements of the exploitation of the reservoir put the lives of those living near it at risk (see paragraphs 168-180 and 185 above).",

Similarly, the resulting infringement amounts not to \u201cinterference\u201d but to the breach of a positive obligation, since the State officials and authorities failed to do everything in their power to protect the applicants\u2019 rights secured by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7 135). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article\u00a08 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 required the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7 136).

The resulting reports, and in particular those of 29 September 2002 and 24 January 2003, seem to have provided a rather detailed account of the flood of 7 August 2001, including its main cause and its scale and destructive effects. The domestic courts therefore had at their disposal the necessary materials to be able, in principle, in the civil proceedings to address the issue of the State\u2019s liability on the basis of the facts as established in the criminal proceedings, irrespective of the outcome of the latter proceedings (see, by contrast, Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 162-63).

[GC], no.\u00a023657/94, \u00a7\u00a0127, ECHR 1999IV). In the present case, the Court has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the authorities\u2019 failure to take measures to protect the applicants\u2019 property. It has no doubt that there is a direct link between that violation and the pecuniary losses alleged by the applicants.",

The Court cannot, however, regard this document as proof that the damage sustained actually amounted to the sum indicated therein, as it is clear that the transcript was only a formal record of the first applicant\u2019s submissions, not a document confirming their accuracy. On the other hand, the Court takes note of the estimate indicating that the cost of repair work on the first applicant\u2019s house would amount to RUB 63,114.97 (approximately EUR 1,500). It therefore awards the first applicant EUR 1,500 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",

The Court further considers it unnecessary to assess the relevance and reliability of the documentary evidence submitted by the fourth applicant to corroborate her claim for pecuniary damage, and to address the Government\u2019s arguments in this respect (see paragraph 254 above). It notes that an evaluation report drawn up by a competent State authority, as referred to by the Sovetskiy District Court of Vladivostok in its judgment of 25 February 2003, attested that the damage done to the possessions in the flat where the third and fourth applicants lived amounted to RUB 486,000 (approximately EUR 11,500). It further notes that the said court accepted that document as reliable proof of the actual damage sustained, and the Court has no reason to question that court\u2019s reasoning (see paragraph 108 above). It therefore awards EUR 11,500 to the third and fourth applicants jointly in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",

The Court agrees with the Government that it cannot take into account the certificate submitted by the fifth applicant to substantiate his claim for the inflation-adjusted amount of the pecuniary damage he sustained, as the document in question refers to the price index in a region other than the one where the fifth applicant lives. Accordingly, the Court awards the fifth applicant EUR 4,700 under this head, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",

In particular, it is unclear whether the second applicant ever attempted, like the fourth and fifth applicants, for example, to have the alleged pecuniary losses duly assessed, and whether there are any documents at all which could confirm her claim. The sixth applicant, on the other hand, alleged that such documents could be found in the materials of her civil case examined by the national courts; however, she failed to explain why she did not submit those documents to the Court. Against this background, the Court considers that there is no call to make any award to the second and sixth applicants under this head.",
