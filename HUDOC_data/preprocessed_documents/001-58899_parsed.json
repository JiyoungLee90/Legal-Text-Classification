Secondly, even assuming that legal aid could be sought to enable them to challenge the deportation order by way of judicial review, there were never notified of this facility. In any event, since they lacked a valid residence permit they could not obtain a certificate of indigence from the competent authority. Thirdly, they maintained that an application for judicial review would not have had any suspensive effect on the implementation of the deportation order and the administrative court seized of their application would not have been competent to review the substance of their complaint, only the legality of the decision to deport them. For that reason a judicial review action would have afforded no reasonable prospects of success since the impugned measure was clearly valid under domestic asylum regulations and the UNHCR had already reached a negative decision on their application for refugee status. Fourthly, any review undertaken by an administrative court would not have taken as its point of departure the question as to whether the applicants would be exposed to treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. The review would have been based on whether or not their expulsion would offend the criteria contained in Article 1 of the 1951 Geneva Convention.",

This obligation results from Article 13 of the Convention, the effect of which is to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see the Vilvarajah and Others judgment cited above, p. 39, \u00a7\u00a0122).

Although the applicants have contended that they had already provided the UNHCR and the domestic authorities with sufficient proof of the risk which they faced (see paragraph 27 above), the Court is not persuaded that, in the absence of information about the new developments which occurred, the domestic authorities can be accused of having underestimated the risk by imposing a deportation order on the applicants and then rejecting their appeal against it.
