The continuous nature of his detention, his identical descriptions of the general conditions of detention in all the cells in the detention facility and the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of his detention conditions in all cells in which he was held warrant the examination of the applicant\u2019s detention as a whole, without dividing it into separate periods (see, for similar reasoning, Guliyev v.

Although mere doubts as to the prospects of success of national remedies do not absolve an applicant from the obligation to exhaust those remedies, in a situation where he had repeatedly and unsuccessfully used a remedy, his failure to have further recourse to it on assumption that it would offer little if any prospects of success cannot be said to have been unreasonable. The Court notes that in his appeal submissions against the extension order of 2\u00a0October 2006 the applicant argued that the risk of interference with the proceedings no longer existed, as all the witnesses for the prosecution had already been questioned by the trial court and the prosecution had finished submitting their evidence (see paragraph 31 above). Nothing in the case file indicates that the applicant\u2019s circumstances materially changed after the Supreme Court dismissed that appeal on 28 December 2006, or that any new factors emerged subsequently that could have altered the position of the Supreme Court. The Court finds that, having regard to the practical realities of the applicant\u2019s position, it could not be said that an appeal to the Supreme Court against the subsequent extension orders, which were based on the same reasons as the extension order of 2\u00a0October 2006, had any reasonable prospects of success.",

The courts assumed that the gravity of the charge carried such a preponderant weight that no other circumstances could have obtained the applicant\u2019s release. The Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk that an accused might abscond or reoffend, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v.

The Court accepts that in cases concerning organised crime the risk that a detainee if released might put pressure on witnesses or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings is often particularly high. These factors can justify a relatively longer period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4\u00a0May 2006). Taking into account that the applicant was suspected of being an active member of an organised criminal group, the Court accepts that the authorities could justifiably consider that the risk of pressure on witnesses and jurors was initially present. However, the Court is not persuaded that that ground could in itself justify the entire six-year period of the applicant\u2019s detention. Indeed, the domestic courts referred to the risk of hampering the proceedings in a summary fashion without pointing to any aspect of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour in support of their conclusion that he was likely to resort to intimidation. In the Court\u2019s view, such a generally formulated risk may not serve as justification for the applicant\u2019s detention for a period of more than six years. The domestic courts failed to consider the fact that that ground inevitably became less and less relevant with the passage of time. The courts\u2019 reasoning did not evolve to reflect the developing situation or to verify whether at the advanced stage of the proceedings that ground retained its sufficiency. The Court is not therefore convinced that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for a fear that he would interfere with witnesses or jurors or otherwise hamper the examination of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

This means that the competent court has to examine \u201cnot only compliance with the procedural requirements set out in domestic law but also the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention\u201d. A court examining the lawfulness of detention must provide guarantees of a judicial procedure. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the parties, the prosecutor and the detained person. Equality of arms is not ensured if counsel is denied access to those documents in the investigation file which are essential in order effectively to challenge the lawfulness of his client\u2019s detention (see Nikolova v.
