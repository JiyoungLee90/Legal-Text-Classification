It was plain from the course of the argument that the ex parte application had not dealt with any telephone intercept, since the Crown argued that this was the province solely of the prosecutor, and not that of the judge, a proposition based on R. v. Preston [see paragraph 34 below].\t\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In these circumstances the defence were entitled to know at least the category of material with which that application did not deal. ...

Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants' names and roles, alleging that those details are essential to the defence. Defences that the accused has been set up, and allegations of duress, which used at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary ... \n\u00a0\u00a0It is sufficient for us to say that in this case we are satisfied that the information concerning the informant showed a participation in the events concerning this crime which, coupled with the way in which the defence was raised from the very first moment by the defendant when he said that he was being set up, gave rise to the need for the defence to be aware of the identity of the informant and his role in this matter. We, therefore, conclude that if one applies the principle which has been quoted from R. v. Keane ... to the facts of the present case, there could only be one answer to the question as to whether the details concerning this informer were so important to the issues of interest to the defence, present and potential, that the balance which the judge had to strike came down firmly in favour of disclosure.\u201d",

The basis for the House of Lords' decision was that the purpose for which such an interception might be permitted was narrowly defined in section 2 of the 1985 Act; in particular, the purpose of \u201cpreventing and detecting serious crime\u201d did not extend to amassing evidence with a view to prosecuting offenders. One of the consequences of this construction was that, in a case of interception authorised for \u201cpreventing and detecting serious crime\u201d, section 6 of the Act would normally require the destruction of intercepted material at a stage well before the prosecution's duty to disclose relevant material could arise in criminal proceedings. Accordingly, if the Act were to operate, as Parliament had intended, to restrict retention and dissemination of intercepted material to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of \u201cpreventing and detecting serious crime\u201d, there was likely to be no intercepted material to disclose to the defence and its destruction could not be said to amount to a material irregularity.",

Any such restriction on the rights of the defence should, however, be strictly proportionate and counterbalanced by procedural safeguards adequate to compensate for the handicap imposed on the defence.

These examples, he submitted, demonstrated that an alternative mechanism was available which would ensure that the rights of the defence were respected as far as possible in the course of a hearing to determine whether evidence should be withheld on public interest grounds, whilst safeguarding legitimate concerns about, for example, national security or the protection of witnesses and sources of information, and he reasoned that the onus was on the Government to show why it would not be possible to introduce such a procedure.",

Moreover, the proposed scheme \nwould give rise to significant difficulties in practice, for example, with regard to the duties which would be owed by the special counsel to the accused, the amount of information he or she would be at liberty to pass on to the accused and the defence lawyers and the quality of instructions he or she could expect to receive from the defence. Such difficulties would be particularly acute in cases involving more than one co-accused, where it would be necessary to appoint a special counsel in respect of each defendant to avoid the risk of conflict of interest, and in respect of long trials, with constantly evolving disclosure issues.

In this way, the Act sought both to achieve a proper balance between the individual's right to privacy under Article 8 of the Convention and the need to use secret surveillance, and to ensure that measures and methods of surveillance were kept secret.

It did not consider that the non-disclosure of intercepted material rendered the proceedings unfair, since it was not established that there was any such material, since the principle of equality of arms was respected because neither side could adduce interception evidence (see paragraph 33 above), and since the applicant could have given evidence as to the fact and content of the telephone calls which he alleged took place, but chose not to.",

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see the Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, \u00a7 58).

In any event, in many cases, such as the present, where the evidence in question has never been revealed, it would not be possible for the Court to attempt to weigh the public interest in non-disclosure against that of the accused in having sight of the material.

It has not been suggested that the judge was not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. He was fully versed in all the evidence and issues in the case and in a position to monitor the relevance to the defence of the withheld information both before and during the trial. Moreover it can be assumed \u2013 not least because the Court of Appeal confirmed that the transcript of the ex parte hearing showed that he had been \u201cvery careful to ensure and to explore whether the material was relevant, or likely to be relevant to the defence which had been indicated to him\u201d - that the judge applied the principles which had recently been clarified by the Court of Appeal, for example that in weighing the \npublic interest in concealment against the interest of the accused in disclosure, great weight should be attached to the interests of justice, and that the judge should continue to assess the need for disclosure throughout the progress of the trial (see the Ward and Davis, Johnson and Rowe judgments in paragraphs 22 and 24-25 above). The jurisprudence of the English Court of Appeal shows that the assessment which the trial judge must make fulfils the conditions which, according to the Court's case-law, are essential for ensuring a fair trial in instances of non-disclosure of prosecution material (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). The domestic trial court in the present case thus applied standards which were in conformity with the relevant principles of a fair trial embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 1. Furthermore, during the appeal proceedings the Court of Appeal also considered whether or not the evidence should have been disclosed (see paragraphs 17-18 above), providing an additional level of protection for the applicant's rights.",

In stating this, we do not suggest in any way that the judge in the present case was not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, or that he was not fully versed in the evidence and issues in the case as mentioned in paragraph 56 of the judgment.

The ex post facto discovery of tons of cannabis cannot justify the previous breach of the fundamental human right to be left alone.

He showed that in two separate ways at present (and two others in the course of legislation) a \u201cspecial counsel\u201d procedure had been introduced by legislation in the United Kingdom. Special counsel's function is to assist the court in circumstances where a party may not be allowed to participate for national security or other reasons. Special counsel is to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings. The relevant legislation provides that the special counsel is not however \u201cresponsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent\u201d. This ensures that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which cannot be disclosed. The Government argued that the present arrangements in principle and in practice adequately protected the rights of the accused. In essence, they relied on the impartiality of the judge and the honour and professional integrity of the prosecution. They also raised the significant practical difficulties involved in creating such a role as special counsel in a criminal case. The problems, the Government pleaded, involved questions as to the duties owed by special counsel to the accused, the amount of information he or she would be at liberty to pass on to the accused and the defence lawyers and the quality of instructions he or she could expect to receive from the defence. Difficulties would be most acute, they argued, where there were more than one accused and problems also would arise where there were long trials with constantly evolving disclosure issues.",

It is, therefore, contemplated by the Government that the special counsel procedure may be used in a criminal case albeit one somewhat different from the facts of this case. The duty owed by special counsel to the accused is one which in general terms ought to be capable of resolution by the relevant professional bodies.
