However, the Court notes that it has been its constant approach that an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by national law in the defence of his or her interests (see, for example, Kolomiyets v. Russia, no. 76835/01, \u00a7 29, 22 February 2007). As regards the second set of proceedings (application no. 56418/13) the Court observes that a significant proportion of the requests and appeals were lodged by the applicant while the case was pending before the first-instance court.

In application no. 56418/13 the Court does not detect any obvious delays on the part of the courts in replying to the parties\u2019 different requests and appeals. However, explanation was not provided on why the Porto Court allowed the proceedings to extend for almost twenty years. In this connection, the Court reiterates that it has stated on many occasions that Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on the Contracting States a duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of the requirements of that provision, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, S\u00fc\u00dfmann v.\u00a0Germany, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV; Bottazzi v. Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, \u00a7 22 , ECHR 1999V; and Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 183, ECHR 2006V). As regards application no. 8349/13, three remittals and one remittal as regards application no. 56418/13, are to be viewed as an indication of deficiencies in the proceedings for which the applicant bears no responsibility; (see, mutatis mutandis, Wierciszewska v. Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003). In this regard, the Court recalls that the remittal of the case for reexamination usually refers to errors committed by lower courts. As such, when the overall length of the proceedings is caused by such reasons, it should be, in the Court\u2019s view, imputable to the authorities and not to the applicants (compare Wierciszewska v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 46).",
