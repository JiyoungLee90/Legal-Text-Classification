The experts advised that the child should receive psychological and social counselling to help her overcome her resistance towards her mother, that the father and his family should be helped to change their attitude and stop influencing the child\u2019s opinion towards her mother, and that both parents should receive counselling on how to behave in the best interests of the child.",
