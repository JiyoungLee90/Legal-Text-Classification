The objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies could not therefore be raised in such cases, and the Court found a violation of Article 13 each time such a complaint was raised in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see as the most recent example involving civil proceedings Rooney v. Ireland, no. 32614/10, 31 October 2013). More recently again, the Court struck out an application in light of the respondent Government\u2019s acceptance, in a unilateral declaration dated 19 January 2017, that \u201cthe length of the proceedings and the lack of an effective remedy in that regard was incompatible with the reasonable time requirement contained in Article 6(1) and Article 13 of the Convention\u201d (see Blehein v. Ireland (dec.) [Committee], no. 14704/16, 25 April 2017). It therefore takes note with interest of this first example brought to its attention of an action in damages for excessive length of proceedings, and of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of this issue in light of the relevant principles of the Constitution and the Convention.",

This refers in particular to the enactment of new legislation by States to remedy the systemic problem of length of judicial proceedings (see the cases referred to in Valada Matos das Neves, cited above, at \u00a7 102). Where the change in domestic law comes about through case-law, the Court\u2019s approach has been, for reasons of fairness, to allow a certain time for applicants to familiarise themselves with the new jurisprudence, the exact period depending on the circumstances of each case, especially the publicity given to the decision in question (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 104-105). Periods ranging from one and a half months (see Poulain v. France (dec.), no. 16470/15, \u00a7 29, 21 March 2017) to eight months (see Leandro Da Silva v. Luxembourg, no. 30273/07, \u00a7 50, 11 February 2010) have been allowed. It follows that even were the Court to modify its assessment of the domestic system in this regard, this would not have any bearing on its conclusion on the complaint raised in the present case. Accordingly, the Court will refrain on this occasion from determining the significance of the Nash decision for the purposes of Articles 35 \u00a7 1 and 13.\u201d",
