He told the prosecutor that he used to live in Istanbul but after losing his job he had moved back to his home town of Hozat. His deceased cousin B\u00fclent Karata\u015f, who had been a bee-keeper, had told him that he had seen a bee colony in a field and asked him to accompany him there to collect it. On the morning of 27\u00a0September 2007 they had left on the motorbike and the horse and had put a chainsaw in the sidecar of the motorbike. After their arrival they had left the road, collected the bee colony from a tree and taken it on horseback to the motorbike at around 11 a.m. At that moment a group of eight or nine soldiers had appeared and asked them what they were doing. They had shown the soldiers their identity cards and told them that they were in the area looking for bees. The soldiers had told them to leave, as they were in a \u201cterrorist area\u201d. B\u00fclent had told the soldiers that they would finish their job and then leave. The soldiers had then left and gone into the forest but approximately twenty minutes later they had returned and asked to see their identity cards again, before asking them to take off their jumpers. He and B\u00fclent had then walked away approximately ten metres and taken their jumpers off. On the orders of the soldiers they had then lain on the ground. The officer in charge of the soldiers had walked towards them and told them to get up and run away. Immediately after he had stood up and started running he had heard a rifle being cocked. Two rounds of shots had then been fired in his direction, followed by a few more rounds of fire. B\u00fclent had at that time been running in another direction. The tenth applicant added that he had rolled down the hill which was next to the road. He had been shot in his chest and arm. Within minutes the soldiers had encircled him and he had started begging the soldiers not to kill him. One of the soldiers had then radioed his commander and said that he did not want to kill him. The commander had then replied, over the radio, \u201cgive him first aid and take him to hospital\u201d. He had then been taken to the hospital in Elaz\u0131\u011f.",

In the petitions the legal representative stated that, after checking their identity cards, the soldiers had allowed the tenth applicant and B\u00fclent Karata\u015f to go down to the river bed to collect their belongings and come back up again. After they had come back their identity cards had been checked once again and they had been ordered to take their clothes off. At that moment B\u00fclent Karata\u015f had been taken to a different location by the soldiers and the tenth applicant had been ordered to kneel down. When he refused to do so the soldiers had hit him with the butts of their rifles and he had therefore rolled down the hill. While doing so, the officer in charge of the soldiers had opened fire at him. The officer had then provided first aid to him and arranged for him to be taken to hospital by helicopter. The legal representative also stated that no weapons allegedly belonging to the tenth applicant or B\u00fclent Karata\u015f had been found, that the former had been shot at close range, and that clothing which would have shown the distance from which he had been shot was missing.",

They also complained that the military prosecutor had failed to conduct a visit to the scene with them in attendance, had not given the tenth applicant the opportunity to identify the soldiers in person, and their effective participation in the investigation had not been ensured as a result of the previous investigating prosecutor\u2019s decision to have the file classified as confidential (see paragraph 26 above). They also repeated their argument that a prosecutor\u2019s duty was to preserve the evidence and not to destroy it; and yet the investigating prosecutor had ordered the destruction of the food supplies found in the pit (see paragraph 11 above), only to rely on them later as evidence against the tenth applicant.",

In this respect the use of the term \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d in Article 2 \u00a7 2 indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraph 2 of Articles 8-11 of the Convention. In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in the subparagraphs of the Article (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0148149, Series A no. 324).",

The only step taken in that regard was to send the eight Kalashnikov-type bullets to the forensic authorities (see paragraph\u00a028 above). The Court considers that making attempts to find those persons should have been a priority for the investigating authorities with a view to verifying the accuracy of the soldiers\u2019 version of the events according to which it was those persons\u2019 alleged actions that had led the soldiers to resort to the use of lethal force.",

The authorities\u2019 attention to the missing clothing was drawn once again on 9 November 2007 when the tenth applicant was being questioned as a suspect before the Hozat Magistrates\u2019 Court. The tenth applicant\u2019s lawyer informed the Hozat Magistrates\u2019 Court that according to the doctors who conducted the post mortem examination, forensic examinations of the men\u2019s clothing would be needed in order to establish the distance from which his client and B\u00fclent Karata\u015f had been shot (see paragraph 27 above). Nevertheless, the only action undertaken by the authorities aimed at ascertaining the whereabouts of the vests did not take place until many months after the incident and even then it was limited to the military prosecutor asking a question to a sergeant involved in the incident. As set about above (paragraph 44), the sergeant apparently told the military prosecutor that the day in question had been hot and the tenth applicant and B\u00fclent Karata\u015f had only had [sleeveless] vests on. The sergeant did not know what happened to the vests but thought that they might have been cut off the bodies to be used as tourniquets to stop their bleeding, or might have fallen off the stretchers while the two men were being transported to the helicopter, or might have been left behind in the trailer of the tractor or in the helicopter.",

The Court considers the failure to take meaningful steps to find the vests to be a serious failure, given that the vests would have been the only tangible evidence to establish the distance from which the two men had been shot.

They repeated their arguments when they lodged their objection against the military prosecutor\u2019s decision to close the investigation (see paragraph 50 above). In response, the Military Court stated that the decision to classify the investigation file as confidential two days after the incident had been a justifiable action and in accordance with the applicable procedure because there had been ongoing military operations against terrorist organisations in the area at the time and allowing access to the investigation file could have facilitated the terrorists\u2019 escape and led to destruction of the evidence (see paragraph\u00a054 above).",
