These documents, they argue, merit greater protection than, for instance, expert reports or minutes of parliamentary committees. The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Council cannot form an accurate picture of international relations unless the ambassadors provide them with additional information, different to and more sensitive than that provided by the media. Diplomats also provide information they have obtained from confidential sources, behind the scenes or off the record. They need, for instance, to be able to express in plain language their views about violations of human rights and political relations in Iran, the involvement of leading Colombian politicians in drug trafficking and the true picture with regard to the balance of power and intrigue in the Kremlin. If, despite everything, reports of this kind are published, the ambassador concerned will almost automatically be declared persona non grata in the host country. If reports of this kind were to be published on a regular basis, ambassadors would no longer be able to report on everything that was going on. That would have an adverse impact on Swiss foreign policy, perhaps even paralysing it completely. And if everything were to be made public,  might just as well recall its diplomats and replace them with the media. In exercising their function as critic and watchdog, the media must always remain mindful of their responsibilities. This applies with particular force in the sphere of foreign policy, as the reports relating to foreign policy are also read abroad.

However, Swiss foreign policy is not a reserved area. When the media bow to the wishes of the Government, we are dangerously close to the kind of artificial neutrality we had during the Second World War.

Media bosses are clearly aware of the responsibilities inherent in the media's role as critic and watchdog in this sphere. At the same time, it should not be forgotten that revelations by the media in the field of foreign policy are commonplace in other countries, particularly in the United States, but also in the United Kingdom and . Clearly, other governments and diplomats have long had to contend with this risk of revelations concerning foreign policy, and have learned to live with it. Whether they like it or not, the Swiss authorities must also learn to adjust to a situation in which foreign policy is as much the focus of media attention as domestic policy, and in which revelations may come not just from the Swiss media but also from foreign media. An approach which places confidentiality before the public interest in too rigid a manner is neither realistic nor legitimate, particularly since diplomatic reports are regularly forwarded to a large number of authorities.",

According to Haldimann, his newspaper did not publish any leaked information unless the public interest was at stake. Although there were more leaks now than previously, they were not damaging in principle, and were often the only remaining means of putting a stop to harmful conduct. The representatives of other media also recognised the fact that Mr Jagmetti's paper was of public interest, as it shed important light on the Delamuraz affair.

In the present case, so the argument runs, Ambassador Jagmetti's report was of limited public interest, since prior to publication it had been a non-event, it was already five weeks old and it could not be made public without damaging Swiss interests. In that respect, the Sonntags-Zeitung undermined Swiss foreign policy in a foreseeable and serious manner which was not justified in the public interest. According to this line of argument, the Jagmetti report should properly have been dealt with as a background document in the classic sense and should not have been published, either in full or in part.",

The paper testifies to a fundamental concern to get at the truth, to find a generous financial solution and to protect Swiss interests and the country's good relations with the . However, it could not escape the attention of even the most casual reader that Mr Jagmetti used very bellicose language and that he regarded his negotiating partners as adversaries who were not to be trusted and who might be amenable to some kind of deal. The language used betrays attitudes which are problematic even in an internal document, since attitudes are liable to be reflected also in negotiations and informal contacts.

Knowing what that ambassador thought and how he formulated his opinions was relevant, and not a trivial concern. Leaving aside the question of the public interest and the relevance of the ambassador's remarks, the publication of this supposedly confidential paper was justified from an ethical viewpoint, as only as a result of its publication did it become clear that those in charge still had no very clear idea, despite the creation of the task force, as to the question of Swiss responsibility and what steps should be taken. From the perspective of political transparency, publication of the confidential paper, despite the fact that it was more than a month old and that in the meantime there had been talk of setting up a fund for Holocaust victims, might have spurred the Government on to overcome the problems, demonstrate leadership and devise convincing solutions.",

The Sonntags-Zeitung did not make sufficiently clear that Ambassador Jagmetti had outlined several options in his strategy paper, of which the 'deal' was just one. Nor did it make the timing of the events sufficiently clear, particularly since the document was already five weeks old and had reached the addressees before the interview given by the outgoing Swiss President on the programme 24 heures/Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve. The newspaper unnecessarily made the affair appear shocking and scandalous and, by its use of the headline \u201cMr\u00a0Carlo Jagmetti insults the Jews\u201d, misled the reader and made it appear that the remarks had been made the previous day. It was incorrect to assert that Mr Jagmetti's letter undermined the process which had begun in January, particularly since the document had been circulated beforehand and had not previously been in the public domain, and could not therefore adversely affect the talks with the country's partners at home and abroad. When the Sonntags-Zeitung attempted to contact Mr\u00a0Jagmetti on Friday 24 January in order to obtain a comment, and failed to reach him because he was in Florida, the newspaper's editors should have considered whether it might not be wiser to delay publication by a week so as to be able to publish an interview with Carlo Jagmetti alongside the extracts from his paper. The fact that publication went ahead in the next issue can only have been prompted by the fear of competition, which on no account constitutes sufficient justification for immediate publication. Hence, by publishing the strategy paper in the way it did, the Sonntags-Zeitung omitted vital pieces of information, in breach of the Declaration on the rights and responsibilities of journalists (point 3 of the Declaration of responsibilities).",

In the midst of an impassioned debate concerning Switzerland's past during and after the Second World War, its policy of neutrality, its policy towards refugees, the extent of anti-Semitism, the assets and gold of Holocaust victims deposited in Swiss banks and public and private responsibility for actions and omissions past and present, the Swiss newspaper the Sonntags-Zeitung on 26 January 1997 published extracts, in an article signed by the applicant, from a confidential strategy paper by the Swiss ambassador to the United States, Carlo Jagmetti. Given that the ambassador sent the report to the Department of Foreign Affairs, to nineteen named individuals and to five other Swiss diplomatic missions, it is generally acknowledged, although not established, that it reached the press as the result of a leak. The report dealt with the strategy to be adopted by the Swiss Government in the negotiations between, among others, the World Jewish Congress and Swiss banks concerning compensation due to Holocaust victims for unclaimed assets deposited in Swiss banks. The published extracts gave an overall assessment of the situation which, although unsurprising, was couched in robust \u2013 some might even say bellicose \u2013 language. A number of the recommendations made in the report were to be acted upon subsequently. The Sonntags-Zeitung published the extracts under the headings \u201cMr Carlo Jagmetti insults the Jews\u201d, \u201cOur adversaries are not to be trusted\u201d and \u201cThe ambassador in bathrobe and climbing boots puts his foot in it again\u201d.

The Court, understandably, has always hesitated to indicate to the press how it should perform its tasks, what matters it should investigate or how far it should go in its criticism. However, this case highlights in striking fashion the growing tendency to trivialise extremely serious issues. The Swiss Press Council, which is not a Government agency but a body set up by the press to supervise press activity, criticised the Sonntags-Zeitung report for a lack of professionalism. It concluded that the newspaper had \u201c... in irresponsible fashion ...made [Mr Jagmetti's views] appear shocking and scandalous\u201d, in breach of journalistic ethics. That finding is all the more interesting given that the Press Council simultaneously approved the publication of extracts from Mr\u00a0Jagmetti's report in the Tages-Anzeiger and the Nouveau Quotidien. I agree with the Press Council's assessment. We cannot allow leaks, regardless of the subject concerned or how they are presented, to be automatically regarded as forming part of the legitimate exercise of freedom of the press and overriding all public or private interests.",

Nevertheless, I feel that the extracts of the report which were published convey only a fragmented picture of the complex and highly controversial issue of unclaimed assets. Even if full publication was impossible in this case, presenting the \u201cstrategy paper\u201d in abridged form was not capable of contributing constructively to a wellinformed public debate. Nor did the SonntagsZeitung make a useful contribution to the debate concerning the substance of the various arguments put forward in the ambassador's report.",
