The Court recalls that it has already examined the Decree\u2019s status in the domestic legal system in its recent case of Zhelyazkov v. Bulgaria (no. 11332/04, \u00a7 31, 9 October 2012), where it found that the fact that the Decree had not been adopted by the Parliament did not deprive it of its quality of \u201claw\u201d for the purposes of the Convention. The Court noted in particular that under Bulgarian law decrees adopted by the Presidium of the National Assembly under Articles\u00a035 \u00a7 5 and 36 of the 1947 Constitution were valid sources of law and had the same force as Acts of Parliament, a conclusion which has been confirmed many times by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph\u00a019 above). The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the case at hand. It notes, moreover, that the term \u201claw\u201d in Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention must be understood in its substantive sense, not its formal one (see Leyla \u015eahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 2005-XI; Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a038224/03, \u00a7 83, 14 September 2010; and Pasko v.

It failed to weigh the alleged gravity of his conduct against his right to freedom of expression and to provide specific reasons showing the necessity of imposing a penalty on the applicant. No attempt was made to account for the fact that the impugned statements were in the main aimed at contributing to a debate of public interest and that the applicant\u2019s criticism was addressed at public bodies and officials, in respect of which, as mentioned above, the limits of acceptable criticism should be wider than in respect of private citizens. The Court has on a number of occasions said that in determining whether an interference with the right to freedom of expression was justified, it has to satisfy itself, inter alia, that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (see, among other authorities, Jersild v.
