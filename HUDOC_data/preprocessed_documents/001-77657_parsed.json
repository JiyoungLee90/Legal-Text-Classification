Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which a deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0146-147). To this end, the provision has been interpreted in the Court\u2019s case-law to include disappearances, where, as time goes by without any news, it becomes increasingly likely that the individual has died (Tahsin Acar v. Turkey [GC], no. 26307/95, \u00a7 226, ECHR\u00a02004III).",

The investigation made by the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court Public Prosecutor, and subsequently by the Diyarbak\u0131r Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s office, did not go beyond checking the police custody and customs\u2019 records to verify whether Hakk\u0131 Kaya had been detained or had left . The Court observes that the Public Prosecutors took no steps on their own initiative to identify possible witnesses. No attempt was made to obtain evidence in the area where Hakk\u0131 Kaya had been abducted, despite the fact that Ahmet Ya\u015far, who was an eye-witness to the event, gave precise details about the abduction. It also appears from the case file that the Prosecutors did not take statements from the police officers who were on duty on the date of the incident. Nor did they attempt to identify or contact the other eye-witness to the incident, \u201cMehmet\u201d (paragraph 9 above). Furthermore, subsequent to the interview published in the \u00dclkede \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem newspaper, the Public Prosecutor initiated a search to locate Mr Abd\u00fclkadir Aygan, who had alleged that JITEM was implicated in the killing of Hakk\u0131 Kaya (paragraphs 19 and 20\u00a0above). It is however observed that the search was unsuccessful and therefore, the evidence of Mr Aygan, who was a very important witness for the pending investigation, could not be taken.",
