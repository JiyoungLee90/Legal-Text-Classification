The applicant's complaints to the domestic authorities in this regard were based on the same evidence and were therefore \u201carguable\u201d for the purposes of Article\u00a013 (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27\u00a0April\u00a01988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, \u00a7\u00a052). The authorities thus had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into his allegations against the police officers. For the reasons set out above no effective criminal investigation can be considered to have been carried out in accordance with Article 13, the requirements of which are broader than the obligation to investigate imposed by Article 3 (see\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Buldan v. , no. 28298/95, \u00a7 105, 20\u00a0April\u00a02004; Tanr\u0131kulu v.

Consequently, any other remedy available to the applicant, including a claim for damages, had limited chances of success and could be considered as theoretical and illusory, and not capable of affording redress to the applicant. While the civil courts have the capacity to make an independent assessment of fact, in practice the weight attached to a preceding criminal inquiry is so important that even the most convincing evidence to the contrary furnished by a plaintiff would often be discarded and such a remedy would prove to be only theoretical and illusory (see Menesheva v. Russia, no. 59261/00, \u00a7 77, 9 March 2006, and Corsacov v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 18944/02, \u00a7 82, 4 April 2006). This is illustrated by the fact that among the numerous examples of domestic case-law submitted by the Government, some dating back to the 1970s, there has not even been one case showing that a civil court would not consider itself bound by a decision of the prosecuting authorities finding that the State agents had not committed ill-treatment.",
