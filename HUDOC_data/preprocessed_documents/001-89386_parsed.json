In all these cases the main basis for such a decision was that the right to obtain release and the right to obtain compensation for a deprivation of liberty in breach of Article 5 are two separate rights, enshrined respectively in paragraphs 4 and 5 of that Article, and this distinction is also relevant for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1. This line of reasoning is of particular importance where the person concerned is still in custody.

On the next day, 26 October 2000, the applicant was set free (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Later he was acquitted of some of the charges against him, which means that he fell within the ambit of point 11 of the 2004 interpretative decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 21, 23 and 29 above). The Court further observes that the gravamen of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 was that his detention between 17 July and 26 October 2000 had no legal basis in Bulgarian law (see paragraph 32 above). It finally notes that a claim under section 2(1) or (2) of the SRDA would have required the national courts to review the legality of the applicant\u2019s detention and to award compensation for any damage suffered, in case they found that this detention had not been lawful (see paragraphs 26, 27 and 28 above). In the Court\u2019s view, these elements are sufficient to show that a claim under section 2 of the SRDA would have, in all probability, been an effective remedy in respect of the applicant\u2019s grievance under Article 5 \u00a7 1. However, although in his initial application to the Court he said that he contemplated bringing such a claim, there is no information in the case file that he actually did so.",

It has also found that the caselaw of the Bulgarian courts in relation to claims for damages under section 2 of the SRDA premised on breaches of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention was not clear and settled (see Kolev, \u00a7 73; and Kolevi, both cited above). The Court is not aware of \u2013 and the Government have not pointed to \u2013 any fresh developments which may alter these findings. The 2004 interpretative decision relied on by the Government (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above) is silent on this issue and cannot be seen as a relevant precedent (see, mutatis mutandis, Vachev v. Bulgaria, no. 42987/98, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2004VIII (extracts)).

His deprivation of liberty is therefore to be considered as detention \u201cafter conviction\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention, regardless of the position under domestic law (see Wemhoff v.\u00a0Germany, judgment of 27 June 1968, \u00a7 9, Series A no. 7; and B.\u00a0v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 28 March 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 3540, Series A no. 175). The Court must therefore determine as a threshold matter whether Article 5 \u00a7 4 was applicable. This provision would in principle be redundant with respect to detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), since judicial control of the deprivation of liberty has already been incorporated into the initial conviction and sentence (see, as a recent authority, Stoichkov v. , no. 9808/02, \u00a7\u00a064, 24 March 2005, citing De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v.

He could therefore only have been lawfully deprived of his liberty in pursuance of his conviction and sentence of imprisonment. By Article 371 \u00a7 1 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, a sentence may be executed only if it has been made final (see paragraph 24 above). Indeed, the applicant was further taken into custody only after the competent authorities had formed the view that his conviction and sentence had become final (see paragraph 10 above). The question whether they were actually so was therefore determinative of the legality of his detention. This question was, moreover, independent of and distinct from the issues resolved by the Sofia District Court during the applicant\u2019s trial. It follows that the applicant was entitled to apply to a \u201ccourt\u201d having jurisdiction to decide speedily whether or not his deprivation of liberty was unlawful in this sense (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoichkov, \u00a7 66; and Svetoslav Dimitrov, \u00a7 69, both cited above).",

The consideration of this legal challenge was significantly delayed, first in the Sofia District Court and then by reason of two wholly unwarranted adjournments in the Sofia City Court (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above). More significantly, although on 17 July 2000 the Sofia City Court found that the appeal against the applicant\u2019s conviction and sentence had been valid, with the result that neither conviction nor sentence was final or enforceable, it declined to make an order for his release, saying that this was a matter for the Sofia District Court (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). However, later the Sofia District Court, despite several requests, did not examine whether the applicant was to remain in custody or be released (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). The applicant was thus unable to obtain a speedy judicial ruling as to the lawfulness of his detention, as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4. This situation was not made good by the fact that more than three months later, on 24 October 2000, the Sofia City Court informally alerted the Sofia District Prosecutor\u2019s Office to the matter, which in turn made an order for the applicant\u2019s release (see paragraphs 1619 above).

As matters stand, Bulgarian law envisages distinct procedures for challenging specific types of deprivation of liberty, such as pre-trial detention (see, for instance, Ivanov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a022434/02, 25 September 2007), confinement to a mental institution (see Kayadjieva v. , no. 56272/00, \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23, 28 September 2006), or detention pending deportation (see Sadaykov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 13).

During this time there was a pretrial investigation and examination by three levels of court. Their length in itself does not appear excessive, especially if account is taken of the fact that the case involved three codefendants charged with several offences, as well as a civil claimant. It is true that certain unjustified delays occurred during the processing of the applicant\u2019s appeal against the judgment of the Sofia District Court (see paragraphs 819 above). However, the Sofia City Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation subsequently disposed of the case in a speedy manner, taking about eight months each (see paragraphs 18, 21 and 23 above). The overall length of the proceedings cannot therefore be said to have exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d.",

On the other hand, any prejudice suffered on that account must have been greatly tempered by the deduction of the relevant period of detention from the sentence of imprisonment ultimately imposed (see paragraph 21 above). Nonetheless, the applicant did forfeit the opportunity of a speedy and effective judicial control of his detention. In addition, he must have suffered, by reason of the absence of the relevant guarantees, feelings of frustration, uncertainty and anxiety not wholly compensated by the finding of violation or by the deduction of the relevant period of detention from his sentence (see, mutatis mutandis, De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, \u00a7 65; and Kolanis v. the , no. 517/02, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2005V).
