The case originated in an application (no. 47395/09) against the Republic of Poland, lodged with the Court on 13 August 2009 under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Polish nationals, Mr Eugeniusz Bukowski (“the first applicant”), Ms Grażyna Zmysłowska (“the second applicant”) and Ms Jolanta Barszcz (“the third applicant”).
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, subsequently by Ms J. Chrzanowska, and later by Mr J. Sobczak, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
On 18 April 2011 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings for the right of perpetual use was communicated to the Government under Article 6 of the Convention.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The first applicant, Mr Eugeniusz Bukowski, the second applicant, Ms Grażyna Zmysłowska, and the third applicant, Ms Jolanta Barszcz, were born in 1931, in 1960 and 1959 respectively and live in Warsaw.
The property in Warsaw which gives rise to the present application (two adjacent plots of land with a detached house situated on it) was originally co-owned by the applicants’ predecessors, the D. family and the K. family.
The land and the building in question fell under the Decree of 26 October 1945 on Ownership and Use of Land in Warsaw by virtue of which the Warsaw Municipality (and after 1950, the State Treasury) became the owner of all plots of land located in Warsaw. Due to subsequent amendments of law, on 6 January 1992 (“the 1992 decision”) the land in question was transferred ex lege to the Warsaw Municipality.
According to a further donation contract, a sale contract and the rules on inheritance, since 1998 the rights and claims to the land and the building have belonged in 3/6 to the third applicant, in 2/6 to the second applicant and in 1/6 to the first applicant.
On 22 June 1988 the third applicant filed with the Mayor of Warsaw an application for restitution of the right of ownership of the building and the land in question pursuant to the Land Administration and Expropriation Act of 29 April 1985 (Ustawa o gospodarce gruntami i wywłaszczaniu nieruchomości). On 12 September 1996 the first applicant and on 25 February 1998 the second applicant joined the proceedings.
In a decision of 3 January 2005 the Mayor of Warsaw noted that on 1 January 1998 the new Land Administration Act of 21 August 1997 had entered into force. Pursuant to section 214 of that act restitution of the right of ownership of the land was not possible. The former owners whose property had been taken over by the State and whose claims for restoration had expired were only entitled to apply for perpetual use of the land. Consequently, the Mayor granted the applicants the right of perpetual use of the land and declared that they retained the ownership of the building located thereon.
On 17 January 2005 the applicants applied to have this decision amended and the ownership of the land restored.
On 6 June 2005 the Warsaw Self-Government Board of Appeal quashed the impugned decision and remitted the case for re-examination.
On 21 November 2005 the Mayor of Warsaw issued a decision, granting the applicants the right of perpetual use of the land. The Mayor decided to return the ownership of the building to the applicants and decided on the annual amount of fees to be paid for the perpetual use of the land.
On 8 December 2005 the applicants appealed against this decision objecting to the amount of fees.
On 5 December 2007 the Warsaw Self-Government Board of Appeal quashed the decision of 21 November 2005 (see paragraph 13 above) and remitted the case for re-examination.
On 15 October 2008 the applicants lodged with the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court a complaint about the inactivity on the part of the Mayor of Warsaw.
By a judgment of 28 January 2009 the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court obliged the Mayor of Warsaw to issue a decision within four weeks.
On 18 June 2009 the Mayor of Warsaw issued a new decision, granting the applicants a right of perpetual use of the land and the ownership of the house. It further fixed the amount of annual fees to be paid for the perpetual use of land.
On 30 June 2009 the applicants applied to the Warsaw SelfGovernment Board of Appeal contesting the amount of fees for the perpetual use of land.
On 5 November 2009 the Warsaw Self-Government Board of Appeal upheld the impugned decision.
On 27 November 2009 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court. On 1 June 2010 the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court rejected their appeal as lodged out of time. However, subsequently, it granted them leave to appeal out of time.
On 26 January 2011 the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicants’ appeal.
The applicants lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court, which was dismissed on 9 August 2012.
On 24 May 2013 the applicants signed a notarial deed by virtue of which they acquired the ownership of the building and a right of perpetual use of the land.
On 6 April 2010 the applicants filed an application to declare the 1992 decision (see paragraph 7 above) null and void.
On 25 February 2011 the Minister of the Interior refused to declare the 1992 decision null and void.
Subsequently, on various dates, the applicants applied to have the case re-examined. Following several remittals on 12 February 2013 the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court refused the applicants’ request.
On 14 March 2013 the applicants lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court. However, they have failed to submit any information about the further course of the proceedings.
On 20 June 2013 the applicants applied to the Mayor of Warsaw for transformation of their right of perpetual use of land into the right of ownership under the Act of 25 July 2005 on Transformation of a Right of Perpetual Use into a Right of Ownership.
On 28 August 2013 the Board of the Mokotów District (Zarząd Dzielnicy Mokotów) refused to grant the application. The applicants appealed against this decision on 13 September 2013.
On 3 October 2013 and 3 September 2014 the Warsaw SelfGovernment Board of Appeal and the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court, respectively, upheld the first-instance decision.
On 3 November 2015 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed both decisions.
On 14 April 2016 the Board of the Mokotów District issued a decision on the free of charge transformation of the right of perpetual use of the land into the right of ownership.
