Russia (dec.), no. 35555/05 and 6 others, 2 May 2017). Even though the remedy was \u2013 or still is \u2013 available to the applicants, the Court reiterates that it would be unfair to request the applicants whose cases have already been pending for many years in the domestic system and who have come to seek relief at the Court, to bring again their claims before domestic tribunals (see Gerasimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0230).",
