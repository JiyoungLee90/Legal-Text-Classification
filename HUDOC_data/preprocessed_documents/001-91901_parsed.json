Therefore, there had been a risk that he might abscond if released. Further, the domestic courts had referred to the danger of reoffending, that danger being gauged by reference to his membership of the National Bolshevik Party. That Party had been recognised as an extremist organisation by a Russian court and had been banned. Its members had resorted to radical and violent action to express their political views and many of them had been convicted or accused of criminal offences. The applicant had been previously fined in administrative proceedings for commission of disorderly acts, which proved that he was likely to reoffend. The domestic courts had also taken into account that the imputed offence had been committed by an organised group. It had been therefore necessary to hold the applicant in custody to prevent his obstructing the establishment of the truth by communication of the details of the investigation to his accomplices. Finally, the Government submitted that the domestic courts had carefully examined the applicant\u2019s arguments and had found them insufficient to warrant release. Thus, as the applicant had no permanent income, his argument regarding his having a child had rightly been considered irrelevant by the domestic courts. In the Government\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention had been founded on \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons.",

He considered himself the victim rather than the perpetrator of the attack and was interested in cooperating with the investigation to assist them in establishing the truth. He had no criminal record, had a permanent place of residence and permanent employment and was the only breadwinner for his ailing wife and his daughter. He had offered to post bail and had provided the courts with the personal surety of a member of Parliament. Therefore there had been no risk of his absconding. Nor could he interfere with the investigation, as he had been arrested after the investigation had been completed. He further argued that his membership of the National Bolshevik Party had not given rise to a danger of reoffending. The members of the National Bolshevik Party had never resorted to violence. All criminal proceedings against them had been politically motivated and they had been persecuted for their political views and membership of an opposition organisation, the National Bolshevik Party. The applicant concluded that the domestic courts had extended his detention without demonstrating the existence of specific facts in support of their conclusion that he might abscond, interfere with the investigation or reoffend.",

Until his conviction, the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continued detention ceases to be reasonable.

The Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of an accused absconding or reoffending, the need to continue deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the seriousness of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v.\u00a0France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 51; see also Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7 102, 8\u00a0February 2005; Goral v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a038654/97, \u00a7 68, 30 October 2003; and Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081). This is particularly relevant in the Russian legal system where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Govorushko v. Russia, no.\u00a042940/06, \u00a7\u00a048, 25\u00a0October 2007). The domestic courts explicitly refused to consider the state of evidence against the applicant or verify the persistence of reasonable suspicion of his involvement in the commission of the imputed offence (see paragraph 26 above).",

The Court accepts that that factor was relevant in assessing the danger of reoffending. Such a danger, if convincingly established, may lead the judicial authorities to place and leave a suspect in detention in order to prevent any attempts to commit further offences. It is however necessary, among other conditions, that the danger be a plausible one and the measure appropriate, in the light of the circumstances of the case and in particular the past history and the personality of the person concerned (see Clooth v. Belgium, judgment of 12\u00a0December 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0225, \u00a7\u00a040). In the cases of Clooth v. Belgium and Kolev v. Bulgaria (see below) the Court found that the previous criminal record did not justify the applicant\u2019s detention because the offences which had given rise to the applicant\u2019s previous convictions were non-violent and were not comparable, either in nature or degree of seriousness, to the charges preferred against him in the contested proceedings (see Clooth, cited above, \u00a7 40, and Kolev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a050326/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-61, 28 April 2005). In the present case the applicant\u2019s record included only minor non-violent administrative offences and he had no criminal record. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s record of administrative offences did not justify his continued detention (see, for similar reasoning, Aleksey Makarov v. Russia, no. 3223/07, \u00a7 51, 12 June 2008).",

Russia, no.\u00a032327/06, \u00a7 62, 15 May 2008). There is no indication in the present case that before his arrest the applicant had made any attempts to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way. In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice at the later stages of the proceedings. Such risk was bound to gradually decrease as the trial proceeded and the witnesses were interviewed (compare Miszkurka v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a039437/03, \u00a7\u00a051, 4 May 2006) The Court is not therefore persuaded that compelling reasons existed for a fear that the applicant would interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the investigation of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh his right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

The applicant consistently maintained that he lived and worked in  on a permanent basis. It is not necessary for the Court to determine the applicant\u2019s residence and employment situation. Even assuming that he did not have a permanent place of residence in Moscow and was unemployed, the mere lack of a fixed residence or permanent employment does not give rise to a danger of absconding or reoffending (see Pshevecherskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a028957/02, \u00a7 68, 24 May 2007). In the present case, the domestic courts did not point to any aspects of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that he presented a persistent risk of absconding, reoffending or interfering with the proceedings. The applicant, on the other hand, constantly invoked the facts mitigating such risks. However, the domestic courts devoted no attention to discussion of the applicant\u2019s arguments that he had positive references, was in frail health and was the only breadwinner for his ailing spouse and a child. Nor did they address the fact that the applicant had not fled or interfered with the investigation during the year that had passed between the imputed events and his arrest, although he had had an opportunity to do so.",
