They stated that the vessel and the fishing equipment were the applicant\u2019s property and that the latter had not been aware of the use made of the rented items by K.D. in the Romanian exclusive economic zone. According to them, the confiscation of the vessel was disproportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, given the significant value of the vessel and the absence of any proven damage. They argued that no harm had been caused and that no civil or injured parties had joined their complaints to the proceedings. In that connection, they requested that if any confiscation measure was necessary, it should be taken in accordance with Article 118 \u00a7 2 of the CC, in the form of a monetary equivalent amounting to EUR 10,000.",

This approach was clear and foreseeable in the sense that the confiscation measure applied on the basis of Article 66 was not automatic, but was always assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. Relevant case-law in which the courts had ordered the confiscation of other Turkish vessels was submitted, the courts pointing to the frequency of offences similar to those in the present case committed by fishing crews cruising under the Turkish flag. The courts had also indicated that there was a frequent practice of dissimulating the real owner of a vessel by having it registered in the name of a different person from its commander, so as to prevent its potential confiscation from a third party from being ordered.",

On the contrary, he could have proved his good faith, and that could have led to the restitution of his property (see, for instance and mutatis mutandis, Yildirim v. Italy (dec.), no. 38602/02, CEDH 2003-IV). Indeed, according to Article 118 \u00a7 1 (b) of the CC (see paragraph 34 above), whose provisions were eventually considered applicable by the Constan\u0163a Court of Appeal (see paragraph 28 above), goods belonging to a third party could be confiscated only if the latter had been aware of the purpose of their use by the perpetrator.",

In order to reach that conclusion, the appeal court attached relevance to the fact that the vessel did not have either a fishing permit or any authorisation for using fishing equipment. The presence on board of several instruments used specifically for illegal fishing, which were claimed by the applicant as his own possessions, constituted another indication of his bad faith (see paragraph 29 above). Nothing in the file suggests that the Romanian courts acted arbitrarily in their assessment of the evidence submitted to them by the applicant on that point.",

In this context, the Court considers it relevant that the applicant failed to adduce proof before the domestic courts as to the value of the vessel, which allegedly was many times higher than any damage potentially caused (see paragraphs 10 and 41 above) and of the fact that the rental of the vessels was his only source of income (see paragraph 25 above). In connection with this, the Court cannot but observe that, due to its severe degree of depreciation, the vessel was ultimately sold for approximately EUR 1,900 (see paragraphs 31-32 above)",
