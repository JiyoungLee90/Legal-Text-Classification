The fact that a friend of the applicant was present at the altercation was also accepted by both the trial and the appeal courts (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above).",

Moreover, the questioning of this witness was requested in order to refute the statements of the witnesses for the prosecution (see Topi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 45, and compare Borisova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 56891/00, \u00a7 47, 21 December 2006).

In this respect the Court notes that such findings clearly contradict the statement the applicant gave before the investigating judge (see paragraph 9 above) as well as the statement given by J. In particular, the applicant and J. both stated that P. had been present during at least part of the altercation (see paragraphs 9 and 14 above). The same was also evident from the police report examined during the trial (see paragraphs 7 and 15 above). It therefore follows that the domestic courts\u2019 reasons for refusing to call P. as a witness on the applicant\u2019s behalf are manifestly contrary to the available facts of the case. Accordingly, the reasoning of the domestic courts for dismissing the applicant\u2019s request cannot in itself be accepted as relevant and valid (compare Grega\u010devi\u0107, \u00a7 56, and Polyakov, \u00a7 35, cited above).",
