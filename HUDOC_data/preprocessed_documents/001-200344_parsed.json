Having examined the thirty-one comments referred to by the LGL Association, the prosecutor noted that of those thirty-one comments, twenty-seven \u00a0people had written one comment each, and two people had written two comments each. For the prosecutor, this was easy to establish, since the commenters had placed those comments under their personal profiles. The prosecutor held that in order to assess whether the comments in question were of a criminal nature, it was necessary to take into account not only the comments as such, but also the context in which those comments had been written. Given that the comments had been written by different people, each comment had to be assessed individually, and not collectively. It was also essential to establish whether those comments constituted an active attempt (aktyvus siekis) to incite other people to disseminate degrading comments and to incite them to commit violence. The prosecutor then considered that active attempts required \u201csystematic action\u201d. In the applicants\u2019 case, however, such a criterion had not been met because various individuals had written only one or two comments, which was not enough to be considered as constituting a systematic attempt to incite hatred or violence against people distinguishable by their sexual orientation. From this it followed that the objective element of a crime, as established under Article 170 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code, was absent. Furthermore, the fact that the \u201cexpression of opinion\u201d in question had been non-systematic and isolated meant that there had been no subjective element \u2013 namely, that of direct intent \u2013 in the crime in question, because by posting the comments the authors thereof had been merely \u201cexpressing their opinion\u201d, instead of seeking to incite hatred or violence against individuals who were distinguishable by their sexual orientation. Even though the authors of the comments had reacted \u201cunethically\u201d in respect of the image portrayed in the photograph of the two applicants, such \u201cimmoral behaviour\u201d did not constitute an element of a crime under Article 170 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor lastly considered that the Supreme Court was of a similar view, in view of the fact that by a ruling of 18 December 2012 in case no.\u00a02K-677/2012 it had acquitted a person who had posted a comment stating that gay people were \u201cperverts\u201d and \u201cbelonged in a psychiatric hospital\u201d. In that case the Supreme Court had considered that such a comment, even though unethical, had not actively incited hatred or discrimination against homosexual people (for a more detailed description see paragraphs 39-41 below). The prosecutor thus saw that his conclusion was in line with the Supreme Court\u2019s practice in such cases \u2013 that is to say, that comments of such a tenor were unethical but not criminal.",

                                        "content": "19.\u00a0\u00a0On 9\u00a0January 2015 the LGL Association lodged an appeal against the prosecutor\u2019s decision with the Klaip\u0117da City District Court. The LGL Association pointed out that the prosecutor had taken the decision not to prosecute on two grounds: firstly, that the actions of the people who had commented on the above-mentioned Facebook post had not been systematic in nature, and secondly, that in respect of cases concerning similar situations (that is to say comments of a similar nature) the authorities routinely considered that no crime had been committed. The LGL Association noted that in more than 90% of cases in Lithuania, hatred was promoted through the electronic sphere \u2013 for example, by the creation of hatred-promoting groups on the Facebook social network or on Internet forums. The LGL Association also relied on Lithuanian court decisions of 2014 at district court (that is to say, first-instance) level which had found that a single comment had been sufficient to find the author thereof guilty of a crime under Article\u00a0170 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 50 and 51 below). The LGL Association thus disputed the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that such actions had to be systematic in nature in order for criminal liability to arise. The LGL Association argued that the question of whether or not comments could be deemed to be systematic in nature could be taken into account when assessing the gravity of a crime and imposing a punishment on the author of such comments, but it did not amount to a constitutive element of that crime. As to the applicants\u2019 case in particular, it also argued, inter alia, that several terms contained in the comments had promoted the infliction of physical harm and even the killing of members of the group in question (for example, advocating burning and extermination), which had indicated their authors\u2019 \u201cparticular attitude\u201d (ypating\u0105 nusiteikim\u0105) towards people of non-traditional sexual orientation and had clearly intentionally articulated a call for violence. On this point the LGL Association relied on the Court\u2019s judgment in Vejdeland v. Sweden (no.\u00a01813/07, \u00a7\u00a7 54 and 55, 9\u00a0February 2012), in which it had held that Sweden had not breached the rights of the applicants in that case by prosecuting them, even if their statements had not called for violence. Lastly, the LGL Association argued that if the comments under the photograph of the applicants on Facebook had been only \u201cexpressing [the authors\u2019] opinion\u201d, it was totally unclear what could be considered to constitute \u201cpublicly ridiculing, expressing contempt, urging hatred or inciting discrimination\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a0170\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Criminal Code. That norm of criminal law was destined to become a \u201cdead letter\u201d, which the law-enforcement authorities chose not to apply \u201cby giving unjustified preference to freedom of expression, or perhaps owing to other motives which, although not related to law, had an influence on law\u201d.",

Even so, the \u201cmere use of obscenities\u201d (tik necenz\u016brini\u0173 \u017eod\u017ei\u0173 pavartojimas) was not enough to incur criminal liability under Article\u00a0170\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Criminal Code.

Therefore, a person who posted in the public space (vie\u0161oje erdv\u0117je) a picture \u201cof two men kissing\u201d should and must have foreseen that such \u201ceccentric behaviour really did not contribute to the cohesion of those within society who had different views or to the promotion of tolerance\u201d (ekscentri\u0161kas elgesys tikrai neprisideda prie visuomen\u0117je kitokias pa\u017ei\u016bras turin\u010di\u0173 asmen\u0173 tarpusavio supratimo bei tolerancijos ugdymo). The owner of a social network profile on which such an image was posted, by exercising his freedom to express his convictions and freedom to promote tolerance, had to take into account the fact that that freedom was inseparable from the obligation to respect the views and traditions of others. According to the court, \u201cthe majority of Lithuanian society very much appreciate[d] traditional family values\u201d (itin vertina tradicin\u0117s \u0161eimos vertybes). Indeed, that view was enshrined in Article 38 of the Constitution, which read that the family should be the basis of society and the State, and that marriage should be undertaken on the basis of the free mutual consent of a man and a woman. The district court also referred to a passage from the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling of 28\u00a0September 2011 (see paragraph\u00a034 below), and from that ruling inferred that \u201cthe family, as a constitutional value, is a union between a man and a woman\u201d. Lastly, the court stated that criminal proceedings were an ultima ratio measure and that they should therefore be initiated only when serious grounds and all elements of a crime existed. This was not the situation in the case at hand. The decision not to prosecute the authors of the comments had been reasonable.",

It pleaded that certain comments had been clearly meant to incite violence, thus directly constituting an objective element of a crime under Article 170 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code. The LGL Association noted that even milder public comments, although concerning racial or ethnic discrimination, had been considered by the Lithuanian courts to constitute a crime. The LGL Association also argued that the subjective element of a crime, that is to say direct intent, should be assessed only after the identification of the alleged perpetrators and during subsequent criminal proceedings, not at the time that a procedural decision was taken regarding whether to start a pre-trial investigation or not. Responding to the district court\u2019s statement that the majority of Lithuanian society very much appreciated \u201ctraditional family values\u201d, the LGL Association underlined that a criminal offence could not be justified by the views and traditions of either an individual or the majority of society. In that connection the LGL Association also relied on the Court\u2019s case-law, which held that freedom of expression was applicable not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that were favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also those that offended, shocked or disturbed. The LGL Association lastly referred to the Court\u2019s judgment in Balsyt\u0117-Lideikien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania (no.\u00a072596/01, \u00a7\u00a082, 4\u00a0November 2008) to the effect that one right, such as the freedom of speech of the authors of the comments, could be restricted if such a restriction was necessary because that speech was offensive.",

The regional court also underlined the fact that the first applicant had posted the photograph in question publicly and had not restricted it to his friends or \u201clike-minded people\u201d (bendramin\u010diams), even though the Facebook social network allowed such a possibility. Such an action could therefore be interpreted as constituting \u201can attempt to deliberately tease or shock individuals with different views or to encourage the posting of negative comments\u201d. The regional court also considered that, in the absence of objective and subjective elements of a crime under Article 170 of the Criminal Code, it would constitute a \u201cwaste of time and resources\u201d, or even an unlawful restriction of the rights of others [that is to say Internet commenters\u2019] to open criminal proceedings.

The first applicant had been summoned by his secondary-school headmaster, who had requested him \u201cnot to disseminate his ideas\u201d. The second applicant had been summoned by the dean of the university theology faculty, who had requested him to change his course of study because his \u201clifestyle did not correspond with the faculty\u2019s values\u201d. On several occasions the applicants had been verbally harassed in public places. They had also received a number of threatening private messages in their social network mailboxes.

It admitted that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was just as perilous as discrimination on the basis of race or colour of skin. Moreover, comments on the Internet, in the event that they instigated hatred or violence, were dangerous, given the fact that persons could be inclined to write such comments because of the protection that anonymity afforded them and the fact that because of the nature of the Internet such comments could be read by a large number of persons, especially when such comments were published on one of the most popular websites, as was the situation in that case. The Supreme Court also pointed out that \u201cthe topic of sexual minorities\u2019 rights in Lithuania was pertinent (tema aktuali) and was surrounded by a certain social tension that was linked, among other things, to a rather conservative (or negative) attitude on the part of part of society towards sexual minorities\u201d.",

Nevertheless, even if the author of that comment had used his right to freedom of expression inappropriately, such a comment could not have posed a real danger to the values protected by Article\u00a0170 of the Criminal Code, that is to say it could not have breached homosexuals\u2019 right of equality, collectively or individually, or their dignity. The comment also could not have genuinely incited readers of the Internet portal in question to commit violence against that group or individuals belonging to that group. For the Supreme Court, that conclusion stemmed from the fact that the comment in question had been \u201claconic\u201d rather than specific (that is to say the author had not further elaborated on his views in order to incite others against the group of persons in question); and \u201cviolence had been discussed only in an abstract manner and through the means of idiom\u201d. The Supreme Court thus concluded that V.G.\u2019s actions had lacked both the objective and subjective elements of a crime and that he had therefore been correctly acquitted.",

In an appeal on points of law V.I. had pleaded that she had used the term \u201cnegro\u201d. The Supreme Court considered that the latter term, if used in Lithuania \u2013 which had no history of slave labour, segregation or social conflict on the basis of certain people belonging to another race and where the word \u201cnegro\u201d therefore did not have a demeaning connotation \u2013 could not have been considered as discriminatory on the basis of race. This also stemmed from the fact that \u201c[historically], there were practically no persons of non-Caucasian race living in Lithuania\u201d. The image of a \u201cnegro\u201d in Lithuanian culture was linked to that of a person who had been exploited and was hard-working, and who therefore deserved compassion.

The book contains fairy tales featuring members of socially vulnerable groups, such as same-sex couples, Roma, and disabled people, and aims at promoting tolerance and respect for diversity among children. Following the complaints, the LEU explained the withdrawal of the book by suddenly describing it as \u2018harmful, primitive and biased homosexual propaganda\u2019. Furthermore, the Office of the Inspector of Journalistic Ethics concluded that two fairy tales that promote tolerance for same-sex couples are harmful to minors. The Inspectorate\u2019s experts deemed the stories in violation of the Law on the Protection of Minors because they encourage \u2018the concept of entry into a marriage and creation of a family other than stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania\u2019.

As correctly pointed out by the Government, under domestic law any person could inform the relevant domestic institutions of an alleged criminal act (see paragraph 68 in fine above). Moreover, the Government had failed to explain what difference it would have made if the applicants had initiated the domestic proceedings themselves. It also had to be born in mind that the LGL Association was the sole civil-society organisation in Lithuania representing the interests of the LGBT community and seeking to improve their situation. In fact, its statutes read that it sought to \u201cpromote measures to prevent homophobic ... hate crimes\u201d (see paragraph\u00a055 above). Accordingly, it seemed that the Government were challenging the very fact that a civil-society organisation might also have a legitimate interest in the outcome of the applicants\u2019 case, and thus questioning the fundamental role of non-governmental organisations in performing a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d function in a pluralist, democratic society. Lastly, the fact that the LGL Association had acted with the full knowledge and consent of the applicants when initiating the domestic proceedings was further confirmed by the fact that it was the applicants themselves who were complaining before the Court as \u201cvictims\u201d, within the meaning of Article\u00a034 of the Convention.

In the present case, where the issue of violence inciting hate speech against persons belonging to the homosexual minority was brought by the LGL Association to the Lithuanian authorities\u2019 attention, the Court is even more inclined to hold that, once they had been notified of such issues \u2013 no matter by whom \u2013 the prosecutors were under an obligation to investigate those comments. Such conclusion also stems from the Government\u2019s own admission, based on the methodological guidelines issued by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, that in respect of homophobic crimes, the launching of a pre-trial investigation should not be too formal and that prosecutors should be conscious of the vulnerability of such crimes\u2019 victims. Likewise, prosecutors are under an obligation to act, even if an anonymous application is received (see paragraph 31 above). The fact that persons guilty of homophobic speech can be prosecuted on the basis of applications lodged by non-governmental organisations is also supported by the practice of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above).",

It suffices to note that the legal action brought by the LGL Association was not an actio popularis, since it acted not on the basis of any abstract situation, be it a provision of domestic law or practice, affecting LGBT persons in Lithuania, but in response to specific facts affecting the rights of two applicants \u2013 members of that association \u2013 under the Convention; moreover, these facts were supported by the evidence which it furnished the authorities (see paragraph 17 above; see also Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0110, ECHR 2014).",

To find otherwise would amount to preventing such serious allegations of a violation of the Convention from being examined at the national level. Indeed, the Court has held that in modern-day societies recourse to collective bodies such as associations is one of the accessible means, sometimes the only means, available to the citizens whereby they can defend their particular interests effectively. Moreover, the standing of associations to bring legal proceedings in defence of their members\u2019 interests is recognised by the legislation of most European countries (see Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no.\u00a062543/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-39, ECHR 2004III, see also, mutatis mutandis, Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0101, 103 and 112, ECHR 2014, and the case-law cited therein). Any other, excessively formalistic, conclusion would make protection of the rights guaranteed by the Convention ineffectual and illusory. In that context, and also in the light of the findings by the ECRI (see points 33 and 58 of the report cited in, respectively, paragraphs 58 and 59 above), the Court is also not ready to disregard the applicants\u2019 statement that they preferred that the LGL Association initiate the criminal proceedings on their behalf, for fear that the Internet commenters would retaliate should the applicants launch such proceedings themselves. Lastly, the Court observes that the present application was lodged by the applicants, acting for themselves, after the domestic courts had adopted decisions in the case that dealt with their particular situation.",

The applicants were likewise convinced that the outcome of the domestic proceedings \u2013 that is to say the decision not to prosecute \u2013 would not have been taken if the picture had depicted any other social or ethnic group within Lithuanian society, such as the Lithuanian Jewish community, and analogous comments, such as \u201cthrow [them] into the gas chambers\u201d and \u201cexterminate them\u201d, had been posted.

They therefore maintained that their different treatment on the grounds of their sexual orientation had lacked any objective and reasonable justification.\u00a0The position of the domestic courts and the Government (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above and paragraph 94 below) had seemed to suggest that the applicants had no right to kiss in public, be that on the first applicant\u2019s Facebook page or on the street, since this amounted to \u201ceccentric behaviour\u201d owing to the applicants\u2019 sexual orientation. The Government\u2019s position also seemed to suggest that if the sight of two men kissing had triggered threats of violence, in strict contravention of Article\u00a0170 of the Criminal Code, then that had been the fault of the applicants, and the courts had thus been correct in refusing to enforce the relevant Lithuanian legislation aimed at protecting same-sex couples such as the applicants.

The applicants\u2019 conduct, that is to say their non-verbal means of expression \u2013 wearing a jumper with a cross, which was the principal symbol of the Christian religion \u2013 could be regarded as a way of expressing the applicants\u2019 views as regards the compatibility of homosexuality with the Christian religion (the Government referred to Donaldson v the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a056975/09, \u00a7\u00a029, 25\u00a0January 2011). In the Government\u2019s view, the public display of such a photograph together with the image of a cross \u201ccould have sparked conflict with people of a different cultural and religious background\u201d. This was illustrated by one comment under the photograph, which read as follows: \u201cVery beautiful composition. In particular, the cross on the jumper. In place\u201d. The Government thus considered that in such cases \u201cthe Contracting States had a wide margin of appreciation in assessing which emblems could potentially inflame existing tensions if displayed publicly\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 28).",

The Government considered that the situation in the present case differed from a situation involving intense fear and anxiety, as described in the judgment of Identoba and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070 and 71). Contrary to the facts in that case, the people who had commented negatively on the Facebook page of the first applicant had not outnumbered the applicants and their supporters, and no physical assaults had ever taken place against them. In that context it was noteworthy that almost since the re-establishment of Lithuania\u2019s independence in 1990 numerous actions had been taken to protect LGBT rights in the country. Baltic Pride, an annual LGBT pride parade, had taken place in Lithuania in 2010, 2013 and 2016.

In the same vein, those commenters, although they had used improper words, had been trying to show that, contrary to what had been suggested by the applicants and their supporters, homosexuality was negative in itself and had a negative impact on children, and that the applicants\u2019 conduct by depicting a cross in their photograph had been incompatible with the Catholic religion. One had to bear in mind that the domestic authorities had considered that the comments had not been systematic, and that was one of the factors that could also indicate that there had no been direct intent on the part of the perpetrators, and that posting such comments had therefore not reached the threshold required by Article 170 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above).

That being so, and although the Government saw the latter fact as provocative, the Court does not view either of those reasons as illegitimate or meriting their suppression. On the contrary, it has already held that there is no ambiguity about the member States\u2019 recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms (see Alekseyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a084). The Court also points to LGBT-friendly Vilnius\u2019s follow-up posts on its own Facebook page in which it was stated that the applicants\u2019 photograph had been posted to serve the aim of helping other LGBT people in Lithuania, and potentially those who were \u201ccondemned by others\u201d and perhaps \u201c[standing] on the roof of some house, or on the edge of a window sill or balcony\u201d, to move \u201cto a safer spot\u201d. The applicants also confirmed this intention when interviewed by the LGL Association (see paragraphs\u00a011 and 12 above). While accepting the Supreme Court\u2019s finding that the atmosphere in respect of issues concerning homosexuality is tense in Lithuania (see point 22 in paragraph 57 above; as confirmed by international bodies, see paragraphs 63 and 64 above), the Court cannot view the above-mentioned intentions, as indicated by the applicants, as having threatened to cause public unrest (see paragraph\u00a044 above; compare and contrast Donaldson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a029). In fact, it is a fair and public debate about sexual minorities\u2019 social status that benefits social cohesion by ensuring that representatives of all views are heard, including the individuals concerned (see, mutatis mutandis, Alekseyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a086).",

In this context the Court notes the applicants\u2019 view that such argument by the Government was \u201cadditional\u201d and \u201cdistracting\u201d, also given that the Government could only point to a single religion-related comment (see paragraph 90 above).

Moreover, given that the Convention is a living instrument, to be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions, the State, in its choice of means designed to protect the family and to secure, as required by Article\u00a08, respect for family life, must necessarily take into account developments in society and changes in the perception of social, civil status and relational issues, including the fact that there is not just one way or one choice in the sphere of leading and living one\u2019s family or private life. In the present case, although the Klaip\u0117da District Court cited the alleged incompatibility between maintaining family values as the foundation of society and acknowledging the social acceptance of homosexuality, the Court sees no reason to consider those elements as incompatible, especially in view of the growing general tendency to view relationships between same-sex couples as falling within the concept of \u201cfamily life\u201d (see Bayev and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a067667/09 and 2\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a067, 20\u00a0June 2017).",

This was confirmed by the Constitutional Court in 2019 when examining questions related to two persons of the same sex living in two different countries who wished to be reunited in Lithuania (see point 32.5 in paragraph\u00a036 above). In the latter ruling the Constitutional Court also underlined not only the fact that under the Lithuanian Constitution \u201cthe concept of family [was] neutral in terms of gender\u201d but also that \u201cthe Constitution is an anti-majoritarian act\u201d and that the views of the majority may not override those of the minority (see points 31.3 and 32.5 in paragraph\u00a036 above). The Court, for its part, has also held that it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group\u2019s rights would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective, as required by the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Alekseyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081, and the case-law cited therein).",

It therefore remains for the Court to determine whether the Government have sufficiently demonstrated that the way the national authorities assessed the relevant facts, as presented in the criminal complaint lodged by the LGL Association, was acceptable (see paragraph\u00a0116 above). In particular, the Court is called upon to determine whether the decision by the prosecutor to discontinue the criminal investigation, subsequently confirmed by the national courts, was motivated by a discriminatory attitude and stereotypes related to sexual orientation (see, mutatis mutandis, Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais v. Portugal, no.\u00a017484/15, \u00a7\u00a046, 25\u00a0July 2017).",

[should be thrown] into the gas chamber\u201d or \u201cinto the bonfire\u201d or have \u201ca free honeymoon trip to the crematorium\u201d, or have \u201ctheir heads smash[ed]\u201d or be \u201ccastrated\u201d or be \u201c[shot]\u201d(see paragraph\u00a010 above), had acted \u201cunethically\u201d but that such \u201camoral behaviour\u201d had not reached the threshold required by Article\u00a0170 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02 and 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph\u00a018 above). The Klaip\u0117da District Court came to the same conclusion, finding that those comments were mere \u201cobscenities\u201d and were simply words \u201cnot chosen properly\u201d (see paragraph\u00a020 above). However, whilst being careful not to hold that each and every utterance of hate speech, must, as such, attract criminal prosecution and criminal sanctions (see paragraph\u00a0116 above), the Court is unable to subscribe to such conclusions of the Lithuanian authorities. The Court recalls its finding that comments that amount to hate speech and incitement to violence, and are thus clearly unlawful on their face, may in principle require the States to take certain positive measures (see, mutatis mutandis, Delfi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0153 and 159). It has likewise held that inciting hatred does not necessarily entail a call for an act of violence or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating racist speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Vejdeland and Others v. Sweden, no.\u00a01813/07, \u00a7\u00a055). Moreover, the Court cannot but observe that other comments, even without calling for violence, regarding the Jews (see paragraph 52 above) have been treated by the Lithuanian authorities as falling under Article\u00a0170 of the Criminal Code. It also considers that the Government have not provided weighty arguments to refute the applicants\u2019 view that if comments such as those uttered in their case did not amount to inciting not only hatred but even violence on the basis of the applicants\u2019 sexual orientation, then it is hard to conceive what statements would (see paragraphs 19 and 87 above). Therefore, the Court, sharing the view of the Constitutional Court that the attitudes or stereotypes prevailing over a certain period of time among the majority of members of society may not serve as justifiable grounds for discriminating against persons solely on the basis of their sexual orientation, or for limiting the right to the protection of private life (see point\u00a031.3 in paragraph 35 above), considers that the assessment made in this case by the national authorities was not in conformity with the fundamental principle in a democratic State, governed by the rule of law (see also, mutatis mutandis, Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais, cited above, \u00a7\u00a046, and Biao v. Denmark [GC], no.\u00a038590/10, \u00a7\u00a0126, 24\u00a0May 2016).",

The Court again cannot subscribe to this argument. It notes that the Lithuanian courts\u2019 practice on this issue is not uniform, in that while the courts sometimes ascribe importance to an accused posting numerous discriminatory comments and find him or her guilty under Article 170 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above), in other cases the making of a single discriminatory comment is sufficient to attract criminal liability (see paragraphs 46-49 and 54 above). In this context the Court, whilst acknowledging that it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see, among many authorities, Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a013279/05, \u00a7\u00a049, 20\u00a0October 2011), does not disregard the argument that the LGL Association put forward in the domestic proceedings (see paragraph\u00a019 above), namely that the number of the comments could constitute a circumstance determining the gravity of the crime or the extent of the culprit\u2019s criminal liability, but that it did not constitute an indispensable element of the crime under the aforementioned provision of the Criminal Code.",

The potential of the comments on the Internet as well as the danger they may cause, especially when they are published on popular Internet websites, has also been underlined by the Lithuanian Supreme Court (see paragraph 44 above). For its part, the Court has also held that in the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public\u2019s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. At the same time, in considering the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d of those placing such information, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor (see, mutatis mutandis, Magyar Tartalomszolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3k Egyes\u00fclete and Index.hu Zrt, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056, with further references). Accordingly, the Court does not find it unreasonable to hold that even the posting of a single hateful comment, let alone that such persons should be \u201ckilled\u201d, on the first applicant\u2019s Facebook page was sufficient to be taken seriously. This is further supported by the fact that the photograph had \u201cgone viral\u201d online and received more than 800 comments (see paragraph 10 above). The report on Lithuania by the ECRI also indicates that the country \u201chas a problem\u201d and that most hate speech takes place on the Internet, and also on social networks (see paragraph 56 above; see also points 26 and 27 of the report, cited in paragraph 57 above). The Court therefore also rejects the Government\u2019s argument that comments on Facebook are less dangerous than those on the Internet news portals (see paragraph 98 above). Neither can it see as pertinent the Government\u2019s argument that the people who commented negatively on the Facebook page of the first applicant had not outnumbered the applicants and their supporters (see paragraph 97 above).",

It considers that this equally applies to hate speach against persons\u2019 sexual orientation and sexual life. The Court observes that the instant case concerns undisguised calls on attack on the applicants\u2019 physical and mental integrity (see, in this context, Panayotova and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a012509/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a058 and 59, 7\u00a0May 2019, with further references), which require protection by the criminal law (see paragraph 111 above). Article\u00a0170 of the Criminal Code indeed provides for such a protection (see paragraph\u00a030 above). However, due to the Lithuanian authorities\u2019 discriminatory attitude, the provisions of this Article were not employed in the applicants\u2019 case, and the requisite protection was not granted to them. The Court considers that, in the circumstances of this case, it would have been manifestly unreasonable for the victims as well as downplaying the seriousness of the impugned comments to require the applicants to exhaust any other remedies. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s objection to the effect that the applicants could have had recourse to other \u2013 civil law \u2013 remedies (see paragraphs\u00a070 and 82 above), must be dismissed.",

For example, in the period between 2013 and 2015 the LGL Association had submitted twenty-four complaints to law-enforcement authorities in relation to two hundred and six instances of alleged online hate speech. On the basis of those complaints, twenty-eight pre-trial investigations had been initiated in 2013, thirteen in 2014 and eight in 2015. Interestingly enough, all of those pre-trial investigations had been either suspended or terminated, and thus had not led to the actual identification or punishment of the alleged perpetrators. The three main reasons for that had been: 1) the failure to identify the individual who had committed the criminal offence in question; 2) the failure to establish the constitutive elements of a criminal offence, and 3) the IP address in question had belonged to a foreign jurisdiction. Moreover, between 2013 and 2015 several requests for the launch of a pre-trial investigation had been refused altogether. It could therefore be concluded that the Lithuanian authorities systemically failed in providing an effective remedy for alleged victims of homophobic online hate speech.",

Moreover, so-called \u201ctraditional values\u201d \u2013 referred to by the third-party interveners in their observations \u2013 had never resulted in the acquittal of a person in a hate-speech case, since acquittals, including that in the applicants\u2019 case, had instead been based on the lack of any of the constitutive elements of a crime. In that context the Government also disagreed with the third parties\u2019 assessment of the 18\u00a0December 2012 Supreme Court ruling (see paragraphs\u00a039-43 above and paragraph 148 below), and claimed that the term \u201ceccentric behaviour\u201d therein referred not to the participants\u2019 sexual orientation, but to the unauthorised form in which they had expressed those ideas \u2013 namely, their above-mentioned unsanctioned demonstration next to the Seimas. Similarly, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling of 1\u00a0March 2016 also could not be seen as hostile to homosexual people, for in that case the Supreme Court had had regard not only to the general social context, but also to the particular context in which the comment had been made, and the person had thus been acquitted for lack of any of the constitutive elements of a crime (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above).",

As the Government have not provided a single verdict by the Supreme Court showing that a trend of interpretation, which was perceived by the prosecutor as rather lenient towards those accused of hate speech against homosexuals, has been reversed, it does not appear that the Supreme Court has had an opportunity to provide greater clarity on the standards to be applied in hate speech cases of comparable gravity. In that context the Court notes the statutory obligation on the domestic courts to take into account the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law (see also Orlen Lietuva Ltd. v. Lithuania, no.\u00a045849/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a033-35, 29\u00a0January 2019). Accordingly, the Court finds that the manner in which the case law of the Supreme Court was applied by the prosecutor, whose decision was upheld by the domestic courts which examined the applicants\u2019 case, did not provide for an effective domestic remedy for homophobic discrimination complaints.",

Similarly, on the facts of the case, and taking into account the gravity of the threats uttered by the Internet commenters, the Court has already found that a civil-law remedy, or a referral of such comments to the Inspector (see paragraph\u00a070 above), did not constitute remedies that had to be exhausted (see paragraph 128 above).",

Accordingly, it cannot find that, at least in this case, failure to establish the identity of those persons and bring them to justice was impossible due to any technical limitations, even if the Lithuanian authorities had been willing to do so (see paragraph\u00a0140 above).",

Firstly, even acknowledging that between 2012 and 2015 some thirty pre-trial investigations regarding homophobic hate speech were opened in Lithuania, one may not overlook the fact that all of them were discontinued, mostly because the culprits could not be found (see paragraph 139 above). As the ECRI noted in 2016, the growing level of intolerance against sexual minorities had remained largely unchecked (see paragraph\u00a056 above). That being so, the Court also gives weight to the applicants\u2019 argument that in view of the law-enforcement authorities\u2019 practice in this regard \u2013 and also in response to the outcome of their own case \u2013 they had not felt like complaining to the law-enforcement agencies again (see also point 53 of the ECRI report, cited in paragraph\u00a059 above).\u00a0In fact, in the applicants\u2019 case the regional court even considered that to open criminal proceedings would have been a \u201cwaste of time and resources\u201d (see paragraph\u00a023 above). As put forward by the applicants and the third party interveners, who also relied on the ECRI (see paragraphs\u00a0136 and 148 above), such prejudicial attitude of the domestic court is fraught with the risk that Article 170 of the Criminal Code would remain a \u201cdead letter\u201d, that, in the words of the LGL association, the law-enforcement authorities chose not to apply \u201cby giving unjustified preference to freedom of expression, or perhaps owing to other motives which, although not related to law, had an influence on law\u201d (see paragraph\u00a019 above). Secondly, the Court notes information regarding the Lithuanian law-enforcement institutions\u2019 failure to acknowledge bias-motivation of such crimes and to take such an approach which would be adequate to the seriousness of the situation (see points 54-55 of the ECRI report, cited in paragraph\u00a059 above; also see points 57 and 58 of that report, cited in paragraph 60 above). In this connection the Court reminds that it has already held in Identoba and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a077) that without such a strict approach on the part of the law-enforcement authorities, prejudice-motivated crimes would unavoidably be treated on an equal footing with ordinary cases without such overtones, and the resultant indifference would be tantamount to official acquiescence or even connivance in hate crimes. Regarding Lithuania, the most recent materials by the ECRI also show lack of a comprehensive strategic approach to tackle the issue of racist and homophobic hate speech by the authorities (see paragraph 62 above).",
