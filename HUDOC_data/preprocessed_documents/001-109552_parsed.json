Section 227a has a similar (substitute) function in that it likewise provides for the crediting for insurance purposes of periods during which the person concerned was prevented from accumulating insurance periods (in this instance, on account of child-raising). In so far as the legislature already compensates for the loss of insurance periods as a result of persecution, no further compensation is needed. In so far as it does not make such provision, there is no difference in relation to other persons who are resident abroad: on account of the territoriality principle applicable under the social security scheme, the crediting of insurance periods in accordance with section 227a of the General Social Security Act would in any event require an equalisation arrangement through an international agreement and, moreover, decisions in such matters would be taken not in administrative proceedings but in proceedings concerning benefit entitlements.",

This equal treatment is admittedly of significance for benefit entitlement (and not only for the application of preferential treatment on the basis of emigration).

First, they stated that within the special regime for victims of National Socialist persecution, the crediting of periods of child-raising abroad in addition to the overall crediting of insurance periods might amount to counting the same periods twice. Second, they argued that the crediting of substitute periods for child-raising was not only a matter of social security law but also of family policy. Both the territoriality principle inherent in social security law and the legitimate interests of family policy provided objective reasons for counting periods of child-raising as substitute periods only if they had been spent in .",

We note in particular that the argument that accepting periods of child-raising abroad as substitute periods in addition to the overall crediting of insurance periods provided for by the special regime may lead to counting the same period twice would also apply to periods of higher education spent abroad. Indeed, the applicant herself obtained the entitlement to overall crediting of 180 insurance months in respect of the years 1951 to 1965 by paying retroactive contributions. In addition, periods of higher education in the years 1953 to 1959 were counted as substitute periods. If the argument of \u201cdouble\u201d crediting of insurance periods does not count for periods of higher education spent abroad, there is no sense in allowing it to count with regard to periods of child-raising abroad.",

We are not convinced by the Government\u2019s second argument either, which relies essentially on the principle of territoriality inherent in social security law, for the simple reason that the regime for victims of National Socialist persecution itself creates a special situation with regard to the territoriality principle. The argument of territoriality is clearly misplaced in the context of a law which aims precisely to compensate victims of persecution in their own country who had to leave the country to survive. In this connection, it should be noted that the applicant was deported, first, to the concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen at the age of seven, and subsequently to the concentration camp in Vittel, spent four years in camps for displaced persons and emigrated to  at the age of twelve. She never accumulated any insurance periods in  under the ordinary regime. In the context of the special legal regime described above, any considerations linked to the principle of territoriality, including considerations of family policy based on that principle, cannot provide a justification for distinguishing between facts that occurred in  and facts that occurred abroad. We find it very disturbing, to say the least, that family policy should privilege Austrian mothers who raise their children in  over Austrian mothers who do so abroad. The presumption of \u201cless valuable\u201d child-raising by Austrian mothers living abroad is totally unacceptable.",

Given the aim of the special regime of eliminating disadvantages for victims of National Socialist persecution, we cannot see any reasonable and objective grounds for excluding one particular type of period, namely time spent child-raising, on the sole ground of residence abroad, taking into account in particular the fact that the applicant\u2019s residence abroad was precisely because of her status as a victim of persecution.",

Consequently, it cannot be said that she chose to live abroad (in contrast to the position in Carson and Others, cited above, \u00a7 86). On the contrary, the fact that she is resident abroad is linked to the persecution she suffered during the period of National Socialism. We find that the applicant was placed against her will in a different situation from persons who have paid regular contributions to the old-age pension system on the basis of their employment in . In other words, she was forcibly excluded from a career of regular contributions, such exclusion being the result of a grave human rights violation. The contested legal solution perpetuates the pattern of exclusion to which the legislature wanted to put an end. By not counting periods of child-raising spent abroad as substitute periods, the respondent State has treated the applicant differently on the basis of a situation that she was forced to accept as a result of that grave human rights violation. The applicant\u2019s actual situation reinforces that pattern of exclusion: years of childcare for children born in the context of such exclusion are treated as years of childcare provided by a non-Austrian mother.",

We accept that the Convention does not restrict the Contracting States\u2019 freedom to decide whether or not to have special social security regimes for victims of persecution. If, however, a State does decide to create a special scheme, as Austria did when it approved the 2002 amendment to the General Social Security Act, it must do so in a manner which is compatible with Article 14 of the Convention (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2006VI). This State obligation is even more compelling in the present case, where the special regime in question aims to repair the harm done to people who suffered persecution. For the reasons set out above, we consider that the exclusion of periods of child-raising by Austrian mothers abroad not only contradicted the generous aim of the 2002 amendment but, more seriously, infringed the European standard of equality. Consequently, we consider that there has been a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",
