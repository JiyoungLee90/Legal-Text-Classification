In the Board\u2019s view, the above factors suggested that the first applicant\u2019s problems were of a fundamental nature and that her potential for change was limited (sier noe om at mors problematikk er av en grunnleggende karakter og at endringspotensialet er begrenset).",

Her cognitive style is characterised by an inability to see connections, or to generalise. She demonstrates egocentric thinking when she keeps bringing up the evil child welfare services and when referring to how her parents and everyone else find it incomprehensible that the child was taken into care. I refer to the statement by the psychologist from [the parent-child institution] that \u2018the mother makes statements that are difficult to attach any meaning to.\u2019 The view that I have formed of [the first applicant] during our conversations is that she has a fragmented view of situations, meaning that different episodes are understood as individual episodes that have no connection. Accordingly, guidance is perceived as criticism, good advice as scolding etc. This inability to generalise is characteristic of [the first applicant]\u2019s thinking. She also lacks the capability of abstract thinking and formal thought operations. It is difficult for her to think forwards and backwards in time. Hence, it is not easy to get an answer as to what ideas she has regarding a possible return of the child. She makes some general statements, for example that she must ask what he likes to eat and whether he watches children\u2019s TV, whereas she does not offer any reflections on what special measures should be taken relating to the child\u2019s emotional stress if he were to be moved. When I ask what the foster mother should do to help during the process of returning the child, [the first applicant] has no constructive suggestions. What she wants, however, is \u2018that she (the foster mother) should feel as shitty as I have for the past year\u2019. Such a statement, combined with the manifest hostility (uttalt fiendtlighet) during the contact sessions, does not bode well for co-operation with either the foster home or the child welfare services should the boy be returned.",

This is also in line with the psychologist [M.S.]\u2019s observations. The atmosphere between the adults may also become less tense when the case has been legally resolved and some time has passed. The fact that the contact sessions will become less frequent than under the previous arrangement will also reduce the stress for the child.

The first applicant had complained early on about the staff from the child welfare services, who, in return, had met her wish to be assigned a new supervisor, but nothing had changed in the first applicant\u2019s attitude. The amount of contact had been increased to three times a week in accordance with the City Court\u2019s judgment (see paragraph 54 above), and X had had strong reactions to this. The director of the child welfare services further stated that they understood that the situation was difficult for the first applicant and had offered her help (see, inter alia, paragraph 48 above). With respect to the contact sessions, they had tried several alternatives. They had at first carried out the sessions in a meeting room at their offices, where the supervisor and foster mother could sit at a table some distance away from the first applicant and X, though in a manner that enabled them to intervene if supervision were necessary. The first applicant had complained about this solution. There had then been some sessions in the foster home, but the foster mother had found this difficult because the atmosphere was very bad and they wanted the foster home to be a secure environment for X. Thereafter they had borrowed an apartment designated for purposes such as contact sessions. This had also not suited the first applicant, who had again complained. They had then gone back to having visits at the child welfare services\u2019 offices, where a new room for such purposes had since been made available.",

The visits between X and the first applicant had not worked well. She had had outbursts during the visits and had left before the time was up. Afterwards X had reacted negatively. The first applicant and her mother had manifested a very negative attitude towards the child welfare services. The first applicant had claimed that the child welfare services assisted them in taking care of the baby, whereas the truth was that they had denied the child welfare services access to their home and, accordingly, no assistance measures had been implemented. It had, admittedly, been the child welfare services that had taken the initiative to petition for adoption, but this was their duty in a case such as the present. It was better for X to be offered the firm attachment to the foster home that an adoption would give him. The municipality stressed that it was not the first applicant\u2019s epilepsy or her IQ that gave reason to take measures, but her immaturity and actual lack of caring skills. The psychologist, K.M., engaged by the first applicant (see paragraph 98 below) should not be allowed to give evidence.

It also noted that the child welfare services in the couple\u2019s current municipality were conducting an ongoing inquiry concerning the mother\u2019s ability to care for Y. A staff member of the child welfare services in that new municipality had testified at the oral hearing, stating that they had not received any reports of concern other than the one from the child welfare services in the first applicant\u2019s former municipality. As part of their inquiry they had made observations at the first applicant\u2019s home. They had observed many good aspects but also that the parents might need some help with routines and structure. The City Court found that this indicated that the child welfare services in the municipality to which the first applicant had moved considered that the parents could give Y adequate care if assisted by the child welfare services.

If his emotional development in the future were to be sound, the carer would have to be aware of that and take it into account. When the first applicant gave evidence in court, she had clearly shown that she did not realise what challenges she would face if X were to be moved from the foster home. She could not see his vulnerability, her primary concern being that he should grow up \u201cwhere he belonged\u201d. The first applicant believed that returning him would be unproblematic and still did not understand why the child welfare services had had to intervene when he was placed in the emergency foster home. She had not wished to say anything about how she thought X was developing in the foster home. In the City Court\u2019s view, the first applicant would not be sufficiently able to see or understand X\u2019s special care needs, and if those needs were not met, there would be a considerable risk of abnormal development.",

The City Court considered that a possible reason for that was that the boy was vulnerable to inexpedient interaction and information that was not adapted to his age and functioning. The first applicant\u2019s emotional outbursts in situations during the contact sessions, for example when X had sought out his foster mother and called her \u201cMummy\u201d, were seen as potentially frightening (skremmende) and not conducive to X\u2019s sound development.",

Nothing had emerged during the City Court\u2019s consideration of the case to indicate that the first applicant had developed a more positive attitude to the child welfare services or to the foster mother, beyond a statement made by her to the extent that she was willing to cooperate. She had snubbed the foster mother when she had said hello during the contact sessions and had never asked for information about X. The first applicant had left in frustration forty minutes before the last visit had been scheduled to end. Everyone who had been present during the contact sessions had described the atmosphere as unpleasant. The City Court considered that one possible reason why the first applicant\u2019s competence at contact sessions had not improved was that she struggled so much with her own feelings and with missing X that it made her incapable of considering the child\u2019s perspective and protecting him from her own emotional outbursts. An improvement was contingent upon her understanding X and his needs and on her being willing to work on herself and her own weaknesses. The first applicant had not shown any positive developments in her competence in contact situations throughout the three years she had had rights of contact. The fact that her parents had a remarkably negative attitude to the municipal child welfare services did not make it any easier for her.",

He believed that the previous assessments of the first applicant\u2019s ability to provide care had at that time been incorrect, and argued before the City Court that the best outcome for X would be to be returned to his biological mother. However, the City Court stated that the psychologist K.M.\u2019s arguments had been based on research conducted in the 1960s, and found them to be incompatible with recent infant research.

It did not find reason to consider other arguments regarding her ability to provide care in more detail, as returning X to her was in any case not an option owing to the serious problems it would cause him to be moved from the foster home. The City Court agreed at this point with the Board in its finding that X had developed such an attachment to his foster parents, his foster brother and the general foster home environment that it would lead to serious problems if he had to move. X\u2019s primary security and sense of belonging were in the foster home and he perceived the foster parents as his psychological parents. On those grounds the care order could not be revoked.",

At the same time, it had been emphasised in several Supreme Court judgments that removal of parental responsibilities was a very invasive decision and that therefore strong reasons were required for making such a decision (see, inter alia, paragraph 125 below). The requirements in respect of adoption were even more stringent. However, the questions of withdrawal of parental responsibilities and consent to adoption had to be seen in conjunction, since the primary reason for withdrawing parental responsibilities would be to facilitate adoption. The court also took into consideration that if the first applicant retained her parental responsibilities, she might engage in conflicts in the future about the rights that such responsibility entailed, such as exposing the child on the Internet.",

In the present case the decisive factor was therefore whether adoption was in X\u2019s best interests under letter (b), and whether consent for adoption should be given on the basis of an overall assessment. Regarding that assessment, several Supreme Court judgments had stated that strong reasons must exist for consenting to adoption against the will of a biological parent. There must be a high degree of certainty that adoption would be in the child\u2019s best interests. It was also clear that the decision must be based not only on a concrete assessment, but also on general experience from child-psychology research.

In the report it was stated, inter alia, that the parents had stated early on that they would accept advice and guidance if the child welfare services so recommended. The mother had stated that she had had a bad experience with the \u201cbaby team\u201d, but that she could accept help from them if another person on the team was appointed to be her contact. In the report it was further stated that the child welfare services considered that it had observed two parents who showed that they wanted the best for their child. The first applicant played with the child, talked to her and engaged actively with her. On the basis of all the information contained in the observations, the child welfare services considered that the parents had to work on routines, cleanliness and involvement with the child. The parents accepted that a social worker be assigned to help them in the home.",

The High Court stated that the case did not raise any new legal issues of importance for the uniform application of the law. With regard to whether new information had emerged, the court noted that the assessment dated 21 March 2012 had been made by, inter alia, a person who had testified before the City Court and that the document would not change the outcome of the case. The first applicant\u2019s caring skills had been thoroughly examined in connection with the Board\u2019s processing of the case and no new information had emerged that indicated changes in that respect. Moreover, the City Court\u2019s reasons were convincing and the High Court observed that the first applicant had not asked for an expert witness to be heard in the City Court and had not given any reasons as to why it was necessary to appoint an expert before the High Court. As had just been mentioned, there was no new information that indicated any changes in her caring skills. Thus there were no serious flaws in the City Court\u2019s judgment or procedure and no reasons for granting leave to appeal.",

In that document it was concluded that a positive development had started and that the social worker should continue to assist the family. The first applicant argued that the City Court had relied more on older documents than on the circumstances at the time of its judgment and had disregarded the fact that its judgment would have the effect of depriving Y of contact with X.

As to the first applicant\u2019s argument that the City Court had not based its decision on the circumstances at the time of its judgment, the municipality pointed to the fact that five out of the eight witnesses they had called, and all the witnesses called by the first applicant, had given evidence before the City Court on the circumstances as they were at that time. They further stated that Y would not be deprived of contact with X as long as the first applicant accepted X\u2019s foster home and contributed to making it a good experience for the children. As to Y\u2019s father, it was argued that it had emerged from his testimony before the Board and City Court that he knew little about X\u2019s placement in care and about the challenges surrounding the contact sessions. The municipality also submitted that they would argue before the Supreme Court that X\u2019s right to respect for his family life was also protected by Article 8 of the Convention and that his need for stability in the foster home and good care would be best ensured if he were adopted.",

Norway inadmissible (see Johansen v.\u00a0Norway (dec.), 12750/02, 10 October 2002). The Supreme Court reiterated that the requirement that adoption be in the child\u2019s best interests, as set out in section 4-20 of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph 122 above), meant that \u201cstrong reasons\u201d (sterke grunner) must be present in order for consent to adoption to be given contrary to the wish of the biological parents. In addition, the Supreme Court emphasised that a decision of this kind had to be based on the concrete circumstances of each case, but also take account of general experience, including experience from research into child psychology or child psychiatry. The Supreme Court examined the general principles in the case-law of the Strasbourg Court and concluded that the domestic law was in conformity with those principles: an adoption could only be authorised where \u201cparticularly weighty reasons\u201d were present. That case was subsequently brought before the Court, which found no violation of Article 8 of the Convention (see Aune, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037, for a recapitulation of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the general principles developed in the case-law of the Supreme Court and the Court).",

Family ties were protected by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 102 of the Constitution. Adoption was also an intrusive measure for the child and could, under Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (see paragraph 134 below), accordingly only be decided when in his or her best interests. However, where there were decisive factors from the child\u2019s point of view in favour of adoption, the parents\u2019 interests would have to yield, as had been provided for in Article 104 of the Constitution and Article 3 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (ibid.). Reference was made to Aune, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066, where the Court had stated that an adoption could only be authorised where justified by \u201can overriding requirement pertaining to the child\u2019s best interests\u201d, which corresponded to the standard of \u201cparticularly weighty reasons\u201d as established by the Supreme Court in the judgment that had been scrutinised by the European Court of Human Rights in Aune (see paragraph\u00a0125 above).",

In the proposal it had been suggested that the child welfare services had developed a reluctance to propose adoptions in the aftermath of the Court\u2019s finding of a violation in Johansen, cited above, even though research had shown that it was in a child\u2019s best interests to be adopted rather than experience a continuous life in foster care until reaching their majority. The Supreme Court interpreted the proposal as emphasising that the child welfare services should ensure that adoption would actually be proposed where appropriate, but that the proposal did not imply that the legal threshold, under Article 8 of the Convention, had changed. The Supreme Court added that the general information obtained from research on adoption was relevant to the concrete assessment of whether an adoption should be authorised in an individual case.",

The rules had been incorporated into section 4-20a of the Child Welfare Act, which had been in force since 2010. They required that an \u201copen adoption\u201d be in the child\u2019s best interests and that the adoptive parents consent (see paragraph 122 above). It observed that the legislature\u2019s reasons for introducing the system of \u201copen adoptions\u201d had been to secure the child stable and predictable surroundings in which to grow up, while at the same time ensuring some contact with its biological parents where this would be in the child\u2019s best interests. The child would thus have all the benefits of the adoption, while still having contact with its biological parents. The Supreme Court found that the introduction of the system of \u201copen adoptions\u201d had not meant that the legal threshold for authorising adoptions had been lowered. However, in some cases further contact between the child and the biological parents could mitigate some of the arguments against adoption. Reference was made to Aune, cited above, \u00a7 78.",

Norway, no. 27496/15, \u00a7 148, 26 April 2018, had stressed the strict procedural requirements that must be met by the domestic decision-making authorities in cases concerning adoption. When summarising the subject of its review, the Supreme Court stated that the best interests of the child were the most important and weighty concerns when deciding the adoption issue. As adoption was such a radical and irreversible measure, it could only be justified \u2013 from the child\u2019s point of view \u2013 by particularly weighty reasons. These grounds had to be balanced against the consequences of adoption for the child\u2019s contact with its biological parents in the individual case. Where there had been little or no contact between the parents and the child, the concern for protection of their family life would be given less weight than in cases where a more normal family life had existed.",

Article 8 covered both the best interests of the child and the right of the parents to be assisted by the State in staying or being reunited with their children. The child welfare systems should not disregard the existence of the biological parents\u2019 rights, which should be duly taken into account and balanced against the best interests of the child, rather than minimised to the point of being ignored.",

It follows that family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and that everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to \u201crebuild\u201d the family (see Gnahor\u00e9, cited above, \u00a7 59). On the other hand, it is clearly also in the child\u2019s interest to ensure its development in a sound environment, and a parent cannot be entitled under Article 8 to have such measures taken as would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see, among many other authorities, Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, \u00a7 136; Elsholz v.

An important international consensus exists to the effect that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child (see Article 9 \u00a7 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, recited in paragraph 134 above). In addition, it is incumbent on the Contracting States to put in place practical and effective procedural safeguards for the protection of the best interests of the child and to ensure their implementation (see the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment No. 14 (2013) on the right of the child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration, paragraphs 85 and 87, quoted at paragraph 136 above).",

Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7 81, Series A no.\u00a0130). The above-mentioned positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the competent authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child (see, for example, K. and T. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 178). In this type of case the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent with whom it does not live (see, inter alia, S.H. v.\u00a0Italy, no. 52557/14, \u00a7 42, 13 October 2015). Thus, where the authorities are responsible for a situation of family breakdown because they have failed in their above-mentioned obligation, they may not base a decision to authorise adoption on the grounds of the absence of bonds between the parents and the child (see Pontes v. Portugal, no. 19554/09, \u00a7\u00a7 92 and 99, 10 April 2012). Furthermore, the ties between members of a family and the prospects of their successful reunification will perforce be weakened if impediments are placed in the way of their having easy and regular access to each other (see Scozzari and Giunta, cited above, \u00a7 174; and Olsson (No.\u00a01), cited above, \u00a7 81). However, when a considerable period of time has passed since the child was originally taken into public care, the interest of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited (see K. and T. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 155).",

However, consideration of what is in the best interests of the child is in every case of crucial importance. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned, often at the very stage when care measures are being envisaged or immediately after their implementation. It follows from these considerations that the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities for the regulation of the care of children and the rights of parents whose children have been taken into public care, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see, for example, K. and T. v.\u00a0Finland, cited above, \u00a7 154; and Johansen, cited above, \u00a7 64).",

The Court thus recognises that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of taking a child into care (see, for example, K. and T. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 155; and Johansen, cited above, \u00a7 64). However, this margin is not unfettered. For example, the Court has in certain instances attached weight to whether the authorities, before taking a child into public care, had first attempted to take less drastic measures, such as supportive or preventive ones, and whether these had proved unsuccessful (see, for example, Olsson (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a072-74; R.M.S. v.

A stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by the authorities on parental rights of access, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between the parents and a young child are effectively curtailed (see K. and T. v.

What has to be determined is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and notably the serious nature of the decisions to be taken, the parents have been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide them with the requisite protection of their interests and have been able fully to present their case (see, for example, W.\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 64; T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028945/95, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2001V (extracts); Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, \u00a7 139; and Y.C. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a04547/10, \u00a7 138, 13\u00a0March 2012). From the foregoing considerations it follows that natural parents\u2019 exercise of judicial remedies with a view to obtaining family reunification with their child cannot as such be held against them. In addition, in cases of this kind there is always the danger that any procedural delay will result in the de facto determination of the issue submitted to the court before it has held its hearing.

There was no reason to consider in further detail any other arguments regarding the first applicant\u2019s ability to provide care, since returning X to her was in any event not an option owing to the serious problems it would cause him to be moved from the foster home (see paragraph 106 above).",

In so far as the question of caring skills is concerned, the following findings of the Board are noteworthy in this context. There was nothing to indicate that the first applicant\u2019s caring skills had improved since the High Court\u2019s judgment of 22 April 2010. She had not realised that she had neglected X and was unable to focus on the child and what was best for him. Whilst note had been taken of the information that the first applicant had married and had had a second child, this was not decisive in respect of her capacity to care for X. He was a particularly vulnerable child and had experienced serious and life-threatening neglect during the first three weeks of his life. The Board had also taken account of the experience during the contact sessions. Moreover, since X had lived in the foster home for three years and did not know the first applicant, returning him to her would require a great capacity to empathise with and understand him and the problems that he would experience. Yet the first applicant and her family were completely devoid of any such empathy and understanding (see paragraph 90 above).",

However, the process leading to the withdrawal of parental responsibilities and consent to adoption shows that the domestic authorities did not attempt to perform a genuine balancing exercise between the interests of the child and his biological family (see paragraphs 207 and 208 above), but focused on the child\u2019s interests instead of trying to combine both sets of interests, and moreover did not seriously contemplate any possibility of the child\u2019s reunification with his biological family. In this context, the Court, in particular, is not persuaded that the competent domestic authorities duly considered the potential significance of the fact that at the time when the first applicant applied to have the care order lifted or, in the alternative, to be granted extended contact rights she was going through substantial changes in her life: in the same summer and autumn as the impugned proceedings commenced she married and had a second child. In this regard, as the City Court\u2019s decision was largely premised on an assessment of the first applicant\u2019s lack of capacity to provide care, the factual basis on which it relied in making that assessment appears to disclose several shortcomings in the decision-making process.",

The Board, in its decision of 2\u00a0March 2009, and the High Court, in its judgment of 22 April 2010 (overturning the City Court\u2019s judgment of 19 August 2009), had relied on the consideration that it was most likely that the foster care arrangement would be a long-term one, and that X would grow up in the foster home (see paragraphs 31, 43 and 75 above). The High Court stated that contact sessions could thus serve as a means of maintaining contact between the mother and son, so that he would be familiar with his roots. The purpose was not to establish a relationship with a view to the child\u2019s future return to the care of his biological mother (ibid.). As regards the implementation of the contact arrangements, the Court also notes that these had not been particularly conducive to letting the first applicant freely bond with X, for example with regard to where the sessions had been held and who had been present. Although the contact sessions had often not worked well, it appears that little was done to try out alternative arrangements for implementing contact. In short, the Court considers that the sparse contact that had taken place between the applicants since X was taken into foster care had provided limited evidence from which to draw clear conclusions with respect to the first applicant\u2019s caring skills.",

Those were the report by psychologist B.S. and family therapist E.W.A, ordered by the child welfare services and concerning X\u2019s reactions to the contact sessions in the beginning of September 2009 (see paragraph\u00a058 above), and the report by psychologist M.S., who had been appointed by the High Court on 15 November 2009 (see paragraph 61 above). The former dated back to 20 February 2010 and the latter to 3 March 2010 (see paragraphs\u00a062 and 63 above respectively). When the City Court delivered its judgment on 22 February 2012, both reports were two years old. Indeed, alongside other witnesses such as family members, psychologists B.S. and M.S. also gave evidence during the hearing held by the City Court in 2012 (see paragraph 98 above). However, the two psychologists had not carried out any examinations since those prior to their reports dating back to early 2010 and only one of the reports, the one by psychologist M.S., had been based on observations of the interplay between the applicants, and then only on two occasions (see paragraph 63 above).",

While it would generally be for the domestic authorities to decide whether expert reports were needed (see, for example, Sommerfeld, cited above, \u00a7 71), the Court considers that the lack of a fresh expert examination substantially limited the factual assessment of the first applicant\u2019s new situation and her caring skills at the material time. In those circumstances, contrary to what the City Court seems to suggest, it could not reasonably be held against her that she had failed to appreciate that repeated legal proceedings could be harmful for the child in the long run (see paragraphs 104 and 218 above).",

It also contained barely any analysis of the nature of his vulnerability, beyond a brief description by experts that X was easily stressed and needed a lot of quiet, security and support, and stating his resistance to and resignation toward having contact with the first applicant, notably when faced with her emotional outbursts (see paragraphs\u00a0101 to 102 above).

On 17\u00a0October 2008 the authorities decided to place the baby in a foster home on an emergency basis, allowing the mother to visit her son for up to one and a half hours per week. By decision of the County Social Welfare Board of 2 March 2009 he was taken into ordinary foster care, and the duration of the mother\u2019s contact was set at two hours, six times per year. This decision was revoked by the City Court, but the High Court, in a judgment of 22\u00a0April 2010, upheld the Board\u2019s decision on compulsory care and reduced the mother\u2019s contact rights to four two-hour visits per year. The child remained in foster care until the Board decided on 8 December 2011 to remove the mother\u2019s parental authority and to authorise the foster parents to adopt him. Upon an appeal by the first applicant, the City Court on 22\u00a0February 2012 upheld that decision, which became final with the Supreme Court Appeals Board\u2019s decision of 15 October 2012.",

In the present case, however, this ultimate aim was absent from the outset of the domestic proceedings. On 21 November 2008 \u2013 two months after the child\u2019s birth and one month after issuing the care order \u2013 the Office for Children, Youth and Family Affairs stated that the boy would need \u201cstable adults who can give him good care\u201d (see paragraph 30).

In order for the foster care order to be revoked, the parents have to show that it is \u201chighly probable\u201d that they would be able to provide the child with proper care. Such a requirement is problematic in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law and the State\u2019s duty to take measures in order to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible (see paragraph 208). The Child Welfare Act also seems to grant the authorities unfettered discretion.

However, the judgment does not as such deal with the shortcomings in the period from the issuing of the care order in October 2008 until the Board\u2019s decision of November 2011. These flaws are briefly mentioned in paragraphs 220 and 221, but solely in order to explain the shortcomings that occurred in the proceedings before the City Court in 2012, particularly the fact that the sparse contact which occurred between the applicants had provided only limited evidence from which to draw clear conclusions with regard to the mother\u2019s caring skills.

It was confronted with a kind of fait accomplis. At that stage the balancing exercise between the interests of the child and those of his biological family would almost inevitably have led to the result of the child remaining with his foster family. As confirmed by the experts and accepted by the court, the child had developed such an attachment to his foster parents, his foster brother and the general foster home environment that it would entail serious problems if he had to move, since his primary security and sense of belonging were in the foster home and he perceived the foster parents as his psychological parents (see, in particular, paragraph\u00a0106 of the judgment).",

The complexity of the issues, the dynamics of the underlying factual and legal developments and the diversity of the values and contextual conditions prevailing in these matters have all contributed to a situation where, at present, the general principles as set out by the Court are riddled not only with some inevitable ambiguities but also with some undeniable tensions and outright contradictions, \u201cinternally\u201d as well as in relation to the relevant specialised legal instruments, particularly the International Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).",

There is indeed no doubt that the removal of a child from his or her natural parents cannot be justified by a finding that such a measure would enable the child to be placed in a more beneficial environment for his or her upbringing. The principle according to which the removal of a child from the care of his or her natural parent(s) is subject to a test of necessity in terms of the child\u2019s best interests and is available only as a measure of last resort is uncontroversial.

The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the competent authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child (see paragraph 105 of the Chamber judgment). Similarly, according to the present judgment, \u201cregard for family unity and reunification... are inherent considerations in the right to respect for family life under Article 8\u201d and, \u201cin the case of an imposition of public care restricting family life, a positive duty lies on the authorities to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible\u201d (see paragraph 205).",

The tension referred to above should be neither overemphasised nor ignored. It is always the case that efforts must be made to reconcile the rights of each of the individuals concerned. There are, however, inevitable limits to the possibilities available for such reconciliation. Consequently, it may ultimately be necessary to decide which consideration takes precedence.

Thus, it has held that when a considerable period of time has passed since the child was originally taken into public care, the interest of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited (see K. and T. v. Finland [GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7 155, ECHR 2001 VII).

Nor can it be overlooked that the care measures were triggered because the assistance provided, although intensive, proved to be unsuccessful. Instead, extremely serious circumstances arose which rendered the care measures necessary for the protection of the child\u2019s life and health. The facts of the case as recounted in the present judgment provide plenty of insight into the challenges faced by the domestic authorities. In particular, it is to be noted that although the first applicant did not contest the High Court\u2019s care order of 2010, she appears not to have realised why any of the imposed measures had been deemed necessary, and continued to perceive the authorities\u2019 actions as a \u201cconspiracy\u201d against her (see paragraphs 77, 90 and 101 of the present judgment).

The domestic court was informed of the positive developments in the mother\u2019s situation, and it was not in dispute that, together with her husband and assisted by a social worker, she was capable of taking care of her daughter. However, given the concurrent findings by the County Board and the City Court regarding the mother\u2019s striking lack of empathy and understanding with regard to X and the challenges entailed for the latter if he were to be returned to her care (see paragraphs 90 and 101 of the present judgment), together with his strong social and psychological attachment to his foster parents, we are unable to share the conclusion that the lack of a new expert examination could, in the circumstances of the present case, be considered a significant shortcoming in the domestic decision-making process.",

When a serious conflict has arisen between a natural parent and the State\u2019s child-welfare authorities over the child\u2019s interests, the reality is that neither those authorities nor the parent whose acts or omissions are at issue can be regarded as detached from that conflict.

The facts of the case as established by the domestic courts show that during her first pregnancy the first applicant was identified as requiring assistance and support once the child would be born. Having given birth, she was accommodated in a specialised facility with a view to receiving such assistance and support, foreseen as lasting for three months. Even in the early days of this stay, the professionals in charge of the facility grew increasingly concerned about the mother\u2019s ability to care for the infant and satisfy his basic needs, including feeding and hygiene. The situation was serious, as baby was suffering from dramatic weight loss. The staff were forced to introduce round-the-clock monitoring in order to safeguard him, including measures to wake the mother up at night-time to ensure she would feed her newborn (see paragraph 20 of the present judgment). However, less than three weeks into a stay scheduled to last three months, the mother announced her intention to leave the facility with the baby, which is when and why the initial emergency care measure was imposed (ibid.).",

Yet the facts as they transpire from the case file also show that the mother was unable to understand, even at the time of the impugned proceedings before the City Court, why the measures had been taken, and was unaware that there had been any neglect of the baby on her part (see paragraphs 101 and 220 of the present judgment). Instead, she perceived the imposed measures as being based on lies (as per her complaint to the County Governor; see paragraph 77 of the judgment) and characterised them as a conspiracy against herself (statement to the County Social Welfare Board in 2011; see paragraph 90 of the judgment).",

The interests at stake cannot be assimilated with each other; there is a stark tension between them. Neither the fact that the issue raised before the Court concerns a domestic decision to sever the legal ties between the mother and the child, nor the Court\u2019s case-law according to which it is in principle in a child\u2019s interests to preserve family ties, nor the fact that the domestic proceedings were conducted while the mother was vested with parental rights over the child (see paragraphs 156-57) are capable of overriding the existence of a conflict of interests arising from the specific circumstances of the case. In our opinion, such a conflict cannot be disregarded when determining whether the parent may act on behalf of the child throughout the proceedings before this Court.",

If the Court is genuinely to embrace, in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the idea of children as subjects of distinct individual rights and the need to regard the best interests of the child as a primary consideration, it appears necessary to make changes also in the procedural practices.",
