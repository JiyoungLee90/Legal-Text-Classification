Neither could a declaration of bankruptcy eliminate a natural person\u2019s future responsibility for his or her debts. Allowing an adjustment of the overall debts and fixing a payment schedule could help the debtor meet his or her future financial obligations, provided he or she complied with that schedule. Such assistance would also reduce the overall cost to society. The courts should seek to adjust a debt in the manner least detrimental to the creditor and only to the extent that such an adjustment was necessary to remedy the debtor\u2019s financial situation. Since underlying contractual terms should be interfered with as little as possible, the partial or total extinction of a claim should be considered as a very last resort. The possibility of ordering a payment schedule to remain in force for five years would enable the creditors to receive at least partial satisfaction. It was noted that somewhat similar legislation for debt adjustment had been, or was being, enacted in countries such as Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States of America.",

If, as the Government argued, debt adjustment sought to alleviate and prevent social problems, the State should at least abandon its fiscal claims against debtors.

They had emphasised the need to give due consideration to the protection of property provided for in the 1919 Constitution, meaning above all that the weakening of the creditors\u2019 position, although inevitable, should not lead to unreasonable results. It was noted that a private individual was not released from his or her liability to reimburse a debt even when declared bankrupt. The effects of debt adjustment on the position of creditors therefore had to be assessed in the light of their ability to obtain payment from the debtor\u2019s future income and assets. As the debt would be reduced and the debtor freed from his or her liability to reimburse a debt only where debt adjustment by other means was not possible, such an adjustment would not in reality weaken the position of creditors.",

The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule. Both forms of interference defined must comply with the principle of lawfulness and pursue a legitimate aim by means reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 48, ECHR 2002IV).",

Austria, judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 169, p. 27, \u00a7 50). The Court considers that a special justification is required for such interference, but accepts that in the context of the 1993 Act there were special grounds of sufficient importance to warrant it. The Court observes that in remedial social legislation and in particular in the field of debt adjustment, which is the subject of the present case, it must be open to the legislature to take measures affecting the further execution of previously concluded contracts in order to attain the aim of the policy adopted. Furthermore, other Council of Europe member States such as  and  have introduced legislation allowing for the adjustment of debts contracted prior to its entry into force.",

However, the burden imposed by N.\u2019s debt adjustment was shared by several creditors, the applicant\u2019s nominal claim representing merely 8.4% of the total amount of the claims. Moreover, it is obvious that, even before the 1993 Act was passed, the \u201cmarket value\u201d, if any, of the applicant\u2019s claim, that is, the amount which anyone willing to buy the claim would have been ready to pay for it, was much less than its nominal value.",

In these circumstances, the burden imposed on the applicant by the 1993 Act cannot be regarded as excessive.",
