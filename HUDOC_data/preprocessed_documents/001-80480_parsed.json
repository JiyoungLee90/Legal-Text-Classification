However, the use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him or her either when the statements were made or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Sa\u00efdi v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 56, \u00a7 43, and A.M. v. Italy, no. 37019/97, \u00a7 25, ECHR 1999-IX). A conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on statements which the defence has not been able to challenge (see, mutatis mutandis, Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II, p. 472, \u00a7 76). Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see, among other authorities, Bricmont v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, \u00a7 89).",

These features are even more prominent in a case involving a minor. In the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the alleged victim. Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see Baegen v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1995, Series A no. 327-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 44, \u00a7 77). In securing the rights of the defence, the judicial authorities may be required to take measures which counterbalance the handicaps under which the defence labours (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, cited above, p. 471, \u00a7 72, and P.S. v. Germany, no. 33900/96, \u00a7 23, 20 December 2001).",

Before the close of the pre-trial investigation and having contested the allegation that he had improperly touched the child, he noted that the videotape and the written opinion of S. were indirect evidence, which in the light of the Convention had to be treated with extreme care. He stated that leading questions may have been put to T. and that T. would have to be heard in court, should charges be brought. He did not request an additional investigation. As to the proceedings in the District Court and the Court of Appeal, it should first be noted that the applicant did not request T.'s attendance. In view of the apparent absence of cases where counsel for the defence had successfully requested the cross-examination of a child complainant of the same age as the child in the present case, the Court accepts that the applicant could not have obtained T.'s appearance in person before the courts.",
