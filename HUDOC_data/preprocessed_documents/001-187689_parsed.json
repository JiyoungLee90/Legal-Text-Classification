The legislature had deliberately chosen to limit the presumption that an accused cannot defend himself to cases where the competent court had appointed counsel for the victim for the private accessory prosecution in accordance with Articles 397a and 406g \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Code (see paragraph 20 below). There were legitimate reasons for that distinction, given that counsel was appointed for the private accessory prosecutor for victims of certain grave offences or where the victim was not able to safeguard his interests sufficiently, or could not be expected to do so, including in scenarios which gave rise to particular factual or legal difficulties. In the present case, counsel for S. had been appointed by the court only in respect of the civil claims (see paragraph 10 above), but not for the private accessory prosecution, in respect of which counsel had been hired by S. at his own expense (see paragraph 8 above).",

Turning to the circumstances of the case, the Court of Appeal concluded that the applicant was capable of effectively defending himself without counsel and had indeed done so. It considered that the applicant had knowledge of the parts of the file relevant for the decision, which did not give rise to factual or legal difficulties, that the nature of the offences and the potential sentence at stake were not significant, and that the factual background and the taking of evidence were easily understandable.

Firstly, the applicant must lack sufficient means to pay for legal assistance. Secondly, the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d must require that legal aid be granted. The Court takes into consideration several factors to determine whether the interests of justice required that legal aid be granted in the domestic proceedings. This is to be judged by reference to the facts of the case as a whole, having regard, inter alia, to the seriousness of the offence, the severity of the possible sentence, the complexity of the case and the personal situation of the applicant (ibid., \u00a7\u00a778-79, with further references). The principle of equality of arms requires that each party be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent and that he is given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party, with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision (see Zahirovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 58590/11, \u00a7 42, 25 April 2013, with further references). In order to determine whether the aim of Article 6 \u2013 a fair trial \u2013 has been achieved, regard must be had to the entirety of the domestic proceedings conducted in the case (see A.V. v. Ukraine, no. 65032/09, \u00a7 58, 29 January 2015).",

While the applicant alleged that this letter did not contain any references to the possibility of free legal assistance (see paragraph 23 above), which the Government did not contest, it is established that the applicant did comment on S.\u2019s application for legal aid to pursue his civil claims in the context of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 9 above). The Court considers that the applicant must thus have been aware of the possibility to apply for free legal assistance. The lack of appointment of counsel may therefore also be attributed to his failure to lodge an application to that end, which constitutes an important difference to the case of Zdravko Stanev v. Bulgaria (no. 32238/04, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 19, 6\u00a0November 2012), in which the applicant had applied for, and had been refused, free legal assistance.",

The applicant did furthermore not argue that he had not been given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed by either the public prosecutor or S. in the proceedings before the District Court. In fact, it is not in dispute that he was given access to the file and that he made submissions on multiple occasions (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 11 above).",

To arrive at that conclusion, it examined the applicant\u2019s knowledge of the file, the level of factual or legal difficulty of the case, the nature of the offences, the severity of the potential sentence, the complexity of the taking of evidence, the scope of activity of S.\u2019s counsel, and the applicant\u2019s capacity to safeguard his legal interests on his own. The Court cannot discern that the Court of Appeal\u2019s assessment was flawed or that it fell short of the standards set out in the Court\u2019s case-law. It considers that the fact that the domestic courts also dealt with civil claims for damages in the course of criminal proceedings, which was one argument for the finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in the case of Zdravko Stanev (cited above, \u00a7 40), is not in itself sufficient to conclude that the interests of justice required that the applicant be appointed counsel ex officio.",

He could thus have benefited from having the facts of the case established anew before the Regional Court, which would have been competent to examine that appeal, if he had pursued it in the way he had lodged it. However, counsel who had subsequently taken up the applicant\u2019s representation gave notice that the appeal was to be pursued only as an appeal on points of law (see paragraph\u00a013 above). Through this procedural choice the applicant waived the right to have the facts established anew during the appeal proceedings before the Regional Court in the presence of his counsel.",
