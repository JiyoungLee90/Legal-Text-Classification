For that reason, despite acknowledgement of a breach of the Convention, the fact that an applicant has been awarded a sum of money in compensation in the domestic proceedings is not decisive when it comes to determining an applicant\u2019s victim status (see Norbert Sikorski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09699).",

However, the Court is of the opinion that the findings in the aforementioned cases cannot be relied on in the case at hand because of the different nature of the alleged violation. In consequence, the amount of compensation awarded at national level in cases related to different violations of the Convention cannot be regarded as decisive in cases raising issues under Article\u00a03. Additionally, the Polish national system does not provide for any alternative form of redress for a violation of a prisoner\u2019s rights on the grounds of detention in inadequate, overcrowded conditions. Financial compensation is the only post-violation measure available to victims but national law does not limit the amount of compensation (see, a contrario, Stella v. Italy (dec.), no. 49169/09, \u00a7\u00a7 59-63).",

However, taking into account the Court\u2019s case-law regarding the amount of compensation awarded in cases concerning prison conditions where the Court has found a violation of an applicant\u2019s rights protected by Article\u00a03, the compensation awarded to this applicant by the domestic authorities of EUR 1,750 is insufficient and the applicant can still claim to be a victim (see Janusz Wojciechowski v.
