They recommended, however, that contact should also take place outside the mother\u2019s home (at playgrounds, during walks) but in her presence.

It was true that the first decision in respect of contact had been given five years previously, when S.N. had been a baby and when the presence of his mother during contact had been justified by the child\u2019s age. However, the age of the child was not the only element to consider. Other relevant elements were the specifics of the child\u2019s development, his state of health, his disability, the need for his permanent medical rehabilitation and his heavy dependence on his mother and maternal grandparents. The court found that these elements still justified the discreet presence of the mother and at her home during the applicant\u2019s contact visits. It noted that the requested change to the contact arrangements would be too far-reaching, since the applicant wanted to see his son more often, outside S.N.\u2019s place of residence and without the mother being present. The court observed that except for the first two months of the child\u2019s life the applicant had not lived with him or cared for him. The applicant admitted that he had not always kept to scheduled visits. Sometimes the reasons for this had been beyond his control (health\u00a0problems or evening school commitments) and sometimes contact had been obstructed by the mother. However, in consequence, his limited and irregular involvement in the child\u2019s life had adversely influenced the emotional ties between the father and the son.",

The applicant, irrespective of his own and his son\u2019s disability, had an incontestable right to contact with his son. However, the communication problem should be taken into account in regulating the contact arrangements so they would remain as favourable as possible to the child. The court noted that the applicant used mostly sign language (and articulated a few single words), while the child communicated only orally, so communication difficulties naturally arose. For this reason, it was still justifiable that the mother, who was able both to use sign language and communicate orally, should be present during the applicant\u2019s visits. The mother\u2019s presence, which provided the child with a sense of security, could also help him to relax during his meetings with the father. The court disagreed with the applicant that the paternal grandmother could ensure proper communication between him and his son. The issue was not only about interpreting between sign language and speech but also about ensuring security and stability, which could only be provided by the mother. The applicant\u2019s son did not know his paternal grandmother well and so her presence would not compensate for the absence of his mother.",

Noting the detrimental consequences of conflict for families, the texts recommended that the member States introduce or promote family mediation or, where necessary, strengthen existing family mediation. In accordance with paragraph 7 of the Recommendation, the use of family mediation could \u201cimprove communication between members of the family, reduce conflict between parties in dispute, produce an amicable settlement, provide continuity of personal contacts between parents and children, and lower the social and economic costs of separation and divorce for the parties themselves and States\u201d (see also the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice\u2019s Guidelines for a better implementation of the existing recommendation concerning family mediation and mediation in civil matters (CEPEJ (2007)14)).",

The applicant could visit his son only in a room of a surface area no greater than four square metres, even though S.N. had his own bedroom. The applicant wanted to spend more time with his son and felt a strong emotional connection with him. However, the conditions during his visits could not be described as neutral and did not guarantee freedom of communication between the applicant and his son. During visits, the applicant was treated dismissively. The mother and the maternal grandmother did not communicate with each other and with the child in sign language, so the applicant was excluded from any discussion and felt left out. In these conditions, it was really difficult to create closer ties with his son. Furthermore, the district court was aware that the mother was refusing to teach S.N. sign language and that the child consequently could not communicate with the applicant without the assistance of third parties.",

The Court concurs with the position of the domestic courts that regardless of his disability, the applicant had an incontestable right to contact with his son and that the communication issue should have been taken into account in regulating contact arrangements.",

The domestic courts\u2019 solution to the problem was to involve the child\u2019s mother in the contact arrangements, since she was able to communicate both orally and in sign language. However, this solution ignored the existing animosity between the parents and the frequent complaints by the applicant that the mother had attempted to obstruct contact and to marginalise his role. The Court also notes in this context that the development of the relationship between the applicant and his child requires much more time than would be the case in a normal situation, given the difficulties in direct communication and the necessity of translation from and into sign language.",

The Court accepts that the change to the contact arrangements sought by the applicant was possibly too far-reaching, having regard to the relatively limited prior contact between the applicant and his son. It might have been more appropriate to gradually increase the applicant\u2019s contact with his son and to make it more diverse. Nonetheless, the Court finds that the maintenance of the same restricted contact arrangements was likely to entail, with the passage of time, a risk of the severance of the applicant\u2019s relationship with his son (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Gluhakovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

This case is also an illustration of an approach by the Court which has been criticised by legal commentators and separate opinions. The case of Kacper Nowakowski v. Poland is an illustration of the Court\u2019s practice of automatically absorbing Article 14 within the scope of the substantive right with which it must be invoked. In this connection the finding of a violation of Article 8 is a partial answer to the applicant\u2019s complaint.

Respect for difference, the right to preserve identities, and acceptance of deaf people and sign languages as part of human diversity and humanity imply that the recognition of sign language is inseparable from the recognition and acceptance of deaf people\u2019s cultural and linguistic identity. The CRPD also recognises that culture (principle (d), Article 30), identity (principle (h), Articles 24 and 30) and language (Articles 2, 21 and 24) constitute an inseparable triangle.",

The definition of language includes \u201cspoken and signed languages and other forms of non-spoken languages\u201d (Article 2).

It is essential for persons with a hearing disability, as well as for other disabled persons who communicate by nonspoken languages, that their children are also taught to communicate with them.
