At these hearings, the domestic court heard the accused, including the applicants, on several occasions as well as a witness, whose testimony did not have any bearing on the applicants\u2019 case. It also took some minor procedural acts. However, no interlocutory decisions of importance, in particular for the rights of the defence of the applicants, were taken by the domestic court during these hearings. In this connection, the Court notes that after the military judge was replaced by a civilian judge, the domestic court held five more hearings on the merits during which it accepted a third-party intervention and again heard the accused, including the applicants, a number of times. Furthermore, the final submissions of both the public prosecutor and the applicants were read out before the court, composed of three civilian judges. Therefore, taking into account, in particular, the respective importance of the procedural acts which took place before and after the replacement of the military judge, the Court considers that none of the acts in which the military judge participated in the instant case necessitated immediate renewal after his replacement (see, mutatis mutandis, Ceylan\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey, (dec.), no.\u00a068953/01, ECHR 2005-...).",
