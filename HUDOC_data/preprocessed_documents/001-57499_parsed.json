The court was unable to accept this submission: in its judgment of 29 October 1971 it pointed out that there was an almost infinite variation in the relevant background of the children who would be in one way or another affected by the book, so that it was difficult to speak of \"true facts\" in this case. The views of the applicant's witnesses had been those approaching the extreme of one wing of the more broadly varied outlook on the education and upbringing of children, whereas the evidence given on behalf of the prosecution tended to cover the views of those who, although clearly tending in the opposite direction, were less radical. Particularly, when looking at the evidence on behalf of the applicant, the court had been driven to the conclusion that most of the witnesses were so uncritical of the book looked at as a whole, and so unrestrained in their praise of it, as to make them at times less convincing than otherwise they might have been. In summary the court considered that a good deal of the witnesses had been so single-minded in an extreme point of view as to forfeit in a large measure the power to judge with that degree of responsibility which makes the evidence of any great value on a matter of this sort.",

Pornographic stories describe the same sort of thing.\" The court considered that, although it was improbable that young people would be likely to commit sexual offences with animals as a result of this, the possibility that they should practise some other forms of cruelty to one another, for sexual satisfaction, was a real likelihood in the case of a significant number of children if this got into the hands of children at a disturbed, unsettled and sexually excited stage of their lives.

In particular, it is not possible to find in the domestic law of the various Contracting States a uniform European conception of morals. The view taken by their respective laws of the requirements of morals varies from time to time and from place to place, especially in our era which is characterised by a rapid and far-reaching evolution of opinions on the subject. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements as well as on the \"necessity\" of a \"restriction\" or \"penalty\" intended to meet them. The Court notes at this juncture that, whilst the adjective \"necessary\", within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), is not synonymous with \"indispensable\" (cf., in Articles 2 para. 2 (art. 2-2) and 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), the words \"absolutely necessary\" and \"strictly necessary\" and, in Article 15 para. 1 (art. 15-1), the phrase \"to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\"), neither has it the flexibility of such expressions as \"admissible\", \"ordinary\" (cf. Article 4 para. 3) (art. 4-3), \"useful\" (cf. the French text of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) (P1-1), \"reasonable\" (cf. Articles 5 para. 3 and 6 para. 1) (art. 5-3, art. 6-1) or \"desirable\". Nevertheless, it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the reality of the pressing social need implied by the notion of \"necessity\" in this context.",

However, it is so decisive for the question of whether or not there has been a violation in this case that my view on this point of detail has compelled me to vote against paragraph 1 of the operative provisions of the judgment. I am not convinced that the measures taken by the British authorities, including the judgment of the Inner London Quarter Sessions, were \"necessary\", within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), for the achievement of their aim, namely the protection of morals. Paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) allows the States to subject the exercise of everyone's right to freedom of expression to restrictions and penalties only if they are measures necessary, in a democratic society, for certain aims considered to be legitimate exceptions to the right guaranteed by paragraph 1 (art. 10-1). These aims include the protection of morals which is relied on by the Government. In the absence of one of the factors which, when found in combination, entitle the State to avail itself of the exception to the right to freedom of expression, paragraph 2 (art. 10-2) does not apply and the individual's right must be respected without any interference. However, my interpretation of the word \"necessary\" and my conception of its application to the impugned measures do not, in part, coincide with the Court's view. They have thus led to my contrary vote although I entirely approve the other reasons contained in the judgment and, inter alia, the opinions expressed on certain questions of principle concerning the scope of the Convention in relation to the States' domestic legal systems and the definition of certain elements of the rights guaranteed and the exceptions permitted.",

However, that was not the case. Certainly it cannot be presumed that the measures were not taken in good faith and with the genuine intention of preventing the book's circulation. Above all, the carefully reasoned judgment of the Inner London Quarter Sessions excludes such a presumption. Nevertheless, from an objective point of view, the measures actually taken against the book's circulation could never have achieved their aim without being accompanied by other measures against the 90 per cent of the impression. Yet nothing in the case file, in particular in the addresses of those appearing before the Court, shows that action of this kind was attempted.",
