Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR 2006IX). The extended application of certain restrictions may place a prisoner in a situation that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. However, the Court cannot define a precise length of time beyond which such a situation attains the minimum threshold of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3. On the contrary, the length of time must be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case; this entails, inter alia, ascertaining whether the renewal or extension of the restrictions in question was justified or not (see Enea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a064).",

In this connection the Court accepts the Government\u2019s argument that in accordance with domestic law, the applicant was subjected to certain additional restrictions because he had been sentenced for having committed a serious crime (see paragraph 24 above).

They disputed the applicant\u2019s argument about the lack of an appropriate procedure and argued that this had not prevented the Prosecutor\u2019s Office from examining various complaints lodged by individuals. In this connection the Government submitted a copy of a prosecutor\u2019s warning of January 2013, issued following a complaint by a prisoner about the excessive use of restraint techniques for life-term prisoners. The warning had been issued to the Prisons Administration and concluded that the indiscriminate use of restraint techniques, such as handcuffs, could not be considered lawful. The document also contained a warning about possible criminal responsibility should the violation continue. The Government further contended that the applicant had failed to attach the complaint he had submitted to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office and that he had to raise a separate claim if no response was provided.",

The existing legal framework in 2013 was similar to that in force in 2005; however, the factual nature of the work carried out by prosecutors at the time of the events in issue in the present case, especially in relation to the supervision of prison conditions, has been examined and criticised in a number of other Article\u00a03 cases against Latvia (see, mutatis mutandis, Bazjaks v.

It is not disputed that the applicant used this remedy by lodging a complaint with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office (see paragraph 14 above). In this case \u2013 in contrast to the Leja case, in which the applicant failed to appeal to a higher prosecutor against the decision dismissing his complaint of illtreatment \u2013 it was the Prisons Administration, acting on the supervising prosecutor\u2019s instructions, which carried out the establishment of the facts. As a result, it admitted to shortcomings in communication between the various authorities concerned (see paragraph 15 above), a problem which has also been recognised in other Article\u00a03 cases brought against Latvia (see, mutatis mutandis J.L. v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a087). Against this background, the applicant would have expected that after the Prisons Administration had recognised this problem, the search for a solution would continue with the involvement of the Prisons Administration and Prosecutor\u2019s Office, all the more so because the letter from the Prisons Administration to the applicant did not indicate any further appeal procedure for him to pursue (in contrast to Leja, cited above). The facts of the case indicate that nothing happened after the Prosecutor\u2019s Office had been informed about the applicant\u2019s situation. In those circumstances it would not be reasonable to require the applicant to launch another round of complaints on the same issue.",
