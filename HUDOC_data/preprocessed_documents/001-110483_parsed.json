As regards the nature of the surcharges, the relevant provisions of the AMA Act showed, in the Government\u2019s view, that this was primarily a lump-sum payment for additional work to be performed by the AMA, namely conducting formal administrative proceedings, and could not be regarded as a penalty.

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, as recent authority, Sergey\u00a0Zolotukhin v.  [GC], no. 14939/03, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2009).",

Nevertheless the Court does not consider that section\u00a021g of the AMA Act was aimed at singling out a specific group of the population and subjecting them to a particular regime, but rather at adapting a general obligation, that of the payment of taxes and other contributions due as a result of economic activities, to specific circumstances in order to make that obligation foreseeable.

According to the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, the second paragraph of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. must be construed in the light of the principle laid down in the Article\u2019s first sentence. Consequently, an interference must achieve a \"fair balance\" between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, including the second paragraph: there must therefore be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued (ibid, \u00a7 62). That balance will be lacking where the person concerned has to bear an individual and excessive burden (see Wieczorek v. , no. 18176/05, \u00a7\u00a7 59, 8 December 2009).",
