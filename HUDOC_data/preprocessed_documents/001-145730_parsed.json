The Government submitted their own expert report suggesting that the applicant company was worthless at the relevant time on account of the fraudulent nature of its tax management and the related legal risks. More generally, with reference to the case of McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom (27\u00a0September 1995, Series A no. 324), the Government suggested that, given the fraudulent nature, scale and seriousness of the domestic case against the applicant company, any pecuniary award would be inappropriate in the circumstances.",

They also pointed out that the beneficiaries of the Yukos International Foundation were anonymous, that there was a risk of double compensation because some of the applicant company\u2019s shareholders were pursuing legal proceedings in other venues, and that there was no guarantee that the interests of all shareholders would be reflected in the distribution of awards by this entity, rather than the interests of merely some of them, who were likely to be the \u201cleast deserving\u201d.",

In the Government\u2019s view, the risk of possible abuse in the distribution of funds was real.

However, extending the notion of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d to each and every shareholder in a bankrupt company (as the majority has done) would diminish the concept of direct effect (damage). It is common knowledge in corporate law that, under all jurisdictions, a shareholder is not the only stakeholder in a given company (the creditors, the labour collective, management, society, the public authorities, etc., are also stakeholders). Shareholders are normally considered as having no additional privileges in relation to other stakeholders with regard to the distribution of a company\u2019s assets in the event of bankruptcy. This position, namely that of last in the line of stakeholders for a bankrupt company\u2019s assets, makes the link between such an applicant company and its shareholders even more remote and more indirect. An exception should possibly be made where a shareholder has decisive and ultimate power in the company\u2019s governance, using the company\u2019s personality as a corporate instrument (\u201cveil\u201d) for its own business (see, inter alia, G.J. v. Luxembourg, no.\u00a021156/93, \u00a7 24, 26\u00a0October 2000). It is difficult to believe that each of the more than fifty thousand Yukos shareholders who under the majority\u2019s approach deserved compensation pro rata had a personal and specific link with the applicant company, and had decisive and ultimate power in its governance.",

Our respected colleague, when comparing the Court\u2019s pilot judgments with collective actions under American law, stated that the Court cannot satisfy claims from persons who are not direct applicants in the case resolved by it. In contrast, as explained in her paper, under American law a court decision may have a direct effect on those who did not participate in the relevant proceedings. In both concepts the judicial decision relates to the interests of a group of people, whereas to be eligible for an award by the Court the beneficiary must specifically indicate his or her intention to the Court. Unfortunately, we find no reasoning in the just satisfaction judgment as to why this well-established approach to the protection of identical interests of numerous persons may be changed in the present case.

As a result, the majority found (by 4 to 3 votes) in the principal judgment, notwithstanding the interpretation of an allegedly unclear statutory provision provided by the national Constitutional Court, that a delay of three and a half months (which we believe is an insignificant overstepping of the 3-year time-bar in the circumstances of this case) amounted to a breach of the Convention requirement of legality (the statutory provision did not meet the criteria of reasonable clarity). The majority decided that mala fide behaviour by a taxpayer had not been specified or implied with the required level of certainty in Russian law, and that therefore the courts did not have sufficient legal grounds to prolong the term accordingly.",

The majority argued that the total amount of the fee was disproportionate in terms of compensating the cost which might have been incurred by the State to facilitate enforcement. This argument is not based on the specifics of Russian law. As in the principal judgment (\u00a7 655) the majority again used a mistaken interpretation of the nature of the fee (see paragraph 31 of the just satisfaction judgment). It is not compensation for the costs associated with the bailiffs\u2019 actions (which, in that amount, would indeed be disproportionate), but a penalty, the rate of which falls within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation, and which is comparable with similar penalties charged in many other jurisdictions.",

In August 2004 the first-instance court quashed the bailiffs\u2019 decision on imposition of the fee for 2000 as disproportionate (see \u00a7 132 of the principal judgment), although this decision was quashed by the upper courts as erroneous (see \u00a7\u00a0133 of the principal judgment). The applicant company thereby obtained an indication of possible success in cancelling the fee, and at that time it obtained clarification by the Constitutional Court in Ruling no. 13-P of 30 July 2001 to the extent that a reduction of the fee is allowed in the context of Russian law (see \u00a7\u00a0485 of the principal judgment). Regardless of this opportunity, and in contrast to all the other proceedings, the applicant company did not actively challenge the fee imposed for 2001, 2002 and 2003. Thus, it exercised its statutory right to apply for a reduction of the fee for 2002, but this application was withdrawn before the court started considering the application (see \u00a7\u00a0201 of the principal judgment). It seems that the fee for 2003 was not challenged at all (see \u00a7 221 of the principal judgment). Such a development may raise the question of whether the applicant company intended to take the opportunity to preserve its assets for its stakeholders with regard to the amount of the fee, or whether instead it possibly chose the tactic \u201cthe worse, the better\u201d, the effectiveness of which has now been proved by the majority.",
