Furthermore, the penitentiary authorities had taken steps to arrange surgical treatment of the applicant's condition.

The doctors who had examined the applicant had not been prepared to conduct the surgery, nor had they advised where such surgery could be performed. The doctors' and hospitals' refusals to conduct the surgery was based on the anatomic-physiological particularities of the blood supply to the vascular tumour which had formed at the time of the tumour onset. Given these particularities, radical treatment would be extremely dangerous for the applicant's life. Accordingly, the authorities had taken every measure to ensure adequate medical assistance for the applicant; however, radical treatment had appeared impossible for medical reasons.",

Following the first recommendation the applicant underwent tomography on 8 October 2001 and, after his placement in the facility US-20/12, a panel of the penitentiary doctors found that the radical treatment was not possible within the penitentiary system. In view of this conclusion the authorities began to examine the possibility of the applicant being operated in a civilian hospital. They first referred the applicant to the SMK for a decision on early release on the basis of his state of health, which would facilitate his surgery outside the penitentiary system. However, on 20 September 2002 the SMK found that the applicant's illness was not life-threatening and did not fall under the list of illnesses that could serve as a basis for early release from serving one's sentence.",

This is, in my opinion not supported by the facts of the case. Though radical treatment was recommended in 2001 and 2002, but was ruled out by the doctors in 2003 and 2004, it appears that the different answers to this complex question were caused by conflicting opinions by the doctors, not by the fact that too much time had passed. I would like to note in this respect, firstly, that a relatively short period of time elapsed between the last report recommending surgery, issued in May 2002, and the first report not recommending it, issued in February 2003. Though it is not inconceivable that this period could have been critical for the development of the applicant's condition, there are no medical reports to support that argument. Secondly, the first report of 2001 only recommended radical treatment subject to the tomography and angiography reports. The opinion of 27\u00a0March 2004 also stated that a decision on the possibility of surgical treatment of the tumour could only be made after angiography had been performed. The reports of August and November 2004, which ruled out radical treatment, were therefore based on more complete and accurate information concerning the applicant's condition.",

Given the complex and rare nature of the applicant's condition, it is understandable that the methods for its treatment could be subject to different medical opinions, especially in view of the results of medical tests which were not available to the doctors who had recommended radical treatment. Thus, the domestic authorities were confronted with conflicting medical opinions as to the applicant's treatment, of which the most recent one ruled out radical surgery. The question to be discussed is whether the authorities took all necessary steps in order to ensure that the applicant received adequate treatment.",

Furthermore, they convened a special medical council, the SMK, to decide on the applicant's early release. The SMK found, however, that the applicant's condition did not fall into the category of illnesses that constituted grounds for such release. I have no reason to contest this finding. Subsequently the authorities were presented with medical opinions that stated that surgical treatment was not recommended, because it posed a threat to the applicant's life. However, even after these opinions were issued, the authorities continued to take measures to investigate the feasibility of radical treatment. They contacted several civilian medical institutions in this regard, but all of them refused to accept the applicant for treatment, due to lack of adequate technical facilities and qualified staff.",
