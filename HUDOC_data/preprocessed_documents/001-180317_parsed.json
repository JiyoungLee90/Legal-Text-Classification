This is particularly true with respect to complaints relating to any obligation under the Convention to investigate certain events. As the passage of time leads to the deterioration of evidence, time has an effect not only on the fulfilment of the State\u2019s obligation to investigate but also on the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the Court\u2019s own examination of the case.

In particular, as regards cases of unlawful or violent death, the Court has indicated that an applicant should bring such a case to the Court within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a few years after the events in question (ibid., \u00a7 162). Where there is an investigation of sorts, even if plagued by problems, the Court accepts that applicants may reasonably wait for developments which could potentially resolve crucial factual or legal issues (ibid., \u00a7166).

The applicants alleged that P.M. had been killed by members of the Croatian army. In these circumstances, the State was under an obligation to initiate and carry out an investigation which fulfilled the procedural requirements of Article 2. Civil proceedings which lie at the initiative of the victim\u2019s relatives would not satisfy the State\u2019s obligation in this regard (see, mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2002II). The Court has repeatedly held that the procedural obligation of the State under Article 2 to conduct a thorough, official, effective and prompt investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force cannot be substituted by payment of damages. The Court confirmed that an action for damages, either to provide redress for the death or for the breach of official duty during the investigation, was not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any findings as to the identity of the perpetrators and still less of establishing their responsibility (see Jeli\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 57856/11, \u00a7 64, 12\u00a0June 2014).

It cannot be the case that any assertion or allegation can trigger a fresh investigative obligation under Article 2 of the Convention. Nonetheless, given the fundamental importance of this provision, the State authorities must be sensitive to any information or material which has the potential either to undermine the conclusions of an earlier investigation or to allow an earlier inconclusive investigation to be pursued further (see Brecknell, cited above, \u00a7 70). As to the present case, the Court notes that in August 2015 the police received an anonymous letter giving the names of possible perpetrators. That certainly amounted to important fresh evidence. Furthermore, the Court notes that in August and September 2015 the Zadar police interviewed possible witnesses and compiled reports on actions that had been taken (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above).",
