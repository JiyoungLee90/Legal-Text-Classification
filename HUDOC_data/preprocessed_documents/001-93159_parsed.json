In that interview, J.P. stated, inter alia, that \u201call Hungarians in Vojvodina were colonists\u201d and that \u201cthere were no Croats in that region\u201d. Even though J.P. in no way relied on fascism as defined by the Serbian courts (see paragraph 18 above), it is understandable why the applicant, who himself had different political views, might have interpreted J.P.\u2019s statements as implying a certain degree of intolerance towards national minorities. The fact that he considered it his duty as a journalist to react to such statements publicly is also understandable. Further, the Court considers that calling someone a fascist, a Nazi or a communist cannot in itself be identified with a factual statement of that person\u2019s party affiliation (see, mutatis mutandis, Feldek v.
