Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7 191, ECHR 2005IV). Whilst prolonged removal from association with others is undesirable, the question of whether or not such a measure falls within the ambit of Article 3 of the Convention depends on the particular conditions, the stringency of the measure, its duration, the objective pursued and its effects on the person concerned (see Rohde v. Denmark, no. 69332/01, \u00a7 93, 21 July 2005). Solitary confinement is one of the most serious measures which can be imposed within a prison. In view of the gravity of the measure, the domestic authorities are under an obligation to assess all the relevant factors in an inmate\u2019s case before placing him in solitary confinement (see Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia, no.\u00a01704/06, \u00a7 83, 27 January 2009, and Onoufriou v. Cyprus, no. 24407/04, \u00a7 71, 7 January 2010). In order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness resulting from a decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement, the decision must be accompanied by procedural safeguards guaranteeing the prisoner\u2019s welfare and the proportionality of the measure (see Ramirez Sanchez v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a059450/00, \u00a7\u00a0139, ECHR 2006IX; Onoufriou, cited above, \u00a7 70; and A.L.

Russia, no. 49790/99, \u00a7 68, 5 July 2005). In the case of mentally ill persons, regard must be had to their particular vulnerability (see Aerts v. Belgium, 30 July 1998, \u00a7 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998V; Keenan, cited above, \u00a7 111; Rivi\u00e8re v. France, no. 33834/03, \u00a7 63, 11 July 2006). There are general measures and precautions which will be available to diminish the opportunities for self-harm, without infringing personal autonomy. Whether any more stringent measures are necessary in respect of a prisoner and whether it is reasonable to apply them will depend on the circumstances of the case (see Keenan, cited above, \u00a7 92, and Trubnikov, cited above, \u00a7 70).",

In the Keenan case, the Court found that the imposition on the applicant \u2013 who suffered from a chronic mental disorder, presented a suicide risk and did not receive adequate medical monitoring and treatment \u2013 of a disciplinary punishment of seven days\u2019 segregation in the punishment block amounted to treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Keenan, cited above, \u00a7 116). Similarly, in the case of Renolde v. France, a penalty of forty-five days\u2019 detention in a punishment cell accompanied by a prohibition of visits and of contact with other prisoners imposed on a person with a history of suicide attempts was not compatible with the standard of treatment required in respect of a mentally ill person and constituted inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment (see Renolde v. France, no. 5608/05, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2008 (extracts)). In the case of Ketreb v. France the placement of the applicant \u2013 who had not been diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder but who had previously made two suicide attempts \u2013 in a punishment cell for fifteen days without previous consultation with a psychiatrist or adequate monitoring during his stay there also amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment (see Ketreb v. France, no. 38447/09, \u00a7\u00a7 114 and 115, 19 July 2012).",

He had already made three suicide attempts before the incident in question in the present application. In view of his condition and his history of suicide attempts, the psychiatrist who treated him recommended that he should not be placed in solitary confinement. That recommendation was reiterated by the prison doctor on 5\u00a0May 2005 immediately before the applicant\u2019s placement in a punishment cell for thirteen days, and then again on 8 May 2005 about an hour before the applicant made a new suicide attempt and injured himself. Despite these unequivocal and consistent medical recommendations, the applicant was left in the punishment cell alone. The Court is particularly concerned by the fact that on 8 May 2005, that is to say three days after the commencement of his solitary confinement and immediately after the doctor repeated his recommendation that the applicant should not be left alone, the door to his cell was shut in order to avoid any communication between the applicant and other inmates.",

The decision of 3 May 2005 ordered his placement in a punishment cell (punishment cells are designed to accommodate two inmates), without mentioning solitary confinement. The Court therefore finds that the applicant was placed in a de facto solitary confinement without any objective assessment as to whether or not the measure in question was necessary and appropriate and in disregard to his psychiatrist\u2019s recommendation that such measure should not be applied to him. The applicant\u2019s solitary confinement in a punishment cell therefore amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",
