In reaching this conclusion, the Court does not overlook the fact that the applicant's behaviour was at the origin of at least several adjournments (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). His systematic use of all possible appeal procedures, even where what was at stake for him was of minimal value, undoubtedly prolonged the proceedings. The Court notes, however, that very significant delays, exceeding by far the delays caused by the applicant, were imputable to the authorities. In particular, for a period of approximately five years the authorities were incapable of securing that summons be served on one of the parties, which practically blocked the proceedings (see paragraphs 23-27 and 32 above). Also, failure on the part of judges to prepare for the hearings in good time and non-appearance of court-appointed experts caused additional adjournments that could have been avoided (see paragraphs 22 and 28 above). Finally, the Court also has regard to the global length of the proceedings, which is excessive in itself, in view of the low level of complexity of the case. ",
