This conclusion finds further confirmation in the fact that the newspaper\u2019s editorial board was registered at the first applicant\u2019s official address and that the second applicant occupied the positions of both editor-in-chief of the first applicant and editor-in-chief of the newspaper.

In assessing whether such a \u201cneed\u201d exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This margin of appreciation is not however unlimited, but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among many others, Grinberg v.

Although it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent politicians do, civil servants acting in an official capacity are, like politicians, subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001III). Further, the allegations of misappropriation of public funds were obviously a matter of great public concern and therefore came within the scope of a public debate on a matter of general importance. The Court reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or debates on questions of public interest (see Feldek v.

Under the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, freedom of expression carries with it \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d, which also apply to the media even with respect to matters of serious public concern. Moreover, these \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d are liable to assume significance when there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the \u201crights of others\u201d. Thus, special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

Mere personal conjecture or a subjective perception of a statement as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by it. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Filatenko v.

It is true that the collector of funds was not mentioned by name and that Mr P. did not officially perform that function, as the funds were formally collected by the local administration. However, when read in context, in particular in conjunction with the article\u2019s title and such statements as \u201cthe Chief Federal Inspector\u2019s Office literally pestered them with offers to become sponsors\u201d, the contested statement might convey to an ordinary reader the impression that it was the Chief Federal Inspector Mr P. who was the collector of funds referred to in the contested statement.

The use of the modal verb \u201cmight\u201d suggests that it was a supposition rather than a statement of fact. Indeed, from a grammatical point of view, modality deals with uncertainties and attitudes, rather than certainties and facts. However, it is not necessary to determine this issue because, under the Court\u2019s case-law, even a value judgment must be based on sufficient facts in order to constitute a fair comment under Article 10 (see Jerusalem v.

Although the second applicant claimed that he had obtained that information from some, unnamed, businessmen he knew (see paragraph 27 above), he never attempted to verify the rumours. The Court reiterates in this connection that even public figures may legitimately expect to be protected against the propagation of unfounded rumours relating to their private life (see Standard Verlags GmbH v.  (no. 2), no. 21277/05 \u00a7 53, 4 June 2009). Given that the applicants were unable to adduce sufficient evidence in support of their allegations, the Court considers that they disseminated unverified information about Mr P.\u2019s alleged involvement in extramarital affairs and a gratuitous accusation of misappropriation of public funds. The Court sees no reason to disagree with the domestic courts\u2019 assessment that the contested statement was of such a nature and gravity as to be capable of causing considerable harm to the reputation of Mr P. It therefore finds the statements about Mr P.\u2019s private life and his alleged mismanagement of public funds frivolous and unfounded. The applicants must be therefore taken to have gone beyond the limits of responsible journalism set out in paragraph 60 above.",

In this regard, even appearances may be of some importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public.

The principle of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms requires that each party be given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations made or evidence adduced by the other party and to present its case under conditions that do not place it at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis its opponent (see Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a035376/97, \u00a7\u00a039, 3 March 2000, and Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, \u00a7 33, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0274).",

It is clear from the materials in the Court\u2019s possession that from 9\u00a0September 2002, that is, from the very beginning of the defamation proceedings, the first applicant was represented by counsel Mr K. and Mr R. (see paragraph 15 above). They submitted written pleadings on the first applicant\u2019s behalf and participated in all hearings, including the hearing of 13 September 2002 and the appeal hearings, where they made submissions on behalf of the first applicant. The applicants\u2019 allegation that Mr K. and Mr R. acted on behalf of the editorial board of the Gubernskie Vesti newspaper does not therefore find confirmation in the case file.",

It is therefore not persuaded by the applicants\u2019 argument that the interim decision of 19 September 2002 was the substitution of a defendant in disguise. It is convinced by the domestic court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe judgment of 13\u00a0September 2002 defined the rights of, and imposed obligations on, the first applicant, because no other organisation had been involved in the proceedings\u201d (see paragraph 35 above). The amendment of the defendant\u2019s name was therefore no more than a rectification of a clerical error, correcting a misspelling of the name of the first applicant, which acted as the editorial board of the Gubernskie Vesti newspaper and which had effectively participated as a defendant in the defamation proceedings from their beginning.",

However, he failed to act with reasonable diligence and take the necessary steps to ensure that his case was effectively presented before the court (see, for similar reasoning, Milovanova v.
