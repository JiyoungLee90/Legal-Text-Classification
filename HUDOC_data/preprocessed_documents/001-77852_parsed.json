It observes that no hearing was held between 8\u00a0February\u00a0and\u00a012\u00a0December 1996 due to a 9-month delay in the preparation of a veterinary report. In this connection the Court recalls that experts work in the context of judicial proceedings supervised by a judge, who remains responsible for the preparation and speedy conduct of proceedings Proszak v. Poland, judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII, p. ..., \u00a7\u00a044). Similarly, no hearings were held before the  between 23 June 1997 and 9\u00a0February\u00a01998. Furthermore, the Court observes that there was an approximately 29-month period of inactivity in the proceedings before the Supreme Court between the date of lodging the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal and the delivery of the judgment. The Court can accept that some delays in the procedure before the Supreme Court could be explained by the fact that at the material time the Supreme Court had to deal with an increased workload (see K\u0119pa v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a043978/98, 30\u00a0September 2003). Nevertheless, in the present case the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal lay dormant in the Supreme Court for nearly 29\u00a0months, which constitutes an unreasonable delay (see Doma\u0144ska v. Poland, no.\u00a074073/01, \u00a7\u00a032, 25\u00a0May\u00a02004).",
