The Court normally accepts as self-evident that the death of a witness constitutes a good reason for allowing their previously-given statements to be admitted as evidence without the defence being given an opportunity to cross-examine this witness in person (see, for example, Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103, 121 and 153; Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.

In all of these cases, the death of a witness occurred shortly after the statement had been given at a pre-trial stage of proceedings or, in any event, prior to the conclusion of the first-instance trial. The analysis of these cases clearly shows that the inability of the defence to examine such witnesses could not have been reasonably attributed to a lack of diligence on the part of domestic courts.",

According to the \u201csole or decisive rule\u201d, if the conviction of a defendant is solely or mainly based on evidence provided by witnesses whom the accused is unable to question at any stage of the proceedings, his defence rights are unduly restricted. In this context, the word \u201cdecisive\u201d should be narrowly understood as indicating evidence of such significance or importance as is likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0123 and AlKhawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 131). Where the untested evidence of a witness is supported by other corroborative evidence, the assessment of whether it is decisive will depend on the strength of the supportive evidence: the stronger the other incriminating evidence, the less likely that the evidence of the absent witness will be treated as decisive. However, as Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention should be interpreted in the context of an overall examination of the fairness of the proceedings, the sole or decisive rule should not be applied in an inflexible manner. In particular, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission as evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01. However, because the admission of such evidence carries a significant weight in the assessment of the overall fairness of the proceedings, the Court must subject these proceedings to the most searching scrutiny.",

These counterbalancing factors include measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of the untested evidence. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance to the case. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair will depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors will have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair.",

The absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness cannot, of itself, be conclusive of the lack of fairness of a trial, although it remains a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness, and one which might tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d). Furthermore, given that its concern is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence.",

The Court concludes that the inability of the defence to examine the impugned evidence by personally confronting the witness as required by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d) of the Convention was due primarily to the lack of diligence on the part of domestic courts. For these reasons, the Court holds that there was no good reason for not admitting S.K.\u2019s statement as evidence until after his death.",

Finland, nos. 39481/98 and 40227/98, \u00a7 47, 26 July 2005). The Court further notes that the only other evidence to some extent complementary to the prosecution\u2019s version of events was a statement given by the alleged victim regarding whether the wine press was abandoned and in working condition, while all the other witness statements contradicted it (see paragraph 7 above). The Court finally notes that no material evidence was introduced at the trial. That being so, the Court is satisfied that the S.K.\u2019s statement was a decisive basis for the applicants\u2019 conviction.",

The Court also attaches significant weight to the fact that the lack of diligence on the part of the domestic authorities was a primary reason for the admission of the S.K.\u2019s statement as evidence only after his death and, consequently, the inability of the defence to cross-examine him at the hearing.
