According to the case-law, the latter are best placed to assess the credibility of witnesses and the relevance of evidence to the issues in the case (see, amongst many authorities, Vidal v. Belgium, 22\u00a0April 1992, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 235-B, and Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16\u00a0December 1992, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 247-B). The Court further reiterates that the principle of equality of arms, one of the broader concepts of a fair hearing, requires each party to be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case under conditions that do not place them at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the opponent. The right to adversarial proceedings means in principle the opportunity for the parties to have knowledge of and to comment on all evidence adduced or observations submitted, with a view to influencing the court's decision (see K.S. v. Finland, no. 29346/95, \u00a7\u00a021, 31\u00a0May 2001).",

The applicant himself gave a full statement before the first-instance court and in the appeal proceedings he was given the last word. It also appears that two cross-examinations were organised during the investigation and that during the trial the applicant, through his counsel, could address questions to the witnesses. His requests for witnesses in his defence were given due consideration, and even though it is true that in the appeal proceedings one of his requests was refused, the appellate court provided reasoning for its decision. Moreover, in his appeals the applicant, even though he was represented by counsel, failed to make any complaint in respect of his right to be heard by the courts or to call and question witnesses.",

That right applies not only to oral statements made at the trial hearing but also to documentary material and the pre-trial proceedings. This means that an accused who cannot understand or speak the language used in court has the right to the free assistance of an interpreter for the translation or interpretation of all those documents or statements in the proceedings instituted against him which it is necessary for him to understand or to have rendered into the court's language in order to have the benefit of a fair trial (see, for example, Hermi\u00a0v.\u00a0Italy, 18114/02, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70). The said provision does not go so far as to require a written translation of all items of written evidence or official documents in the procedure. In that connection, it should be noted that the text of the relevant provisions refers to an \u201cinterpreter\u201d, not a \u201ctranslator\u201d. This suggests that oral linguistic assistance may satisfy the requirements of the Convention (see Husain v. Italy (dec.), no. 18913/03, 24 February 2005). The fact remains, however, that the interpretation assistance provided should be such as to enable the defendant to have knowledge of the case against him and to defend himself, notably by being able to put before the court his version of the events (see G\u00fcng\u00f6r v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), no. 31540/96, 17 May 2001). In view of the need for that right to be practical and effective, the obligation of the competent authorities is not limited to the appointment of an interpreter but, if they are put on notice in the particular circumstances, may also extend to a degree of subsequent control over the adequacy of the interpretation provided (see Kamasinski v. , no. 9783/82, \u00a7 74, 19 December 1989; Diallo\u00a0v.\u00a0Sweden (dec.), no. 13205/07, 5 January 2010).",

Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to show that the interpreter provided inaccurate or inadequate translation to the applicant, who never raised any complaint before the domestic authorities in this respect.",

In this respect it is important to note that he lodged an appeal and an appeal on points of law against the judicial decisions convicting him, raising specific complaints, and therefore it does not appear that he had not been aware of their content or that he had been unable to exercise his\u00a0defence rights by exhausting all available domestic remedies (see, mutatis mutandis, Baka v. , no. 30400/02, \u00a7 76, 16 July 2009).",
