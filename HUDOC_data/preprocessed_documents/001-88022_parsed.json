The  found that under the 1874 Recognition Act a religious body had a subjective right to recognition as a religious society provided that the conditions laid down in that Act were met. The rule of law required that such a right be an enforceable one, in other words, that refusal to grant recognition should be subject to review by the Austrian courts and not left to the sole discretion of the administrative authorities. In order to guarantee such a review it was necessary for a negative decision refusing recognition to be taken in the form of a written decision (Bescheid). Under the Austrian legal order, only when taking such decisions were the competent authorities bound to deal with a request by a party, whereas no such obligation existed with regard to decrees (Verordnungen). A positive decision had to be taken in the form of a decree as it not only had effect vis-\u00e0-vis the parties but also vis-\u00e0-vis the general public.",

In particular, before July 1998, the first applicant could not have been established as a legal entity and, thus, could not have entered into legal relations, concluded contracts or acquired assets. The first applicant had, thus far, no internal autonomy, could not hire the necessary religious ministers and was not entitled to perform its pastoral work for believers in hospitals or prisons. The second to fifth applicants, as leading executives of the first applicant, were also limited in exercising their right to freedom of religion. Neither the Basic Law 1867 nor the 1998\u00a0Religious Communities Act provided explicitly for the internal autonomy of a religious community. The  had found (in its judgment of 3 March 2001, B1713/98 \u2013 see paragraph 34 above) that registered religious communities, unlike recognised religious societies, did not enjoy the right to comprehensive organisation and administration of their internal affairs without State interference. Lastly, the applicants contested that they would have had the possibility of forming an association under the Associations Act. They referred to the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding of 1929 (VfSlg. 1265/1929), confirming the administrative authorities\u2019 practice not to allow religious societies to form an association, and thus refusing the request of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses (Ernste Bibelforscher) to set up an association. Thereafter the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had not tried again to form an association, but auxiliary associations (Hilfsvereine) with specialised religious aims had been created. The two examples of associations submitted by the Government were likewise merely auxiliary associations. It was not until the enactment of the 2002\u00a0Associations Act that religious societies had been allowed to set up an association.",

Referring to a judgment of the  (VfSlg. 10.915/1986), the Government contended that the refusal of recognition did not impede the applicants\u2019 exercise of their right to freedom of religion within the meaning of Article\u00a09 of the Convention.

Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, judgment of 25\u00a0May\u00a01993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0260, p.\u00a017, \u00a7\u00a031; and Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no.\u00a024645/94, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR\u00a01999-I). Since religious communities traditionally exist in the form of organised structures, Article 9 must be interpreted in the light of Article 11 of the Convention, which safeguards associative life against unjustified State interference. Indeed, the autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is, thus, an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 affords (see Hasan and Chaush, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062).",

They repeated in essence their above complaints. In particular, the applicants disputed the necessity of the ten-year waiting period, as the recognition of the Coptic Orthodox Church by a specific law in 2003 (see paragraph 45(e) above) proved the contrary. The Coptic Orthodox Church had only existed in  since 1976 and had been registered as a religious community in 1998. The applicants argued that most of the registered religious communities and even most of the recognised religious societies did not fulfil the criterion for the minimum number of adherents, which showed that this requirement was unnecessary for the observance of public duties, contrary to what the Government maintained. Since the first applicant, which was the fifth largest religious community in  and was thus even bigger than most recognised religious societies, also complied with the necessary number of adherents, it should have been recognised a long time ago. Further, the requirement of the use of income and other assets for religious purposes, including charity activities, was discriminatory as it interfered in an unjustified way with the first applicant\u2019s internal administration and organisation, in breach of both Article 9 of the Convention and Article 15 of the Basic Law 1867. The prerequisite of a positive attitude towards society and the State was discriminatory as it was not required in respect of any other natural or legal personality in .

The precondition of the use of income for religious purposes was also provided for under the 1874 Recognition Act (sections 5 and 6) and was thus not new. Since recognised religious societies obtained the status of a legal person under public law, which entailed duties and obligations in the public interest, the requirement of a positive attitude towards society and the State \u2013 meaning acceptance of a pluralistic State and the basic principles of the rule of law, which did not preclude the disapproval of particular provisions for reasons of conscience \u2013 did not appear discriminatory.

Given the number of these privileges and their nature, in particular in the field of taxation, the advantage obtained by religious societies is substantial and this special treatment undoubtedly facilitates a religious society\u2019s pursuance of its religious aims. In view of these substantive privileges accorded to religious societies, the obligation under Article 9 of the Convention incumbent on the State\u2019s authorities to remain neutral in the exercise of their powers in this domain requires therefore that if a State sets up a framework for conferring legal personality on religious groups to which a specific status is linked, all religious groups which so wish must have a fair opportunity to apply for this status and the criteria established must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.",

As the Minister had failed to give a decision, the Ombudsman\u2019s Office, further to a complaint by the applicants, issued a notice on 5 February 1981 finding that the inactivity of the Minister constituted an undesirable state of affairs in public administration (Missstand im Bereich der \u00f6ffentlichen Verwaltung). The applicants pointed out that the  had already found in 1988 (VfSlg.\u00a011.931/1988) that the Ministry was obliged to decide on a request for recognition. The lapse of time of nine years between their first request for recognition in 1978 and the one they submitted in 1987 had already been in breach of the reasonable-time requirement under Article\u00a06 of the Convention. In 1992 the  had again decided that the applicants had a right to obtain a decision and even their complaint about the authority\u2019s inactivity had not resulted in a decision. Only in December\u00a01995 had the  followed the Constitutional Court\u2019s opinion and requested the Minister to give a decision and to submit the case file, but the Minister had failed to comply. It was not until the Administrative Court\u2019s decision of 28\u00a0April 1997 that the Minister had been obliged to take a decision on the request for recognition.

The  and the  had likewise not decided speedily. Moreover, the proceedings were not complex; they only involved one issue, namely the availability of a legal remedy as provided for by Article 13 of the Convention. In addition, the determination of the requirements for recognition was not complicated and did not justify delaying a decision from 1978 until 2008, which would be the first possible date for recognition after the entry into force of the 1998 Religious Communities Act.

Rather, they argued that the first applicant, instead of existing as a legal body having legal personality, preferably that of a religious society, did not have and could not have had legal personality of its own but, on the contrary, had to resort to the subterfuge of availing itself of the legal personality put at its disposal by so-called \u201cauxiliary associations\u201d. If I were persuaded that this had been the only avenue open to the applicants I might have gone along with the majority in finding a breach of Article 9 but I do not find the arguments raised by the applicants in this connection persuasive. In my view there was a reasonable possibility that the first applicant could have directly acquired legal personality as an association (Verein) under Austrian law and that such status would have been by no means inferior to the status of a religious community that was actually conferred on it.",

Lastly, the provision in section 2(4) of this Act, whereby the competent Minister, in the same decision by which he or she registers a religious community, has to dissolve any association whose purpose was to disseminate the religious teachings of the religious community concerned (see paragraph 47 of the judgment), would not have any meaning if an association could not be created with a view to pursuing religious aims, as seems to be the contention of the applicants. Having regard to the contents of the Act as described in detail in the judgment (see paragraphs 47-54), which essentially lays down rules for establishing, monitoring and dissolving a religious community and whose sole purpose is to confer legal personality on it, I cannot see how these rules are substantially different from the ones existing under Austrian law for establishing an association. Thus, given that the applicants had a reasonable possibility of obtaining legal personality for the first applicant even before its registration as a religious community and that even in the absence of this step no interference by the public authorities with the applicants\u2019 exercise of freedom of religion has been alleged, I cannot find that they can claim to be victims of a violation of Article 9 of the Convention.",
