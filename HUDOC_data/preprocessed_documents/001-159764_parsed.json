As regards the applicant\u2019s more frequent visits to his father, the court noted that regular, long-term leave from the house arrest would jeopardise its purpose of securing the applicant\u2019s presence throughout the proceedings. The applicant appealed, arguing that the time period to assist his mother was too short, that his father\u2019s health was deteriorating fast, requiring more frequent visits, that is, every second week, and that he had already submitted the contact details of his mother\u2019s financial institution and workplace.

To this end they must examine all the arguments for and against the existence of a public interest justifying a departure from the rule in Article 5, paying due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, and must set them out in their decisions on applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see, for example, McKay v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2006X).",

Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7 106, 8 February 2005). The risk of absconding has to be assessed in light of the factors relating to the person\u2019s character, his morals, home, occupation, assets, family ties and all kinds of links with the country in which he is being prosecuted (see Becciev v. Moldova, no. 9190/03, \u00a7 58, 4 October 2005).",

However, during the period under consideration, the gravity of charges was the only factor for the assessment of the applicant\u2019s potential to abscond. In particular, in the appeal decision of 6 January 2012, the K\u00faria found that the gravity of charges was decisive compared to the specific circumstances militating in favour of the applicant\u2019s release, such as his health condition (see paragraph 23 above).",

For the Court, the apparent contradiction between the applicant\u2019s abiding by the rules of these permissions and the authorities\u2019 insistence on him being a flight risk was not solved; and the authorities\u2019 reasoning remained limited to the possibility of a severe sentence, which alone cannot be considered sufficient, after a certain lapse of time, to justify continued detention.",

This aspect of the right set out in the first paragraph of Article\u00a09, to hold any religious belief and to change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However, as further set out in Article 9 \u00a7 1, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one\u2019s belief, alone and in private but also to practice in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Leyla \u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2005XI). Nevertheless, Article\u00a09 does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief (see Kala\u00e7 v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 27, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV, and Kosteski v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, no. 55170/00, \u00a7 37, 13 April 2006). In order to count as a \u201cmanifestation\u201d within the meaning of Article 9, the act in question must be intimately linked to the religion or belief. An example would be an act of worship or devotion which forms part of the practice of a religion or belief in a generally recognised form. However, the manifestation of religion or belief is not limited to such acts; the existence of a sufficiently close and direct nexus between the act and the underlying belief must be determined on the facts of each case. In particular, there is no requirement on the applicant to establish that he or she acted in fulfilment of a duty mandated by the religion in question (see Cha\u2019are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a7 73-74, ECHR 2000VII; Leyla \u015eahin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 78)",

At the same time, religious freedom requires that the national authorities take reasonable measures to ensure the access to religious services of persons placed under house arrest, taking into account \u2013 to the extent practically possible \u2013 the specificity of each religion and the religious obligations of the believers. In my view, a stronger emphasis should have been placed upon this obligation. The determination of the scope of this obligation requires that a fair balance be struck between colliding legal goods.
