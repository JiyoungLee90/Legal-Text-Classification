This insistence on the protection of the individual against any abuse of power is illustrated by the fact that Article 5 \u00a7 1 circumscribes the circumstances in which individuals may be lawfully deprived of their liberty, it being stressed that these circumstances must be given a narrow interpretation having regard to the fact that they constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom (see Quinn v.

The requirements of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, with their emphasis on promptness and judicial supervision, assume particular importance in this context. Prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of life-threatening measures or serious ill-treatment which violate the fundamental guarantees contained in Articles\u00a02 and 3 of the Convention (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 76, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). What is at stake is both the protection of the physical liberty of individuals and their personal security in situations which, in the absence of safeguards, could result in a subversion of the rule of law and place detainees beyond the reach of the most rudimentary forms of legal protection.",
