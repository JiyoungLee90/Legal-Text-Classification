The DAA observed that, according to the case-law of the Administrative Court, it amounted to a refusal to undergo a breathalyser test if the person who had been ordered to undergo the test had made four invalid attempts out of five. According to the statements of police officers W. and R. and the paper print outs of the test results, the applicant had been allowed to make much more attempts, namely nine and only one had produced a valid result. When the applicant had claimed that the breathalyser had been defective, police officer R had made himself two attempts using the same mouthpiece as the applicant and both attempts had produced valid results. The DAA also noted that technical tests of the breathalyser had been carried out on 15 May 2000 and on 9 November 2000 and each time the breathalyser had been found fully functioning. On the basis of this evidence it was safe to conclude that the applicant had refused to undergo the breathalyser test. The DAA also ordered that an appeal had no suspensive effect because it was necessary to avoid the risk that a person lacking trustworthiness for road traffic might drive. Moreover the applicant was ordered to follow driver improvement training before his driving licence would be returned.",

He found that according to the paper print out of the breathalyser test the applicant had made nine attempts of which only one had been valid whereas during the other attempts the applicant had not blown sufficient air into the mouth-piece. Thereupon two attempts with the same mouth-piece as used by the applicant had been made by police officer R., which both produced valid results. Thus, there were no indications that the breathalyser did not function properly or that it had not been handled correctly by the police officers who had been specially trained for this task. In such circumstances a request for obtaining a report by a technical expert, without giving clear indications in what the malfunctioning of the breathalyser might have consisted, amounted to an inadmissible request for evidence (Erkundungsbeweis). The Regional Governor concluded that refusing to undergo a breathalyser test was as serious as driving under the influence of alcohol because it prevented the authorities from verifying whether a person was actually drunk. The additional measure imposed on the applicant was therefore justified in order to improve his attitude.",

He further complained about the authority\u2019s assessment of evidence, as the statements of the police officers who had ordered him to undergo the breathalyser test were contradictory and stated that they should be questioned on the precise circumstances in which breathalyser test had been carried out. Lastly he complained that the authority had wrongly applied the law because it should not have refused to obtain the opinion of a technical expert on the functioning of the breathalyser.",

The applicant had failed to raise any substantial arguments against these findings and had not shown that the assessment of the evidence carried out by the authorities was contradictory or implausible. In accordance with Section 39 \u00a7 2 of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofgesetz) the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for a hearing as it found that an oral hearing was not likely to contribute to the clarification of the case.

If a person loses one of these qualities, their driving licence must be withdrawn. When the provisions on the withdrawal of a driving licence were enacted by Parliament, the legislator stated expressly that this measure was a protective measure and not a punishment, and this is also the constant case-law of the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court. Thus, the withdrawal of a driving licence on the one hand and punishment for a traffic offence on the other are distinct proceedings which are not linked to each other. Moreover, withdrawing a driving licence is not only a security measure for protection against the danger caused by unfit drivers, but is also designed to have an educative impact on the driver concerned and, for this reason, educational measures can also be imposed. The applicant\u2019s driving licence was withdrawn for a period of four months as he was no longer considered trustworthy on the roads on account of his conduct during a driver and vehicle inspection. This measure was accompanied by the obligation to undergo additional training before his licence could be given back to him. Taking into account the time for which the driving licence was withdrawn, that the measure was imposed without undue delay and accompanied by additional measures, it is apparent that it did not constitute a criminal sanction falling under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Also, the time for which his driving licence was revoked was particularly long, and the obligation to attend corrective training in order to regain his driving licence constituted a heavy sanction. Lastly, his driving licence was of vital importance for him because he had to commute regularly from Vienna to his dental surgery in P\u00f6chlarn, which was a significant distance from Vienna.

This, however, does not rule out a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, as recent authority, Sergey Zolotukhin v.

Classification in domestic law is not, however, decisive for the purposes of the Convention, having regard to the autonomous and substantive meaning to be given to the term \u201ccriminal charge\u201d (cf.

This measure was confirmed by the Melk District Administrative Authority for a period of four months and immediately enforced. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s driving licence was not only withdrawn but the authority also ordered him to undergo training before the driving licence could be returned to him. The Court therefore considers that the measure at issue did not have primarily a punitive character but rather constituted a preventive measure for the safety of road users (Escoubet v.

In the present case the applicant was not convicted for refusing to take a breathalyser test. Lastly, the time for which the applicant\u2019s driving licence had been withdrawn, a period of four months, was not so significant that it would ordinarily be viewed as a criminal sanction.",

The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play (see, inter alia, Mennitto v.
