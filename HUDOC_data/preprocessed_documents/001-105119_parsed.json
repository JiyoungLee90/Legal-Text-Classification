Considering that the sentence for the offence for which the applicant was convicted would in theory be imprisonment from two to eight years, the applicant's lenient sentence resulted from the mitigation due to the length of proceedings. Moreover, the Government referred to the detailed judgment delivered in the same proceedings in respect of two other defendants, where the District Court had expressly acknowledged the protraction of the proceedings.
