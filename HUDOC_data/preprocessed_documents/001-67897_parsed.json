However, in the present case, the petty thefts case against the applicant ended in 2000, before the adoption of Article 239a. The applicant could not have used the new remedy in that case (see paragraph 36 above). As regards the icons and antiquities case, even assuming that it was still pending at the investigation stage after June 2003 and that the applicant could therefore make use of the new remedy after that date, any acceleration of the proceedings at that moment would have come too late to make up for the excessive delay already accumulated (see paragraphs 37-60 and 152 above). In these circumstances the Court does not consider it necessary to rule in the abstract whether the new Article 239a is an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Djangozov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a045950/99, \u00a7\u00a052, 8\u00a0July 2004).",
