Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6 (see Bykov v.  [GC], no. 4378/02, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2009..., with further references). The right not to incriminate oneself presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see, inter alia, J.B. v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a031827/96, \u00a7\u00a064, ECHR\u00a02001-III). In this sense the right is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court must examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (ibid.).",

As followed from the statement made at the trial by Mr F, there had previously been cases of workers pouring out diesel from their service vehicles, and thus the company's director had asked the competent authorities to carry out checks (see paragraph 17 above). The applicant's car was apparently stopped during one of such checks. It does not transpire from the case file that at any time on 21\u00a0February 2001 the applicant was informed of the reason for which his car had been stopped and inspected. Neither was he informed of the nature and cause of any suspicion or accusation against him. After the police inspection of his car, the applicant was asked about the origin of the fuel. He did not tell them about the purchase of the fuel because he felt intimidated and did not have a receipt to prove the purchase. Instead, he stated that he had poured out the fuel from his service vehicle. An inspection record was drawn. This record contained a note indicating that the applicant had poured out the fuel from the company's premises. Shortly thereafter, the applicant was apprised of his right to remain silent and signed a statement to the police confirming that he had poured out thirty litres of fuel from his service vehicle for personal use.",

Testimony obtained under compulsion which appears on its face to be of a non-incriminating nature - such as exculpatory remarks or mere information on questions of fact - may later be deployed in criminal proceedings in support of the prosecution case, for example to contradict or cast doubt upon other statements of the accused or evidence given by him during the trial or to otherwise undermine his credibility (ibid).",

Consequently, the Court is not satisfied that the applicant validly waived the privilege against self-incrimination before or during the drawing of the inspection record. Moreover, given the weight accorded to the applicant's admission at the trial, the Court does not need to determine the validity of the applicant's subsequent waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination in the \u201cExplanations\u201d, which derived from his earlier admission (see paragraphs 11 and 40 above).",

It did not draw any distinction or made any comparison between that statement and the subsequent more detailed statement made after the applicant had been apprised of Article 51 of the Constitution. While it is not the Court's role to examine whether the evidence in the present case was correctly assessed by the national courts, the Court considers that the conviction was based on the applicant's self-incriminating statements. The Court finds it regrettable that the courts did not provide sufficient reasons for dismissing the applicant's arguments challenging the admissibility of the pre-trial statements, especially in the light of the weakness of the other evidence presented by the prosecution at the trial. It was, however, the prosecution's obligation under Russian law to prove the offence of theft on the strength of the other evidence because the CCrP required that a defendant's admission of guilt in the commission of an offence could be used as a basis for criminal charges only if his or her culpability was confirmed by the totality of evidence collected in the case (see paragraph 28 above).\u00a0The Court cannot but observe that two of the witnesses presented by the prosecution only confirmed the fact of the car inspection and the seizure of the fuel.

The Court also held that the lack of legal assistance during a suspect's interrogation would constitute a restriction of his defence rights and that these rights would in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements, made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer, were used for a conviction. The Court took a similar approach in the equally important judgment in Panovits (Panovits v. Cyprus, no. 4268/04, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70-73, 11 December 2008).",

The applicant had also been asked to sign this record, immediately, on the spot (see paragraph 10). It was only shortly thereafter that the applicant was apprised of the privilege against self-incrimination and that he then added that he had taken the diesel for \u201cpersonal use\u201d (see paragraph 11). The relevant steps, namely the drawing up of the inspection record and the taking of the applicant's explanation, were carried out as part of a direct sequence of events (see paragraph 47).",
