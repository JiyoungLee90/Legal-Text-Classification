The principles developed in the context of length-of-proceedings cases are also applicable in the situation where applicants complain of the delayed enforcement of final judgments in their favour, as in the present case (see Kudi\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 28971/05, \u00a7 17, 9 December 2008). States which, like Serbia, have opted for a remedy designed both to expedite proceedings and afford compensation are free to award amounts which - while being lower than those awarded by the Court - are still not unreasonable (see Cocchiarella, cited above, \u00a7 97).",

Serbia, no. 41703/06, \u00a7 51, 2 October 2012, and Klikovac and Others v. Serbia, no. 24291/08, \u00a7 25, 5 March 2013). In view of a very large number of non-enforced domestic decisions against socially/State-owned companies, the Court reduced that amount to EUR\u00a02,000 (see Sto\u0161i\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 64931/10, \u00a7 67, 1 October 2013). In doing so, it took into consideration also the economic situation in Serbia to which the Government referred. Since that amount is already much lower than what the Court would have normally awarded in such cases, any lower amount awarded at the domestic level is considered to be unreasonable. It should be added, however, that the Court could accept a lower domestic award, if the respondent State opts for a comprehensive solution and transfer the liability for all non-enforced domestic decisions against socially/State-owned companies to the State by virtue of law (see Kne\u017eevi\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 15663/12, \u00a7\u00a7 11-15, 14 March 2017, accepting a domestic award of EUR 50 in respect of non-pecuniary damage).",
