Also, certain important items of the forensic medical evidence were examined with a substantial delay, even though they were available from the very beginning (see paragraph 8 above), and after the investigation was reopened in July 2000, yet the relevant results of the investigation were obtained only on 2 April 2003 (see paragraph 52 above).",

Moreover, as it has already been mentioned above, the detailed instructions given by the supervising prosecutor (see paragraph 19 above) and the General Prosecutor's Office (see paragraphs 26 - 27 above) had repeatedly been not complied with by the investigative authorities which had questioned witnesses and suspects insufficiently and had, therefore, repeated their interviews over the same factual details. This was pointed out by the authorities supervising investigation on various occasions (see, specifically, paragraphs 36, 38, 49 and 55 above), after numerous remittals of the case for additional investigation due to the lack of a thorough investigation. Certain witnesses who could have shed light on the events at issue and could have given witness statements useful for investigation were not questioned at all as they could not be found, no serious attempts being made by the authorities to identify their whereabouts (see paragraphs 31 and 43 above). The police investigation lacked important witness statements from S. girlfriend and D.'s fianc\u00e9e (see paragraph 6 above). Also, the police officer S-v, who was present at the K. bar on the evening of Mr E.'s death, was questioned on 8\u00a0January 2003 only (see paragraph 47 above), even though the instructions on his questioning dated back to 5\u00a0November 2001 (see paragraph 36 above). Moreover, the authorities were unable to ascertain important factual elements of the case (see paragraphs 27, 38, 49 and 55 above).",

The hierarchically superior investigative authorities constantly remitted the case to the same investigator (see paragraphs 34, 39, 42, 44, 45, 51 and 57 above) who had conducted the initial investigation, being aware that his acts lacked the required expedition and adequacy.

This initial evidence was considered sufficient to indict D. and S. for inflicting serious bodily injuries leading to the death of E. and to conduct a subsequent search for them as the persons accused of this crime (see paragraph 12 above). More specifically, the investigation, for unclear reasons that remained unexplained, disregarded the important forensic medical examination reports of 7 June 1993, from which it ensued that the applicant's son had been beaten. This was later confirmed in the initial investigation report and the further forensic examination, i.e. that he had sustained multiple injuries (see paragraphs 8 and 38 above).",
