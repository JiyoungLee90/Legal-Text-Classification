Only two of the four lay assessors sitting in the  had been nominated by organisations that were, broadly speaking, involved in matters concerning the applicant company's business sector.

The fact that in each set of proceedings the lay assessor nominated by the SAF did not agree with the majority view demonstrated that there were no such common or opposing interests at hand.

These interests could not be contrary to those of the applicant company. It would be wrong to assume that their views on these objective issues would be affected by their belonging to one or other of the nominating bodies. Distinguishing the present case from that of Langborger v. Sweden, the Court notes that, in the latter case, the organisations which had nominated the lay assessors to the Housing and Tenancy Court had an interest in their affiliated unions' continued participation in rent negotiations, a participation which Mr\u00a0Langborger wished to end by having the relevant negotiation clause deleted from his lease. Furthermore, the affiliated tenants' union had an economic interest in the retention of that clause, as it received a commission of 0.3% of the negotiated rent. No such links between the dispute in the present case and the labour market organisations that had nominated the lay assessors are to be found.",

However, to accept that this gives rise to doubts as to the Labour Court's impartiality would, in the Court's opinion, be tantamount to considering that, in cases where lay assessors have been nominated by any labour market organisation, the Labour Court would fail to meet the requirement of being an \u201cimpartial tribunal\u201d in all disputes where one of the parties is not affiliated to such an organisation. The Court considers that it would be contrary to the considerations underlying the statement in \u00a7 34 of the Langborger judgment (see above) to accept such a proposition (see Stallarholmens Pl\u00e5tslageri o Ventilation Handelsbolag and Others v. , Commission decision cited above, at p. 119).",

One cannot rule out the possibility (since we are dealing with \u201cappearances\u201d) that all the organisations which have appointed lay assessors may be perceived as being in favour of affiliation. Consequently, it becomes difficult to distinguish the present application from the case of Langborger v.\u00a0Sweden (judgment of 22\u00a0June 1989, Series A no.\u00a0155, \u00a7\u00a035). In that case, the Court noted that the lay assessors: \u201chad been nominated by, and had close links with, two associations which both had an interest in the continued existence of the negotiation clause\u201d. In the instant case, there were both links with the system of collective bargaining agreements and an interest in it, as even the Government acknowledged: \u201cthe two lay assessors nominated by the LO and the SAF, respectively, could be said to have been linked to associations which were interested, generally speaking, in the system of collective agreements established by them on the labour market\u201d.",
