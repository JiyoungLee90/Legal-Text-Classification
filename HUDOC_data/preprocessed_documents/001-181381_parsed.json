However, recently I have read an article [entitled] \u201cFather for son, brother for brother\u201d in the Delovye Novosti newspaper, which clearly and specifically states that you, on the basis of corporate solidarity among judges, have given a similarly unlawful judgment, as a result of which a person was falsely convicted and sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. The newspaper article says that this issue has attracted the attention of the presidential administration and the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office. I know that the case in question was examined by the Council of Judges and by a parliamentary commission, before which you appeared, before your appointment. This was the source of the problems you had in securing your appointment to the position of judge for life .... This article tells me unequivocally that you will only decide [this] case according to the instructions which you ... receive, and the law \u2013 including my rights as a consumer \u2013 will mean absolutely nothing to you.

It described a criminal case concerning a bar brawl in which a person had been killed and a certain G. charged with murder. The article was apparently mainly based on the statements of G.\u2019s father. It put forward a point of view according to which G. was innocent since he had not provoked the brawl but had simply been defending a friend whom the victim had supposedly humiliated. The article described, in caustic terms, the decisions of the courts in the case. It also described G.\u2019s father\u2019s and brother\u2019s efforts to defend him. According to the article, G. had been convicted by Judge V. of the Nova Kakhovka Court and sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. After the conviction had been quashed on appeal, a retrial had been conducted by Judge M. who, according to the article, had been driven to convict G. by \u201c[judges\u2019] esprit de corps and corporate solidarity\u201d. The article reported that G\u2019s conviction by Judge M. had again been quashed on appeal and the case remitted for retrial before a different district court and that G.\u2019s relatives had apparently made sure that the case would be under the supervision of the presidential administration and other high State bodies.",

According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 must be determined according to both (i) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge (that is to say whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case); and (ii) an objective test \u2013 that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself (and, among other aspects, its composition) offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, for example, Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2015, with further references). As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge\u2019s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge, or a body sitting as a bench, lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (ibid., \u00a7 76). The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other protagonists in the proceedings. In this connection even appearances may be of a certain importance or, in other words, \u201cjustice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done\u201d. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (ibid., \u00a7 77 and 78).",

For the applicant, this meant that contempt could not be committed through words only. It had been inevitable that her challenge to the judge would lead to expression of opinions unpleasant to her, but the applicant had not used any words or expressions which might have offended the judge.

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court.

The Court\u2019s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\u201d and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0124, with further references).",

In addition, the article concerned Judge M. only tangentially and, even to the extent that it did concern her, did not contain any specific factual information, as opposed to vague and apparently equally unsubstantiated statements about her motives.

As to the nature of her remarks, while they were indeed very critical, sweeping and emotional, the applicant limited herself to rather formal expressions and did not resort to indecent, belittling or highly sarcastic language (contrast Ska\u0142ka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a010, and Rodriguez Ravelo, cited above, \u00a7 46), Moreover, it is an important consideration that the statements were made in the courtroom, where the principle of fairness militates in favour of a free and even forceful exchange of arguments between parties (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7 137). While the hearing was in principle open to the public, the applicant alleged, and the Government did not contest, that only the court staff, trainees and Ms S. (the adverse party\u2019s lawyer) had been present (compare, for example, Raichinov v. Bulgaria, no. 47579/99, \u00a7 48, 20 April 2006). Moreover, the impugned remarks had not been repeated outside the courtroom (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7 137). It follows that all those present were, by virtue of their position and training, unlikely to have been susceptible to the applicant\u2019s sweeping and emotional criticism of the judge; therefore, it is unlikely that a less severe reaction to the applicant\u2019s statements would have been gravely damaging to the courts\u2019 authority.",
