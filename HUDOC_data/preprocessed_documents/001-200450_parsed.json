The court considered that the complainants were not attacking the law concerning compensation [which determined that compensation was to be awarded according to the value of the land at the time of the Notice to treat]. As to the facts, it noted that when the empyhteutae acquired the right of perpetual emphyteusis over the land, they paid the equivalent of 0.08 euro cents per square metre. The expropriation concerned 6,774.54 sq.m and the compensation awarded by the LAB was that of EUR 2,786 therefore the applicants received 0.41 euro cents per square meter, which was much greater than the price they had paid for it. According to the applicant\u2019s architect, in 1964 compensation had to amount to EUR 15,710 (EUR\u00a02.30 per sq.m) while according to the architect appointed by the Commissioner of Land - given that in 1961 the land was outside a development zone - compensation had to amount to EUR\u00a03,610 (0.36\u00a0euro cents per sq.m). It followed, according to the court, that the compensation awarded to the empyhteutae was closer to the price at which they had acquired the land, while the compensation estimated by their expert had not taken into consideration the purpose of the expropriation and the use made of the land but rather reflected the price on an open market.

They relied on ECtHR case-law that had established in various cases that domestic law concerning compensation was in breach of the Convention as it did not take account of the passage of time between the taking and the actual payment. Further the first-instance court had erroneously considered the land as having an area of 6,774.54 sq.m as opposed to 7,531 sq.m.

The same as well as other delays on the part of the complainants had also been confirmed by the ECtHR in Bezzina Wettinger and Others (cited above). Furthermore, during the firstinstance proceedings it had been established that the ground rents had been repaid to the applicants. As to the value of the land itself, at the time when it was taken this had been agricultural land thus it had to be valued on that scale and not on one for development as had been done by the ex parte architect.

In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference that cannot be justified under Article 1. That Article does not, however, guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of \u201cpublic interest\u201d may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see The Holy Monasteries v.\u00a0Greece, 9 December 1994, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-71, Series A no.\u00a0301A, and Papachelas v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no. 31423/96, \u00a7 48, ECHR 1999II).",

However, it also found that the delay in the payment of compensation, from 1981 onwards was the fault of the empyhteutae, including the applicants or their ancestors (Bezzina Wettinger and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 106-114). Nothing appears to have changed since then, and the delay in the payment of compensation from 1981 to date remains the fault of the applicants, as also acknowledged by the domestic jurisdictions. Thus, it remains to be determined whether the award made by the LAB, twenty years after the taking, in 1981 (regardless of whether it was paid out or not thereafter) was in itself adequate.",

The Court notes that this in itself raises an issue of proportionality according to the Court\u2019s case law. Indeed, in similar Maltese cases, the Court has consistently found that the awards of the LAB which did not take into account the delay in the payment of compensation were inadequate (see, for example, Frendo Randon and Others v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a02226/10, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 22\u00a0November 2011 and Schembri and Others v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a042583/06, \u00a7\u00a045, 10\u00a0November 2009).",

The Court considers that, even assuming that it was not  at the time of the taking  classified as undevelopable land or as being outside a development zone (ODZ land), it cannot be said that it was indisputably developable land. The fact that, when the applicants (or their ancestors) entered into the contract of emphyteusis, no specific type of development had yet been determined for the land did not entail any assurance as to its development (see, mutatis mutandis, Trimeg Limited v.\u00a0Malta, (dec.), no. 64792/10, 27 September 2011). Nor can the terms of the agreement between the parties determine the nature of the land irrespective of any other legal considerations. In this connection the Court notes that the ground rent prices referred to by the applicants concern the entirety of the property which had been taken under title of emphyteusis, while the expropriated part amounts to around one fourth of that property. Further, the parties have not indicated what were the objective criteria arising from the law, applicable at the relevant time, to determine whether land was agricultural or otherwise. In such circumstances it is not for the Court to make that assessment and for the purposes of the present case it suffices to note that the Constitutional Court considered such land to be agricultural (see paragraph 20 above).",

Indeed the award made is even smaller than what the Government\u2019s architect estimated the land to be worth (as agricultural land). Thus, even assuming that the applicants\u2019 architect\u2019s valuation was, as seems to have been understood by the domestic courts, to refer to developable land, the award made to the applicants remains questionable. Moreover, it cannot go unnoticed that the LAB in their rectification judgment, gave the same amount of compensation established previously despite acknowledging that they had previously relied on a wrong (smaller by around 10%) measurement. This situation was not remedied by the constitutional jurisdictions. Thus, the award also appears to have been made without proper consideration of the actual size of the property. It follows that the compensation determined more than two decades after the taking had not been adequate.",

However, in the present case the Court does not lose sight of the fact that, although inadequate, compensation had been determined and was payable to the applicants in 1981 and that this Court has already found that the delay in the payment of compensation, from 1981 onwards was the fault of the empyhteutae, including the applicants or their ancestors (Bezzina Wettinger and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 106-114). The Court will also take account of the public interest behind the measure, and the limited share of the applicants in the present case. It will, however, refrain from awarding interest, which will be paid domestically upon the finalisation of the deed of expropriation.",
