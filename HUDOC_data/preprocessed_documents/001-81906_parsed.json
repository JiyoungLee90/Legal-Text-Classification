Relying on the evidence collected and the tests conducted in the course of the preliminary investigation, the Shumen Regional Prosecutor's Office argued that the first assailant had stabbed the victim, given that he had had the knife and the victim's blood had been found on his clothes. It therefore dismissed the charges against the second assailant for negligent homicide resulting from an inflicted median bodily injury and remitted the case for further investigation, with instructions that the first assailant be again charged with murder stemming from an act of hooliganism (see paragraphs 12 above and 56 below). The only other remaining accused was G.R.G., who had been eighteen years old at the time of the attack and who continued to be charged with hooliganism of exceptional cynicism and impudence as the statute of limitation had not expired in respect of him (see paragraphs 21 above and 58 below).",

However, the Court considers that other means may also be employed to attain the desired result of punishing perpetrators who have racist motives. It observes in this respect that the possibility existed in domestic legislation to impose a more severe sentence depending on, inter alia, the motive of the offender (see paragraph 63 above). The Court further observes that the authorities charged the assailants with aggravated offences, which though failing to make a direct reference of the racist motives of the perpetrators provided for more severe sentences than those envisaged in domestic legislation for racial hatred offences (see paragraphs 56-61 above). Thus, it does not consider that domestic legislation and the lack of penalty-enhancing provisions for racist murder or serious bodily injury were responsible in the present case for hampering or constraining the authorities from conducting an effective investigation into the death of the applicants' relative and applying effectively the existing domestic legislation.",

The applicants noted that the Court had repeatedly held that there is no requirement that remedies that are neither adequate nor effective should be used (see, mutatis mutandis, Sak\u0131k and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 26 November 1997, Reports 1997VII, p. 2625, \u00a7 53) and that an individual must have clear, practical opportunity to challenge an act which is an interference with his or her rights (see De Geouffre de la Pradelle v.

In respect of the lack of availability of the remedy claimed by the Government, the applicants noted that the Protection against Discrimination Act entered into force close to four years after they had lodged their complaints with the Court. With regard to its effectiveness, they argued that an action for damages, be it based on anti-discrimination legislation or general tort law, could not remedy the substance of their complaint before the Court, which was that the authorities had failed to conduct an effective investigation into the death of their relative and to prosecute the perpetrators. Moreover, an action under the Act would be directed against the investigation authorities and would require the applicants to prove discriminatory treatment by them on the basis of race, of which there was no direct evidence.

Sufficient evidence was also collected that this was by no means an isolated event for the assailants and that they had periodically practiced racist violence of a similar nature.

Moreover, when investigating violent  authorities have the additional duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any racist motive and to establish whether or not ethnic hatred or prejudice may have played a role in the events. Failing to do so and treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention. Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State's obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute; the authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances of the case (see Nachova\u00a0and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 160).",

The Court considers it completely unacceptable that, while aware that the attack was incited by racial hatred, the authorities did not expeditiously complete the preliminary investigation against the assailants and bring them to trial. On the contrary, they allowed the criminal proceedings to procrastinate and to remain at the investigation stage for more than eleven years. As a result, the statute of limitations expired in respect of the majority of the assailants. In addition, the Court observes that the authorities failed to also charge the assailants with any racially motivated offences. It notes in this respect the widespread prejudices and violence against Roma during the relevant period and the need to reassert continuously society's condemnation of racism and to maintain the confidence of minorities in the authorities' ability to protect them from the threat of racist violence (see Menson and Others (dec.), cited above).",
