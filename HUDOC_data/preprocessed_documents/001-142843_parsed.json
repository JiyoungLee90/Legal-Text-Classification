The Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances or the victim\u2019s behaviour (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 92-94, ECHR 2000XI).",

The Government disputed the applicant\u2019s submissions, stating that he had had four square metres of personal space throughout his detention in the facility. They supported their submissions with certificates prepared by the director of the facility, handwritten affidavits by the facility staff members, selected pages from the inmate population logs and the applicant\u2019s cell register (see paragraph 27 above).",

Russia, no.\u00a02708/02, \u00a7\u00a7 95-98, 24 May 2007; Shukhardin v. Russia, no. 65734/01, \u00a7\u00a7 65-68, 28 June 2007). In particular, the Court has held that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time is incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see also Sta\u0161aitis v. Lithuania, no.\u00a047679/99, \u00a7\u00a067, 21 March 2002, and Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no.\u00a055669/00, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 2 March 2006). Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2005-X).",
