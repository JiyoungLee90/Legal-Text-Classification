The case originated in an application (no. 51752/10) against the Republic of Lithuania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Lithuanian nationals, Mr Kristupas Kavaliauskas (“the first applicant”), Mr Martynas Kavaliauskas (“the second applicant”), Mr Romas Konstantinas Batūra (“the third applicant”) and Ms Danutė Butkienė (“the fourth applicant”) on 3 August 2010. On 6 June 2013 the fourth applicant died, and on 11 July 2016 the Court was informed that, as her heir, the second applicant had inherited all her pecuniary and non-pecuniary rights pertaining to the present application.
The applicants were represented by Mr B. Simanavičius, a lawyer practising in Vilnius. The Lithuanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms K. Bubnytė.
The applicants alleged that they had not received adequate compensation for their property and that the restitution process had been unreasonably lengthy, in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
On 7 March 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1972, 1980, 1937 and 1925 respectively and live in Vilnius.
On 5 November 1991 L.N. (who later died – the first and the second applicants became her heirs), the third and the fourth applicants asked the Lithuanian authorities to restore their property rights in natura to a house in Kaunas, nationalised in 1940s.
In September 1993 L.N., the third and the fourth applicants were asked by the authorities to provide some additional documents necessary to proceed with the restoration of their property rights. L.N. submitted the necessary documents to the Kaunas City Municipality.
In March 1995 L.N. and the fourth applicant agreed that the property rights to one room of the house would be restored to their brother – the third applicant. On 30 March 1995 the third applicant wrote a letter to the authorities, asking them to restore the property rights to 22.4 sq. m of the house and one room of 10.32 sq. m. He also asked to decide the question of the restoration of property rights to a remaining part of the house at a later stage.
By a decision of 11 April 1995, the Kaunas City Council restored L.N.’s, the third and the fourth applicants’ property rights to a house in Kaunas in equal parts. The Kaunas City Council held that 22.42 sq. m of the house would be returned to L.N., the third and the fourth applicant in natura in equal parts and that a room of 10.32 sq. m would be returned in natura to the third applicant. The decision also indicated that the remaining part of the house would be returned in natura when the tenants of the house had been provided with other premises, or compensation would be paid if the premises were not returned.
In July 1995 L.N. and the fourth applicant asked the authorities to pay them compensation for the part of the house that had not been returned in natura.
In March 1996 L.N., the third and the fourth applicants wrote a letter to the authorities, stating that they refused the property that had already been returned to them in natura, and asked to be paid compensation for the entire house.
In September 1996 the third applicant, who by an agreement approved by the notary in 1995, was representing L.N. and the fourth applicant, withdrew the application of March 1996 (see paragraph 11 above) and confirmed that 22.42 sq. m of the house and 10.32 sq. m had been returned to L.N., the third and the fourth applicant in natura.
On 23 September 1996 L.N., the third and the fourth applicants asked the authorities to pay them compensation for the part of the house that had not been returned to them in natura and stated that they agreed to partial compensation until the full market-value compensation figure had been calculated.
Following the request of L.N., the third and the fourth applicants (see paragraph 13 above), the Kaunas City Municipality assessed the value of the entire house and on 8 October 1996 set it at 239,190 Lithuanian litai (LTL – approximately 69,274 euros (EUR)) in total, the third applicant signed for himself and as L.N.’s and the fourth applicant’s representative, signalling their agreement to such compensation. On the same day, the Kaunas City Board amended the decision of 11 April 1995, establishing that the remaining part of the house would not be returned, compensation of LTL 79,730 (approximately EUR 23,091) would be paid to L.N., the third and the fourth applicants each, and that the remaining part of the compensation would be paid when the market value of the house had been calculated. Following this decision, L.N., the third and the fourth applicants were paid compensation on 17 October 1996 and 18 October 1996.
On an unspecified date L.N., the third and the fourth applicants lodged a claim with the domestic courts in order to have the part of the decision of the authorities of 11 April 1995 by which the premises of 22.42 sq. m of the house had been returned to them in natura annulled.
On 24 October 2000 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court decided to annul the part of the decision of 11 April 1995 by which 22.42 sq. m of the house had been returned in natura and to oblige the Kaunas City Board to pay monetary compensation for this property.
Accordingly, on 18 September 2001 the decision of the authorities of 11 April 1995 was amended and it was decided to pay monetary compensation for the 22.42 sq. m of the house.
The value of the property was calculated on 14 April 2008. On 1 June 2009, in accordance with an application by L.N., the third and the fourth applicants to receive compensation for 22.42 sq. m of the house, LTL 30,000 (approximately EUR 8,689) in total were paid to them.
In November 2006 the Kaunas City Municipality Administration asked the Centre of Registers to assess the value of the house and to establish the difference between the value assessed and the compensation that had already been paid. In January 2008 the Centre of Registers assessed the market value of the house in 1996 at LTL 855,000 (approximately EUR 247,625) and established that the remaining compensation to be paid was LTL 615,809 (approximately EUR 178,350) in total.
On 19 March 2008 the authorities amended the decision of 11 April 1995 and established that L.N., the third and the fourth applicants had to be paid compensation amounting to LTL 615,809 (approximately EUR 178,350) in total.
On 26 March 2008 L.N., the third and the fourth applicants were asked to fill in a form in order to receive their compensation; they did so on 1, 20 and 4 April 2008 respectively. The compensation was adjusted in line with the inflation index and amounted to LTL 818,458 (approximately EUR 237,042) and was paid on 17 July 2008. Each person received LTL 272,819 (approximately EUR 79,014).
On an unspecified date L.N. died, and the first, the second applicants, who became her heirs, the third and the fourth applicants lodged a claim with the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court, asking for the annulation of one part of the order of the authorities of 19 March 2008 (see paragraph 20 above), and to oblige the authorities to calculate the remaining compensation as well as the compensation that had already been paid in accordance with the market price of the house in 2008. They also asked to be awarded damages.
On 9 March 2009 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court decided to annul one part of the decision of the authorities of 19 March 2008 and to oblige the authorities to recalculate the compensation for the remaining part of the house in accordance with the market value in 2008. The court decided to reject the claim for damages as no unlawful acts by the authorities had taken place.
The applicants appealed, and on 29 March 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court partly overturned the decision of the court of first instance. It referred to a similar case of the same court where it had held that the value of the property had had to be assessed in the light of values when the decision to restore property rights had been taken, and that the assessment of the value at a later stage might have created grounds for unjust enrichment. The Supreme Administrative Court also referred to the same case where it had held that although the authorities had not taken the necessary actions to calculate the remaining part of the compensation from 22 October 1996 until 28 April 2008, these had not been appropriate grounds for annulling the decision of the authorities to pay the remaining part of the compensation. The remaining part of the decision of the court of first instance was left unchanged.
Article 23 of the Constitution reads:
“Property shall be inviolable.
The rights of ownership shall be protected by law.
Property may be taken over only for the needs of society according to the procedure established by law and shall be justly compensated.”
The Law on the Procedure and Conditions for the Restoration of Citizens’ Ownership Rights to Existing Real Property (Įstatymas „Dėl piliečių nuosavybės teisių į išlikusį nekilnojamąjį turtą atstatymo tvarkos ir sąlygų“ – hereinafter “the Law on Restitution”), enacted on 18 June 1991 and amended on numerous occasions, provided for two forms of restitution – the return of the property in natura or compensation if physical return was not possible. At the time it was enacted, Article 8 of the Law on Restitution provided that monetary compensation had to be paid in accordance with the procedure established by the Government and within a period of ten years.
.  As from 26 April 1996, Article 8 of the Law on Restitution provided that monetary compensation had to be paid in accordance with the procedure established by the Government within a period of ten years and that compensation for the property had to be equivalent to its market value.
On 1 July 1997 the Seimas (the Lithuanian Parliament) enacted the new Law on the Restoration of Citizens’ Ownership Rights to Existing Real Property (Piliečių nuosavybės teisių į išlikusį nekilnojamąjį turtą atkūrimo įstatymas – hereinafter “the 1997 Law on Restitution”), which replaced the Law on Restitution of 1991. Article 16 of the 1997 Law on Restitution provided that the State had to compensate citizens for existing real property which had been compulsorily purchased by the State, as well as for real property which had been extant prior to 1 August 1991 but which had subsequently ceased to exist as a result of decisions taken by the State or local authorities. Compensation for residential buildings which were not returned in accordance with this Law, had to be established in accordance with the procedure approved by the Government.
Point 2.1 of Government Resolution no. 336 of 8 March 1995 on the Procedure of Payment of Monetary Compensation for State Redeemable Residential Buildings (or Parts Thereof) (Lietuvos Respublikos Vyriausybės nutarimas “Dėl piniginės kompensacijos už valstybės išperkamus gyvenamuosius namus (arba jų dalis) mokėjimo tvarkos patvirtinimo” – hereinafter “Resolution no. 336”) provided that the value of residential buildings (their subdivisions or apartments) had to be index-linked, with a base date of 1 January 1995, to the consumer price index as applicable at the date of the assessment of value.
On 21 December 1998, the Government adopted Resolution no. 1455 issuing the Order on the Assessment of the Value of Property that has to be Compulsorily Purchased by the State, on Residential Buildings (or parts thereof) that have been Returned to their Owners, and on [Rented] Apartments (Lietuvos Respublikos Vyriausybės nutarimas “Dėl valstybės išperkamo iš savininkų turto bei sąvininkams sugrąžintų gyvenamųjų namų, jų dalių, butų, kuriuose gyvena nuomininkai, vertės nustatymo”), which annulled Resolution no. 336.
Point 2.1 of Government Resolution no. 1456 of 21 December 1998 on the Procedure of Compensation for Citizens for State-Redeemable Residential Buildings, Or Parts Thereof or Apartments (Lietuvos Respublikos Vyriausybės nutarimas “Dėl atlyginimo pinigais piliečiams už valstybės išperkamus gyvenamuosius namus, jų dalis, butus tvarkos patvirtinimo”) established that the value of residential buildings, their subdivisions, and apartments for which compensation had already been paid before this Resolution entered into force, was not to be recalculated.
The Civil Code provides that damage caused by unlawful acts of public authorities must be compensated for by the State, irrespective of the fault of a particular public servant or other public-authority employee (Article 6.271).
The Supreme Administrative Court has noted that the principle of equal value was linked to the date of the adoption of the decision to pay monetary compensation. If the situation had been interpreted otherwise, it would create possibilities for unjust enrichment. The Supreme Administrative Court therefore held that in that case (no. A525-1539/2010) the property rights had been restored in 1996, and it would have been unjust to calculate the market value of the property during the proceedings of 2008 (decision of 17 February 2010).
In decisions of 15 June and 19 October 1994 the Constitutional Court emphasised that the notion of property rights in Lithuania essentially denoted partial reparation. In this respect the Constitutional Court noted that the authorities of Lithuania as a re-established State in 1990 were not responsible for the Soviet occupation half a century ago, nor were they responsible for the consequences of that occupation. The Constitutional Court held that since the 1940s many private persons had bought, in accordance with the legislation applicable at the material time, various property items which had been previously nationalised. The denial of these factual and legal aspects was impossible, and the domestic legislation on restitution of property rights duly took into account not only the interests of the former owners, but also the interests of private persons who had occupied or purchased the property under lawful contracts.
On 20 June 1995 the Constitutional Court affirmed that the choice by the Parliament of the partial reparation principle was influenced by the difficult political and social conditions in that “new generations had grown, new proprietary and other socio-economic relations had been formed during the 50 years of occupation, which could not be ignored in deciding the question of restitution of property”. The notion of restricted restitution was confirmed by the Constitutional Court several times (for example, on 4 March 2003, 5 July 2007).
