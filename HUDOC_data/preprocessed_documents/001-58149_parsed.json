This communication nevertheless distinguishes the present case from earlier cases concerning the role of advocates-general described in other judgments of our Court. In my opinion, the information thus provided before the hearing is sufficient.

At the hearing they would have been able to answer the comments made by the advocate-general and he would not have been present at the subsequent deliberations.
