The applicant stressed that he had learned that the documents had been seized when by a letter of 16\u00a0December 2004 the Court had asked him to submit copies of the two domestic court decisions which he had already enclosed with his letter of 28 November 2002.

In the Court\u2019s view, the new complaint raised under Article 2 of the Convention is not simply an elaboration of the original complaints lodged with the Court more than three years earlier, on which the parties have already commented. The Court therefore limits its examination to the complaint about the contraction of HIV through a contaminated syringe (see Nuray \u00ffen v.  (no. 2), 30\u00a0March 2004, no. 25354/94, \u00a7\u00a0200; Melnik v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a072286/01, \u00a7\u00a7 61-63, 28 March 2006; Kravchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a034615/02, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28, 2 April 2009; and Isayev v. , no. 20756/04, \u00a7\u00a7 81-83, 22 October 2009).",

The Court reiterates that Article 2 does not solely concern deaths resulting from the use of unjustified force by agents of the State but also, in the first\u00a0sentence of its first paragraph, lays down a positive obligation on States to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within their jurisdiction (see, for example, L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom, 9 June 1998, \u00a7\u00a036, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, and Paul and Audrey\u00a0Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 54, ECHR\u00a02002II).",

Persons in custody are in a particularly vulnerable position and the authorities are under an obligation to account for their treatment. The Convention requires the State to protect the health and physical well-being of persons deprived of their liberty, for example by adopting appropriate measures for the protection of their lives and providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see, inter alia, Keenan v. the , no. 27229/95, \u00a7\u00a0111, ECHR 2001III; Mouisel v.

The Court also reiterates that where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7\u00a085, ECHR 1999-IV, and Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR\u00a02000-VII).",

Italy [GC], no.\u00a032967/96, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002-I). The Court further reiterates that even if the Convention does not as such guarantee a right to have criminal proceedings instituted against third parties (see Perez v. France [GC], no. 47287/99, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2004-I), the effective judicial system required by Article 2 may, and under certain circumstances must, include recourse to the criminal law. The system required by Article 2 must provide for an independent and impartial official investigation that satisfies certain minimum standards as to effectiveness. Accordingly, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness, and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved. The requirement of public scrutiny is also relevant in this context (see Kats and Others v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 29971/04, \u00a7\u00a0116, 18 December 2008).",

At the same time, it does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that, having dismissed the applicant\u2019s version of events, the authorities did not attempt to identify the exact way in which the applicant\u2019s infection had been acquired. Neither the applicant\u2019s medical records nor any other documents submitted by the parties contained any reference to a history of intravenous drug use by the applicant. Similarly, there was no evidence that there had been sexual contact between the applicant and other inmates.
