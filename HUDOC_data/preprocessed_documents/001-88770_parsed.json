The entrance to the dugout had no stairs. Having consulted the villagers, he concluded that the dugout had been left by rebel fighters, since it did not resemble the buildings usually left by the federal troops. He had looked into the dugout and had seen a corpse. Mr Vakhazhi Albekov\u2019s relatives who were present said that they recognised him by his clothes. Mr G. had not entered the dugout.
