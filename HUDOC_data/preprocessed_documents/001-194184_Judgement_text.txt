The case originated in two applications (nos. 24751/10 and 63824/10) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Mr Ivan Georgiyevich Kanna and Mr Igor Leonidovych Tsyganok (“the applicants”), on 15 April and 13 October 2010 respectively.
The first applicant was represented by Mr Y.L. Boychenko, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. The second applicant was represented by Ms O.O. Khatnyuk, a lawyer practising in Kyiv. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Ivan Lishchyna of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants complained under Article 5 of the Convention: that appeal courts, when quashing the sentences of trial courts in respect of them and remitting their cases for retrial, had failed to provide reasons for their decisions authorising the applicants’ detention on remand, and had set no time-limit on that detention; that the length of their pre-trial detention had been unreasonable and unjustified; and that the trial courts had refused their applications for release without providing sufficient reasons. The second applicant further complained, under Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention, that the Pecherskyy District Court of Kyiv’s decision of 10 July 2006 extending his period of detention in police custody to ten days (see paragraph 20 below) had been in breach of the Convention, and that the criminal proceedings against him had been unreasonably long.
Notice of the above complaints was given to the Government on 25 January 2018 (application no. 24751/10) and 29 January 2018 (application no. 63824/10), and the remaining complaints, including the second applicant’s complaint concerning his detention from 15 February to 6 May 2006, were declared inadmissible, pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The first applicant, Mr Ivan Georgiyevich Kanna, was born in 1960 and lives in Kryvyy Rig.
On 18 May 2008 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of bribery.
On 21 May 2008 the Pecherskyy District Court of Kyiv ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention with effect from 18 May 2008. The relevant decision stated that he might otherwise escape and hinder the investigation or continue with his criminal activity. No further details regarding the above-mentioned reasons were provided by the court. The applicant’s detention was subsequently extended a number of times on similar grounds.
On 7 April 2010 the Leninskyy District Court of Donetsk convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to, inter alia, ten years’ imprisonment.
On 6 October 2010 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the district court’s decision as to the applicant’s guilt and reduced his term of imprisonment to eight years.
On 14 June 2011 the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and Criminal Matters quashed the ruling of 6 October 2010 and remitted the case to the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal for reconsideration.
On 22 December 2011 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal quashed the sentence of 7 April 2010 and remitted the case to the trial court for fresh consideration. It also ordered the applicant’s further detention. No reasons for the applicant’s detention or a time-limit on that detention were set out in the decision of the appeal court.
On 17 December 2012 the Leninskyy District Court of Donetsk convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to, inter alia, ten years’ imprisonment.
On 28 May 2013 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the district court’s decision as to the applicant’s guilt and reduced his term of imprisonment to eight years.
On 11 February 2014 the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and Criminal Matters upheld the decision of the court of appeal, making slight amendments.
The second applicant, Mr Igor Leonidovych Tsyganok, was born in 1964 and lives in Kyiv.
On 14 February 2006 a criminal investigation for fraud was instituted in respect of the applicant. On 15 February 2006 he was arrested in the context of the above investigation.
In the course of the investigation, the applicant was held in custody and detained several times by the courts, before being released on 6 May 2006.
On 21 June 2006 the Pecherskyy District Court of Kyiv again ordered the applicant’s detention. The relevant decision stated that he might otherwise escape and hinder the investigation or continue with his criminal activity.
On 7 July 2006 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal quashed the decision of 21 June 2006 and released the applicant.
On the same day the investigator rearrested the applicant on additional charges of tax evasion within the same criminal investigation (see paragraph 16 above). On 10 July 2006 the Pecherskyy District Court of Kyiv extended his period of detention in police custody to ten days with a view to obtaining information on his character.
On 17 July 2006 the Pecherskyy District Court of Kyiv ordered the applicant’s detention with effect from 7 July 2006. The decision stated that he had no permanent place of residence, had been accused of a serious crime, and might otherwise escape and hinder the investigation or continue with his criminal activity. No further details regarding the above-mentioned reasons were provided by the court.
On 16 March 2009 the Shevchenkivskyy District Court of Kyiv found the applicant guilty of embezzlement and forgery of documents, and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment.
On 30 June 2010 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal quashed the above sentence and remitted the case for additional pre-trial investigation. By the same decision, it extended the applicant’s detention without indicating a time-limit for its duration. The court stated that it had found no reason to change the preventive measure imposed on him, given the seriousness of the charges.
On 1 August 2013, in the course of his trial, the Shevchenkivskyy District Court of Kyiv released the applicant on bail.
According to the applicant, the case is currently being examined by the trial court.
