A restrictive or technical approach in this area is therefore to be avoided (see S.D., D.P. and A.T. v. the United Kingdom, no. 23715/94, Commission decision of 20 May 1996; P.,C. and S. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 56547/00, 11 December 2001; C. and D. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34407/02, 31 August 2004; Giusto, Bornacin and V. v.

They were minors who had lost their mother and had a complicated, if not hostile, relationship with their father. Their aunt submitted the current application in their name. It is undisputed that she has actively participated in the upbringing of the boys, cared for them and, at least as far as the post-December 2009 period is concerned, provided a home for them. At the moment of lodging the application with the Court, the boys had been permanently residing with their maternal family for more than two years. In present circumstances, there is no doubt that the aunt had a sufficiently close link with her nephews \u2012 the direct alleged victims of a violation under Article 8 of the Convention \u2012 to complain on their behalf. It hence remains to determine whether the current case satisfies two additional criteria from the perspective of the Court\u2019s relevant case-law: first, the risk that without the aunt\u2019s complaint, the boys will be deprived of effective protection of their rights; and that there is no conflict of interests between them and their aunt (see Lambert, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

No family members other than the father and the maternal grandparents and aunts expressed any interest in the relevant domestic proceedings (see paragraphs 10 and 20 above). The father, given the outcome of the domestic proceedings, is clearly showing no interest at all (see also paragraphs 34-35 above). As for potential institutional alternatives to handle their representation, the Court observes that the SSA was itself the subject of criticism in the current application. It would therefore not have been realistic to expect them to facilitate, on behalf of the children, the bringing of a complaint which is in part a criticism of the system they represented. There was therefore no alternative source of representation in the present case which would render their aunt\u2019s assumption of the role inappropriate or unnecessary.",

Although issued more than three years ago, the decision continues to have full legal effect.

Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7 59, Series A no.\u00a0130, and Monory v. Romania and Hungary, no. 71099/01, \u00a7 70, 5 April 2005). In this context, the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities. There are in addition positive obligations inherent in an effective \u201crespect\u201d for family life. Hence, the Court has repeatedly held that Article 8 includes the right for parents to have measures taken that will permit them to be reunited with their children and an obligation on part of the national authorities to take such action (see, amongst many others, Eriksson v. Sweden, judgment of 22\u00a0June 1989, Series A no. 156, pp. 26-27, \u00a7 71; Margareta and Roger Andersson v. Sweden, judgment of 25 February 1992, Series A no. 226-A, p. 30, \u00a7 91; Olsson v.

This also applies to cases where contact and residence disputes concerning children arise between parents and/or other members of the children\u2019s family (see Fu\u015fc\u0103 v.

The reunion of a parent with a child who has lived for some time with other persons may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures being taken to this effect. The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Where contact with the parent might appear to threaten those interests or interfere with those rights, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them (see Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7 58). The child\u2019s best interests must be the primary consideration and may, depending on their nature and seriousness, override those of the parents (see among many others, Olsson (No. 2), \u00a7 90, Ignaccolo-Zenide, \u00a7 94, both cited above; P\u0142aza v.

In the case of children, the above principle is exercised through their right to be consulted and heard (see M. and M. v. Croatia, no. 10161/13, \u00a7\u00a7 180-181, 3 September 2015). The Court has already held that as children mature and, with the passage of time, become able to formulate their own opinions on their contact with their parents, for instance, the courts should give due weight to their views and feelings as well as to their right to respect for their private life (see Plaza, cited above, \u00a7 71).

Thus, it appears from the case file that the SSA became formally involved in the proceedings only from the appeal stage onwards (see paragraph 19 above), skipping \u2012 for unknown reasons \u2012 the full examination of the case at first instance. After its involvement in the appeal proceedings, the SSA and its relevant regional branch enjoyed the status of an \u201cinterested party\u201d (see paragraph 23 above). The Code of Civil Procedure, however, does not make any provision for the status of an \u201cinterested party\u201d and/or its ensuing procedural rights.

In this connection the Court points out, having regard to Article 12 of the CRC (see paragraph 40-42 above, and in particular point 32 of General Comment no. 12 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child), that in any judicial or administrative proceedings affecting children\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention, children capable of forming their own views should be sufficiently involved in the decision-making process and be given the opportunity to be heard and thus to express their views (see also M. and M., cited above, \u00a7 181). The same principle is enshrined in the Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on Child-Friendly Justice, which provide for the right of children to be heard and to express their views in all matters that affect them (see paragraph 43 above).",

The Government for its part maintained that Article 81 of the CCP did not intend to imply the obligatory direct involvement of children over the age of seven in proceedings affecting them (see paragraph 64 above).",

In any event, taking into account the relevant international standards, the Court does not understand why the domestic courts failed both to give any consideration to the possibility of directly involving the older boy in the proceedings and to give reasons for not hearing him (see M. and M., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 184-185). The potential need for his direct involvement was particularly apparent given the flaws in the quality of the boys\u2019 representation, as noted above.",

The Court accepts the above motivation of the domestic courts. Indeed, the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other\u2019s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life and it is within the best interests of the children to be allowed to develop in a sound and harmonious environment. However, while making its own assessment of the best interests, the domestic courts failed to give adequate consideration to one important fact: the boys did not want to be reunited with their father.",

But, whatever the manipulative role played by the maternal family, the evidence before the domestic courts concerning the hostile attitude of the children towards their father was unambiguous. The latest conclusion of the social workers dated 4\u00a0January 2012, noted the particularly severe alienation of the children from their father (see paragraphs 27-28 above).",

In such circumstances, ordering such a radical measure without considering a proper transition and preparatory measures aimed at assisting the boys and their estranged father in rebuilding their relationship appears to be contrary to their best interests (see, Z.J., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 99 and 103; compare also with Plaza, \u00a7 86, Hokkanen, \u00a7 61, and M. and M., \u00a7 186, all cited above).",
