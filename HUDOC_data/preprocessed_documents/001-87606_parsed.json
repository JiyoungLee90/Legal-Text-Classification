In this connection the Court observes that after the applicant\u2019s employment dispute had been remitted for a fresh examination at first instance and the file had been lost, there was no judicial decision which would determine the merits of the dispute or discontinue the proceedings regarding it (see Dubinskaya v. Russia, no.\u00a04856/03, \u00a7\u00a030, 13 July 2006). Hence, the Court finds that the proceedings should be considered pending on the date of entry into force of the Convention in respect of the , which was undisputed by the parties. Furthermore, in so far as the Government argued that the domestic courts had dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests for restoration of the case file by their decision of 10\u00a0November 1998, the Court observes that they furnished no evidence to the effect that this decision had ever been served on him (compare Sukhorubchenko v. , no.\u00a069315/01, \u00a7\u00a050, 10 February 2005).

However, the institution of proceedings does not, in itself, satisfy all the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 and the right of access to a court includes not only the right to institute proceedings but also the right to obtain a \u201cdetermination\u201d of the dispute by a court.

In any event, the Court considers that the decision of 26\u00a0August 2002, as upheld on appeal, made it clear that in 2002 any chance of the applicant\u2019s ever having his employment dispute determined was practically non-existent.
