The case originated in an application (no. 38945/05) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Sretko Pralica (“the applicant”), on 14 October 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Bereta, a lawyer practising in Prijedor. The Government of Bosnia and  (“the Government”) were represented by their Deputy Agent, Ms Z. Ibrahimović.
On 11 October 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in the vicinity of Prijedor.
Prior to the dissolution of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“the SFRY”) the applicant deposited foreign currency in his bank accounts at the then Privredna banka Sarajevo Filijala Prijedor. In , as well as in other successor States of the former SFRY, such savings are commonly referred to as “old” foreign-currency savings (for the relevant background information see Jeličić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 41183/02, ECHR 2005-...).
Following several unsuccessful attempts to withdraw his funds, the applicant instituted proceedings, seeking the recovery of his entire “old” foreign-currency savings and accrued interest.
By a decision of the Prijedor Court of First Instance of 4 September 1995 the Prijedorska banka (the legal successor of the Privredna banka Sarajevo Filijala Prijedor) was ordered to pay the applicant 254,725.85 German marks (DEM) and legal costs in the amount of 2,000 dinars (approximately DEM 770 on the date of the judgment). The judgment entered into force on 11 March 1996. On 26 December 1997 the Prijedor Court of First Instance issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju).
Although domestic authorities took over the judgment debt, the judgment has not yet been enforced.
