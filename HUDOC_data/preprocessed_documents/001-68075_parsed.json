This obligation applies also to higher courts. Nonetheless, when so applied it cannot be construed in the same way as for a first-instance court. Higher courts sometimes have to take into account considerations other than the mere chronological order in which cases are entered on the list, such as the nature of a case or the urgency it requires. Furthermore, while Article 6 requires that judicial proceedings be conducted expeditiously, it also lays emphasis on the more general principle of the proper administration of justice (see, for example, Gast and Popp v.\u00a0Germany, no. 29357/95, p. 487, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000-II).",
