Where there is a choice of remedies open to an applicant, Article 35 must be applied to reflect the practical realities of the applicant\u2019s position in order to ensure the effective protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (see, inter alia, Hilal v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a045276/99, 8 February 2000, and Krumpel and Krumpelova v.

Indeed, where an applicant has a choice of remedies and their comparative effectiveness is not obvious, the Court tends to interpret the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies in the applicant\u2019s favour (see Budayeva and Others v.

Moreover, an applicant who has used a remedy which is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried others that were also available but probably no more likely to be successful (see Ivan Vasilev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7\u00a056, 12 April 2007 and the cases cited therein).",

For the Court, the same consideration holds true as regards the State\u2019s positive obligation under Article 8 to protect an individual\u2019s private life from the acts of another individual, while taking into account the wide margin of appreciation the Contracting States enjoy in this area (see paragraphs 80 above). In this context, the Court accepts that in certain situations the domestic authorities might be required to proceed with the dispersal of a violent and blatantly intolerant demonstration for the protection of an individual\u2019s private life under Article\u00a08. Nonetheless, in the present case, the applicant\u2019s complaint was merely directed against the authorities\u2019 failure to apply criminal-law sanctions against the demonstrators to prevent an infringement of her private life.",

In this context the statement that private life is not susceptible to exhaustive definition, in paragraph 78 of the reasoning, may convey the idea that a definition of the term \u201cprivate life\u201d in the Convention is impossible. I disagree with this view. In principle, even a broad and vague legal concept used in an international treaty has a certain meaning and is susceptible to definition. If the term \u201cprivate life\u201d used in the Convention cannot be defined, then the content of the legal rule enshrined in Article 8 of the Convention becomes uncertain and the normative force of this treaty provision is put into question. Even assuming that \u201cprivate life\u201d is undefinable, the Court should provide as precise guidelines as possible concerning the content and scope of legal obligations imposed on the High Contracting Parties.",

As long as the Court continues to entertain uncertainty about the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d, the scope of obligations under Article 8 remains undetermined. Even if in some areas belonging to the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d there is sufficient case-law to predict future judgments of the Court, it remains a broad domain subject to uncertainty. The High Contracting Parties are aware that they have to protect some values connected with the private sphere but they have only a limited knowledge of the exact content of their obligations and cannot foresee exactly where their obligations end. They cannot reasonably be blamed for not always observing a treaty provision whose precise meaning remains \u2013 to a large extent \u2013 unknown to them. Finding violations of Article 8 in such a specific context entails a fragmentation of the international law regime of State responsibility for treaty violations.",

                        "content": "5.\u00a0\u00a0Some scholars have expressed the view that private life, as understood by different courts, is a bundle of disparate entitlements (see, for instance, M.-T. Meulders-Klein, \u201cVie priv\u00e9e, vie familale et droits de l\u2019homme\u201d, Revue internationale de droit compar\u00e9, 1992 no. 4, p. 771). This remark is especially valid for the judicial application of Article 8, which has become a legal basis for extremely heterogeneous entitlements lacking cohesion and devoid of logical connections. The conceptual confusion reflects the vicissitudes of the case-law. The provision is used by the Court to fill the lacunae in the Convention and to broaden its scope to protect highly varying individual interests which were not previously covered by this treaty. The lack of a precise definition of the notion in question leaves the Court very broad freedom of action. Such a situation is difficult to accept, however, because it undermines legal certainty and, more generally, the international rule of law. Moreover, the Court\u2019s case-law goes beyond the limits of permissible evolutionary treaty interpretation and turns the judicial application of the Convention into primary rule-making without sufficient democratic legitimacy. One of the consequences of such an approach is also that it limits the scope of the right to political participation by way of parliamentary elections, protected by Article 3 of Protocol No 1. Matters which should be decided either by way of new treaties, ratified with the consent of democratically elected national parliaments, or by way of national legislation, enacted by national parliaments, are decided by the international judge (see my dissenting opinion to the judgment of 12 \u00a0August \u00a02014 in the case of Firth v. the United Kingdom (nos. 47784/09, 47806/09, 47812/09, 47818/09, 47829/09, 49001/09, 49007/09, 49018/09, 49033/09 and 49036/09)).",

Taking account of the case-law of the Court and national courts and without entering into a detailed legal analysis, it suffices to say here \u2013 briefly \u2013 that \u201crespect for private life\u201d may be understood as protection of autonomy and secrecy in personal matters. The notion under consideration does not encompass ethnic identity, which is a different matter. Ethnic identity is protected \u2013 to some extent \u2013 by certain other provisions of the Convention, in particular Article 3 and Article 14, but enjoys much stronger and more efficient protection under other international treaties.",
