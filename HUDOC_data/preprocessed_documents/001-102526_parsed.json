The Court further observes that normally the applicants are not called on to be legally represented in the cases like the present one and therefore their legal expenses are not reimbursed. In the instant case, the applicant furnished a contract concluded with a lawyer containing no detailed account of the services to be rendered. The applicant did not provide any document evidencing payment in compliance with the contract either. Yet, the lawyer concerned filed observations and two inquiries to the Court on the applicant's behalf. Regard being had to the Court's case-law and the information in its possession, the Court awards the amount of EUR\u00a0100 for costs and expenses (see mutatis mutandis, Romanchenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a05596/03, \u00a7\u00a038, 22 November 2005).",
