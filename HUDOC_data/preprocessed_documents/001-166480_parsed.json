Under the agreement, a security zone was created between the conflicting parties and a Joint Control Commission was set up to monitor the implementation of the agreement in the security zone. The JCC is composed of representatives of Russia, the Republic of Moldova and the self-proclaimed Republic of Transdniestria. Any decisions made by the JCC must have the consent of all the parties (for more details, see Ila\u015fcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, \u00a7\u00a7 87-91, ECHR 2004VII).",

The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Mozer, cited above \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).

Greece, no. 51473/99, \u00a7 43, 6 June 2002; Herrmann v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 9300/07, \u00a7 74, 26 June 2012; Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.

I take the same view in the present case. In paragraph 49 of the judgment the Court concludes that it has found no element to be considered as a legal basis for interfering with the applicants\u2019 property rights. This conclusion has far-reaching consequences. The Court has not merely limited itself to the fact that the independence of Transdniestria has not been recognised by the international community. In the present case the Court has aggravated the situation even further: the Court does not recognise the existence of the Transdniestrian legal system as a whole. This allows the Court to find a violation of the Convention by the Russian Federation automatically, without any legal analysis. It is difficult to imagine a more uncompromising reaction to the self-determination process. Such an approach creates the impression that there is a fundamental defect in the Court\u2019s position in such cases.",
