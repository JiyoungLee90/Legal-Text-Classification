However, while this singling out of members of the media was aimed at enabling and facilitating journalistic activity, it did not have the effect of conferring any sort of immunity on journalists when they failed to comply with police orders to leave the scene of a demonstration. Only a limited number of member States (Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Russia and Serbia) dealt with the issue of news-gathering during demonstrations by way of specific regulations.

The applicant claimed that there had been no separate and secure press area for journalists at the site of the demonstration. He had contacted all the main media organisations and found out that none of the journalists present had been instructed to go to a secure area and no one had in fact seen such an area. The view from outside into the cordoned-off area had been blocked by a dense, several rows deep, line of police officers, police minibuses and police buses. At 7.15 p.m. the police had cordoned off an even larger area, which had made it even more difficult to follow the events. There could not have been a secured area for journalists because originally the demonstration was to be a march and therefore a static press area would not have served any purpose. Even if there were such an area, its use should have been optional as it was not up to the State authorities to decide from which angle journalists should cover the event.",

There had also been a separate area for media representatives. However, the escalation of violence at the site of the Smash ASEM demonstration had resulted in the police arriving in numerous vehicles, some of which may have blocked visibility from the secure area to parts of the site. It was uncontested that the applicant had personally heard the police orders to disperse by 8.30 p.m. and that he had seen people heading towards the exits. At around 9 p.m., when the police had given the final orders to disperse, there had been two other photographers at the demonstration site but they had left the scene at around 9.15 p.m. No measures had been imposed on them at any stage. The police orders had been given in order to calm the situation, to restore public order and, in particular, to ensure public safety. When at 9.15\u00a0p.m. the police had ordered the applicant to leave he had refused to do so, stating that, as a photographer, the order did not apply to him. At that time those members of the crowd who had shown resistance had been detained and the event had come to an end. Some minutes later the police had apprehended the applicant as it had been clear that he was determined to disobey the police. As the applicant had consulted his superior by telephone asking for advice on whether to stay or leave, he had clearly understood that the police orders applied to him as well. The District Court had also found it established that the police orders had clearly applied to everybody, thus the applicant\u2019s apprehension could not have come as a surprise to him.",

The applicant lodged the complaint that his detention had been illegal in so far as it exceeded twelve hours for the first time in his submissions to the Grand Chamber. The Chamber, when examining the necessity of the interference with the applicant\u2019s right under Article 10, had regard to the Government\u2019s argument that the duration of the applicant\u2019s detention of about eighteen hours was explained by the fact that he was detained late at night and that domestic law prohibited interrogations between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. (see paragraph 48 of the Chamber judgment). However, the applicant had not complained before the Chamber that his detention for a duration exceeding twelve hours was unlawful. This complaint did not form part of the application which was declared admissible by the Chamber, and therefore falls outside the scope of the examination by the Grand Chamber.

Switzerland, 25 March 1998, \u00a7 59, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, and Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, \u00a7 29, Series A no.\u00a0176-A). None of the applicant\u2019s arguments discloses any indication that the domestic authorities applied the law in an arbitrary manner. The Court is therefore satisfied that the interference complained of, encompassing the applicant\u2019s apprehension, detention and conviction, had a legal basis in Finnish law, namely in section 19 of the Police Act, in Chapter 1, section 2, second paragraph, of the Coercive Measures Act and in Chapter 16, section 4, of the Penal Code. The Court therefore concludes that the interference was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d.",

It is to be noted in this connection that paragraph 2 of Article 10 does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to media coverage of matters of serious public concern. In particular, and notwithstanding the vital role played by the media in a democratic society, journalists cannot, in principle, be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that, as journalists, Article 10 affords them a cast-iron defence (see, among other authorities and mutatis mutandis, Stoll, cited above, \u00a7 102; Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7 65; and Monnat v.

As the demonstration turned violent, the police first prevented the crowd from marching but allowed a peaceful demonstration to be held on the spot. Later on the police sealed off the area around the demonstration and ordered the crowd to disperse. The police had made security preparations for the event by deploying 480 police and border-guard officers. The police had good reason to expect, on the basis of the risk assessment made by the Finnish Security Intelligence and their previous experience of riots which had taken place the same year, as well as in view of the tone of the posters inviting members of the public to \u201cbring even a little bit of mayhem to the streets of Helsinki\u201d and the anonymity of the organiser of the demonstration (see paragraphs 12-16 above), that the demonstration might turn violent. Subsequently the District Court found that the police actions had been legal and that the police had had justifiable reasons to give the orders to disperse (see paragraph 37 above). The Court therefore sees no reason to doubt that the police orders were based on a reasonable assessment of the facts. Moreover, in the Court\u2019s view, the preventive measures against the likelihood of the events turning violent, including police orders to leave the scene of the demonstration, were justified. The measures were directed not only at the \u201cabstract\u201d protection of public order \u2013 the protection of public safety as well as the prevention of disorder and crime \u2013 but also at the safety of individuals at or in the vicinity of the demonstration, including members of the media and thus also the applicant himself.",

Furthermore, the demonstration was of such a character \u2013 initially foreseen as a march along the route \u2013 that the violent events could and actually did take place in an \u201cunpredicted\u201d area. In such a situation there was no possibility whatsoever for the authorities to secure in advance an area close to such events.

It cannot therefore be said that the applicant was as such prevented from reporting on the event.

The applicant\u2019s appearance did not therefore seem to allow him to be clearly distinguishable from the protesters. It is thus likely that, on the basis of his presence within the cordoned-off area, as well as of his appearance, he was not readily identifiable as a journalist prior to his apprehension.",

It appears from the pre-trial investigation report that he did so to his apprehending officer, who stated during the pre-trial investigation that the applicant did not resist the apprehension and that he had asked to make a telephone call, which he had been allowed to do. When the apprehending police officer had asked for identification, the applicant had presented his press card (see paragraph 27 above). From this it can be deduced that the applicant was not wearing his press badge, or at least was not wearing it visibly so that he could be immediately identified as a journalist. Another police officer present during the applicant\u2019s apprehension stated during the pre-trial investigation that the applicant did not resist the apprehension but that he did not hear the applicant identify himself as a journalist (ibid.). It has also not been established whether the applicant identified himself as a journalist when he was taken to the bus taking him to custody. Nevertheless, the Court considers that the police must have learned of his status as a journalist at the latest at the police station when the receiving police officer removed the applicant\u2019s press card which, according to the applicant\u2019s own submissions, he had \u201cheld up\u201d and started to wear visibly on his chest only a while earlier (see paragraph 28 above). On the basis of this information, the Court considers that, had the applicant wished to be acknowledged as a journalist by the police, he should have made sufficiently clear efforts to identify himself as such either by wearing distinguishable clothing or keeping his press badge visible at all times, or by any other appropriate means. He failed to do so. The applicant\u2019s situation was thus different from that of the journalist in Najafli v. Azerbaijan who was wearing a journalist\u2019s badge on his chest and also had specifically told the police officers that he was a journalist (see Najafli v. Azerbaijan, no. 2594/07, \u00a7 67, 2 October 2012; see also, mutatis mutandis, Gsell, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

The Court observes that the District Court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the orders of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them (see paragraph 37 above). The applicant himself admitted before the District Court and in his submissions to this Court that he had heard the orders at around 8.30 p.m. (see paragraphs 24 and 37 above). This is also confirmed by the fact that the applicant then called his employer to discuss whether he should leave the area or not (see paragraph 24 above). For the Court, this fact shows that the applicant understood, or at least contemplated, that the order applied to him as well. In addition, the applicant conceded in his submissions to this Court that, about half an hour later, he was personally told to disperse by a police officer, but he replied to the police officer that he had decided to stay (see paragraph 25 above). This admission is in manifest contradiction with the applicant\u2019s claim that he was not aware of the police orders to disperse. The applicant thus clearly knew what he was doing and it cannot therefore be accepted that he was unaware of the police orders. Moreover, as a journalist reporting on police actions, he had to be aware of the legal consequences disobeying police orders may entail. Therefore, the Court cannot but conclude that, by not obeying the orders given by the police, the applicant knowingly took the risk of being apprehended for contumacy towards the police.",

As witnessed by this last remaining journalist during the District Court proceedings, he had taken his last photograph at 9.15 p.m. and left the area just two to three minutes before the applicant\u2019s apprehension took place. No measures were imposed on these journalists at any point (see paragraph 37 above). The applicant could also have left the scene and moved outside the police cordon without any consequences at any time during it. Moreover, nothing in the case file suggests that the applicant, had he obeyed the order given by the police to leave the cordoned-off area, could not have continued to exercise his professional assignment even in the immediate vicinity of the cordoned-off area where, as it later developed, the police broke up the crowd of demonstrators and apprehended the protesters.",

The Court observes that there is no information in the case file as to whether the applicant asked to be interrogated promptly during the night. The applicant has not even alleged that he did so. In addition, 128 persons altogether were apprehended and detained due to the demonstration and this fact may also have delayed the applicant\u2019s release. However, the next day the applicant was one of the first to be interrogated and released due to his status as a journalist: he was the seventh detainee to be interrogated and the sixth to be released after the release of the minors (see paragraph 32 above).

Since these lawful orders were not obeyed, the police were entitled to apprehend and detain the disobedient demonstrators. As the Government pointed out, the fact that the applicant was a journalist did not entitle him to preferential or different treatment in comparison to the other people left at the scene (see paragraph 78 above). This approach is also supported by the information available to the Court, according to which the legislation of the majority of the Council of Europe member States does not have the effect of conferring any special status on journalists when they fail to comply with police orders to leave the scene of a demonstration (see paragraph 57 above).",

According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the principle of discretionary prosecution leaves States considerable room for manoeuvre in deciding whether or not to institute proceedings against someone thought to have committed an offence (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoll, cited above, \u00a7 159). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that journalists cannot be exempted from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law solely on the basis that Article\u00a010 affords them protection (ibid., \u00a7 102). Nonetheless, the Court accepts that journalists may sometimes face a conflict between the general duty to abide by ordinary criminal law, of which journalists are not absolved, and their professional duty to obtain and disseminate information thus enabling the media to carry out their essential role as a public watchdog. Against the background of this conflict of interests, it has to be emphasised that the concept of responsible journalism requires that whenever a journalist \u2013 as well as his or her employer \u2013 has to make a choice between the two duties and if he or she makes this choice to the detriment of the duty to abide by ordinary criminal law, such journalist has to be aware that he or she runs the risk of being subject to legal sanctions, including those of a criminal character, by not obeying the lawful orders of, inter alia, the police.",

The reasons given by the District Court for the applicant\u2019s conviction for contumacy towards the police are succinct. However, having regard to the particular nature of the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression at stake in the present case (see paragraph 108 above), the Court is satisfied that they are relevant and sufficient.

In the present case, the District Court refrained from imposing any penalty on the applicant as his act was considered \u201cexcusable\u201d.

Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98 and 3 others, ECHR 2003-II); the interference must be justified by an \u201coverriding social need\u201d (see Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, Series A no.\u00a0216); and public policies must be pursued \u201cin the least onerous way as regards human rights\u201d (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a036022/97, 2 October 2001).

However, the assessment of whether there was a pressing social need to interfere with a journalist\u2019s right under Article\u00a010 is materially different from cases where other individuals exercise the right to freedom of expression. Hence in Stoll the Court considered it necessary to examine whether the conviction of the journalist, for disclosing confidential information in breach of the criminal law, was nonetheless necessary, and in that regard adopted the following criteria: the interests at stake, the review of the measure by the domestic courts, the conduct of the applicant and whether the penalty imposed was proportionate (see Stoll, cited above, \u00a7 112).",

In my view, that approach is incorrect. Although the facts of the present case concern the criminal conduct of a journalist whilst obtaining information during a public demonstration, rather than the disclosure of confidential information, the same criteria as developed in Stoll are applicable for assessment under Article 10 \u00a7 2 in this case, although they of course have to be adapted accordingly to the facts as they are presented here.",

It goes without saying that the way in which the police dealt with the situation justified intrusive journalistic scrutiny. It is important to highlight that the applicant was apprehended when the police engaged with the last remaining protesters within the cordoned-off area, after the dispersal order had been issued. It was exactly at that moment that it became crucial for the purposes of Article 10 of the Convention for the press to be able to observe the operational choices made by the police in arresting and dispersing the remaining participants so as to secure transparency and accountability. I would refer here to the Venice Commission\u2019s Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly: Second Edition, adopted in 2010, drawn up by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Co-operation and Security in Europe (see paragraph\u00a055 of the present judgment), which state that third parties (such as monitors, journalists, and photographers) may also be asked to disperse, \u201cbut they should not be prevented from observing and recording the policing operation\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 168-69). Also, \u201c[p]hotographing or video recording the policing operation by participants and other third parties should not be prevented, and any requirement to surrender film or digitally recorded images or footage to the law enforcement agencies should be subject to prior judicial scrutiny\u201d.",

In fact, this was exactly the view adopted by the Helsinki District Court, when it concluded that the applicant\u2019s act was \u201cexcusable\u201d under Chapter 6, section 12(3), of the Penal Code. The District Court correctly acknowledged (see paragraph 37 of the present judgment) that, as a journalist, the applicant was \u201cforced to adapt his behaviour in the situation due to the conflicting expectations expressed by the police, on the one hand, and by his profession and employer, on the other hand\u201d. Thus, the interests at stake were such that the applicant, as a journalist, should have been given ample latitude by the police to pursue his journalistic activity, taking due account of Article 10 of the Convention. It follows that applying the first of the Stoll criteria, and thus having proper regard not just for the applicant\u2019s own rights but for the important societal interests which were also at stake, the margin of appreciation afforded to the respondent State is very limited. On that basis alone, it is already doubtful that there was a pressing social need justifying the intrusive interferences with the applicant\u2019s Convention rights, given that they involved not only his initial arrest but also his detention and the seizure of his professional equipment, his prosecution and ultimately his criminal conviction for contumacy towards the police.",

                        "content": "10.\u00a0\u00a0As regards the second of the Stoll criteria, the review of the measure by the domestic courts, the Court\u2019s role under Article 10 of the Convention is limited to assessing whether the grounds relied on by the domestic authorities were relevant and sufficient. I note at the outset that the domestic courts\u2019 role in this case was limited to assessing whether the conditions for convicting the applicant of contumacy towards the police under Chapter\u00a016, section 4(1), of the Finnish Penal Code were fulfilled. In the Helsinki District Court\u2019s judgment (see paragraph 37 of the present judgment), no examination was carried out to determine whether there was a pressing social need for convicting the applicant, taking into account all the measures to which he had been subjected. There was no analysis of the necessity of his detention or the seizure of his journalistic equipment. Furthermore, I disagree with the majority that the reasoning of the Helsinki District Court shows that it struck a fair balance between the conflicting interests at stake, as required by the case-law of the Court. The District Court gave a very laconic assessment of the necessity of convicting the applicant, finding simply that \u201cit was necessary to stop the situation at Kiasma by ordering the crowd to disperse and asking the persons to leave the area\u201d. On that basis alone, the District Court concluded that the \u201cconditions for restricting Pentik\u00e4inen\u2019s freedom of expression by ordering him to disperse along with the remaining crowd were fulfilled\u201d. The District Court\u2019s subsequent reasoning, distinguishing the applicant\u2019s case from Dammann v.\u00a0Switzerland (no. 77551/01, 25 April 2006), is also summed up in a single sentence, in which it proclaimed that \u201cthe cited case is not similar to the case at hand\u201d.",

Furthermore, in the latter part of its judgment the District Court nevertheless concluded, as I mentioned above, that the applicant\u2019s act was \u201cexcusable\u201d under Chapter 6, section 12(3), of the Penal Code. In this sense, the District Court\u2019s judgment is internally inconsistent for the purposes of the necessity assessment required under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention: on the one hand, it was necessary to apprehend the applicant for disobeying the police, but, on the other, it was nonetheless excusable for him to act in that way! It clearly follows that the Helsinki District Court\u2019s reasoning, although perhaps relevant, cannot be considered sufficient under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

Firstly, it is undisputed that the applicant took no direct or active part in the demonstration. He was apprehended for not obeying police orders to disperse when the police decided to engage with the last remaining participants in the cordoned-off area, and not for rioting or other violent behaviour. Secondly, as the majority correctly conclude (see paragraph 98 of the present judgment), the applicant was not readily identifiable as a journalist prior to his apprehension. Thirdly, it nevertheless appears from the pre-trial investigation, as acknowledged in the Court\u2019s judgment (see paragraph 99), that the applicant identified himself to the apprehending officer. When the police officer asked for his identification, the applicant presented his press card.",

                        "content": "12.\u00a0\u00a0As I mentioned at the outset, I accept that the police were initially justified in apprehending the applicant at the end of the demonstration as he was not displaying his press card visibly and was wearing clothing that did not distinguish him from the protesters. However, the duty of the Government to demonstrate the existence of a pressing social need for interfering with the applicant\u2019s Article 10 rights does not stop there, as the applicant was subsequently subjected to other restrictive measures, even though the police were well aware that the applicant was a journalist, as the apprehending officer\u2019s testimony confirmed. It is in that context that the correct characterisation of the applicant\u2019s conduct during the demonstration becomes decisive. In that respect it is noteworthy that the majority seem to assess a number of important facts \u2013 relating to the events, the applicant\u2019s conduct and his state of mind \u2013 to his disadvantage, although other justifiable explanations for the applicant\u2019s actions are equally plausible (see, for example, paragraphs 100-01, 103 and 107 of the present judgment). I stress that it is clear that if a journalist violates the criminal law by directly and actively taking part in a hostile or violent demonstration, Article 10 will, in principle, not provide a safe haven from measures such as detention and possible prosecution. However, that was clearly not the case here. The applicant made a judgment call in the middle of a tense and developing situation, to the effect that his freedom to impart information to the public should outweigh his duty to follow the dispersal order. Thus, the Helsinki District Court correctly characterised the applicant\u2019s act as excusable. It is true, as the majority note, that a journalist has of course to be aware of the fact that he or she assumes the risk of being subject to legal sanctions by not obeying the police (see paragraph 110). However, the majority overlook the crucial importance of recognising at the same time that a journalist can justifiably consider that his actions are protected on the basis of his freedom of expression. In the light of the applicant\u2019s conduct, the Government have therefore in no way demonstrated that, once the police were informed of his journalistic status and shown his press card, there remained a pressing social need which justified subjecting him to a seventeen-and-a-half-hour period of detention, taking away his journalistic equipment, and prosecuting and convicting him for contumacy towards the police.",

With all due respect, to suggest that the decision to prosecute and convict a journalist for a criminal offence does not, in a case such as the present one, have, by itself, a chilling effect on journalistic activity is overly simplistic and unconvincing. On the contrary, it is in my view not unreasonable to consider that today\u2019s decision, accepting as permissible under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention the prosecution of the applicant and his conviction for a criminal offence, will have a significant deterrent effect on journalistic activity in similar situations occurring regularly all over Europe.",

I note that it is not in the least convincing for the majority to attempt to limit their findings to the \u201cparticular circumstances of the instant case\u201d (see paragraph 114 of the present judgment). On the contrary, it is quite clear that the reasoning of the majority will unfortunately allow Contracting States considerable latitude in imposing intrusive measures on journalistic activity in public settings where force is used by law-enforcement officials.",

Recent events in many European countries demonstrate, more than ever, the necessity of safeguarding the fundamental role of the press in obtaining and disseminating to the public information on all aspects of governmental activity. That is, after all, one of the crucial elements of the democratic ideal protected by the European Convention on Human Rights.",
