The Court notes, however, that this Article spoke solely of the possibility of terminating the right of ownership in respect of land and contained no mention whatsoever of terminating the right of use of accommodation (see paragraph 18 above). Thus, it appears that the applicants' right of use was terminated with reliance on legal rules which were not applicable to their case. The Court considers that such termination of their right of use was bound to result in an unforeseeable or arbitrary outcome and must have deprived the applicants of effective protection of their rights. It therefore cannot but describe the interference with the applicants' possessions on such a legal basis as arbitrary and unlawful (see, mutatis mutandis, Minasyan and Semerjyan, cited above, \u00a7 75-76).",
