In particular, the administrative body in charge of sanitary monitoring (nadle\u017eni organ uprave za poslove sanitarnog nadzora; \u201csanitary inspectorate\u201d) issued special permits for exhumation and transfer, and established conditions in respect thereof, but acquiring such a\u00a0permit required opening special proceedings.",

She had therefore no other way to exercise her right except through the courts. By rejecting her claim the courts had left her subject to the will (samovolja) of the respondent party. The fact that the Montenegrin legislation did not regulate all issues relating to burials and the transfer of mortal remains did not mean that she had no right to transfer her husband\u2019s remains. She maintained that thereby she had been deprived of her right to fair trial, and the right to family life in a broader sense. She also referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 1994 (see paragraph 10 above). She furthermore submitted that the courts in the surrounding region, such as the Zagreb Municipality Court and the Zagreb County Court, had ruled on claims relating to the exhumation and transfer of mortal remains from one burial place to another.",

As the Supreme Court only kept case files for five years, after which they were destroyed, the case that she had referred to had most probably been destroyed too. Moreover, the practice of the courts in the region was irrelevant.

The court held that it did not have authority to rule on the transfer of mortal remains from one grave to another. That judgment was upheld by a second-instance court. On 30 April 1995 the Supreme Court (Rev. br. 153/94) upheld the finding that the local sanitary inspectorate was in charge of issuing permits for the removal of mortal remains, but it held that in the case at issue A. had a right to use the burial plot in question, and that that was a property-related right on the basis of which she could seek a court\u2019s protection if she considered that her rights as a co-user of that burial plot had been breached. In other words, it was only through the courts that it was possible to regulate the use of a burial plot by its co-users; the claimant was thus authorised to seek the protection of that right before the courts.",

France (no.\u00a037794/97, ECHR 2001X), the Court held that the delay in releasing the body of the applicant\u2019s child for a funeral after an investigation infringed Article 8 of the Convention in both its private and family life aspects. Moreover,\u00a0in the case of\u00a0Znamenskaya v. Russia (no. 77785/01, 2 June 2005), the Court considered the private life aspect of Article 8 to be applicable to the question of whether a mother had the right to change the family name on the tombstone of her stillborn child.\u00a0Finally, the burial of a\u00a0still-born baby in a common grave without consulting or informing the mother, together with the transport of the body in an ordinary van, constituted an interference with the mother\u2019s respect for private and family life which had no domestic legal basis (see\u00a0Hadri-Vionnet v.

Therefore, the present case concerns an issue of the State\u2019s positive obligations in the sphere of relations between individuals and requires primarily an examination by the Court of whether an appropriate legal framework to regulate the situation at issue was in place and the Court\u2019s assessment of the conduct of the domestic authorities in that respect (see\u00a0B\u0103rbulescu v.

There are different ways of ensuring respect for private life and the nature of the State\u2019s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private or family life that is at issue. Even though the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not lend themselves to precise definition, the applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see\u00a0B\u0103rbulescu,\u00a0cited above, \u00a7 113). The breadth of this margin varies and depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual, the nature of the interference and the object pursued by the interference (see S. and Marper v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, \u00a7 101-102, ECHR 2008).",

Even though the domestic legislation did not explicitly provide that the nephew\u2019s consent was necessary for the exhumation, this was in fact the case. Notably, both undertakers and the relevant sanitary inspectorate affirm, inter alia, that the consent of the owner of the burial plot is in practice required (see paragraphs 14-15 above). In the absence of such consent, no permit can be issued and no exhumation can be undertaken. Furthermore, tampering with graves and cadavers without a\u00a0permit constitutes a criminal offence (see paragraphs 21-23 above).\u00a0The applicant\u2019s interest in the exhumation and transfer of her husband\u2019s remains therefore has to be weighed not only against society\u2019s role in ensuring the sanctity of graves, but also against the rights of her husband\u2019s nephew.",

As regards the present case, apart from considering whether the exhumation and removal, in practical terms, were possible and/or easy and whether there were any public-health interests involved, there are a number of other issues that required clarification. In particular, it was not clarified whether the applicant\u2019s husband had lived in BIH and whether the burial plot there was the applicant\u2019s alone or if they had acquired it jointly with the aim of them both being buried there one day. It also appears that there was a dispute as to whether the applicant\u2019s husband had been buried in Montenegro pursuant to his own wish or not. It was not clarified either whether there is anything preventing the applicant from having her final resting place in the same burial spot as her husband in the event that the exhumation is not undertaken.",

Notably, neither the 1988 Rules on the Conditions and Methods of Exhuming and Transferring Deceased Persons (see paragraph 24 above), nor any other piece of legislation set forth any\u00a0substantive standards for resolving disputes among family members regarding exhumation, or the final resting place, of the remains of a late relative. In addition, the body in charge of resolving such disputes was not defined. In particular, the domestic courts took the standpoint that the applicant needed to lodge a request with the administrative body, which in turn could not follow any such request in the absence of the third party\u2019s (i.e. the late husband\u2019s nephew\u2019s) consent. The\u00a0administrative bodies, as already noted, do not in general deal with such issues. In the event of a dispute, they instruct the parties first to resolve the matter and only then to lodge a request for exhumation. Such proceedings, in the Court\u2019s view, clearly lacked the ability to balance the competing interests. Possibly, such interests could perhaps be properly balanced in civil contentious proceedings that the applicant actually initiated.",

The judgment cautions, however, that \u201cthe nature and scope of this right ... will depend on the particular circumstances and the facts adduced\u201d (paragraph 48).

Such arrangements tend to be shaped by one\u2019s culture, tradition and religious or philosophical beliefs as well as the final wishes of the deceased. As such, it seems uncontroversial that they deserve protection under both the private and family life aspects of Article 8.",

The national authorities are often required to weigh up competing considerations that do not normally arise in the immediate aftermath of a relative\u2019s death. Prime among these is the need to respect \u201cthe peace of the dead\u201d and to prevent exhumations in the absence of some important reason for doing so; some national or local authorities apply minimum rest periods, during which there is a strong presumption against disinterment (e.g. ten years in Austria, Germany and parts of Italy). This restrictive principle has been expressly recognised by the Court in the Elli Poluhas D\u00f6dsbo v.\u00a0Sweden (no. 61564/00, ECHR 2006I) case (see paragraph 52 of the judgment). Considerations based on the sanctity of graves are further supported by obvious public health concerns. In addition, property interests of third parties in the burial plot, or competing family claims over the wishes of the deceased, may need to be considered. It therefore seems difficult to speak of a fully-fledged \u201cright to exhumation\u201d, rather than legitimate private or family life interests that may be invoked in certain exceptional situations. In general terms, I consider that States are entitled to a wider margin of appreciation in regulating disinterment, compared to the original funeral arrangements.",

An administrative or judicial authority must invariably authorise exhumation. However, even requests grounded on such motives are not necessarily granted automatically, and may be rejected when weighed in the balance against other considerations such as the \u201cimmutability of burials\u201d or the wishes of other family members.",

Her request was motivated by what she claimed to be her late husband\u2019s wishes \u2013 a fact disputed by the husband\u2019s nephew \u2013 and their supposed plan to be buried together in a family plot in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the surviving spouse, her preferences should take priority over those of other (more remote) family members, unless shown to be contrary to the final wish of the deceased. The fact that the husband\u2019s original burial took place during the armed conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina would also appear to be an important consideration. All these factors had to be weighed up carefully by the national authorities.",

Instead, they simply concluded that the applicant had no \u201cproperty-related, status-related or any other interests\u201d in requesting the transfer of her husband\u2019s remains.
