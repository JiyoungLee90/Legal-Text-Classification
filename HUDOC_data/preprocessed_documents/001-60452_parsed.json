In particular, the seizure of all the assets of the registered partnership and the office records had frightened off financial backers, preventing the applicants from purchasing a modern wood processor and putting it to use already in 1989. Only in 1994 had their financial situation improved sufficiently for them to countenance the purchase of the wood processor. However, the machine they purchased, and which they started using in October 1994, was second-hand and had neither the capacity nor the reliability of a new machine. Only in July 1997 were the applicants able to purchase a new wood processor which met their standards. Until then, the enterprise had therefore had much less earning power than it would have had if the various Netherlands authorities had left it alone. ",
