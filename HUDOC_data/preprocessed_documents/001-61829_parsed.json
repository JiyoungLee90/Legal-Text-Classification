They considered that the position of a member of parliament was a position of trust which did not entail any statutory or other obstacle to prevent him or her from acting as an expert member of a court of appeal in cases concerning rental matters. M.P. had sat as a lay member in rental matters since 1974 and gained extensive expertise. The fact that he was a social democrat was of no relevance to the proceedings.",

The Court observes that M.P. had sat on the Court of Appeal as an expert in rental matters since 1974 and had, in the Government's view, acquired considerable experience, permitting him to make a valuable contribution to the adjudication of these types of cases.

Even assuming therefore that participation by a member of parliament in, for example, the adoption of a general legislative measure could cast doubt on later judicial functions, it cannot be asserted in this case that M.P. was involved in any other capacity with the subject matter of the applicant company's case through his position as a member of parliament.",
