As to the facts, it observed that the second applicant had attached their third-party claim for damages to the proceedings orally in the interview of 3 December 2002. As to the law, the Constitutional Court referred to the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Krumpel and Krumpelov\u00e1 v.\u00a0Slovakia (no.\u00a056195/00, 5 July 2005) and acknowledged that an aggrieved party (obe\u0165) of a\u00a0criminal offence who attached a third-party claim for damages (adh\u00e9zny n\u00e1rok) to the criminal proceedings was entitled to the guarantees of the civil limb of Article 6 of the Convention. However, referring to unspecified practice of the ordinary courts and to the nature of things, the Constitutional Court held that it was a\u00a0condition for the aggrieved party to benefit from the guarantees in question to have made the claim against a specific person and that that person could be identified no earlier than when charges were brought against him or her. The Constitutional Court further referred to its previous case-law on the subject and held specifically that the aggrieved party claiming damages in the criminal proceedings only benefited from the right to a hearing within a\u00a0reasonable time under Article 6 after a charge had been brought against a\u00a0specific person. In that regard, the Constitutional Court noted that the charges against A. of 4 November 2004 had been quashed on 10\u00a0January\u00a02005 (see paragraph 10 above). Therefore, at the time of the constitutional complaint, the applicants had no longer benefited from the constitutional guarantees relied on.",

However, in the author\u2019s view, its provisions are to be understood so that the condition of being lodged in due time is fulfilled when the thirdparty claim is included in a\u00a0criminal complaint. Judicial practice indicates that the aggrieved party must make the third-party claim against a\u00a0specific person charged with a\u00a0criminal offence. Without this condition being fulfilled, the criminal court has no power to rule on the aggrieved party\u2019s compensation.
