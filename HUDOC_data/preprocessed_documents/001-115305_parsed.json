As to the costs and expenses claimed in respect of the domestic proceedings, the Court notes, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, that the applicants failed to specify and substantiate their claim in any respect. As to the proceedings before the Court, making its assessment on an equitable basis and in the light of its practice in comparable cases, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicants, who were legally represented, the claimed sum of EUR\u00a02,400, plus any tax that may be chargeable to them on these amounts.",
