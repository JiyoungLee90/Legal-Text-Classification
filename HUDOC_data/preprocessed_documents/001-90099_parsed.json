Later that night a police officer in uniform had come to her flat and taken documents belonging to Mr Dvali and Mr\u00a0Kakushadze. On the morning of 8 August 2000 she had spoken to Mr\u00a0Berkadze by telephone, not the applicant. No one had ever mentioned the applicant\u2019s name in connection with the abduction of Mr Dvali and Mr\u00a0Kakushadze. She had given testimony against the applicant because she had been persuaded by the investigators that the applicant had ordered the killing of Mr\u00a0Dvali and Mr Kakushadze, but she now understood that the applicant was innocent.",

She repeated the arguments stated in her grounds of appeal. However, the appeal court upheld the findings of the first-instance court, referring again to the written depositions given by Mr Grigolashvili, Ms Margvelashvili and Mr Kervalishvili at the pre-trial stage, the recording of the telephone conversation of 8\u00a0August 2000 between Ms Margvelashvili and the applicant, the recording of the conversation between Mr Tsartsidze and Mr Grigolashvili, written and oral submissions by Ms Avaliani and Mr Tsartsidze and certain pieces of circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution. The court of appeal noted that the wiretapping of the telephone line of Ms\u00a0Margvelashvili\u2019s flat had been lawfully authorised by the President of the St Petersburg City Court for the period between 7 and 17 August 2000. As regards the depositions submitted by the defence, which were declared inadmissible by the trial court, the appeal court noted that \u201cthe trial court [had made] the correct legal assessment\u201d and declared them inadmissible. Further, the appeal court dismissed the complaint regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to summon Ms Galyashina and its discharge of Mr Kurdiani. The appeal court further noted that the first-instance court had not referred to the report prepared by the anonymous expert \u201cA.\u00a0P. Ivanova\u201d and had not breached any procedural rules by accepting her report. It also noted that the report had been admitted to the case file before the end of the trial. As to the grounds of appeal by Ms Margvelashvili and Mr Grigolashvili, the court of appeal held that \u201ctheir arguments ... were untenable, since their testimony had been thoroughly examined by the [first instance] court, it analysed them in its judgment, the findings of the [first instance] court are duly reasoned\u201d.",

In doing so the Court has to ascertain that the right to cross-examine witnesses has not been waived by the applicant in any form (see Ozerov v.

Thus, the Court will see whether the witness statement read out at the trial was corroborated by other evidence (even hearsay or circumstantial \u2013 see Asch, cited above). The Court will also examine other factors, for instance the procedure followed by the national courts while admitting and examining that evidence (see Haas (dec.), cited above; J.G. v.
