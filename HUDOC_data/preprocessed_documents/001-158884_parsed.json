In these circumstances, the \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d is also based on a reasonably justified reliance on administrative decisions which have a sound legal basis and which bear on property rights (see Kopeck\u00fd v.\u00a0Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, ECHR 2004-IX, and Pyrantien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 61).

While no estimates in this regard have been made by the domestic authorities, the Court finds it reasonable to conclude that the market value of the land in 2008, when the final judgment of the Supreme Court was adopted, was higher than the nominal price paid by the applicant in 1994. It should also be noted that the LTL 122 returned to the applicant had obviously suffered considerable devaluation and could not be reasonably related to the value of the land fourteen years later. Accordingly, the Court finds that the compensation of LTL 122 paid to the applicant in 2008 was clearly insufficient for the purchase of a new comparable plot of land (see, mutatis mutandis, Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7 207).",
