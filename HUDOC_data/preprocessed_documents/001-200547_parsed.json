There was also evidence that he had complained to his superiors that he had not been able to adapt to army life and had asked to be transferred to another unit, but this had not happened. By virtue of army order 7-1 of 2012 (subparagraph 6(a) point 5), which applied to army units and concerned the function of the National Guard\u2019s healthcare services, it was one of the duties and obligations of the Commander, in cooperation with the doctor, to identify problematic soldiers and to take all necessary measures to help them adjust to army life. It appeared that in the case of Mr Nicolaou the requisite measures had not been taken. His commanding officer knew of the problems and the Chief of Staff had confined himself to reassuring him and telling him to be patient until he was released from service and to come and see him when he had a problem or felt under pressure. Steps should also have been taken for his transfer. Although no criminal liability could be attributed to these persons, it was possible that disciplinary offences had been committed and should have been investigated by the army authorities.",

Furthermore, as admitted by the Attorney General, the conduct of the army officers as such during the period of Mr Nicolaou\u2019s military service and, particularly, at the time preceding his death had not been investigated (see paragraph 55 above). Indeed, the initial police report did not even mention the problems faced by Mr Nicolaou in the army (see\u00a0paragraph 26 above), never mind whether they could have had any link to his death.",

Even though these investigations were more thorough, the passage of time had undermined their effectiveness and certain essential failings could no longer be remedied. This was acknowledged by the Attorney General (see paragraph 81 above). The Court reiterates, in this connection, that the mere passage of time can work to the detriment of the investigation, and even fatally jeopardise its chances of success (see,\u00a0mutatis\u00a0mutandis, Talpis\u00a0v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a041237/14, \u00a7 128, 2 March 2017). It also observes that the passage of time will inevitably erode the amount and quality of the evidence available (see, see, mutatis mutandis, Paul\u00a0and\u00a0Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002II). In this connection, it is noted that any tests carried out on physical evidence after so many years, in the absence of proper storage, could not be reliable (see paragraphs 65 and 84 above).",
