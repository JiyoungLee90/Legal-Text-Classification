Accordingly, the applicants were required to seek redress at domestic level and bring a civil action for compensation before Polish courts (ibid., \u00a7\u00a081) and their applications to the Court were inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (\u00a7\u00a082).

Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation (see Nevmerzgitskiy v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a058825/00, 25 November 2003, where the applicant was subjected to force-feeding, and Tarariyeva v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.\u00a04353/03, 11\u00a0October 2005, where the applicant\u2019s son was denied medical assistance). However, in the event of a repetition of the same events, such as an applicant\u2019s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court\u2019s view, a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d which brought the entire period complained of within the Court\u2019s competence (see Vlasov v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 78146/01, 14 February 2006, and Moiseyev v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004). Similarly, in a situation where the applicant\u2019s detention in the police ward was not continuous but occurred at regular intervals when he was brought there for an interview with the investigator or other procedural acts, the Court accepted that in the absence of any material change in the conditions of his detention, the breaking-up of his detention into several periods was not justified (see Nedayborshch v.\u00a0, no. 42255/04, \u00a7\u00a025, 1\u00a0July 2010). In another case, the applicant\u2019s absence from the detention facility for carrying out a certain procedural act did not prevent the Court from recognising the continuous nature of his detention in that facility (see Romanov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a063993/00, \u00a7\u00a073, 20 October 2005, where the applicant spent one month out of the remand prison in a psychiatric institution). Nevertheless, where an applicant was released but subsequently re-detained, the Court limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Belashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a028617/03, \u00a7\u00a048, 4 December 2008; Grishin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a030983/02, \u00a7\u00a083, 15\u00a0November 2007; and Dvoynykh v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a072277/01, \u00a7\u00a046, 12\u00a0October 2006).",

Different types of detention facilities have different purposes and vary accordingly in the material conditions they can offer. Thus, temporary detention wings located inside police stations are designed for short-term custody only and often lack the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention, such as a toilet, sink, or exercise yard (see for example Shchebet v.\u00a0, no. 16074/07, \u00a7\u00a089, 12 June 2008), whereas in correctional colonies \u2013 in contrast to remand prisons \u2013 the restricted space in the dormitories is compensated for by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (see Nurmagomedov v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). The difference in material conditions of detention creates the presumption that an applicant\u2019s transfer to a different type of facility would require the submission of a separate complaint about the conditions of detention in the previous facility within six months of such transfer (see Volchkov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045196/04, \u00a7\u00a027, 14\u00a0October 2010; Gultyayeva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a067413/01, \u00a7\u00a0148, 1 April 2010; Maltabar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-84, and Nurmagomedov (dec.), cited above). Only in a few exceptional cases, having regard to the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of the detention conditions in both facilities, has the Court recognised the existence of a \u201ccontinuous situation\u201d encompassing the applicant\u2019s stay both in police custody and in the remand prison (see Lutokhin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a012008/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-42, 8 April 2010; Seleznev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036, and Guliyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a024650/02, \u00a7\u00a033, 19\u00a0June 2008).",

Nevertheless, a significant change in the detention regime, even where it occurs within the same facility, has been held by the Court to put an end to the \u201ccontinuous situation\u201d as described above and the six-month time-limit would thus be calculated from that moment: this would be the case for instance where the applicant has moved from a communal cell to solitary confinement (see Zakharkin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a01555/04, \u00a7\u00a0115, 10 June 2010) or from an ordinary cell to the hospital wing.",

Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention.

Nevertheless, the Court considers it important to review those findings in the light of the situation in the Russian legal system both on the date of the submission of the individual applications in the instant case and on the date of the present judgment. In doing so, it will depart from its ordinary practice of confining the scope of its review to the remedies explicitly invoked by the Government, but rather make a global assessment of the remedies available in the domestic legal system that appear prima facie capable of offering either preventive or compensatory relief to the aggrieved individual.",

However, there is no legal requirement on the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings that would entirely be a matter between the supervising prosecutor and the supervised body. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. Moreover, the Court has already seen cases in which an applicant did complain to a prosecutor but his complaint did not elicit any response (see Antropov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a022107/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 29\u00a0January 2009).

Even though the complainants have received a personal reply, the Court reiterates that, as a general rule, an application to an ombudsman cannot be regarded as an effective remedy as required by Article 35 of the Convention because the ombudsman has no power to render a binding decision granting redress (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a084, with further references).",

Their task is different: they identify various human rights issues on the basis of individual complaints and other information at their disposal, highlight problems in their annual reports and work out solutions in co-operation with regional and federal authorities (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above). While their activities may usefully contribute to general improvement of conditions of detention, the ombudsmen remain unable, in view of their specific remit, to provide redress in individual cases as required by the Convention.

The Russian Government, however, did not submit a single judicial decision showing that the complainant had been able to vindicate his or her rights by having recourse to this remedy. The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the conditions-of-detention cases that have previously come before it. The absence of an established judicial practice on this matter appears all the more baffling in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1\u00a0February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law no. 4866-1 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which Impaired Citizens\u2019 Rights and Freedoms. The remedy, which has not produced a substantial body of case-law or a plethora of successful claims in more than eighteen years of existence, leaves genuine doubts as to its practical effectiveness. Admittedly, the ruling of the Plenary Supreme Court, which explicitly mentioned the right of detainees to complain under Chapter 25 about their conditions of detention, was only adopted in February 2009, but it did not alter the existing procedure in any significant way and its effectiveness in practice still remains to be demonstrated (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 in paragraph 60 above).",

In the Aleksandr Makarov case, Mr Makarov\u2019s detention in most aspects, including the lighting, food, medical assistance, sanitary conditions, etc., complied with domestic legal regulations, yet their cumulative effect was such as to constitute inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a098-100). The Court found it questionable whether, in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed such conditions of his detention, Mr Makarov would have been able to argue his case effectively before a court, and noted that such approach by the Russian courts offered no prospect of success for his tort action and rendered this remedy theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-89; see also Silver and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0117-118, in which the jurisdiction of the English courts was limited to determining whether or not the prison authorities had exercised their powers in compliance with the Prison Act and the Rules).",

Thus, in the Skorobogatykh case, the Russian courts acknowledged the accuracy of Mr Skorobogatykh\u2019s allegations of severe overcrowding in the remand prison where he had been detained, but rejected his claim against the State, noting that the overcrowding was due to \u201cobjective reasons\u201d (see Skorobogatykh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a017-18 and 31-32). In another case the Russian courts explicitly stated that the prison management and State authorities in general could not be held liable in tort for the overcrowded cells and the state of disrepair into which the remand prison had fallen, owing to a lack of funding from the federal budget (see Artyomov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016-18 and 111-112). A similar situation obtained in the Roman Karasev case, where the courts consistently absolved the authorities of all liability, citing \u201cobjective factors\u201d (see Roman Karasev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a017, 24 and 82). As the Court put it, the applicant\u2019s claim did not fail because of a lack or non-substantiation of justiciable damage but because of the provisions of the applicable legislation, as interpreted and applied by the domestic courts (ibid., \u00a7\u00a085). The Court considered this approach adopted by the Russian courts unacceptable because it allowed a large number of well-founded cases where the unsatisfactory conditions of detention resulted from a lack of funds or a limited capacity of detention facilities, to remain unresolved at the domestic level (see Artyomov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0112; also compare Orchowski v.\u00a0, no.\u00a017885/04, \u00a7\u00a0108, ECHR 2009... (extracts), where the Polish courts had considered that the policy of reducing the space for each individual in overcrowded establishments was in accordance with domestic law).",

In the Shilbergs case, the Court was furthermore concerned with the reasoning of the Russian courts, which had assessed the amount of compensation by reference in particular to the \u201cdegree of responsibility of the management and its lack of financial resources\u201d. The Court accepted that, applying the compensatory principle, national courts might make an award taking into account the motives and conduct of the defendant and making due allowance for the circumstances in which the wrong was committed. However, it reiterated its finding made in a number of cases that financial or logistical difficulties, as well as the lack of a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, could not be relied upon by the domestic authorities as circumstances relieving them of their obligation to organise the State\u2019s penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7\u00a063, 1 June 2006). The Court found it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter\u2019s lack of funds. It considered that in circumstances such as those under consideration the scarcity of means available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and were thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion. Furthermore, the Court emphasised that the domestic courts, as the custodians of individual rights and freedoms, should have felt it their duty to mark their disapproval of the State\u2019s wrongful conduct to the extent of awarding an adequate and sufficient quantum of damages to the applicant, taking into account the fundamental importance of the right of which they had found a breach, even if they considered that breach to have been an inadvertent rather than an intended consequence of the State\u2019s conduct. As a corollary this would have conveyed the message that the State could not set individual rights and freedoms at nought or circumvent them with impunity (see Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071-79).",

In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, among others, Nachova and Others v.\u00a0 [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR 2005VII; Ila\u015fcu and Others v.\u00a0Moldova and  [GC], no.\u00a048787/99, \u00a7\u00a026, ECHR 2004VII; and Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0168).",

Nevertheless, an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention mentioning the specific elements, such as for instance the dates of his or her transfer between facilities, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds.

In this connection the Court noted that the destruction of the relevant documents did not absolve the Government from the obligation to support their factual submissions with appropriate evidence. Moreover, it often found that the Russian authorities did not appear to have acted with due care and diligence in handling the prison records because some of them had actually been destroyed after the Government had been put on notice that the Court was dealing with the case (see Shcherbakov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a023939/02, \u00a7\u00a078, 17\u00a0June 2010; Gultyayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0154; and Novinskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a011982/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102-103, 10 February 2009).

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant\u2019s position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court\u2019s findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v.

Indeed, the Court\u2019s task, as defined by Article 19, that is to \u201censure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto\u201d, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in a large series of cases (see, mutatis mutandis, E.G. v. Poland (dec.), no. 50425/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23\u00a0September 2008).

Poland (dec.), no. 50003/99, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 2007 ... (extracts)).

It appears, therefore, that the violations were neither prompted by an isolated incident, nor attributable to a particular turn of events in those cases, but originated in a widespread problem resulting from a malfunctioning of the Russian penitentiary system and insufficient legal and administrative safeguards against the proscribed kind of treatment. This problem has affected, and has remained capable of affecting, a large number of individuals who have been detained in remand centres throughout  (compare Broniowski, \u00a7\u00a0189, and Hutten-Czapska, \u00a7\u00a0229, both cited above).",

In its Resolution 1277 (2002) on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation, the Parliamentary Assembly noted a sharp decrease in the numbers of detainees in custodial institutions but deplored detention conditions, in particular prison overcrowding, poor health care and insufficient financing. It called on Russian authorities to improve the conditions in pre-trial detention centres and ensure respect for the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to implement the recommendations made by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (point 8 (ix)). A more recent report by the Monitoring Committee on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation (Doc. 10568, 3 June 2005) noted that, as a result of mass amnesties, the use of alternative sentencing and reduction of penalties in the Criminal Code, as well as the transfer of competence for the ordering and extending of pre-trial detention from prosecutors to courts, and the construction of new remand centres, the average overcrowding in pre-trial detention had been reduced to only one per cent above the facilities\u2019 normal capacity. Nevertheless, a detailed region-by-region analysis showed that pre-trial detention centres remained overcrowded at different levels in thirty-four regions: in fifteen of them the overcrowding is less than 20%, in sixteen between 20 and 50%. In three regions \u2013 the Tuva Republic, the Chita and Kostroma regions \u2013 the pre-trial detention facilities remained more severely overcrowded (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a0204-210 of the report).",

The resolution recalled that the existence of structural problems and the pressing need for comprehensive general measures had been stressed by the Committee of Ministers and acknowledged by the Russian authorities, and reiterated the need for an integrated approach to finding solutions to the problem of overcrowding in remand prisons, including in particular changes to the legal framework, practices and attitudes.",

The Programme expressly referred to Russia\u2019s accession commitments and the standards for pre-trial detention set by the Court and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and declared as its objective the alignment of the conditions of detention with the Russian legal norms and further transition to international standards. Taking stock of the situation in the penitentiary system, it noted that only forty Russian regions possessed facilities capable of providing accommodation to detainees in accordance with the domestic sanitary norm of four square metres per inmate, whereas pre-trial detention centres in eighteen regions could offer less than three square metres per inmate. The Programme\u2019s annual targets were to bring sixty per cent of remand centres into compliance with the Russian sanitary norm by 2011 and all of them by 2016. However, less than one per cent of remand centres were expected to be compatible with the international standard of seven square metres per inmate by 2011 and only 11.4 per cent by 2016.",

It is a reason for grave concern for the Court that the violations identified in the present judgment occurred more than five years after the Kalashnikov judgment in which the problem of overcrowding had been identified for the first time, notwithstanding the respondent Government\u2019s obligation under Article 46 to adopt, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, the necessary remedial and preventive measures, both at individual and general levels (compare Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0134).",

It was followed by a still more ambitious programme, approved by a Government decision of 5 September 2006 for a period from 2007 to 2016, which provides in particular for the construction of more than twenty new remand centres providing remand prisoners with seven square metres of personal space.

Indeed, in the years 2007 to 2010 the Russian courts have ordered placement in custody in more than ninety per cent of cases in which this measure was sought by the investigative authorities, and approved applications for a further extension order in approximately ninety-eight per cent of cases. In practical terms, this meant that the prosecutor\u2019s request for a custodial measure was rejected only in respect of one in ten defendants and that only one out of fifty incarcerated defendants was set free before the opening day of the trial. In the second half of the year 2008, bail was used in 407 cases; in the first half of 2009, their number grew to 599 (see point II (4) of Appendix II to Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above), which still represented less than one per cent of the cases in which the suspect was remanded in custody. The statistics for the year 2010 did not show any visible change in the judicial practice and the percentage of rejected applications for detention or extension orders increased by less than 0.2 per cent, notwithstanding the fact that on 22 October 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation adopted a special ruling (see paragraph 52 above) by which it reminded the courts that detention on remand should only be ordered if other preventive measures could not be applied.",

It reiterates that Russian prosecutors should be formally encouraged to decrease the number of applications for detention orders, except in the most serious cases involving violent offences. However, the above judicial statistics, read together with the findings of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03 in the Court\u2019s recent judgments and the Committee of Ministers\u2019 assessment, demonstrate that the successful prevention of overcrowding of remand centres is contingent on further consistent and long-term measures for achieving full compliance with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03. In addition to the Committee of Ministers\u2019 conclusions in its Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 and Recommendation Rec(2006)13 on the use of remand in custody, the conditions in which it takes place and the provision of safeguards against abuse, the Court strongly doubts that the existing trend to use deprivation of liberty as the preventive measure of predilection can be reversed unless the relevant provisions of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure have been amended to reflect expressly the requirements flowing from Article 5 of the Convention. As the Court has consistently reiterated, the first among these requirements is that the presumption should in all cases be in favour of release and that remand in custody should be an exceptional measure rather than the norm. Until conviction, the defendant must be presumed innocent and may be remanded in custody only if it has been convincingly established by reference to specific facts and evidence collected by the prosecution that (i) there is reasonable suspicion that he or she committed an offence, and (ii) there is a substantial risk of his or her absconding, reoffending, obstructing the course of justice or threatening public order, and (iii) these risks cannot be satisfactorily allayed through the use of bail or any other preventive measure not related to deprivation of liberty (see points II (6)-(9) of Recommendation Rec(2006)13, and, among other authorities, Bykov v.

The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.), nos.\u00a046113/99 et al., \u00a7 69, ECHR 2010...; Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), nos. 27451/09 and 60650/09, \u00a7\u00a040, 23 September 2010). Less than full application of the guarantees of Article 13 in this context would unacceptably weaken the effective functioning, on the national and international level, of the scheme of human rights protection set up by the Convention (see Finger, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0121, and McFarlane v.\u00a0 [GC], no.\u00a031333/06, \u00a7\u00a0112, ECHR 2010..., with further references). The Contracting States have consistently emphasised the need for effective domestic remedies, not least in the context of repetitive cases, which become vital for guaranteeing the long-term effectiveness of the Convention and containing the Court\u2019s workload (see Recommendation Rec(2004)6 to member States on the improvement of domestic remedies, and the Declarations adopted by the High Contracting Parties at the Interlaken and Izmir conferences).",

The treatment of the complaint does not have to be public or call for the institution of any kind of oral proceedings, but there should be a legal obligation on the prosecutor to issue a decision on the complaint within a reasonably short time-limit.",

It is therefore impossible to ascertain whether a Chapter 25 judgment would be limited to a general statement that the established violation be removed or could also order specific measures that would be needed to combat overcrowding and other forms of ill-treatment, affecting not just the claimant but large segments of the prison population. Taking into account the pervasive and structural nature of the problem of overcrowding, consideration should be given to equipping the Russian courts with appropriate legal tools allowing them to consider the problem underlying an individual complaint and effectively deal with situations of massive and concurrent violations of prisoners\u2019 rights resulting from inadequate detention conditions in a given remand facility.",

Furthermore, Chapter 25 orders do not appear to be subject to mandatory enforcement by the court bailiffs. It follows that such a judicial order may remain without effect in practice. Admittedly, a State official who persistently sabotages enforcement of a judicial decision may be held criminally liable under Article 315 of the Criminal Code; however, the Court has not yet seen evidence of an established practice of instituting criminal proceedings against defaulting officials (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104).

The domestic law on compensation must reflect the existence of this presumption rather than, as it does now, make the award of compensation conditional on the claimant\u2019s ability to prove the fault of specific officials or bodies and the unlawfulness of their actions. As the Court has previously found, substandard material conditions are not necessarily due to failings of prison governors or other officials but may be the product of structural malfunctioning of the domestic framework of detention on remand, whereas overcrowding may result from deficiencies originating outside the penitentiary system, for instance in courts or prosecutorial offices. It is also recalled in this connection that, even in a situation where every aspect of the conditions of detention complies with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect may be such as to constitute inhuman treatment (see paragraph 115 above). It must therefore be made clear that neither a high crime rate, nor a lack of resources, nor other structural problems may be regarded as circumstances excluding or attenuating the domestic authorities\u2019 liability for non-pecuniary damage incurred through inhuman or degrading conditions of detention. As the Court repeatedly stressed, it is incumbent on the Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way that it ensures respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of any financial or logistical difficulties (see, among others, Yevgeniy Alekseyenko, \u00a7\u00a087, and Mamedova, \u00a7\u00a063, both cited above).",

An accelerated settlement of the individual cases at the domestic level is not only required because of the gravity of the applicants\u2019 allegations under Article 3, a provision of fundamental importance in the Convention system. The need for such a settlement is also dictated by the principle of subsidiarity: once the Court has clarified the obligations of the respondent State under the Convention, it is in principle for the latter to take the necessary remedial measures, so that the Court does not have to reiterate its finding of a violation in a long series of comparable cases.",

In the Court\u2019s view, such redress may notably be achieved through ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0145). It is recalled that the compatibility of the conditions of detention with the requirements of Article\u00a03 of the Convention will be assessed by reference to the criteria defined in this judgment (see paragraphs 143-158 above) and that the amounts of compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage will be determined in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law and the principles outlined in paragraph 172 above.",
