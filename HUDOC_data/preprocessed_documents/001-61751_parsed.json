In his view, the Government's statements are very generic and contain no facts or references to specific measures aimed at expediting the proceedings that have lasted so far for six years. The applicant contends that he objected to all expert examinations, save for one ordered on 5 April 2001. In any event he could not be blamed for a failure to appeal against the procedural orders because the responsibility for the compliance with procedural deadlines lies with the court and he has attempted in good faith to expedite the proceedings by lodging a civil action for compensation for delays. He only requested additional witnesses once, on 6 August 1998, which request resulted in an adjournment of the hearing for mere 18 days, and the Government's allegations about his failures to appear for a hearing are not supported by references to specific dates or by evidence, such as court summons.
