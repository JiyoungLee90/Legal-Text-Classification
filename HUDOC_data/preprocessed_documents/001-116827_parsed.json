It was not disputed that the undercover witness had been an agent employed in the DEA\u2019s  office. He had also been authorised by the Macedonian public prosecutor to be used in the operation against the applicant. The applicant had not contested, either in the domestic proceedings or in the proceedings before the Court, the need for protection of the identity of this witness. Even if his identity had been disclosed or he had been examined under the general rules for examination of witnesses it would not have added anything to the process of establishing the facts. In this connection, they submitted that the applicant\u2019s conviction had been based neither solely nor to a decisive extent on the evidence produced by this witness. The admissibility of that evidence had been confirmed by the domestic courts, which had ruled on the basis of the principle of free assessment of evidence (\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435). They had analysed the available evidence carefully and had provided sufficient reasons for having regarded the evidence produced by the undercover witness as credible. The trial judge had known the identity of that witness; she had established that the witness had been involved in the events recorded on the video material; she had followed his behaviour during examination and drawn conclusions about his reliability. That the applicant and his lawyers had not attended the oral examination of this witness had been in compliance with the applicable rules at the relevant time. Live streaming media, with the possibility for face and voice distortion, had become available later. The public prosecutor, although present at the oral examination, had not put any questions to this witness, as evident from the relevant court record. Furthermore, the witness had been warned about the legal consequences of false testimony.",

The Court\u2019s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair. In addition, all the evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence; as a general rule, Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III).",

The evidence given by the first undercover agent was subsequently withdrawn by the public prosecutor (see paragraph 34 above) and was not used in court.

Apart from the evidence set out in the indictment, the trial court further admitted in evidence the detailed list of incoming calls on the mobile phones confiscated from the accused (see paragraph 16 above) and the oral evidence produced by the available co-accused (see paragraph 18 above). The Court is accordingly satisfied, like the Supreme Court (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a049 above), that the evidence produced by the undercover witness examined at the trial was not the sole evidence. However, on the question of the decisive nature of this evidence, the Court observes that the trial court analysed it in detail and relied on it in order to establish the time, place and way in which the offence had been committed (see paragraph 36 above). In the absence of a soundtrack to accompany the video material, his testimony was the only evidence concerning the substance of the discussions during the critical meeting in the cafe bar in . This was confirmed in the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment (see paragraph 44 above). There was no other evidence corroborating the applicant\u2019s involvement in the crime. In this connection, it is noteworthy that the trial court relied on the evidence given by this witness in order to refute the evidence of the applicant\u2019s co-accused, who had denied that their relationships and meetings with the applicant had been drugs-related (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that this evidence was decisive for the applicant\u2019s conviction.",

That was in accordance with the then applicable rules, which, contrary to statutory provisions now in force (see paragraph 74 above), did not provide for such opportunity when no streaming media were used. Furthermore, the available material in the case-file does not suggest that any attempt was made in order to allow the defence to view the witness\u2019s examination via streaming media, despite the fact that section 270-a of the Act provided for such an opportunity. The applicant and his legal representatives could not therefore see and hear the witness giving evidence in court. Consequently, they were not able to observe his demeanour in order to make their own assessment of the veracity of the account being given by him (see, a contrario, Ellis and Simms, \u00a7 82). That the trial judge had herself ascertained that the witness had been involved in the events recorded on the video material and had stated her opinion of the witness\u2019s credibility (see paragraph 82 above) cannot be considered a proper substitute for the opportunity for the defence to question the witness in their presence and make their own judgment as to his demeanour and reliability (see Van Mechelen, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

The authorities\u2019 efforts to secure the attendance of the witness and to establish a communication link with him were to no avail (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above). Those efforts show that there were no legal obstacles to contrast the applicant\u2019s arguments with the evidence given by the witness by using less far-reaching measures than those applied during the witness\u2019s examination, which would have taken into account the legitimate interest of the police authorities in a drug trafficking case in preserving the anonymity of their agent so that they could protect him and also make use of him again in the future.",

Immediately after, the trial court gave an hour to all accused and their lawyers to read the transcript of the witness\u2019s statement, to consult and prepare questions. The parties submitted instead their arguments that the time allowed for that exercise had not been adequate. Furthermore, the court ordered, on the applicant\u2019s request, that the witness\u2019s statement was translated into Serbian, the language of which he had sufficient command. Those discussions, the translation of the witness\u2019s statement and the court\u2019s deliberations lasted until 3,10 pm., when the trial court fixed a one-hour time-limit for all accused to prepare questions to be put to the witness in writing. None of the accused submitted any question to the witness. Given the circumstances of the case, the Court does not consider that the one-hour time-limit set by the court was adequate, i.e. that it was such as to enable the applicant to familiarise himself properly with and to assess adequately the evidence produced by the witness and to develop a viable legal strategy for his defence (see, mutatis mutandis, Galstyan v. , no. 26986/03, \u00a7 87, 15 November 2007). In the Court\u2019s view, it placed the applicant in a position where he was effectively deprived of a real chance of challenging the reliability of the decisive evidence against him (see paragraph 88 above). That the witness had limited leave to remain in the respondent State and that any extension of the time for preparing written questions would prolong the proceedings (see paragraph 45 above) cannot justify the serious limitations of the applicant\u2019s defence rights. In this connection, the Court recalls that the right to the fair administration of justice holds so prominent a place in a democratic society that it cannot be sacrificed to expediency (see Kostovski, cited above, \u00a7 44).",

Turkey, 18\u00a0December 1996, \u00a7 51, Reports 1996-VI). The rationale for the exhaustion rule is to afford the national authorities, primarily the courts, the opportunity to prevent or put right the alleged violations of the Convention. This is an important aspect of the subsidiary nature of the Convention machinery (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999V, and Kud\u0142a v.

Obviously, the applicant\u2019s goal in bringing that claim is to obtain a judicial declaration affording him redress for the alleged breach of his property rights. Consequently, it is essentially the same as his complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 submitted before the Court. That the applicant used this remedy suggests that he considered this avenue of redress as offering reasonable prospects of success. The applicant\u2019s argument about the unforeseeability of the outcome of these proceedings in view of their length (see paragraph 99 above) is irrelevant for the effectiveness of this remedy. No other argument casting doubt on the effectiveness of this avenue of redress has been put forward. In view of the fact that it is in the interests of the applicant, and the efficacy of the Convention system, that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Varnava and Others v.  [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7 164, ECHR 2009), the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint under this head is premature and must be rejected under Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

France, no. 58148/00, \u00a7 64, ECHR\u00a02004IV). In the present case, the Court considers that certain costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings were undoubtedly expended with a view to limiting the effects of the violation found by the Court. However, in the absence of any supporting documents, the Court finds it difficult to assess which costs were incurred in order to seek prevention or redress before the national courts of the violation found. The same consideration applies to the applicant\u2019s claim for reimbursement of the costs incurred in the proceedings before it. It therefore rejects the applicant\u2019s claims under all heads (see\u00a0Parizov v. the , no.\u00a014258/03, \u00a7 72, 7 February 2008).",
