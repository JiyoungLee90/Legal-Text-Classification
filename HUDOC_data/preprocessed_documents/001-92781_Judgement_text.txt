The case originated in two applications (nos. 6924/06 and 8252/06) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Mr Volodymyr Ivanovych Shylkin and Mr Anatoliy Grygorovych Poberezhnyy (“the applicants”), on 28 January and 15 February 2006 respectively.
Mr Poberezhnyy was represented by Mr I. Melnyk, a lawyer practising in Kamyanets-Podilsky, Khmelnytsky region, .
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 10 January and 11 September 2007 the Court decided to communicate the applicants’ complaints under Article 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Pervomaysk, Mykolayiv region, .
On 19 May 2003, after several rounds of court proceedings, the Pervomaysk District Court of Mykolayiv Region ordered the Pervomaysk Town Centre of Municipal Companies (Комбінат комунальних підприємств міста Первомайська), a municipal entity owned by the local council, to pay the applicant the total amount of 7,498.94 Ukrainian hryvnyas (UAH) in damage caused to his apartment and other property.
This judgment was not appealed against and became final. On 23 November 2003 the State Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings. According to the Government, in the course of these proceedings the amount of UAH 1,500 had been transferred to the bank account indicated by the applicant. However, because the bank details provided by the applicant were inaccurate that sum was withdrawn. The applicant, in turn, denied that any sum had ever been paid into his bank account. He provided the relevant bank statement to support his claim.
On 19 May 2004 the local council decided to liquidate the debtor entity and the liquidation proceedings were initiated. In this respect, on 1 June 2004 the State Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings and transferred the writ of enforcement to the liquidation commission for further processing. The liquidation proceedings apparently are still pending.
The applicant complained to various State authorities about lengthy non-enforcement of the judgment in his favour but to no avail.
The judgment of 19 May 2003 remains unenforced.
The applicant was born in 1952 and currently resides in the village of Dovzhok, Khmelnytsky region, .
On 13 April 2000 the local city council decided to liquidate the applicant’s employer, the Kamyanets-Podilsky Maintenance Municipal Company (Кам’янець-Подільське ремонтно-виробниче комунальне підприємство) owned by this council, and liquidation proceedings were initiated. Subsequently the applicant resigned.
On 11 July 2001 the Kamyanets-Podilsky City Court awarded the applicant UAH 3,385.42 in salary arrears and other payments due to him by his former employer.
In so far as this judgment became final, on 15 October 2001 the State Bailiffs’ Service instituted proceedings to enforce it. In the course of these proceedings the total amount of UAH 2,195 was paid to the applicant.
On 17 August 2003 the State Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings and transferred the writ of enforcement to the liquidation commission for further processing. The liquidation proceedings are apparently still pending.
On 10 April 2003 the applicant requested the local Prosecutor’s Office to institute criminal proceedings against L. and M., the head of the liquidation commission of the debtor company and the bailiff respectively, for lengthy non-enforcement of the judgment given in his favour. Apparently the proceedings are still pending.
The applicant also complained to various State authorities but to no avail.
The judgment of 11 July 2001 remains unenforced.
