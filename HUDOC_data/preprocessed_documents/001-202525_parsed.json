In particular, a norm cannot be regarded as a \u201claw\u201d unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Experience shows, however, that it is impossible to attain absolute precision in the framing of laws, particularly in fields in which the situation changes according to the prevailing views of society. In particular, the consequences of a given action need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, while certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. The role of adjudication vested in the national courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as may remain; the Court\u2019s power to review compliance with domestic law is thus limited, as it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0108 to 110).",

However, the Court is not convinced that this judicial remedy was capable of removing the applicant\u2019s victim status in the circumstances. In particular, it observes that the President of Hungary had five days \u2013 that is to say, until 16 March 2013\u00a0\u2013 to assent to the Amendment of 11 March 2013 and that the area in front of the President\u2019s residence was closed down for the entirety of this period (see paragraphs 5 and 7 above). Given the instantaneous nature of a political demonstration \u2013 the impact of which may rapidly diminish or disappear with the passage of time from the triggering event \u2013 the judicial proceedings which resulted in a decision of 18\u00a0March 2013 (that is to say, entirely outside the relevant time frame), albeit expeditious, can hardly be regarded as effective in the circumstances. Indeed, the only option left to the applicant would have been to hold an unauthorised gathering, that is, without a presumption of legality, such a presumption constituting a vital aspect of the effective and unhindered exercise of freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. Inevitably, the state of affairs complained of resulted in a chilling effect on the freedom of assembly (see, a fortiori, B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a067-68, 3 May 2007). The Court further notes that the compensatory remedy pursued by the applicant was unsuccessful (see paragraph\u00a011 above).",
