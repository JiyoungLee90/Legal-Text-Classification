The case originated in an application (no. 45102/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Doğan Bilginoğlu (“the applicant”), on 20 September 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr Ü. Kılınç, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 15 May 2018 the Government were given notice of the complaints concerning the interference with the applicant’s property and the loss of value of the compensation awarded to him, as well as that concerning the domestic authorities’ compliance with their positive obligations. The remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Istanbul.
The applicant is the owner of a plot of land in the island of Bozcaada, which in whole was designated as a grade three nature conservation area.
In 1995 the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways (“the Directorate”) awarded a tender to Güven İnşaat Ltd. Company (“the Company”) and a certain F.G. for the improvement of the roads in Bozcaada. In line with the contact between those parties, the Company and F.G. were given permission to quarry stone from the Municipality’s mine. However, during the construction works, on an unspecified date in October 1995, a certain amount of stone was removed from the applicant’s property, which was located nearby.
After having learned that third parties had exploded dynamite on his land and quarried stone, the applicant lodged two actions before the civil courts and made a number of criminal complaints before the Bozcaada Public Prosecutor.
By a letter dated 26 July 1996 the District Governor informed the General Directorate for the Protection of Cultural and Natural Heritage that that on 1 November 1995 he had taken the necessary measures and put an end to the interference, which had taken place by mistake. In the meantime, upon a request of the District Governor, two officers issued a report, establishing that there was no activity on the applicant’s property.
On 15 March 1996 the applicant brought an action for compensation against the Directorate, the Company, and F.G. before the Bozcaada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction, claiming 1,000,000,000 former Turkish liras (TRL) in respect of pecuniary damage and a further TRL 1,000,000,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, together with interest calculated on the basis of the rediscount rate. He submitted that the defendants had repeatedly removed quantities of stone from his land, as a result of which the land had lost a substantial amount of its value and the vineyard house had been demolished. He requested that the domestic court determined the value of the stone taken from his land, as well as the loss in value of his land.
On 25 October 1996 the applicant lodged another action with the Bozcaada Civil Court, seeking TRL 20,000,000,000 in compensation. The two cases were joined.
On 27 March 1997 the Bozcaada Civil Court dismissed the applicant’s claim against the Company and F.G and partially allowed his claim against the Directorate. The court awarded the applicant TRL 166,448,525 in respect of pecuniary damage, corresponding to the value of the stone taken from his land.
On 3 March 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court, holding that the Company should have been held liable as well. It also held that the lower court should have obtained an expert report in order to determine the quality of the stone and to assess the loss in the value of the land.
On 28 March 2001, after having examined expert reports determining the quality and value of the stone quarried from the land, the Bozcaada Civil Court partially allowed the claim against the Directorate and awarded the applicant TRL 410,955,000 in respect of pecuniary damage. The court dismissed the claim regarding the loss in value of the land.
On 20 November 2001 the Court of Cassation once again quashed the first-instance court’s judgment, finding that the land had indeed lost part of its value and that the first-instance court should obtain an expert report to determine the extent of that loss.
On 19 April 2006 the Bozcaada Civil Court awarded the applicant 6,028 Turkish liras (TRY) plus statutory interest with effect from the date of introduction of the case, in respect of pecuniary damage for the value of the stone, the vineyard house, and the loss in value of the land.
By a decision of 7 November 2006 the Court of Cassation upheld that judgment with an amendment and awarded the applicant compensation plus statutory interest from the date of the first interference with his possession, which it determined as 29 November 1995. The appellate court rejected the applicant’s subsequent request for rectification on 2 April 2007.
On 16 April 2009 the applicant was paid TRY 35,191 in compensation. On 4 May and 2 December 2009, he was paid an additional TRY 1,408 and TRY 1,477, respectively.
On 24 May 1996 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against persons unknown, who had allegedly quarried stone from his land. On 5 July 1996 the Bozcaada Public Prosecutor filed an indictment with the Bozcaada Magistrates’ Court, charging five people with theft. On 20 March 2001 the Bozcaada Magistrates’ Court decided that the criminal proceedings should be suspended and subsequently discontinued on the condition that no further offence of the same or a more serious kind was committed by the offenders within a five-year period. By a decision of 30 April 2007 the Magistrates’ Court discontinued the proceedings.
On 15 April 1998, after having discovered traces of fresh activity on his land, the applicant lodged another criminal complaint. On 15 June 1998 Bozcaada Public Prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute, as those responsible of the traces could not be determined.
On 19 March 2003 the applicant realised once again that stone had been removed from his land and lodged another criminal complaint. On 18 April 2003 the Public Prosecutor filed an indictment and charged two people with theft. On 4 November 2004 the Bozcaada Magistrates’ Court acquitted the accused, holding that the elements of the crime had not been established. That judgment became final on 11 November 2008.
Lastly, on 4 July 2003 the applicant lodged another complaint, this time after observing that his land had been littered with garbage. On 1 June 2004 the Bozcaada Public Prosecutor issued an indictment and charged three people with breaching Law no. 2863 on the Protection of Cultural and Natural Heritage. On 21 July 2005 the Ҫanakkale Assize Court acquitted two of the accused. By a judgment of 26 January 2010, which became final on 1 April 2010, the Assize Court sentenced the other accused to ten months’ imprisonment and decided to suspend the pronouncement of the judgment.
