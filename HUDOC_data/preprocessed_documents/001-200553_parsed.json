In particular, the court decision of 5\u00a0August 2008 had provided that it would take effect on the day of its pronouncement and, thus, the applicant should have been immediately released.

The applicant considered that Russian law contained a lacuna in that court decisions on early conditional release were not explicitly mentioned among those court decisions which could be enforced immediately in the part concerning the release of the person concerned.

It is sufficient to note that the District Court, by phrasing the operative part of the early release decision of 5\u00a0August 2008 the way it did and by affirming the same in its reply to the prison governor\u2019s request for clarifications, clearly demonstrated that the immediate enforcement of the decision of 5\u00a0August 2008 in the part requiring immediate early release of the applicant was a deliberate judicial choice and not a technical or other error. Even though the prosecutor\u2019s office may have disagreed with that decision, it did not raise that matter in its statement of appeal. Nor did the court of appeal rule on that issue. Thus, in the present case a national court provided its interpretation of the relevant domestic law and that interpretation was not overturned by a higher court. However, the prison governor refused to comply with a judicial decision requiring the applicant\u2019s immediate release which was valid (see, mutatis mutandis, Svetoslav Dimitrov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a055861/00, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58, 7\u00a0February 2008).",
