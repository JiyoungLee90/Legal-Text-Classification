The case originated in an application (no. 34129/03) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Microintelect OOD, a Bulgarian limited liability company with a registered office in Sofia (“the applicant company”) and two other applicants, on 20 October 2003.
The applicant was represented by Ms V. Krumova-Kyuchukova, a lawyer practising in Sofia. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant company complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of the unjustified forfeiture of alcohol belonging to it in administrativepenal proceedings against its business partners and under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention of its inability to intervene in those proceedings.
On 26 May 2009 the Court (Fifth Section) decided to give the Government notice of the applicant company’s complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The company’s remaining complaints, as well as the complaints of the other applicants, were rejected as inadmissible.
Following the re-composition of the Court’s sections on 1 February 2011, the application was transferred to the Fourth Section.
On 31 July 2000 the applicant company entered into a contract with a sole trader, Ms T.Z., to jointly operate a billiards club. The contract stipulated, in particular, that the sole trader would operate the club against an undertaking on the part of the applicant company to supply the club with alcohol. The contract also made provision for the manner in which profits would be shared between the parties, and set out penalties in case of breach.
On 7 August 2000 the applicant company obtained a licence to sell alcoholic beverages in the billiards club.
On 18 January 2001 the applicant company entered into a similar contract with another sole trader, Ms V.G., for the joint operation of an electronic games club. At that time the applicant company had already obtained a licence to sell alcoholic beverages in that club.
Both the billiards club and the electronic games club were operated in premises leased by the applicant company.
On 3 July 2002 the tax authorities carried out an inspection at the billiards club. They found that the sole trader, Ms T.Z., was selling alcohol without the requisite licence. The next day, 4 July 2002, the authorities drew up a report accusing her of trading in excise goods without the requisite licence, contrary to section 17a(2) of the Excise Act 1994 (see paragraph 23 below), and impounded the alcohol (eighteen bottles) that they had found in the club. The applicant company was not notified of those events.
On 8 July 2002 Ms T.Z. objected to the report, saying she had been selling the alcohol on behalf of the applicant company, which had a licence to do so. She further claimed that the impounding had been unlawful.
On 16 July 2002 the regional tax director dismissed the objection, observing that the impounding could not be challenged separately as it had been ancillary to the opening of administrative-penal proceedings and had amounted to a measure intended to prevent tampering with evidence. On an appeal by Ms T.Z., on 25 October 2002 the Dobrich District Court upheld that decision, finding that the impounding could not be challenged in separate judicial review proceedings; only the penal order which would conclude the administrativepenal proceedings was capable of being challenged by way of judicial review.
In the meantime, on 17 July 2002 the regional tax director issued a penal order against Ms T.Z. The penalties imposed thereby were a fine and forfeiture of the impounded alcohol. The applicant company was not served with a copy of the order.
Ms T.Z. sought judicial review of the order. On 29 January 2003 the applicant company applied to intervene in the proceedings as a third party, arguing that it was the owner of the forfeited alcohol. The next day, 30 January 2003, the Dobrich District Court discontinued the judicial review proceedings, finding that Ms T.Z.’s application was out of time.
A subsequent appeal by the applicant company against the discontinuance was rejected by the Dobrich District Court on 17 February 2003 on the grounds that, not being a party to the proceedings, the company did not have standing to appeal against their discontinuance. On an appeal by the applicant company, in a final decision of 22 April 2003 the Dobrich Regional Court upheld that decision, holding that the company did not have standing to intervene in the proceedings. The court found it irrelevant to now discuss whether or not the company could have claimed to be a victim of the administrative offence. Ensuing attempts by the company to obtain reopening of the proceedings were unsuccessful.
On 3 July 2002 the tax authorities carried out an inspection at the electronic games club jointly operated by the applicant company and Ms V.G. They found that Ms V.G. was selling alcohol without the requisite licence. The next day, 4 July 2002, they drew up a report accusing her of trading in excise goods without the requisite licence, contrary to section 17a(2) of the Excise Act 1994 (see paragraph 23 below). They impounded the alcohol (fortysix bottles) that they had found in the club. The applicant company was not notified of those events.
Ms V.G. sought judicial review of the impounding, arguing that she had been selling the alcohol on behalf of the applicant company, which had a licence to do so. On 23 October 2002 the Dobrich District Court rejected her application as inadmissible, holding that the impounding could not be challenged in separate judicial review proceedings; only the penal order which would conclude the administrativepenal proceedings was capable of being challenged by way of judicial review.
In the meantime, on 19 August 2002 the regional tax director issued a penal order against Ms V.G. The penalties imposed thereby were a fine and forfeiture of the impounded alcohol. The applicant company was not served with a copy of the order.
The sole trader sought judicial review of the order.
At a hearing held on 4 November 2003 the applicant company applied to intervene in the proceedings as a third party, arguing that it was the owner of the forfeited alcohol. However, the Dobrich District Court turned its application down, finding that it had not been party to the administrative-penal proceedings. It held that the business relations between the applicant company and Ms V.G. were irrelevant for the proceedings. It also instructed the applicant company to bring separate proceedings in the civil courts.
On 10 February 2004 the Dobrich District Court upheld the penal order. It found that the alcohol had been properly forfeited. It reiterated that considerations concerning the business relations between Ms V.G. and the applicant company were irrelevant for the administrativepenal proceedings. The Dobrich Regional Court upheld that judgment in a final judgment of 7 June 2004.
At the relevant time, a mayor of a municipality, acting at the request of a sole trader or a company, was empowered to issue a licence for selling alcohol (section 40 of the Wine and Spirits Act 1999 and sections 27-28 of the regulations issued in 2000 under section 40(6) of that Act). The licensing regime for the sale of alcohol was later lifted.
Section 17a(2) of the Excise Act 1994, as in force at the relevant time, made it an administrative offence punishable with a fine for a company or a sole trader to, inter alia, sell excise goods without licence. For the procedure to be followed with a view to punishing an administrative offence, the Excise Act 1994 referred to the Administrative Offences and Punishments Act 1969 (“the 1969 Act”).
When punishing an administrative offence, the authorities must, if the relevant statute so provides, also seek to have forfeited, inter alia, the goods which are the subject of the offence and which belong to the offender or which have been used to commit the offence (section 20(1) and (3) of the 1969 Act). At the relevant time section 17a(11) of the Excise Act 1994 (superseded by section 124(1) of the Excise and Tax Warehouses Act 2005), read in conjunction with section 17a(2) of the same Act, provided that excise goods sold by a company or a sole trader without a licence were subject to forfeiture. It did not specify whether that was the case if the goods belonged to the offender alone.
The 1969 Act does not make provision for third parties who claim to be the owners of forfeited goods to take part in the proceedings against an offender, and the courts have turned down requests for intervention on that basis (опр. № 338 от 10 август 2004 г. по н. а. х. д. № 222/2004 г., РС – Петрич, потв. с опр. № 8 от 25 май 2005 г. по д. № 1247/2004 г., ОС – Благоевград).
When drawing up a report accusing an individual or a legal person of an administrative offence, the relevant authority must indicate the names and the addresses of the persons, if any, who have suffered damage as a result of the offence (section 42(9) of the 1969 Act). Before issuing a penal order in respect of the offence, the relevant authority must give notice of the proceedings to the persons, if any, who have suffered damage as a result of the offence (section 52(3)). Those persons can then ask the authority to award them compensation, provided the claim does not exceed two Bulgarian levs, unless another statute makes provision for a higher amount (section 45(1)). As a rule, compensation must be awarded simultaneously with the issuing of the penal order (section 55(1)). However, if the authority encounters difficulties in resolving the issue of compensation, it can discontinue that part of the proceedings and direct those concerned to bring their claims by way of civil actions (section 56).
Section 1 of the State Responsibility for Damage Caused to Citizens Act 1988 (renamed in July 2006 the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act – “the 1988 Act”), as originally enacted and in force until the end of 2005, provided that the State was liable for damage suffered by individuals (граждани) as a result of unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by civil servants, committed in the course of or in connection with the performance of their duties. The Supreme Court of Cassation’s caselaw (реш. № 2139 от 12 декември 1997 г. по гр. д. № 1649/1996 г., ВКС; реш. № 1807 от 14 януари 2002 г. по гр. д. № 97/2001 г., ВКС; реш. № 1307 от 21 октомври 2003 г. по гр. д. № 2136/2002 г., ВКС, V г. о.), fully confirmed in a binding interpretative decision of that court of 22 April 2005 (тълк. реш. № 3 от 22 април 2005 г. по т. гр. д. № 3/ 2004 г., ОСГК на ВКС), was that solely individuals, not legal persons, could claim compensation under that provision. On 21 December 2005 Parliament decided to amend section 1(1) by adding “legal persons” to the category of those entitled to bring a claim. The amendment came into force on 1 January 2006. In their ensuing case-law the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court have held that it conferred on legal persons a substantive right to claim damages, and has no retroactive effect (опр. № 9134 от 3 октомври 2007 г. по адм. д. № 8175/2007 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; опр. № 1046 от 6 август 2009 г. по гр. д. № 635/2009 г., ВКС, ІІІ г. о.; опр. № 1047 от 7 август 2009 г. по гр. д. № 738/2009 г., ВКС, III г. о.; реш. № 335 от 31 май 2010 г. по гр. д. № 840/2009 г., ВКС, III г. о.; реш. № 329 от 4 юни 2010 г. по гр. д. № 883/2009 г., ВКС, IV г. о.).
