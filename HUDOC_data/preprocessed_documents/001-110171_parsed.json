The thrust of the article was that the sanitary situation in the municipality was a matter of concern and posed significant public health risks; extensive investments were necessary to improve it; there was a serious shortage of available funds; the municipal authorities were dealing with the problems in a slow and incompetent manner; it was more important for them to save money than to prevent serious health risks and to avert a danger to the population; the quality of water was unsatisfactory; and the mayor, despite the fact that he had been in office for two terms, had failed to deal with the problems properly.",

It was not related to the facts and it was not couched in objective terms, as stipulated by that provision. In fact, its first part, in particular, was very critical of the applicant and contained innuendos about his character, motives and about the newspaper and its journalists. This alone made it impossible to regard the letter as a request for rectification. Furthermore, the style of the letter lacked the objectivity which could be expected of a rectification. It could therefore not be reasonably seen as such. It resembled rather a \u201creply\u201d, within the meaning of the same provision of the Press Act, expressing the value judgments and views of its author vis-\u00e0-vis the impugned article. Even assuming that the letter could be seen as a rectification, it did not comply with the relevant requirements laid down by section 33 of the Press Act as it was more than twice the length of the contested article.",

It noted that he was clearly obliged to do so under the provisions of the Press Act. He was aware of his obligation as he had previously published rectifications in the newspaper. No objective grounds existed which could be said to have legitimately prevented the applicant from complying with that obligation and, in any event, he had not invoked any such grounds.

Assuming that the accused took into consideration the significance of his article, he should have, as a diligent journalist and editor-in-chief, either published the rectification demanded by the municipality, which directly concerned the questions raised in the article and outlined the steps which the municipality had already taken, or informed the municipality of the grounds for his refusal to publish a rectification.\u201d",

Indeed, the Court has already held that the right of reply, as an important element of freedom of expression, falls within the scope of Article\u00a010 of the Convention.

Likewise, an obligation to inform the party concerned in writing about the reasons for a refusal to publish a reply or rectification is not, in the Court\u2019s opinion, of itself open to criticism. Such an obligation makes it possible, for example, for the person who feels aggrieved by a press article to present his reply in a manner compatible with the editorial practice of the newspaper concerned.",

The judgment was upheld by the  on 27\u00a0March 2007. This sentence, not least the suspension of the applicant\u2019s right to exercise his profession as a journalist, has not been justified.

It is therefore reasonable to consider that the letter dated 17 October 2005 was sent to the applicant\u2019s newspaper on behalf of the , and not by the mayor himself in his personal capacity. This understanding is not altered by the fact that the mayor obviously was, given the polemical content of the letter, somewhat irritated by the newspaper article and, rightly or wrongly, took personally the criticism made in it. I consider that the right to reply and the duty to publish the reply under Article 10 of the Convention must first and foremost be assessed in light of the fact that the municipality is a public authority, not in the light of the personal right of the mayor to defend his allegedly damaged reputation. In my view, this is a very important consideration in the context of the present case when viewing the compatibility of the right to reply and the duty to publish such a reply against the background of the right to freedom of expression under Article\u00a010 of the Convention.",

By using this approach the majority implies that the municipality\u2019s right to reply and the applicant\u2019s duty to publish it has some basis in Article 10 of the Convention. I disagree. Clearly a public authority, like the , cannot invoke rights under Article\u00a010 of the Convention to impose on private parties a duty to publish a reply to criticism of its activities. It follows that recourse to national law for this purpose is contrary to Article\u00a010 of the Convention and is another ground for finding a violation in the present case.",
