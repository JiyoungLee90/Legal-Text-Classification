Austria (no. 5263/03, 26.5.2005, \u00a7 32) - which also concerned criminal proceedings under Article 209 of the Criminal Code \u2013 it found that even if Mr Wolfmeyer had eventually been acquitted of the charges under Article 209 of the Criminal Code, he could still claim to be the victim of an alleged breach of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention. What mattered was not a conviction under Article 209 of the Criminal Code but the mere fact that criminal proceedings under this provision had been instituted at all. Thus, for the purpose of the present application it is irrelevant whether or not the criminal proceedings against the applicant respected the guarantees of Article\u00a06 of the Convention because, in any event, the Court has found above that such proceedings should not have been instituted in the first place.
