The fact that the domestic judicial authorities provided a forum for the determination of a private-law dispute between the two claimants, in which the applicant was unsuccessful, does not necessarily give rise to an interference by the State with property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Even assuming that the applicant\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d is \u201csufficiently established to be enforceable\u201d to attract the guarantees of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, among many authorities, Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v.
