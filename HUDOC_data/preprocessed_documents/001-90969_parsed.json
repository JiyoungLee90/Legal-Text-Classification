It appears from these documents that the applicant owned five twelfths of the property described above under paragraph 9 (a) and half of the property described above under paragraph\u00a09\u00a0(b). However, in his observations of September 1999, the applicant\u2019s lawyer alleged that his client had had full ownership of the whole of the two plots. He submitted that from 1921 onwards only the applicant, his wife and his two children had been living in the house built on plot no. 20. This house had been the marital home from the time of his wedding and the applicant had had the absolute and unrestricted use and occupation of it. Moreover, from August 1928 the applicant had been cultivating and taking care of the whole of plot no. 442. He had been a farmer who earned his income from the production of the olive trees. In support of these statements, the applicant\u2019s lawyer produced a certificate issued by the Trypimeni village committee on 25\u00a0September 1999. The reason why the applicant had not been registered as the owner of the whole share of the two plots was that the applicant\u2019s mother, Mrs Maria Yianni, had been the owner of two twelfths of plot no.\u00a020. She had given one twelfth of the plot to the applicant and one twelfth to his brother, Mr Elias Kyriakou, in the form of an unregistered gift. The applicant\u2019s brother had also been the owner of the remaining five twelfths of plot no. 20 and of the remaining half of plot no. 442. In 1956 Mr\u00a0Elias Kyriakou, who had emigrated to Australia and had no intention of coming back to , had given all his shares to the applicant. However, no official transfer of ownership had been entered in the land register. In support of his version of the facts, the applicant\u2019s lawyer produced an affidavit from the applicant\u2019s son, Mr Andreas Ioannou.",

It observes, in particular, that the parties have failed to provide reliable and objective data pertaining to the prices of land and real estate in  at the date of the Turkish intervention. This failure renders it difficult for the Court to assess whether the estimate furnished by the applicant\u2019s heirs of the 1974 market value of their properties is reasonable. The question must accordingly be reserved and the subsequent procedure fixed with due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent Government and the applicant\u2019s heirs (Rule\u00a075\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Rules of Court).",
