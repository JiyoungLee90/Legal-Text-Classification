In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively, or ordered retrospectively under Article 66b \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned, owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct, were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1 \u00a7 1 of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act. As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of \u201cpersons of unsound mind\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention made in this Court\u2019s case-law (see \u00a7\u00a7 138 and 143-156 of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment). If the above pre-conditions were not met, those detainees had to be released no later than 31 December 2011. The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality; as a general rule, proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released.",

In line with the Court\u2019s findings in the case of M. v.\u00a0Germany (cited above, \u00a7 129), it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi-disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution did not have prospects of success (see \u00a7 113 of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment).",

The Federal Constitutional Court noted that the European Court of Human Rights had considered preventive detention to be a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 102, 140). It considered that it was not necessary schematically to align the meaning of the constitutional notion of \u201cpenalty\u201d to that under the Convention.

The expert had found that the applicant was fixated on boys aged between six and sixteen. His dissocial personality manifested itself in continuous irresponsibility and disregard for social rules and obligations, his inability to maintain long-term relationships, his inability to feel guilty and to learn from experience, as well as his tendency to blame others and to superficially rationalise his own behaviour.",

Accordingly, on 7 March 2012 the Government had submitted to the Federal legislator a draft Act on establishment, at federal level, of a difference in the provisions on preventive detention compared to those on prison sentences (Gesetz zur bundesrechtlichen Umsetzung des Abstandsgebotes im Recht der Sicherungsverwahrung) which was being examined by Parliament at the time of their submissions to the Court. Likewise, the Land Rhineland-Palatinate (in which Diez Prison was situated) had drafted an act on the enforcement of preventive detention to implement the new federal legislation. The Federal Constitutional Court had thus paved the way so that in cases as the present one preventive detention was only executed if it was justified under sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01. The implementation of a difference between the execution of penalties and of preventive detention guaranteed that the institutions in which preventive detention was executed against persons suffering from a mental disorder were suitable institutions for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e).",

A transitional period was necessary in order for the respondent State to comply with its duty under Article 3 to protect the public from most dangerous offenders.

To that end, the legislator, at the relevant time, had started examining the Act on establishment, at federal level, of a difference in the provisions on preventive detention compared to those on prison sentences. Likewise, new provisions on the enforcement of preventive detention were being examined by the Parliaments of the L\u00e4nder. In addition, substantial construction works were started, inter alia on the premises of Diez Prison, in order to bring the accommodation for persons in preventive detention in line with the requirements set up by the Federal Constitutional Court. A multidisciplinary staff was to work in those structures where detainees were to be provided with individualised psychiatric, psychological and social therapeutic treatment.",

Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28; Jamil, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 142).

At that time, a preventive detention order made by a sentencing court for the first time, read in conjunction with Article 67d \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code in the version then in force (see paragraph 36 above), meant that the applicant could be kept in preventive detention for ten years at the most. Based on the subsequent amendment in 1998 of Article 67d of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 1a (3) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraph 37 above), which abolished that maximum duration with immediate effect, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences then ordered, in the proceedings here at issue, the applicant\u2019s continued preventive detention beyond the ten-year point.

It notes that the applicant\u2019s preventive detention was imposed by the Hanau Regional Court in December 1997 together with the applicant\u2019s conviction for criminal offences, namely eleven counts of sexual abuse of children. Article 66 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, under which the preventive detention order against the applicant was made, indeed allowed such an order to be made only against someone who has, amongst other requirements, been sentenced for (at least) three intentional offences to at least three years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 34 above).

Unlike preventive detention under the Criminal Code, therapy detention under the Therapy Detention Act is not a measure imposed following and together with the conviction for a criminal offence, despite the fact that it can be ordered only in respect of persons who committed certain serious offences and were previously kept in preventive detention. Therapy detention is not designed as a sanction for a criminal offence imposed by the criminal courts. It is a measure ordered by the civil courts, outside the criminal law context, and aimed at the medical and therapeutic treatment and reduction of the current dangerousness of persons suffering from a mental disorder, who previously manifested that they posed a high risk to the public by committing a serious criminal offence.",

In that context, the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s finding that a schematic alignment of the meaning of the constitutional notion of \u201cpenalty\u201d to that under the Convention was not mandatory if, in substance, the minimum standards set by the Convention were complied with (see paragraphs 45 and 47 above).

It is true that the persons concerned had a real prospect of being released if they participated in the treatment and measures considered necessary to reduce their dangerousness. Nevertheless, the applicant\u2019s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. It was subject to a court\u2019s finding that it was not highly likely that the applicant, owing to specific circumstances relating to his conduct, would commit the most serious offences or that he did not suffer from a mental disorder. The latter requirements set up by the Federal Constitutional Court were stricter than those at issue in the case of M. v. Germany (ibid.). Preventive detention, however, still remained among the most severe measures which may be imposed under the German Criminal Code.
