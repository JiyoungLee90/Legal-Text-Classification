The investigators limited themselves to sending requests for information to the military authorities, to no avail. Furthermore, being mindful of their procedural limitations as regards investigating crimes allegedly committed by military servicemen, the investigators took no steps to transfer the investigation to the military authorities, despite the misleading information to the contrary provided to the applicants (see paragraph 20 above). The Court further notes the criticism expressed by the supervising prosecutors and the domestic court and the persistent failure of the investigators to comply with their orders and remedy the shortcomings pointed out by them (see paragraphs 17, 23, 28 and 29 above). This shows that the authorities did not demonstrate the necessary diligence in collecting evidence of the crime. In view of the importance of such evidence in a case concerning the alleged killing, this aspect alone justifies the finding of a violation of a procedural breach of Article 2 of the Convention. In such circumstances, the Court does not find it necessary to examine whether the investigation was sufficiently independent.",
