Eight of them were set aside as insufficiently reasoned by a higher prosecutor or a court. Indeed, the analysis of the prosecutor\u2019s decisions reveals that the prosecutor accepted too readily the police officers\u2019 denial that force had been used against the applicant and decided not to open criminal proceedings, finding, in total disregard of the medical evidence and witness statements, that there was no proof of ill-treatment or, in later decisions, that there were no grounds to believe that the injuries had been inflicted by the police. The prosecutor did not cite any reasons why he considered that the medical evidence was inconclusive or the witnesses were unreliable. The Court finds it particularly striking that after the decisions of 19 October 2006 and 28 May 2007 had been set aside by a court precisely on the ground of a lack of reasoning, the prosecutor failed to abide by the court\u2019s instructions and remedy the flaws in its reasoning.

In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see V. v. the  [GC], no.\u00a024888/94, \u00a7\u00a071, ECHR 1999IX).",

The absence of long-term health consequences cannot exclude a finding that the treatment is serious enough to be considered inhuman or degrading (see Egmez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078 and 79). The applicant was hit at least several times in his face, shoulders, back and legs and was subjected to electric shocks, which is a particularly painful form of ill-treatment. Such treatment must have caused him severe mental and physical suffering, even though it did not apparently result in any long-term damage to his health. Moreover, it appears that the use of force was aimed at debasing the applicant, driving him into submission and making him confess to criminal offences.

The courts assumed that the gravity of the charge carried such a preponderant weight that no other circumstances could have obtained the applicant\u2019s release. The Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk that an accused might abscond or reoffend, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v.\u00a0France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 51; see also Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7 102, 8\u00a0February 2005; Goral v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a038654/97, \u00a7 68, 30 October 2003; and Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).",

The Court accepts that in cases concerning organised crime the risk that a detainee if released might put pressure on witnesses or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings is often particularly high. These factors can justify a relatively longer period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4\u00a0May 2006). Taking into account that the applicant was suspected of being an active member of an organised criminal group, the Court accepts that the authorities could justifiably consider that the risk of pressure on witnesses and jurors was initially present. However, the Court is not persuaded that that ground could in itself justify the entire five-year period of the applicant\u2019s detention. Indeed, the domestic courts referred to the risk of hampering the proceedings in a summary fashion without pointing to any aspect of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour in support of their conclusion that he was likely to resort to intimidation. In the Court\u2019s view, such a generally formulated risk may not serve as justification for the applicant\u2019s detention for a period of more than five years. The domestic courts failed to consider the fact that that ground inevitably became less and less relevant with the passage of time. The courts\u2019 reasoning did not evolve to reflect the developing situation or to verify whether at the advanced stage of the proceedings that ground retained its sufficiency. The Court is not therefore convinced that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for a fear that he would interfere with witnesses or jurors or otherwise hamper the examination of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

The Court accepts that it may be necessary to issue custody orders in respect of convicted prisoners, for example to make possible the person\u2019s transfer from the correctional colony where he is serving his sentence to a detention facility situated in the area where the investigation and trial are conducted. However, in the present case the domestic courts did not refer to such a necessity. Instead, they repeated the stereotyped formula without any assessment of whether, considering the applicant\u2019s detention in a correctional colony, the risk of fleeing from justice, reoffending or intimidating witnesses or jurors was real. The Court considers that the extension orders issued between 6 April 2004 and 28\u00a0January 2006 clearly attested to the domestic courts\u2019 perfunctory attitude to the applicant\u2019s detention, which was extended automatically without concrete relevant facts being addressed or the changing circumstances taken into account. Although it is true that the extension orders issued during that period did not affect the applicant\u2019s situation in practical terms, as he was in any event being held after conviction by a competent court, this fact is not decisive for the Court\u2019s assessment. The existence of a violation is conceivable even in the absence of prejudice or damage; the question whether an applicant has actually been placed in an unfavourable position or sustained damage becomes relevant only in the context of Article\u00a041 (see, among many authorities, Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others v.

It accepts that in cases concerning organised crime, involving numerous defendants, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task, as it is necessary to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-suspects (see, mutadis mutandis, \u0141aszkiewicz v. Poland, no.\u00a028481/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059 and 61, 15\u00a0January 2008). However, it has already found, in similar circumstances, that the complexity of the case, the number or the conduct of the defendants could not justify more than five years\u2019 detention pending investigation and trial (see Erdem v. Germany, no. 38321/97, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2001VII).",

There is no indication in the case file that the trial court availed itself of the measures existing under national law to discipline the defaulting witnesses and obtain their attendance, to ensure that the case be heard within a reasonable time (see Zementova v.

He has spent more than five years in custody pending trial, his detention not being based on sufficient grounds. The criminal proceedings against him have been excessively long. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation. However, the amounts claimed appear excessive. In particular, the Court observes that although the applicant has been held in detention pending trial for more than five years, during part of this period he was concurrently serving his sentence in an unrelated criminal case. The extension of his detention during that period did not prejudice his position or cause him any actual damage. The Court must take this fact into account when determining the amount of just satisfaction to be awarded. Making its assessment on an equitable basis and taking into account the gravity of the ill-treatment, the Court awards the applicant EUR\u00a030,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
