In addition, the prompt treatment recommended in case of suspicion of Hellp syndrome would have been the immediate evacuation of the pregnancy in order to avoid aggravation of the hepatic and vascular lesions. Furthermore, with careful monitoring of the mother and of the foetus as well as prompt treatment, the deaths might have been avoided. The fact that the patient reached the Cuza-Vod\u0103 Clinic in Ia\u015fi in a serious condition suggested inadequate monitoring. The absence of a diagnosis for three days aggravated the patient\u2019s condition. Given the doctor\u2019s aforementioned duties, he should have been aware of the evolution of a state of preeclampsia, and he was obliged to exhaust all the available remedies to avoid it and treat it. The extremely low level of thrombocytes in the patient\u2019s blood in Suceava was an important aid to a suspicion of this type of complication and an indication that prompt intervention was necessary.",

In particular, it noted amongst other things that while she was in hospital the applicant\u2019s daughter stated that she had eaten forest mushrooms. At the time there was another patient in the hospital suffering from mushroom poisoning. This caused her medical condition to be blamed on the mushrooms, which delayed the Hellp syndrome diagnosis. It also noted that during the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation on the intensive therapy unit the applicant\u2019s daughter condition worsened. Dr D.D. was contacted by phone and he suggested that the pregnancy should be evacuated. Given the patient\u2019s serious condition and the local intensive therapy possibilities (posibilit\u0103\u021bile locale de terapie intensiv\u0103), in order to solve the case, Dr D.D. was contacted and he accepted that the patient be transferred to Ia\u015fi. It further noted that according to the post-mortem report the patient had displayed symptoms of hepatic-nephritis and generalised haemorrhagic vasculopathy and subsequent cardio-respiratory insufficiency. It concluded that the actions of the Suceava Hospital\u2019s staff could be explained from a medical standpoint, in the context of the patient\u2019s anamnesis and given that according to the information available and on the basis of the patient\u2019s symptoms they could have also concluded that the patient\u2019s condition had been caused by mushroom poisoning, and not by Hellp syndrome as turned out to be the case.

In addition, the question of whether the applicant\u2019s daughter had eaten forest mushrooms had not been entirely clarified. Dr I.M.\u2019s statement that the applicant\u2019s daughter had eaten the aforementioned mushrooms had not been confirmed or rebutted by any other evidence. The information concerning the consumption of mushrooms found in the clinical observation chart was also added there by Dr I.M. Furthermore, the reasons why the applicant\u2019s daughter was not accompanied by a doctor during her transfer by ambulance remained unclear. Consequently, the court ordered a forensic expert report to be produced which would establish whether: (a) the doctor had been diligent enough to correctly establish the diagnosis; (b) the actual diagnosis had been established on the basis of the symptoms and the investigations made in the case; (c) the correct diagnosis could have been established on the basis of supplementary tests and examinations which should have been performed; (d) the medical treatment had been appropriate; (e) the medical intervention should have been performed at the Suceava County Hospital; (f) the applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s health had deteriorated during her transfer to the clinic in Ia\u015fi because she was not assisted by a doctor throughout the transportation; (g) any of the aspects above, or others, had any causal link with the death of the applicant\u2019s daughter and her new born granddaughter. If the expert report established a causal link between the death and the fact that the transfer by ambulance had not been done with a doctor present, the reason why the patient had not been accompanied by a doctor and the identity of those responsible should be established. Consequently, the medical staff responsible for the transfer by ambulance should be heard. The court also ordered that the notes on the clinical observation chart should be checked for accuracy against the doctor\u2019s statements regarding the consumption of forest mushrooms, and accordingly the victim\u2019s mother and husband should be heard.",

The remedy in question would have been available to the applicant, particularly because it was exempted from judicial tax, and according to the Court\u2019s case-law was adequate, given the circumstances of the case. They also contended that according to the relevant domestic legal doctrine criminal law considered the fault (culpa) a form of guilt only where it met a high level of severity. However, tort liability could be engaged even for the slightest negligence (culpa cea mai u\u015foar\u0103). Therefore, the scope of application of tort liability is wider than that of criminal liability. Consequently, the findings of the domestic authorities excluded only Dr I.M.\u2019s criminal liability, and not his tort liability. They also submitted that, according to the relevant criminal procedure rules, since criminal proceedings against Dr I.M. had never been opened, separate general tort law proceedings would not have been suspended pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings.",

However, if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence, \u201cthe obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained.

Portugal, no.\u00a056080/13, 15 December 2015. In the present case too there is a noticeable trend to discreetly impose a duty to provide a specific level of healthcare service under Article 2 (1). Here too the Court disregards the findings of the domestic experts without proper reason and in disregard of the natural boundaries of its capacity to review issues of medical expertise on matters dealt with by the national forensic experts. The Court did not offer any reasons for departing from its own case-law as reaffirmed for a factually similar situation in Eugenia Laz\u0103r v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a032146/05, 16 February 2010, quoted in at least a dozen cases. Where a Contracting State has made adequate provision for securing high professional standards among healthcare professionals and the protection of the lives of patients, it cannot accept that matters such as an error of judgment on the part of a healthcare professional or negligent coordination among healthcare professionals in the treatment of a particular patient are sufficient of themselves to call a Contracting State to account from the standpoint of its positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention to protect life (see Stihi-Boos v. Romania (dec.), no. 7823/06, \u00a7\u00a054, 11\u00a0October 2011, and Florin Istr\u0103\u021boiu v. Romania, no. 56556/10, \u00a7 74, 27\u00a0January 2015).",
