Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols Nos. 1 and 4, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 \u00a7 2 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 95, ECHR\u00a01999V, and the Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, p. 3288, \u00a7\u00a093). The Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim's conduct (see the Chahal v. the United Kingdom judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports\u00a01996-V, p. 1855, \u00a7 79).",

However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

It is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how the injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (Selmouni v. France, cited above, \u00a7 87). It is not sufficient for the State to refer merely to the acquittal of the accused police officers in the course of a criminal prosecution, and consequently, the acquittal of officers on a charge of having assaulted an individual will not discharge the burden of proof on the State under Article 3 of the Convention to show that the injuries suffered by that individual whilst under police control were not caused by the police officers (Corsacov v. Moldova, no. 18944/02, \u00a7 55, 4\u00a0April 2006). The authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions (Mikheyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 77617/01, \u00a7 108, 26\u00a0January 2006).",

The Court considers that weight should also be given to the acknowledgement by the Chief of the Greek Police that Mr Georgantzis and Mr Giannopoulos had caused bodily harm to the applicant, as well as to the judgment of the first instance jurisdiction which was satisfied on the evidence produced before it that the applicant had been beaten by Mr Georgantzis (see paragraphs 12-13 and 15 above).",
