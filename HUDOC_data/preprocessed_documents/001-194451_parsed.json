The applicant had then suggested that a company owned by MP bank would buy the shares and X would finance the purchase. Later, this was changed and Y became the buyer. Secondly, the District Court observed that it had been common knowledge that there had been a shortage of liquid assets in the large Icelandic banks. However, the applicant and other witnesses had agreed that X\u2019s situation had been good in this regard, which was supported by documents in the case. The District Court concluded that this had to be taken into account when evaluating the applicant\u2019s decision to turn to X for a loan for the certificates. However, it noted that it was obvious that a creditor carried a certain lending risk. With X granting a loan instead of MP bank, that risk had moved to X. The Supreme Court, in its judgment of 7 June 2012, had concluded that this loan had been unlawful. The District Court then noted that the applicant had denied being aware of how matters had been carried out by X in relation to the granting of the loan to Y. Moreover, it found that his statement in this regard had been credible and supported by other witness statements. The District Court further stated that the applicant had admitted to his involvement in deciding the equity price of the certificates in order for MP bank to receive full payments for it loans. However, that had been normal in the light of his position as CEO of MP bank. He had not been in a position to decide how matters had been carried out by X in relation to the granting of the loan and had not had any part in processing the loan there. Therefore it had, according to the District Court\u2019s judgment, not been proved that the applicant should have known that the co-accused had granted the loan in an unlawful manner.",

With the said business transaction, which was largely financed by [X], the risk of loss because of the capital certificates, which had rested on MP bank, where [the applicant] was the chief executive officer, was transferred to [X]. By doing so the bank had all its claims on the owners of the certificates paid in full, and the owners, inter alios [A] and [B], which [C] had a large share in, were relieved of their obligations. Furthermore, the bank sold its own certificates at a price that did not, as previously stated, represent their real value at the time. Taking into account [the applicant\u2019s] knowledge, which has previously been described, his education and knowledge of bank operations and financial institutions, the court agrees with the prosecution that [the applicant] should have known that the loan granted by [X] to [Y] on 13 October 2008 had been unlawful and could cause [X] significant financial risk, as it later turned out, [X] lost all the money that it had lent to [Y]. Accordingly [the applicant], with the actions described in the indictment, is guilty of aiding and abetting [A] and [C\u2019s] fraud by abuse of position. As stated above, [since] it has to be considered that [the applicant] was not aware of how matters had been carried out by [X] in relation to the granting of the loan to [Y], the Supreme Court considers that it has only been proved that his intent in the aiding and abetting concerned a conduct which is punishable by up to two years\u2019 imprisonment according to Article 249 of the Penal Code.

The Supreme Court noted, however, that when acquitting the applicant the District Court had not made an assessment regarding the other violations committed by A and C, which the applicant was charged with aiding and abetting. Accordingly, nothing hindered the Supreme Court from assessing the evidence relating to these violations, be it documents or recordings of testimony which it had before it. Referring to Article 22 \u00a7 1 of the Penal Code, the Supreme Court pointed out that in order to establish intent for aiding and abetting, it was not a requirement that the person in question be fully aware of how the violation would occur. The applicant\u2019s knowledge of factors other than the way in which the loan was granted from X to Y could therefore lead to the conclusion that he must have been aware, in the light of the prelude to the granting of the loan and all other circumstances considered, that the granting of the loan was not in accordance with the law. Accordingly, the Government pointed out, insofar as the Supreme Court made its own assessment of the facts, it primarily built on documentary evidence or confined itself to witness testimony regarding undisputed facts, and the Supreme Court only deviated from the District Court\u2019s conclusions regarding questions of law, not from its assessment of the evidentiary value of statements.",

It is not the function of the Court to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a domestic court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. In the determination of whether the proceedings were fair the Court does not act as a court of fourth instance deciding on whether the evidence had been obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law, its admissibility or on the guilt of an applicant. These matters, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, are the province of the domestic courts. It is not appropriate for the Court to rule on whether the available evidence was sufficient for an applicant\u2019s conviction and thus to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts. The Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly and that in a given case they were compatible with the Convention, while also taking into account the specific circumstances, the nature and the complexity of the case (Murtazaliyeva v.

As to the latter, no reference was made to the right to hear witnesses under Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) of the Convention. The Government also centred their arguments on Article 6 \u00a7 1. The Court for its part sees no need to examine any part of the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) of its own motion, as the application does not concern the right to hear witnesses \u201cunder the same conditions\u201d as the prosecution, but rather the general right to a \u201cfair hearing\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1.

Norway, cited above, \u00a7 39, and Sigur\u00fe\u00f3r Arnarsson v. Iceland, cited above, \u00a7 30). It may also be that the accused unequivocally has waived his right to take part in the appeal hearing (see, inter alia, Kashlev v. Estonia, no.\u00a022574/08, \u00a7\u00a051, 26 April 2016). However, the Court has held that where an appellate court is called upon to examine a case as to the facts and the law and to make a full assessment of the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence it cannot, as a matter of fair trial, properly determine those issues without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused \u2013 who claims that he has not committed the act alleged to constitute a criminal offence (see Constantinescu v.

For example, in the case of Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, \u00a7 36, 10\u00a0March 2008, the Court considered that the appeal court had not simply given a different legal interpretation or another application of the law to facts already established at first instance, but had carried out a fresh evaluation of facts beyond purely legal considerations (see also Sp\u00eenu v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a032030/02, \u00a7\u00a7 55-59, 29 April 2008, Andreescu v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a019452/02, \u00a7\u00a7 65-70, 8\u00a0June 2010, Almenara Alvarez v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a016096/08, 25 October 2011).

Moreover, since the District Court had not in its conclusions made any assessment of the value of the testimony before it relating to such \u201cother factors\u201d there was, in the Supreme Court\u2019s view, nothing that hindered it from taking that evidence into account when deciding the case, as long as it regarded facts other than the way in which the granting of the loan was carried out on behalf of X. On this basis the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cit is beyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the applicant participated, to no lesser degree than A and C, \u201cin planning how matters should be carried out in granting the loan\u201d by X to Y, and that he also \u201cshould have known\u201d that the loan \u201chad been unlawful\u201d (see paragraph 41 above).",

Moreover, this broader legal approach led the Supreme Court to build its conviction of the applicant on a broader factual base than the District Court had done in its judgment. Thus, even if the Supreme Court\u2019s initial disagreement with the District Court was of a purely legal nature, the Supreme Court\u2019s application of the law inevitably also implied that the Supreme Court had to make a new and broader assessment of a factual nature. It emerges from the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment that it based this new assessment on the documents of the case, including transcripts of the applicant\u2019s and the witnesses\u2019 statements before the District Court beyond what transpired from the District Court\u2019s judgment (see paragraph\u00a041 above).",

As the Court has previously stressed, such procedures may be regarded as an important aspect of the execution of its judgments and their availability demonstrates a Contracting State\u2019s commitment to the Convention and to the Court\u2019s case-law (Moreira Ferreira v.
