Bearing in mind the special character of these proceedings, the court was of the view that at this stage the mere fact that the convicted person was granted legal aid was sufficient to ensure an effective exercise of his or her defence rights.

It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999.

It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer\u2019s refusal and not on the earlier date when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself. It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with the legalaid lawyer\u2019s refusal had a right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for an effective lodging of a cassation appeal (III KZ 87/01). The Supreme Court reiterated its position in a decision of 6 May 2008 and in a number of similar decisions given in 2008. It observed that there had been certain discrepancies in the judicial practice as to the manner in which the timelimit in such situations was calculated, but the strand of the case-law launched by the decision given in February 2002 was both dominant and correct, and also accepted by doctrine as providing to the defendants adequate procedural guarantees of access to the Supreme Court within a reasonable timeframe (II KZ 16/08).",

The Supreme Court has examined the manner in which the beginning of the relevant time-limit should be determined in such special circumstances. It held, in its decision of 26 February 2002, that following a legalaid lawyer\u2019s refusal to prepare a cassation appeal the event triggering the running of the relevant timelimit should be established in such a way as to accommodate the defendant\u2019s situation so as not to deprive him of a practical possibility of having his or her case examined by the Supreme Court. Hence, it held that the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was informed of the lawyer\u2019s refusal, not when the lawyer was served with the judgment of the second-instance court.",

It cannot therefore be said that the applicant was put in a position where he was left with so little time to have a cassation appeal in his case prepared that he was denied a realistic opportunity of having his case brought to and argued before the cassation court (compare and contrast with Sia\u0142kowska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011- 155, where the applicant had only three days left).

The Court is aware that under the case-law of the Supreme Court the mere refusal of a legalaid lawyer to prepare a cassation appeal did not constitute a sufficient ground for a new lawyer to be assigned to the case under the legalaid scheme (see paragraphs 19 \u2013 22 above). However, the Court is of the view that Article 6 of the Convention does not confer on the State an obligation to ensure assistance by successive legalaid lawyers for the purposes of pursuing legal remedies which have already been found not to offer reasonable prospects of success. In the present case the lawyer appointed under the legalaid scheme found no legal grounds on which to prepare a cassation appeal. In the absence of indications of arbitrariness or negligence on the lawyer\u2019s part in discharging his duties, the State can be said to have complied with its obligations to provide a framework for the provision of legal aid in connection with the cassation proceedings.",

The failure of the Katowice Court of Appeal to inform the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, of his procedural rights meant that he had no way of knowing that he had a new time-frame within which to find a lawyer who might be persuaded to file a cassation appeal on his behalf. The Court notes in this connection that the procedural framework governing the making available of legal aid for a cassation appeal in criminal cases, as described above, is within the control of the appellate courts. When notified of a legal-aid lawyer\u2019s refusal to prepare a cassation appeal, it is entirely appropriate and consistent with fairness requirements, that an appeal court indicate to an appellant what further procedural options are available to him or her. The Supreme Court\u2019s case-law stresses this point.

Once the Polish legal system has put in place an ultimate recourse to cassation in criminal proceedings, to signify anything at all, this right has to be a meaningful (\u201cpractical and effective\u201d) one, and not one dependent exclusively on the unfettered and unreviewable caprice of one single non-juridical person. If the right to have recourse to the Court of Cassation exists in the Polish system, the guarantees of Article 6 had to be complied with. Moreover, when the state is under an obligation to provide legal aid, this must be done in a manner that secures the beneficiaries \u201cthe genuine and effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 6\u201d.",

That has been left exclusively \u2013 and irrevocably \u2013 to the moreorless inspired fancies of any legalaid lawyer.

The negligence of the first legal-aid lawyer, additionally, had to \u201cbe shown\u201d in separate civil proceedings against the lawyer for compensation, the applicant being required to prove that the court should, in the circumstances, have assigned a new legalaid lawyer.

Giving a right to a legal-aid lawyer to decide on the fate of the case even before it is brought before the Supreme Court and without any written reasons for that decision, is, for me, arbitrary, even, as Judge Bonello pointed out, capricious. Of course, a legal-aid lawyer\u2019s opinion should matter. However, I see legal-aid more in terms of free legal representation than legal advice or, even worse, only the legal (and very personal) attitude of an individual having no judicial status. Additionally, as a Judge, I find the formula \u201cin a legalaid lawyer\u2019s opinion, a cassation appeal lacked prospects of success\u201d not only arbitrary, but offensive and prejudicial, especially bearing in mind the fact that the Court of Appeal in this case relied on this \u201copinion\u201d by refusing the applicant\u2019s requests for the appointment of a new legal-aid lawyer and thereby finally preventing the applicant from having his case decided by the highest judicial authority. That is what I see as the essence of this problem and that is why I think that the \u2019s caselaw should have dealt with this situation more carefully instead of finding a violation of Article 6 for the sole reason that the timelimits set by the Polish legislation had not been respected.",
