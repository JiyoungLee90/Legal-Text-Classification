Since then he had examined four other defamation cases brought by Mr Stepaniuc against the applicant newspaper and had found in all of them for Mr Stepaniuc and awarded the maximum amount possible under the law. According to the applicant it was a strange coincidence that the President of the court should himself have examined the majority of the defamation actions brought by Mr Stepaniuc. This is moreover strange since he had never examined defamation proceedings against Flux brought by \u201cordinary\u201d plaintiffs. In all the cases the actions had been upheld even though Mr Stepaniuc had failed to pay the court fees, an omission which was a formal ground for inadmissibility under the Code of Civil Procedure. Mr Stepaniuc had not even appeared before the court and all of his actions had been examined in his absence, usually at the first hearing. Judge I.M. never put questions to the defendant but kept advancing reasons which were in support of the plaintiff's position, reasons which had never been advanced by the plaintiff himself. This was proof of the \u201cspecial care\u201d shown by Judge I.M. towards Mr Stepaniuc.",
