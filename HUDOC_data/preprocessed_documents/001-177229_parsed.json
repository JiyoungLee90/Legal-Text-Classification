The Constitutional Court dismissed, by seven votes to six, the objection raised as to constitutionality and ruled that the provision in question was not disproportionate in that it did not violate the constitutional right to know one\u2019s biological parents and to establish the commensurate legal bond, which itself fell within the scope of the fundamental rights to personal identity and to found a family. In the view of the Constitutional Court judges, such a limitation did not prevent the holder of the right from exercising it but merely imposed on him or her the onus of doing so by a given deadline. The Constitutional Court noted, inter alia, that the existence of a legislative deadline was intended to avoid the unjustified prolongation of an indeterminate situation as regards the legal establishment of the parental relationship. It noted that there was a public interest in having both biological and legal paternity established as soon as possible in order to have a legally sound parental relationship for as long as possible. In addition, there was an interest in ensuring legal certainty in respect of the putative father and his family due to the personal and patrimonial consequences of the recognition of paternity. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view the tenyear time-limit established under Article 1817 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code was therefore reasonable in terms of ensuring that there was no time limit imposed for instituting paternity proceedings during a phase of the son\u2019s life in which he was not mature enough to make a firm decision.",

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Mikuli\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057, and S.H. and Others v. Austria [GC], no. 57813/00, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2011). However, the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In both cases consideration must be given to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. A balancing exercise is also required with regard to competing private interests. In this connection, it should be observed that the expression \u201ceveryone\u201d in Article 8 of the Convention applies to both the child and the putative father. If, as stated earlier, on the one hand, people have a right to know their identity, on the other hand, a putative father\u2019s interest in being protected from allegations concerning circumstances that date back many years cannot be denied. Finally, in addition to that conflict of interest, other interests may come into play, such as those of third parties \u2012 principally those of the putative father\u2019s family \u2012 and the general interests of legal certainty (Backlund, cited above, \u00a7 46).",

In contrast to situations where proceedings are instituted by fathers to establish or deny paternity, a significant number of States did not set a limitation period for children to bring an action aimed at having paternity established. Indeed, a tendency could be observed towards increasing protection of the right of the child to have its paternal parentage established (Phinikaridou, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058).",

Only a small number of legal systems seemed to have devised solutions to the problem which arises when the relevant circumstances become known only after expiry of the time-limit, for instance, by providing for the possibility of bringing an action after the time-limit has expired in cases where material or moral factors rendered it impossible to lodge it within that period, or if there was good reason for the delay (ibid., \u00a7 59).",

Accordingly, the existence of a limitation period per se is not incompatible with the Convention. What the Court needs to ascertain in a given case is whether the nature of the time-limit in question and/or the manner in which it is applied is compatible with the Convention (Backlund, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045, and Phinikaridou, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

The Court will therefore examine whether the factors substantiating a particular paternity claim were met before or after the expiry of the applicable time-limit. Furthermore, the Court will examine whether an alternative form of redress exists in the event that the proceedings in question are time-barred.

It further observes that the legislator set a general timelimit of ten years from the date of an individual\u2019s reaching the age of majority or of emancipation. The legislature then set a period of an additional three years following the occurrence of one of three different events, namely: paternity being successfully challenged by a third party, or an individual becoming aware \u2012 after the expiry of the ten-year time-limit \u2012 of a factor or circumstances which would justify the proceedings (in particular if the child has ceased to be treated as a son or a daughter), or \u2012 in the event that paternity has not been established \u2012 the investigating party\u2019s becoming aware of facts and circumstances which warrant the investigation (see paragraphs 29-30 above). Moreover, the Court takes note of the fact that the time-limit currently in force is the result of a legislative evolution which became operational in 2009 and sought to eliminate a short time-limit that was automatically applied. It also notes that this evolution of the legislation was intended to address the argument raised in Ruling no.\u00a023/2006 of the Constitutional Court that the two-year time-limit laid down in Article 1817 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code in force at the time was incompatible with Articles 26 \u00a7 1 and 36 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution (see paragraph 31 above). In the light of the foregoing, the Court does not consider the time-limit provided for by Portuguese law to be a rigid one (see, mutatis mutandis, Konstantinidis, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

The Court notes, however, that since 2011 the Constitutional Court has taken the view that the aforementioned time-limit is not incompatible with the Constitution because it is reasonable to allow an individual a sufficient amount of time, having reached the age of majority, to decide whether or not to start paternity proceedings while at the same time safeguarding legal certainty in respect of the putative father and his family (see paragraph 34 above).",

The applicants therefore did not institute paternity proceedings within the time-frame provided for by Article 1817 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code. Moreover, it notes that both applicants had always been aware of their respective father\u2019s identity: in particular, the first applicant had contact with the putative father\u2019s family (see paragraph\u00a06 above) and the second applicant claimed before the domestic courts that he had always known that A.M. was his father (see paragraph 19 above). The instant cases are therefore distinguishable from Phinikaridou and Backlund, both cited above, in which the applicants had not been able to start paternity proceedings within the time period established by law since they were not aware of the identity of the biological father and in which the legislation had established a rigid time-limit for the institution of the proceedings. The Court also notes that the applicants, in their submissions before the domestic courts, did not have recourse to any argument that would result in application of the supplementary three-year period provided for in paragraph 3 of Article 1817 of the Civil Code, as pointed out by the Vila Real Court in its decision dismissing the action lodged by the second applicant for being time-barred (see paragraph 20 above). Similarly, they did not refer to any factor that had prevented them from acting sooner.",
