The relevant detention orders had been based on relevant and sufficient reasons: the gravity of the charges against the applicant and a well-founded risk that he might abscond, exert pressure on the witnesses and the victim, or otherwise obstruct the proceedings. In particular, the domestic court had evidence to the effect that the applicant\u2019s relatives had taken measures to persuade the victim, Ye., to change her statements. The Government relied in this respect on the record of Ye.\u2019s questioning as a victim on 12\u00a0May 2005, the record of her questioning by the court on 15 November 2005, and her objections to an unspecified appeal filed by the applicant\u2019s lawyer. The Government further submitted that the lack of detailed reasoning in the appeal decisions of 11 May, 21 July and 29 August 2005 upholding the extension orders could not be regarded as a ground for finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, since the custodial measure was commensurate with the gravity of the charges against the applicant, the reasonable suspicion against him, and the public interest in preventing crime. Given the above considerations no alternative, more lenient, preventive measures could have been applied to the applicant. The applicant\u2019s argument that the custodial measure was incompatible with his state of health had been duly examined by the court and dismissed as unsubstantiated.",

Factors that ran counter to the presumption that he would reoffend were: the applicant\u2019s personality, his having a permanent place of residence and employment, his having a family, including two dependent children, his advanced age, his heart condition, and the absence of any previous criminal record. The detention orders of 15\u00a0September and 15 November 2005 had been very brief; they had failed to address the applicant\u2019s situation in any detail and had mostly relied on the gravity of the charges against him. Further, it did not appear from the text of these detention orders that the domestic court had considered the possibility of applying an alternative preventive measure. The applicant drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that on 17\u00a0February 2006 he had been convicted and given a suspended sentence of four years\u2019 imprisonment, which confirmed the argument that he had never posed any serious danger to society.",

Even if this period does not appear particularly excessive in itself, the Court reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention cannot be seen as authorising pre-trial detention unconditionally provided that it lasts no longer than a certain minimum period. Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2003-I (extracts)). It is incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish the existence of concrete facts constituting grounds for continued detention. Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no.\u00a054071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v. , no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a084-85, 26\u00a0July 2001).",

However, after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0152-153).",

The Court notes that the relevant judicial decisions did not go any further than listing these grounds, omitting to substantiate them with reference to any specific facts (see paragraph 12 above). Later on, when the investigation was already completed and the case file had been submitted to the trial court, the domestic court in its decisions of 15\u00a0September and 15\u00a0November 2005 continued to rely on the gravity of the charges against the applicant and his potential to obstruct the establishment of the truth.

Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7 180, ECHR 2005X (extracts)). Although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v. , 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207; Panchenko, cited above, \u00a7 102; Goral v.

In order for their reasoning to be sufficient the domestic courts needed to take into account the stage of the judicial proceedings, the applicant\u2019s personal situation (his age, health, residence and employment status, dependent children, the existence or lack of a criminal record, and so on), his behaviour before and after the arrest, and any other specific indications, such as, for example, the nature of the crime and the severity of the potential sentence, in order to justify, or prove groundless, the fear that he might abuse his regained liberty by, inter alia, manipulating witnesses.",

In the present case, it was not until the stage of the trial that the domestic courts mentioned in their decisions the presumed absence of any grounds for altering the custodial measure (see paragraphs 15 and 19 above). Even then, the relevant decisions omitted to set out with sufficient clarity why such alternatives would not have ensured that the trial followed its proper course.",
