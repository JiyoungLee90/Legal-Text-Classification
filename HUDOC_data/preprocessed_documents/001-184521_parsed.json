It is primarily for the national authorities \u2013 above all the courts \u2013 to interpret and apply domestic law, the Court\u2019s role being confined to determining whether or not the effects of that interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a026083/94, \u00a7 54, ECHR\u00a01999-I). Nevertheless, the principle of subsidiarity does not mean renouncing all supervision of the result obtained by using domestic remedies; otherwise, the rights guaranteed by the Convention would be devoid of any substance. It has been the Court\u2019s constant position that the Convention is intended to guarantee not theoretical or illusory rights, but rights that are practical and effective (see Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v. Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, \u00a7\u00a045, ECHR 2001-VIII).",

Compensation for detention imposed in breach of the provisions of Article 5 must be not only theoretically available but also accessible in practice to the individual concerned (see Abashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039, with further references). It must comprise a right to compensation for pecuniary damage, but also afford a right to compensation for any distress, anxiety and frustration that a person may have suffered as a result of a violation of other provisions of Article 5 (see Khachatryan and Others v. Armenia, no.\u00a023978/06, \u00a7 157, 27 November 2012). Moreover, a right to compensation for damage suffered which sets the levels of that so low as no longer to be \u201cenforceable\u201d in practical terms would not comply with the requirements of that provision (see Novoselov v.

Where, as in the present case, the existence of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 5 must be assessed in the light of the monetary redress afforded at the domestic level, the Court has had regard to its own practice under Article 41 of the Convention in similar cases (see Selami and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 78241/13, \u00a7\u00a0102, 1 March 2018; Cristina Boicenco v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 25688/09, \u00a7 43, 27 September 2011; Ganea v.

It reiterates that such an assessment should be carried out in a manner consistent with the domestic legal requirements and take into account the standard of living in the country concerned, even if that results in awards of amounts that are lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases (see Cocchiarella v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2006V). Nevertheless, the fact remains that Mr Vasilevskiy was awarded EUR 3,320 for the 472 days during which he had been unlawfully detained and Mr Bogdanov EUR 324 for the 119 days during which he had been unlawfully detained. That amounted to the respective rates of EUR 7 and EUR\u00a02.70 per day of wrongful deprivation of liberty. That level of compensation was not merely substantially lower than the Court\u2019s awards in similar cases but also disproportionate to the duration of their detention and negligible in absolute terms (see, by contrast, Novoselov, cited above).",
