His request (paragraph 7 above) in the impugned proceedings had been lodged only after the publication of the announcement regarding the election of new members to the SJC; this fact had raised concerns that the request had been lodged in an effort to increase his chances in the election for membership of the SJC, in which he had intended to participate.

The negative aspect of this right, namely the right to choose not to be treated as a member of a minority, is not limited in the same way as the positive aspect of that right (see paragraphs 25-26 above). The choice in question is completely free, provided it is informed. It must be respected both by the other members of the minority and by the State itself. That is supported by Article 3 \u00a7 1 of the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (see paragraph\u00a026 above) which provides as follows: \u201cno disadvantage shall result from this choice or from the exercise of the rights which are connected to that choice\u201d. The right to free self-identification is not a right specific to the Framework Convention. It is the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of international law on the protection of minorities in general. This applies especially to the negative aspect of the right: no bilateral or multilateral treaty or other instrument requires anyone to submit against his or her wishes to a special regime in terms of protection of minorities (see Molla Sali v.

The Ministry of Justice and courts at two levels of jurisdiction declined to grant that request on the following grounds: 1) it had been submitted after the announcement of the election of new members to the SJC had been published; 2) it had related to the applicant\u2019s electoral rights in the forthcoming election for new members to the SJC; and 3) it would have put other judges involved in those election at a disadvantageous position (see paragraphs 9, 12 and 15 above). In so far as it may be understood from the Government\u2019s observations that the applicant failed to prove his claimed (Macedonian) ethnic identity, the Court observes that at no stage in the impugned proceedings was the applicant requested to provide any (objective) evidence that his claim (to have his ethnicity changed) was genuine. Indeed, there is nothing in the impugned decisions to suggest that the applicant\u2019s request was dismissed as purely subjective and based on unsubstantiated grounds. In this respect the Court is also mindful of the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s request would have been granted had it not been submitted after the publication of the announcement of the election of new members to the SJC, in which he intended to participate as a candidate. They made no reference to any further requirement, such as the objective substantiation of that request (see paragraph 31 above).",

Only the Higher Administrative Court stated that the impugned refusal of the applicant\u2019s request (see paragraph\u00a07 above) had been based on the State Judicial Council Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) and the General Administrative Procedure Act; it furthermore identified the provisions that it deemed relevant for its decision (see paragraph 15 above). The Court observes that section 6 of the Act specified the composition of the SJC and that section 221(1) of the General Administrative Procedure Act set out the general rules regarding the rectification of errors in respect of administrative matters. Neither of those provisions concerned the electoral roll or the rectification of details contained therein. Such issues were regulated by section 17 of the Act, to which the applicant also referred in his request for the modification of his ethnicity entry in the electoral roll (see paragraph 8 above). That was also confirmed by the SJC (see paragraph\u00a017 above).

Under that provision, such a request is to be lodged after the electoral roll has been made available for inspection, which, in itself, can occur only after the public announcement of the election of new members to the SJC (see paragraph 23 above). In the Court\u2019s view, that provision is couched in general terms and applies to all judges whose personal details are recorded in the electoral roll. It contains no clause that further specifies or limits its applicability or makes it dependent on, for example, certain circumstances that apply to the claimant in the present case. Indeed, there is nothing in that provision that could be interpreted as preventing (that is to say excluding) judges running for election to the SJC from seeking the rectification of their personal entries in the electoral roll, (including their respective ethnicity designations) subsequent to the publication of the announcement of such an election. In the present case, the domestic authorities cited and applied the above interpretation of that provision, which in the Court\u2019s opinion cannot be said to have been predictable; furthermore, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the applicant could not reasonably have expected, in the absence of any clause to that effect, that his request would fail on those grounds.

The law guarantees the right to have entries rectified, which presupposes that the relevant information should reflect an objective reality. The applicant could not legitimately expect his ethnic identity to be modified without sufficient substantiation of his request.

The majority interpret section 17 in complete isolation from any other legal rule or provision. The impugned provision is interpreted without any consideration for its systemic context. This context consists of relevant legal rules which might have been inserted in other statutes or regulations and more general principles which may be applicable and which might have implicitly guided the national authorities, even if they did not consider it necessary to refer expressly to them in the reasoning of the decisions they rendered. It is also necessary to take into account all the relevant rules concerning the recognition of ethnic identity in other spheres of life.",
