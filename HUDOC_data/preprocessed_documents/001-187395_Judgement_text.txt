The case originated in an application (no. 78005/11) against the Hellenic Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eleven Greek nationals (“the applicants”), whose names appear in the annexed list, on 9 December 2011.
The applicants were represented by Mr G. Lallas, a lawyer practising in Athens. The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent’s delegate, Ms A. Magrippi, legal representative A at the State Legal Council.
The applicants alleged in particular that the revocation of the license that had been granted to them to exploit a quarry and the classification of the largest part of their land as a zone of absolute protection violated their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property. In addition, they complained that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts had been excessive and that they had not had at their disposal an effective remedy to complain in this regard.
On 26 April 2017 the application was communicated to the Government.
By virtue of contract no. 12289/19-3-1980, the first two applicants, along with Loukas Kokkinos, the predecessor in title of the third applicant, and Spyridon Kokkinos, the predecessor in title of the fourth applicant, jointly acquired ownership of two adjacent plots of land measuring 30,850 sq. m in total, along with buildings and mechanical equipment for the extraction of inert material situated on that land.
In July 1980 the first and second applicants and the predecessors in title of the other applicants formed a company, with view to operating a quarry on the land and selling aggregate material.
After the applicants and their predecessors in title started operating the quarry, on the basis of licence no. 205/3-3-1981 issued by the Fokida Prefecture (hereinafter, “the Prefecture”), on 3 June 1981 they bought an adjacent plot of land measuring 18,946 sq. m.
On 8 November 1997 Loukas Kokkinos transferred his share of the property to the third applicant via a parental grant. On 11 May 1999 Spyidon Kokkinos transferred his share of the property to the fourth applicant via a parental grant. On 21 January 1997 Konstantinos Karageorgos passed away without leaving a will, and his share was inherited in equal portions by the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth applicants, who accepted the inheritance. Following the death of Ioannis Karageorgos, on 28 December 1996 the ninth, tenth and eleventh applicants accepted the inheritance in respect of his share of the property.
Following the above transfers and inheritances, ownership of the property was as follows: the first applicant owned 20%, the second applicant owned 16.66%, the third and fourth applicants owned 15% each, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth applicants owned 4.16% each, the ninth and tenth applicants owned 6.25% each, and the eleventh applicant owned 4.16%.
From 1974 onwards a company named Latomeia Parnassidos EPE operated a quarry on the plot of land in question.
On 5 May 1976, by ministerial decision no. A/Φ31/55679/4945/5-5-1976 issued by the Minister of Culture and Science, a hill named Glas in the Fokida region was nominated as an “archaeological area”, as it had ruins from the Mycenaean period.
Following an application by the applicants and their predecessors, on 3 March 1981 the Prefecture issued licence no. 205/3-3-1981 permitting the applicants and their predecessors to operate a quarry for aggregate material. The licence was valid for ten years, with the possibility of renewal. The licence was granted following a decision dated 25 November 1980 issued by the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities (hereinafter, “the Ephorate”). The decision was positive, provided that the quarry operated within specific designated borders so as to protect the monuments.
Following some objections raised by the Ephorate as to the borders within which the applicants could operate their quarry, on 27 May 1985, on the basis of Article 51 of Law no. 5351/1932, the applicants and their predecessors in title asked the Ephorate to expropriate their plot of land if they considered that their activities posed a threat to the monuments in the area. On 16 August 1985 the Ephorate replied to them that their request would be examined by the Local Council of Monuments for the region and by the Legal Department of the Ministry of Culture. It seems that there was no further response.
Between 1982 and 1989 on many occasions the Ephorate expressed concerns regarding the way in which the antiquities situated on the land were affected by the quarrying and mining activities, and warned the applicants not to go beyond the borders designated for the operation of the quarry. On 3 October 1989 the Minister of Culture issued ministerial decision no. ΥΠΠΟ/ΑΡΧ/Α1/Φ.10/7732/735/3-10-1989, which revoked the decision of the Ephorate dated 25 November 1980 on the basis of which the applicants’ licence to operate the quarry had been granted. The ministerial decision in itself, however, had no effect on the licence granted by the Prefecture. The decision was revoked on the grounds that the applicants had exceeded the limits that had been imposed for the protection of the ancient monuments. Following that decision, on 17 October 1989, 29 January 1990, 9 February 1990 and 11 June 1990 the Ephorate asked the Prefecture to revoke licence no. 205/1981, on the basis of which the quarry was operating, so that the ministerial decision could take effect. However, it appears that the licence was never revoked, even though, according to the applicants, they essentially ceased the quarrying and mining activities. However, some documents indicate that the Ephorate continued to address complaints to the applicants during that period, asking them to stop any mining activities and warning them of the continuing damage to the antiquities.
On 24 October 1989, following a complaint lodged by the Ephorate, some of the applicants were convicted by the three-member Amfissa Magistrates’ Court of destroying antiquities situated in the archaeological area of Glas, an offence under Article 50 of Law no. 5351/32 on Antiquities.
On 3 January 1991 the applicants signed a lease contract by which they rented the quarry to a company called Fokiki AE for 1173.85 euros (EUR) per month. A term of the contract was that the lease would be interrupted if for any reason the licence for operating the quarry was revoked, or the quarry was forced to cease operations.
On 3 March 1991, by ministerial decision no. ΥΠΠΟ/ΑΡΧ/Α1/Φ.10/13624/725/27-3-1991 issued by the Minister of Culture and based on Article 91 of Law no. 1892/90, Glas hill, where the applicants’ land and quarry was located, was designated a “zone A region” – a region in which any construction or alteration of the ground was absolutely prohibited, with a view to protecting Delphi monuments. The designated land included 45,000 sq. m out of the approximately 49,000 sq. m. owned by the applicants.
On 15 July 1991, by decision no. ΤΒΝΦ/Φ.23/Α.88/15-7-1991, the Prefecture decided to renew the operating licence for the applicants’ quarry for another two years, until 2 March 1993. The decision was based on Article 33 § 1 (b) of Law no. 1428/84. By the same decision, the name of the licensee was officially changed from the applicants’ company to Fokiki AE, the company to which they had leased the quarry. The new licence included terms obliging those who exploited the quarry to comply with all the conditions set by the Archaeological Service. Both the Ministry of Culture and the Ephorate objected to the renewal of the licence, and requested its revocation.
On 28 December 1996 the applicants’ company was dissolved (act no. 10551/28-12-1996) and the land was divided up between the applicants according to the percentages set out above.
On 2 August 2000 the applicants lodged an application for compensation with the Athens Administrative Court of First Instance, based on Article 24 § 6 of the Constitution. In that application, they requested compensation for the damage they had allegedly suffered due to the restrictions imposed on their plot of land, namely: the value of their plot of land, the value of the existing facilities and equipment in their quarry, and the income they would have gained if they had been allowed to continue their operations. The total claim was EUR 1,904,622.15. The applicants argued that, owing to the rocky soil, their land was only suitable for quarrying.
On 25 June 2002 the Athens Administrative Court of First Instance published judgment no. 5568/2002 dismissing the applicants’ application for compensation. In particular, the domestic court held that Article 24 § 2 of the Constitution referred to the regulatory competence of the State only in respect of cities and urban areas, and therefore only exceptionally could a non-urban area be built on, and, in principle, only for uses assisting its main purpose, namely agricultural activities. It was possible to change the purpose of a property and implement further secondary measures limiting the property’s intended use, in order to achieve constitutionally foreseen aims, such as increased protection of the cultural environment, on the condition that the relevant property did not disappear or become inactive in relation to its purpose. The imposition of such limitations on the right of property meant that an owner had a right to compensation under Article 24 § 6 of the Constitution when the limitations caused essential, temporary or definitive deprivation of the use of a property in relation to its purpose, for example in the event of construction on land situated on a town plan being completely prohibited. In order to assess compensation, only the primary purpose of the land was taken into account, and not any other secondary uses that were exceptionally allowed. The use of the property was designated either directly by the Constitution, or by the legislature or the administration. As regards the applicants’ plot of land, it was situated outside the town plan and therefore its main purpose was agricultural. Agricultural activities were not impeded by the limitations imposed by the ministerial decisions. The above-mentioned findings were not affected by the fact that the plot of land had been used as a quarry from 1981 until 1993, because the provisions of Law no. 1428/1984 had only exceptionally allowed that use.
All applicants except for Mr Panagiotis Karageorgos, the seventh applicant, lodged an appeal with the Athens Appeal Administrative Court, arguing that the distinction made by the lower court concerning the primary and secondary use of the land was arbitrary, and that no provision of the Constitution or law provided that the use or purpose of land was a factor determining the right to compensation. On 21 November 2003 the appeal court published judgment no. 4634/2003 dismissing the applicants’ appeal, which contained similar reasoning to that of the first-instance court. The appeal court upheld the lower court’s conclusions concerning the primary and secondary use of a plot of land. Based on a document prepared by the Directorate of Agriculture of Fokida Prefecture – which said that the plot of land was to be used for agricultural activities and not as a quarry – and taking into account that the land was not in a quarrying region, the domestic court held that the core of the applicants’ right to their property was not affected, nor was their land excessively restricted according to its purpose, which would have been the case if the limitations imposed had concerned prohibiting the cultivation of olive trees or the grazing of sheep, for example. Based on the above factors, the applicants did not have a right to be compensated for the restrictions imposed on the use of their land.
Apart from the seventh applicant, all the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Administrative Court, arguing that the domestic courts had erroneously made their right to compensation dependent on the purpose of the land. On the contrary, the use of the plot of land and its purpose should only have been taken into account in relation to the assessment of the amount of compensation. In an additional memorandum, the applicants argued that the ministerial decisions had deprived them of the right to build on the remaining part of their land, which measured 3,800 sq. m, less than the statutory limit defined by law in order to be able to build. On 28 March 2011, by judgment no. 925/2011, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicants’ appeal on points of law, holding that it was not competent to rule on what the purpose of the plot of land was, and that that was within the competence of the Administrative Court of Appeal. Given that the lower court had ruled that the land was to be used for agricultural activities, it had correctly applied the law concerning compensation, and had rightly dismissed the applicants’ action for compensation. The decision was finalised (καθαρογράφηκε) on 28 June 2011.
The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court’s judgments in Anonymos Touristiki Etairia Xenodocheia Kritis v. Greece (no. 35332/05, §§ 18-22, 21 February 2008) and Varfis v. Greece (no. 40409/08, §§ 12-18, 19 July 2011).
In addition, the following legislative provisions are relevant:
Article 50 of Law no. 5351/1932 on Antiquities, as in force at the relevant time, read as follows:
The relevant provisions of Law no. 1428/1984 on the Exploitation of Inert Material and Other Provisions, as in force at the relevant time, read as follows:
“1.  Any public, municipal, communal or private areas, as well as areas belonging to legal persons operating under public law, that are suitable, based on the quality of stone [in those areas], their morphology, the existence of sufficient material and their accessibility ..., may be designated quarrying areas.
Quarrying areas in each prefecture shall be designated within five years by a decision of the competent prefect ... that is, issued following consent being given by the committee provided for in paragraph 3...”
“1.  The exploitation of quarries for inert material across the country shall be permitted only in quarrying areas as defined in Article 3.2. In the following cases, the exploitation of quarries for inert material outside quarrying areas shall exceptionally be permitted by a decision of the prefect, following a reasoned opinion of the Prefecture Council: ...”
The relevant provisions of Law no. 2115/1993 on the Amendment, Replacement and Completion of Law. no. 1428/1984 on the Exploitation of Inert Material and Other Provisions, issued on 2 February 1993, read as follows:
“1.  Quarries for inert material that operate outside quarrying areas under an exploitation licence or leasing contract or decision ... shall continue to operate until the expiry of the licence or the termination of the contract.
By a decision of the competent prefect, and following an opinion delivered by the Prefecture Council, a licence to exploit municipal, communal or private quarries ... may be renewed for five years each time, until thirty years has passed from the time the initial licence was issued, in accordance with the procedure and conditions set out in Articles 9 and 10 of Law no. 1428/1984 ...
In any event, the competent archaeological service shall ensure that quarries operating within archaeological sites shall cease to operate within two years.”
The relevant provisions of Law no. 1892/1990, as in force at the relevant time, read as follows:
According to the case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court, Article 24 of the Constitution provides that the cultural environment has the benefit of increased protection, and the State may impose restrictions or take measures to avoid its destruction or degradation or alteration. These restrictions may be wider than those provided for by Article 17 of the Constitution relating to property, and oblige the State to compensate persons whose property is affected by measures if those measures essentially bind the property in relation to its intended use (judgment no. 3224/2009). Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Articles 17 and 24 of the Constitution state that property and other rights in rem are protected in the context of the intended use of the property, which includes a range of permitted uses. These uses are determined either directly by constitutional provisions, or by the legislature or the administration in accordance with the Constitution. The immovable property could be categorised according to its intended use, property located in urban areas and property located outside urban areas. Property located outside urban areas, if not protected by special provisions such as those concerning forests or archaeological sites, is intended, in principle, for agricultural activities. Construction on such land is possible, under stricter conditions than those relating to land situated in urban zones (judgment no. 2036/2011).
Following the Court’s judgments in Theodoraki and Others v. Greece (no. 9368/06, 11 December 2008), Z.A.N.T.E. – Marathonisi A.E. v. Greece (no. 14216/03, 6 December 2007) and Anonymos Touristiki Etairia Xenodocheia Kritis v. Greece (no. 35332/05, 21 February 2008), the Supreme Administrative Court issued a series of judgments by which it modified its previous case-law, according to which every plot of land situated outside urban areas was intended to be used for agricultural activities. Following the change in the case-law, the owner of a plot of land may rely on and prove the fact that even though his or her property is situated outside an urban area, its intended use, before the imposition of restrictions, was residential, in accordance with the conditions laid down by law which applied to that region (judgments nos. 3224/2009 and 415/2006).
