The Supreme Court of Cassation referred to court decisions delivered between July 2007 and the date of the case on which it was deliberating at the time. In view of that finding, the court suspended the proceedings at hand and proposed that an interpretative decision be taken (\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 269 \u043e\u0442 2.06.2010 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116\u00a0187/2010 \u0433., IV \u0433. \u043e., \u0413\u041a). Subsequently, in interpretative decision no. 1 of 30 March 2012, the Plenary of the Civil Chambers of the Supreme Court of Cassation, (\u0442\u044a\u043b\u043a. \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1 \u043e\u0442 30 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 2012 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0442\u044a\u043b\u043a.\u0434. \u21161/ 2010 \u0433., \u041e\u0421\u0413\u041a) resolved this contentious issue. In particular, it noted that under Article 344 \u00a7 1 of the Labour Code, an action brought by an employee challenging an unlawful dismissal and seeking reinstatement and compensation had to be directed against the employer, namely the physical or legal entity which hired the employee. In the case of head teachers, this was the school. It held that the same approach applied to situations in which the employment contract had been concluded by the institution superior to the employer.",

In any event, the salient issue in the instant case is not whether the domestic courts erred in applying national law, but whether the judgments and decisions delivered by the national courts pursuant to the two actions brought by the applicant interfered with her right under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to obtain a judicial examination of her claim with respect to the second dismissal.",

The Court observes that in the latter case, the applicant\u2019s complaint concerned two different sets of proceedings in respect of identical factual circumstances and the same civil tort claim. More importantly, in both sets of proceedings the question of the proper defendant was explicitly raised by the defendants and examined by the domestic courts, which took two diametrically opposed positions on the latter point, to the effect that the merits of that applicant\u2019s claims were not examined (see Kostadin Mihaylov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 14-22). In the light of those circumstances, it appears to the Court that the present case is different from that of Kostadin Mihaylov, cited above, for at least two reasons. First, the dismissal proceedings in the present applicant\u2019s case concerned different matters: the first set of proceedings concerned only the dismissal order dated 19 July 2002, whereas the second set of proceedings concerned the dismissal of 6 December 2005 (see paragraphs 7-9 and 11-17 above). Secondly, the question of the correct defendant was not addressed by the courts in the first set of dismissal proceedings, as the REI had not raised an objection in that sense (see paragraphs 7-9 above). It is not for this Court to rule on the question whether the domestic courts were obliged to examine ex officio that point in the first set of proceedings. In any event, they examined a civil dispute as described by the applicant with respect to the circumstances of the first dismissal and, in the absence of an objection on the part of the REI that it was not the proper defendant, they ruled on the merits of the case. In the view of the Court, the REI was not prevented from raising an objection that it was not the proper defendant in subsequent proceedings against the same applicant, and the courts were not wrong to consider that they were not bound by the fact that the REI had acted as an opposing party in the previous set of proceedings instituted by the applicant.",

That entity was also the one which had just acted as a defendant in the first set of dismissal proceedings, where the applicant obtained successful results in a final court decision delivered only two weeks before being dismissed anew (see paragraphs 7-9 above). It also appears that at the time it was common practice for the domestic courts to adjudicate unfair dismissal claims with the REI as the defendant (see paragraph 22 above). The Court can therefore accept that the applicant cannot be reproached for having envisaged that the REI would again be the party called to answer her claims related to her new dismissal. The Court notes that the two-month statutory time-limit to complain against the applicant\u2019s dismissal expired on 6 February 2006. That was also the ultimate deadline for bringing an action against the school either in separate proceedings, or in the course of the proceedings already instituted against the REI. This is indicated in the applicable legislation providing that only the date of the civil action against the school was binding on the latter, and not the date of the beginning of the dismissal proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a021 and 26 above). It is true that the applicant has not explained why she did not designate the school as an opposing party in those proceedings, either together with the REI or by substituting the latter for the school, as suggested by the Government (see paragraph 31 above). However, it seems that the first hearing in which the REI raised its objection about the question of the defendant took place after 6 February 2006, by which time the action against the school was already time barred. Although this remains unclear from the case file, the Court observes that in any event, the first court decision indicating that the applicant should address her claims against the school was taken on 12\u00a0April 2006 (see paragraph 12 above), well beyond the two month statutory limit, within which the applicant could have joined the school as a defendant in accordance with the national law.",

Although that inconsistency and some of the relevant procedures were later settled by two binding interpretative decisions taken by the Supreme Court of Cassation, confirming that schools were the proper defendants in cases of dismissal of head teachers, those rulings were mandatory only for subsequent court decisions and had no effect on the applicant\u2019s situation (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above). Moreover, the Government have not submitted copies of relevant domestic court decisions delivered before the beginning of 2006. It appears, from the information available to the Court that this divergent practice of the national courts started after the applicant has submitted her claim in the beginning of 2006. The divergent practice in question was resolved by the Supreme Court of Cassation at the beginning of 2012, that is to say more than six years after the applicant\u2019s second dismissal. Therefore, the information brought to the attention of the Court is not sufficient to establish that this inconsistency in the case-law already existed at the time of the applicant\u2019s appeal against her second dismissal to such an extent that it could have been reasonably expected of her that she address her claims against both the school and the REI from the very beginning of the proceedings in order to be sure of obtaining judicial examination on the merits.",
