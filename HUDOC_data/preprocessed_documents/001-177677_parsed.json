It has held, inter alia, that when the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3 sq. m of floor surface in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article\u00a03 arises. The burden of proof is on the respondent Government, which can, however, rebut that presumption by demonstrating that there were factors capable of adequately compensating for the scarce allocation of personal space (ibid., \u00a7 137). However, where a prison cell \u2013 measuring in the range of 3 to 4 sq. m of personal space per inmate \u2013 is at issue the space factor remains a weighty factor in the Court\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of conditions of detention. In such instances a violation of Article 3 will be found if the space factor is coupled with other aspects of inappropriate physical conditions of detention related to, in particular, access to outdoor exercise, natural light or air, availability of ventilation, adequacy of room temperature, the possibility of using the toilet in private, and compliance with basic sanitary and hygienic requirements (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0139).",

However, the Court observes that it has found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in previous cases mainly on account of lack of individual space and poor sanitary conditions in Giurgiu Prison, during a period corresponding to when the applicant was imprisoned there (see Marian Toma v.

Whilst there may be differences in their relationship with their child, both the mother and the father can provide this attention and care (see, mutatis mutandis, Konstantin Markin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0132).

Greece [GC], nos.  and , \u00a7 77, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and the references cited in that judgment). More particularly, the Grand Chamber has emphasised \u201cthat the advancement of the equality of the sexes is today a major goal in the member States of the Council of Europe and that very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before such a difference in treatment could be regarded as compatible with the Convention (see Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 280B, and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 263). In particular, references to traditions, general assumptions or prevailing social attitudes in a particular country are insufficient justification for a difference in treatment on grounds of sex\u201d (see Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 127, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). We find it of relevance for the present case that the Court has also observed that contemporary European societies have moved towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibility for the upbringing of their children and that men\u2019s caring role has gained recognition (ibid., \u00a7 140). Furthermore, as the Court noted in Petrovic v. Austria (cited above, para. 38), that while being aware of the differences which may exist between mother and father in their relationship with the child, it started from the premise that so far as taking care of the child is concerned, both parents are \u201csimilarly placed\u201d.",

Criminal law policy choices must be rational and their rationale is under the Court\u2019s supervision. Regardless to the width of this margin in general, it is framed by human rights and fundamental freedoms as protected by the Convention and the Court\u2019s jurisprudence. Consequently, it may not override the mentioned well-established requirement of particularly serious reasons for any difference of treatment on the basis of sex. What is more, we are of the view that the Court is bound to make an autonomous assessment of the existence of such particularly serious reasons, whereas it falls to the Respondent State to discharge the burden of proof place upon it and justify the difference in treatment (see mutatis mutandis DH v. Czech Republic..., para. 188).",

According to the Government, the disparate treatment of both relevant categories is in the protection of the best interest of the child. They also make reference to the particular links between a mother and a child during the first months after the birth. Bearing this in mind, it is apparent that the pertinent piece of Romanian legislation, namely Article 453 para. 1 b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, aims at the protection of children under the age of twelve months. In light of the Court\u2019s case law, emphasizing the importance of fathers from the child\u2019s earlier age, it is difficult to see how this difference in treatment can serve the best interest of children, let alone how this best interest could provide objective and reasonable justification for excluding fathers ex lege from the circle of beneficiaries of the provision.",

Leaving aside the fact that these arguments were not advanced by the Government it is hard to accord them any relevance. We are strongly convinced that the motherhood in general and women in the vulnerable period after giving birth in particular would not be protected to any lesser extent if the law provided for a suspension of sentence for fathers of newborn children, if their particular circumstances so warrant. The risks associated with changing the law to allow men, as well as women, to petition for a stay in their sentences to care for their infant children are very low. As the government argued on a number of occasions, judges will take into account the totality of the circumstances and grant stays only when they are warranted. Changing the law to allow men the same opportunities as women would not provide an automatic suspension of their sentence to all fathers who have children younger than one (just as the current version of the law does not provide an automatic postponing to mothers). It simply gives men and women the right to make an argument as to why their sentences should be postponed. Ensuring both fathers and mothers have an opportunity to make their case before a judge poses no serious risks or threats to the judicial system or to broader goal of fairness in the Romanian society. If anything, it will do the opposite. It will ensure both men and women are seen as primary caregivers and that fathers are equally important in the lives of their children. This will indirectly contribute to promoting, rather than hindering, gender equality in Romania.",

Because leveling down is thus not permitted and would be ill advised, and no good reason exists for creating such a separation, a violation of Article 14 should be found and the law should be changed in such a way that it permits men and women to petition for a suspension in sentence due to child-care responsibilities.",
