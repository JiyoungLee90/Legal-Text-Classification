According to them, those who had profited from it had been mostly people who had known about the directive and instituted proceedings after 7 June 2005, including some friends of managers of the Fund. As a result of the disclosure of this practice, four managers of the Fund were dismissed and on 16 November 2005 the Minister of Agriculture resigned.

The Court has found such a burden excessive when the uncertainty has lasted for several years (see, amongst other authorities, Lyubomir Popov v.

The amount of compensation which the State guaranteed to pay was based on the price of land in 1991. The Court reiterates that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not impose any restrictions on the Contracting States\u2019 freedom to determine the scope and conditions of property restitution for possessions taken before they ratified the Convention (see Kopeck\u00fd v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2004IX). It is true that the applicants claimed, and it might well be the case, that the substitute plots of land had a much higher value, but the Court observes that the discrepancy between the two possible ways of settling restitution claims arose only because of the rise in the price of land after 1991 as a result of market forces for which the State generally cannot be held responsible.",

In the context of restitution the Court has accepted that even cases where the applicants were not compensated at all for confiscated property complied with the Convention, provided that they still retained some of it (see \u0160imonov\u00e1 v. the  (dec.), no. 73516/01, 26 April 2005, and Ha\u0161kovcov\u00e1 and V\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u0161ov\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 43905/04, 7\u00a0December 2010).

This aspect is pertinent in considering whether a certain \u201cthreshold of hardship\u201d was crossed in the applicant\u2019s case (see Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7 192). The Court does not conclude that the threshold was crossed in the present application, given that the applicant is entitled to receive her purchase price for the claim.",
