The company claimed to have ceased its broadcasts - independently of the consequences of the station\u2019s having been struck by lightning - because of the PTT\u2019s ban on retransmission. Other reasons may have weighed more heavily, however. With the arrival of experimental local radio stations and a third frequency for Radio DRS [Direktion Radio und Fernsehen der deutschen und r\u00e4toromanischen Schweiz], the transmitter on the Pizzo Groppera had to face serious competition, including that from Radio 24; the transmitter\u2019s survival is accordingly no doubt in jeopardy irrespective of the ban on retransmission.

Like the Commission, the Court considers that both broadcasting of programmes over the air and cable retransmission of such programmes are covered by the right enshrined in the first two sentences of Article 10 \u00a7 1 (art. 10-1), without there being any need to make distinctions according to the content of the programmes. The disputed administrative decisions certainly interfered with the cable retransmission of Sound Radio\u2019s programmes and prevented the subscribers in the Maur area from receiving them by that means; they therefore amounted to \"interference by public authority\" with the exercise of the aforesaid freedom.",

Since then, changed views and technical progress, particularly the appearance of cable transmission, have resulted in the abolition of State monopolies in many European countries and the establishment of private radio stations - often local ones - in addition to the public services.

Its wording is not unlike that of the last sentence of Article 11 \u00a7 2 (art. 11-2). In this respect, however, the two Articles (art. 10, art. 11) differ in their structure. Article 10 (art. 10) sets out some of the permitted restrictions even in paragraph 1 (art. 10-1). Article 11 (art. 11), on the other hand, provides only in paragraph 2 (art. 11-2) for the possibility of special restrictions on the exercise of the freedom of association by members of the armed forces, the police and the administration of the State, and it could be inferred from this that those restrictions are not covered by the requirements in the first sentence of paragraph 2 (art. 11-2), except for that of lawfulness (\"lawful\"/\"l\u00e9gitimes\").

However, its inclusion was opposed on the ground that it might be utilised to hamper free expression, and it was decided that such a provision was not necessary because licensing in the sense intended was deemed to be covered by the reference to \"public order\" in paragraph 3 of the Article (see Document A/5000 of the sixteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, 5 December 1961, paragraph 23).",

In the actual context, three points are of primary importance. (1) The second sentence of the Article expressly mentions freedom to receive and impart information \"regardless of frontiers\".  This freedom of cross-boundary communication is an essential element of present-day democracy and must be taken into account when interpreting the other provisions in Article 10 (art. 10).  (2) The third sentence of the first paragraph of this Article (art. 10-1) expressly permits the licensing of broadcasting enterprises.  Even if modern technical developments permit a far greater number of radio and television enterprises and channels than was the case when the Convention was drafted, States still have the right and the duty to ensure the orderly regulation of communications, and this can only be achieved by a licensing system.  Whether a licensing system can be used for preserving a State monopoly in this field in spite of the modern developments can be left open in the present context, since such a monopoly no longer exists in .  It seems also to be undisputed that a licensing system cannot be used for imposing censorship and cannot justify the suppression of legally permitted information and ideas.  I further agree with the majority of the Court that the retransmission of radio programmes by cable can be made conditional on a licence, although under the terms of the third sentence of Article 10 \u00a7 1 (art. 10-1) this is by no means beyond doubt.  It can hardly be doubted that the prohibition of such retransmission cannot be left to the unfettered discretion of the executive.  This implies that the second paragraph of Article 10 (art. 10-2) comes into play and must be respected when a State operates a licensing system.  (3) The question, therefore, is whether the interference by the Swiss authorities in the present case satisfies the requirements of Article 10 \u00a7 2 (art. 10-2), as developed in the case-law of the Convention organs.  Among these requirements, a first condition is that a restriction must be \"prescribed by law\". ",

                        "content": "Here a first problem arises which has been discussed neither by the parties nor in the present judgment, but which needs further consideration.  As far as can be seen, the Swiss legislature has until now never enacted any substantive provisions on broadcasting licences; instead it has given the Government, by means of Federal Act of 1922 governing correspondence by telegraph and telephone as interpreted in practice, complete freedom to regulate this field.  (The Act primarily concerns telegraph and telephone communications, since in 1922 radio did not yet exist).  Is the requirement in Article 10 \u00a7 2 (art. 10-2) that restrictions must be \"prescribed by law\" really satisfied when a parliament confers unlimited or extremely broad powers on the executive, which becomes the law-making as well as the law-executing authority?  I have doubts in this respect, but it is not necessary to discuss this question in extenso since I am convinced that the legal basis for the interference in question is not sufficient even if Article 78 of the Government's Ordinance of 17 August 1983 is taken as the starting-point.  This Article merely refers to \"the provisions of the International Telecommunication Convention and the international Radio Regulations\", without giving any further details.  I accept that under the Swiss system treaty law is part of domestic law.  I also think that technical provisions contained in international texts do not all have to be published in the official gazette; it suffices that they are accessible, which is the case here.  But what do these international norms mean and prescribe in the present context?  It has never been clarified whether  violated its international obligations by permitting or tolerating the radio broadcasts in question.  It has never been clarified whether Groppera Radio violated Italian law, including any international norm which is self-executing in .  It seems to me to be beyond doubt that  would not be in breach of any international obligation if it were to permit the retransmission by cable of the programme in question.  Under international law it may have the right, but it clearly has no duty, to intervene and to prohibit such retransmission.  Taking the foregoing into account and having regard to the only Swiss decision which explains in some detail the situation under Swiss law - that is the decision of 31 July 1984 of the head office of the Swiss Post and Telecommunications Authority -, I see no adequate and sufficiently clear legal provision which can be regarded as a basis for the interference in question.

Apart from the news programmes, which were clearly bulletins of the type usual in broadcasts of this kind, these programmes were therefore essentially light entertainment and contained none of the kind of discussion or mere airing of views and expression of ideas or cultural or artistic events with which Article 10 (art. 10) is concerned.  Mr Minelli moreover specified that the programming left political problems untouched and aimed to provide entertainment but also an opportunity for the expression of personal opinions on personal matters.  This is far from the discussion of ideas and artistic expression.  Besides, the radio station's essentially commercial objective accounts for the emphasis on mere entertainment in its programmes.  Article 10 (art. 10) is certainly not designed to protect either commercial operations or mere entertainment.  I therefore conclude that no issue arises under it and that consequently there can be no question of a breach in this case. ",
