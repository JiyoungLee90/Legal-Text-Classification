In certain circumstances it might attain the \u201cminimum level of severity\u201d, provided by Article 3 of the Convention. Thus in the case of Vala\u0161inas v. Lithuania (no.\u00a044558/98, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2001VIII), in which the applicant, a male prisoner, was stripped naked in the presence of a female prison officer \u2012 who in the course of searching him touched his sexual organs and his food with her bare hands \u2012 the Court found a breach of Article 3. In the case of Wiktorko v. Poland (no. 14612/02, \u00a7\u00a7 54-55, 31 March 2009), the Court held that the forcible undressing of a female applicant by a male personnel at a de-intoxification centre and her subsequent lashing to a bed with belts for about ten hours constituted degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. In the case of Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland (25196/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054-60, 15 November 2001), the Court held that while strip searches might be necessary on occasions to ensure prison security or prevent disorder in prisons, they had to be conducted in an appropriate manner. The prison guards verbally abused and derided the applicant with their behaviour intended to provoke feelings of humiliation and inferiority, which, given the applicant\u2019s personality, his peaceful behaviour during the entire period of his detention, the fact that he was not charged with a violent crime and that he had no previous criminal record, showed a lack of respect for his human dignity, in violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
