Maintaining in the main her arguments before the City Court, she requested that the Housing Cooperative X\u2019s action be dismissed; in the alternative, she argued that the request for compulsory sale was unlawful in that no evidence had been adduced to show that she had defaulted her obligations vis-\u00e0-vis the Housing Cooperative or, in any event, that any such default had been substantial. In the further alternative, she submitted that, after refusing to dismiss the suit, the City Court had failed to refer her case for examination according to the ordinary procedure (involving in principle an oral hearing) and had wrongly considered her objections against compulsory sale as being clearly groundless; therefore, she asked the High Court to quash the City Court\u2019s decision and to refer the case back for re-examination in accordance with the ordinary procedure.

Switzerland, 24\u00a0June 1993, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 263 and the cases cited therein). Although the earlier cases emphasised that a hearing must be held before a court of first and only instance unless there were exceptional circumstances that justified dispensing with one (see, for instance, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson, cited above, \u00a7 64; Fredin v.

It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Miller v. Sweden, no. 55853/00, \u00a7 29, 8\u00a0February 2005). The overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article\u00a06 is, as always, the key consideration (see, mutatis mutandis, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.

In this regard, the Court observes that in its decision of 5 August 2010, the High Court, like the City Court, held that it was decisive whether the conditions for the imposition of default measures under sections 5-22 and 5-23 had been fulfilled on 14 April 2009, at the time when the Board communicated its order of compulsory sale to the applicant (see paragraph 60 above).",

In this context it is of interest to note that the trial courts in those proceedings, after hearing evidence from Mr A, who was legally represented, and from witnesses, had convicted him on nearly all of the charges and had sentenced him to imprisonment of 120 days and eighteen days, respectively by judgments of 10 March 2006 and 23 June 2008 which had not been subject to appeal and had gained legal force (see paragraphs 11 to 19 above).",

This conclusion, the High Court observed, was further strengthened by the information that the incidents ought to be considered as a pattern of behaviour capable of creating an atmosphere of insecurity in the close environment. And having reached this conclusion, the High Court found it unnecessary to examine whether Mr A\u2019s moving into the applicant\u2019s flat contrary to the declaration made on her behalf by Attorney B. on 26 May 2004 (see paragraphs 5 to 7 above) amounted to serious default in the sense of the Housing Cooperative Act.",

These issues had clearly not been present in the case of Ms Sagvolden. In Orli\u0107 v.

Thus, like in the above-cited cases, when examining whether the procedural safeguards available to the applicant in this case afforded due respect to her Article 8 interest in keeping her home, an important factor will be whether the national courts reviewed not only the lawfulness of the measure but also its reasonableness and proportionality (McCann, \u00a7 50; \u0106osi\u0107, \u00a7 22; Orli\u0107, \u00a7 65; see also Gladysheva, \u00a7 95; Bjedov, \u00a7 68; and Zehentner, \u00a7 63, all cited above).",

The High Court found decisive that, after she had moved in, Mr A had repeatedly caused serious harassment and nuisance to her neighbours, according to the facts established in the criminal judgments from 10\u00a0March\u00a02006 and 23 June 2008 (see paragraphs 53 to 55 above). Also, he had been imposed restraining orders prohibiting him from seeking contact with four of the applicant\u2019s neighbours, running over different periods between May 2007 and April 2009 (see paragraph 56 above). The High Court considered the applicant\u2019s submission that the situation had since improved but found decisive that the conditions for ordering compulsory sale had been fulfilled at the time when the Board notified her of its decision. Due to the number of incidents and to the length of the period in which they had occurred, the matters for which Mr A had been convicted constituted such substantial default as could warrant compulsory sale of her flat. The incidents drew a pattern of behaviour capable of creating an atmosphere of insecurity in the near environment (see paragraph 57 above). The High Court had regard to the applicant\u2019s argument related to her old age and problems in moving but held that this could not lead to any different conclusion, it being her own and her son\u2019s acts that had led to the impugned order of compulsory sale (see paragraph 61 above). The Court also notes that the applicant did not complain, nor is there anything to suggest, that there was a risk that she would be left homeless (compare Ivanova and Cherkezov v.
