The Court finds that the main delays in the resolution of the dispute were caused by the numerous remittals of the case for a fresh consideration, including after a final judgment had been adopted. The Court further observes that these remittals appear largely attributable to manifest inconsistencies in the domestic courts\u2019 approach to interpretation of applicable facts and law. The Court notes, in particular, that some of the judgments had been based on essentially the same analysis as the judgments which had been previously quashed. The Court reiterates that repetitive re-examination of claims within one set of proceedings can disclose a serious deficiency in the domestic judicial system (see Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25\u00a0November\u00a02003). Although the Court has previously rejected some cases concerning repeated remittals, having observed that the judicial authorities had acted diligently in handling a complex matter (see Zhurba\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a011215/03, 19\u00a0June\u00a02007, and Bespalov\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a011484/05, 15\u00a0January 2008), it cannot find a\u00a0similar justification for the remittals in the present case. The Court finally notes that there were five months of procedural inactivity after the judgment was quashed on 9 June 2000.",
