She relied on previous decisions of the Social Security Commissioners, in which they held that there would be no failure to disclose unless disclosure was reasonably to be expected. If there was no failure to disclose, the question of recovery of an overpayment would not arise at all. The Tribunal allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that the relevant test was not what a reasonable man would have thought it appropriate to disclose, but rather what a reasonable man knowing the particular circumstances of the claimant would have expected her to disclose. The Tribunal accepted that the applicant did not understand that the placing of her children in care was a material fact which she needed to disclose to the DWP, and that it was not reasonable to expect her, in the particular circumstances of her case, to have disclosed that fact.",

Notwithstanding the settled case-law of the Commissioners, the \u201creasonableness test\u201d was not a requirement under section 71 of the 1992 Act and did not represent a possible construction of section 71.

Although the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of R. (Carson and Reynolds) v.\u00a0the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to the effect that a noncontributory benefit such as income support was not a possession within the meaning of Article 1 was taken as correct by the House of Lords, the underlying issue of principle awaited the decision of the Grand Chamber of the Court in the case of Stec.

The proposition that you could not report something that you did not know was a simple proposition of logic, whereas the proposition that you could not report something you did not appreciate you had to report depended on difficult questions of cognitive capacity and moral sensitivity which varied from person to person.",

Where a benefit system relies on recipients to report any change in their circumstances, the Court considers that it would be perverse if they could acquire an assertable right to overpaid benefit where they have failed to report such a change.

A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy.

However, the Court agrees with the Court of Appeal that these two groups could not be said to be in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations. On the contrary, although neither could be said to be \u201cto blame\u201d for the failure to report, the Court considers the situation of persons who are not aware of a fact to be qualitatively of a different nature to that of persons who are aware of a fact but who are not aware of its materiality. As the Court of Appeal found, the proposition that you cannot report something that you do not know is a simple proposition of logic, whereas the proposition that you cannot report something you do not appreciate you have to report depends on difficult questions of cognitive capacity and moral sensitivity which vary from person to person.",

Holding otherwise would be contrary to the doctrine of unjust enrichment, would be unfair to other individuals contributing to the social security fund, and would amount to sanctioning an inappropriate allocation of scarce public resources. However, the Court has observed that the above general principle cannot prevail in a situation where the individual concerned is required to bear an excessive burden as a result of a measure divesting him or her of a benefit (Moskal v.

Indeed, the Court observes that it would have been open to the applicant to request that the Secretary of State waive his right to recover the overpaid benefit if there was evidence that recovery would be detrimental to her health or welfare. As she did not make any such request, the Court cannot accept that the recovery would have had such a detrimental impact.",
