On 24\u00a0March 1973 the company decided to transfer these two adjoining plots by way of gift to Mr Ioannis Vrahimis. The company secretary was authorised to take all necessary steps on behalf of the company to effect the transfer. On 11\u00a0June 1973 the relevant declaration of transfer was submitted to the Kyrenia District Lands Office. However, the process of transfer and registration was not completed owing to the Turkish military intervention. Meanwhile, in view of the proposed gift of the land, the applicant and her former husband proceeded to build a two-storey house (with a surface area of approximately 200 sq. m.) on it. As at the relevant time Mr Ioannis Vrahimis had no income, the applicant bore the costs of building and furnishing the property. In April 1974, when the house was completed, she moved into it with her family. They intended to live there initially for long periods and then permanently.",

Moreover, she was allegedly beaten with an electric baton while detained in the \u201cTRNC\u201d, and this provoked severe pain in her abdomen (see paragraph\u00a019 above). However, the Court has at its disposal little evidence to corroborate the applicant's version of events. The medical certificates issued by Dr Costas Antoniades (see paragraphs 25-26 above) only refer to bruises and abrasions and specify that X-ray examinations had shown no bone damage. The third medical certificate was issued on 12\u00a0November 2002 (see paragraph 27 above), which is more than thirteen years after the date of the alleged ill-treatment. Dr Constantines stated that he had first examined the applicant in June 1998, almost ten years after her arrest.

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 42, Reports 1996-III).",

The Court therefore concluded that when, as in the Foka case, an act of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities was in compliance with laws in force within the territory of northern , it should in principle be regarded as having a legal basis in domestic law for the purposes of the Convention. It does not see any reason to depart, in the instant case, from that finding, which is not in any way inconsistent with the view adopted by the international community regarding the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d or the fact that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus remains the sole legitimate government of Cyprus (see Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a025781/94, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 61 and 90, ECHR\u00a02001\u2013IV).",

Taking part in an unlawful assembly is an offence under section 71 of the Cypriot Criminal Code and is punishable by up to one year's imprisonment (see paragraph 36 above). It is also an offence under the \u201cTRNC\u201d laws to enter \u201cTRNC\u201d territory without permission and/or other than through an approved port (see paragraphs 40-41 above). The Court further notes that according to Chapter 155, section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a police officer may, without warrant, arrest any person who commits in his presence any offence punishable with imprisonment or who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty (see paragraph 39 above \u2013 see also Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 61, and Chrysostomos and Papachrysostomou, Commission's report, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0147).",

Moreover, on 21 July 1989, during the court hearing, an interpreter translated the charges to the accused (see paragraph\u00a021 above).

In the Court's view, the intervention of the Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces was not due to the political nature of the demonstration but was provoked by its violent character and by the violation of the \u201cTRNC\u201d borders by some of the demonstrators (see Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 110).",
