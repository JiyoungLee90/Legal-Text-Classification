The case originated in an application (no. 46581/99) against the  lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Ms Ecaterina Daniliuc (“the applicant”), on 19 November 1997.
The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that her rights provided for by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention were violated because of the non-enforcement of two judgments favourable to her and because of the quashing of one of them following a request for annulment (recurs în anulare) by the Prosecutor General.
On 27 April 2004 a Chamber of the Fourth Section decided to join the admissibility and merits of the case in accordance with Article 29 § 3 of the Convention.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Costeşti.
In 1995, the applicant lodged with the Ialoveni District Court a civil action against Costeşti Municipal Council claiming compensation for alleged illegal acts.
On 6 October 1995, the Ialoveni District Court found in favour of the applicant and awarded her 675 Moldovan lei (MDL). No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final.
Between 1995 and 2003 the applicant complained on numerous occasions to different State bodies about the non-enforcement of the judgment of 6 October 1995.
On 11 March 2003, after the present case was communicated to the Government, the judgment of 6 October 1995 was enforced.
In 1996 the applicant lodged with the Ialoveni District Court a civil action against the Costeşti Municipal Council and a private agricultural enterprise.
On 16 September 1996, the Ialoveni District Court allowed the action in part and awarded the applicant MDL 20,960.
On 26 February 1998 the  rejected the Costeşti Local Council’s appeal for failure to pay the court fees. The judgment of 16 September 1996 became final.
In 1998, the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law in which she argued that the amount of compensation was insufficient.
On 18 August 1998, the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal and upheld the judgment of 16 September 1996.
On an unspecified date in 2000 the Prosecutor General’s Office lodged with the Supreme Court of Justice a request for annulment of the judgments of 16 September 1996, 26 February 1998 and 18 August 1998.
On 17 May 2000 the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the Prosecutor General’s appeal, quashed the judgments of 16 September 1996, 26 February 1998 and 18 August 1998 and ordered the re-opening of the proceedings.
The re-opened proceedings ended by a final judgment of the Ialoveni District Court of 2 December 2002 by which the applicant’s application was struck out of the list of cases for failure to appear before the court.
