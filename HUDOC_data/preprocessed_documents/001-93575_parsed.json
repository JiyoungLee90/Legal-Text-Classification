In particular, these treatments included a violent punch on his chest during arrest; being blindfolded, handcuffed, made to lie down on the floor face down and told to raise his legs and receiving kicks to his buttocks and a blow to his head when he lowered his legs after his arrival at the police station; having one officer pulling his right leg while at the same time another pressed down on his back during interrogation. During this time, his testicles were squeezed and he received kicks and pressure to his back. A few hours before he was to be brought before the prosecutor, the applicant was told that chief Soner was going to come and he was made to wait while sitting in an uncomfortable position for hours. This person punched the applicant\u2019s face and his chin and kicked him on his knees.

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v.

The minimum standards as to effectiveness defined by the Court\u2019s case-law include the requirements that the investigation be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny, and that the competent authorities act with exemplary diligence and promptness (see, for example, \u00c7elik and \u0130mret v.\u00a0, no.\u00a044093/98, \u00a7 55, 26 October 2004). In addition, the Court recalls that the rights enshrined in the Convention are practical and effective, and not theoretical or illusory. Therefore, in such cases, an effective investigation must be able to lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Orhan Kur v. , no. 32577/02, \u00a7\u00a046, 3 June 2008).",

Firstly, the Court reaffirms that evidence obtained during forensic examinations plays a crucial role during investigations conducted against detainees and in cases where the latter raise allegations of ill-treatment (see Salmano\u011flu and Polatta\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a015828/03, \u00a7 79, 17 March 2009). In this connection, the Court cannot but note that all these medical reports submitted to the Court lack detail and fall significantly short of both the standards recommended by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), which are regularly taken into account by the Court in its examination of cases concerning ill-treatment (see, inter alia, Akko\u00e7 v. Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X), and the guidelines set out in the Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, \u201cthe Istanbul Protocol\u201d, submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (see Bat\u0131 and Others, \u00a7\u00a0100, cited above). The Court recalls the CPT\u2019s standard that all medical examinations should be conducted out of the hearing, and preferably out of the sight, of police officers. Further, every detained person should be examined on his or her own and the results of that examination, as well as relevant statements by the detainee and the doctor\u2019s conclusions, should be formally recorded by the doctor (see Akko\u00e7, \u00a7 118, cited above, and Mehmet Eren v. Turkey, no. 32347/02, \u00a7 40, 14 October 2008). Moreover, an opinion by medical experts on a possible relationship between physical findings and ill-treatment was found to be a requirement by the Court (see Mehmet Emin Y\u00fcksel v. Turkey, no. 40154/98, \u00a7\u00a029, 20 July 2004). In the instant case, the medical reports were drafted in cursory manner, for example, without any mention as regards size, colour or possible relationship between the physical findings and the applicant\u2019s statements. Moreover, at least on one occasion, the applicant was examined in circumstances where police officers could see the examination room if they wished (see paragraph 19 above), in clear breach of the aforementioned CPT standards.",

There was no serious attempt to elucidate the identities of the persons referred to as Mehmet and Soner by the applicant or the veracity of his claims as regards their respective rank and presence in the police station at the time of the events. Thirdly, the prosecutor failed to secure the testimonies of the other police officers on duty that day, those that accompanied the applicant to the medical examinations as well as those of potential eye-witnesses, such as the persons arrested together with the applicant or others present at the police station on the day of the events. In the absence of conclusive medical evidence in the case file, these testimonies would have provided, in the Court\u2019s opinion, important information capable of casting light on the origins of the injuries noted on the applicant\u2019s medical reports dated 27 July 2004 and of proving or disproving the applicant\u2019s allegations.",
