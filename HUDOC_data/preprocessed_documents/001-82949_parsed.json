In particular, the Court held that \u201cthe quashing of the judgment, which did not respect the principle of legal certainty and the applicant's 'right to a court', cannot be accepted as a reason to justify the non-enforcement of the judgment\u201d (see Sukhobokov, cited above, \u00a7 26, and Velskaya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 19-21).",

The Government did not advance any other justification for the failure to enforce the judgments of 20\u00a0October and 26 November 1999, as upheld on 26\u00a0January 2000.
