They could certainly continue to await the compensation designated initially, such as the two flats in the applicants\u2019 case. In addition, they could seek to replace it with monetary compensation relying on section\u00a09(1), or they could apply to have the expropriation quashed under section 9(2). What is important in the Court\u2019s view is that each of these avenues was intended to provide an asset equivalent in value to the value of the expropriated property and satisfy fully the expropriated owners. Neither the Territorial and Urban Planning Act 1973 nor the Territorial Planning Act 2001 envisaged or regulated a situation where no such equivalent asset would be provided in exchange for part of the expropriated property. Thus, in the present case, the introduction of sections 9(1) and 9(2) of the Territorial Planning Act created alternative venues for the completion of the expropriation procedure, but did not, in principle, change the nature of the applicants\u2019 legitimate expectation, namely to receive full compensation for their expropriated property.",

This decision on their part seems amply justified, in view of the lack of any evidence that throughout the years the Kazanlak municipality ever took any steps to fulfil its obligation to construct and deliver such flats. Faced with the municipality\u2019s passivity, which, in itself, could have raised an issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Kirilova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 106-124, and Antonovi v. Bulgaria, no. 20827/02, \u00a7\u00a7 28-31, 1 October 2009), the applicants made use of a remedy aimed at putting an end to the deadlock situation \u2013 they sought the quashing of the expropriation under section 9(2). The Court has already noted that, in a similar situation where it was clear that the compensation initially due would never be provided, the applicants had had to use the other remedies aimed at completing the expropriation procedure (see Petrovi v. Bulgaria [Committee], no.\u00a026759/12, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a025-29, 2\u00a0February 2017).",

It is also significant that the applicants\u2019 entitlement to obtain the quashing of the expropriation of their property, under section 9(2), was confirmed by the Administrative Court, which allowed their request in that regard (see paragraph 13 above).",

On the contrary, as noted already, all means of completing pending expropriation procedures were meant to ensure the provision of such equivalent assets, be it compensation in the form of other property, or monetary compensation, or revocation of the expropriation and return of the expropriated property. Consequently, there could be doubt as to whether the deprivation of the applicants of their \u201cpossessions\u201d was in accordance with the requirements of domestic law, and thus whether it was \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of the analysis under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see also Parvanov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44-50, where the Court also found, in a similar situation, a breach of the requirement of lawfulness).
