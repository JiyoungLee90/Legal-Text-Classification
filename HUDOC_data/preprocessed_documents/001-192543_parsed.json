Further, albeit indirect, evidence of that is the information that flogging sentences are commonly imposed and carried out in Iran in respect of a broad range of offences, and that the Iranian authorities regard them as a legitimate form of punishment (see paragraphs 43, 44, 45, 46 and\u00a047 above).",
