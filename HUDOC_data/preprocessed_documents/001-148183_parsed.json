It had been established in the course of the domestic inquiry that the guards of the temporary detention centre had shirked their responsibility to exercise surveillance over Mr Timin and monitor him. The guards and other inmates had witnessed his erratic behaviour; however, nothing had been done by the authorities to alleviate his condition.

In other words, she complained that the State had failed to comply with its positive obligation to take measures to protect an individual whose life was at risk. Accordingly, the complaint falls directly within the ambit of Article\u00a02 of the Convention (compare Tarariyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a04353/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a073-103, ECHR 2006XV).

The paramedics who were summoned twice by the administration of the temporary detention centre to attend to him recommended that he be taken to hospital for further examination and treatment. While the administration complied with the first recommendation and Mr Timin, albeit with a delay, was taken to hospital where he was consulted by a drugs counsellor and received treatment, the second recommendation was not followed.
