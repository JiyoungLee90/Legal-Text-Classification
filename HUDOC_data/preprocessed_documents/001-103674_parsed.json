The Government did not offer any justification for their failure to submit specific documents that could have allowed the Court to establish the exact number of detainees in the applicant's cells during the period under consideration. The only pertinent elements they produced were the certificates drafted by the prison director in 2009, according to which the cells accommodated up to three detainees, including the applicant. Whereas it is impossible to determine the specific periods of overcrowding, owing to the lack of prison records to which only the Government have access, it is clear that three detainees in an eight-square metre cell were afforded less than three square metres of floor space per person. Besides, the fact of overcrowding was further confirmed in February 2009 by the  prosecutor in his reply to the applicant's complaint of December 2008 (see paragraph 30 above).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, \u00a7 50). On this last point, the Court stresses that, where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Khudoyorov v. , no.\u00a06847/02, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2005...

Upon request of the investigator, the City Court granted an extension until 4 October 2008 for the purpose of studying the case file. It relied on Article 109 \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Subsequently, further extensions for the same purpose and by reference to the same legal provision were granted by the City Court on 1 October and 3 December 2008, 3 February, 1 and 28\u00a0April 2009. The parties disagreed on whether such repeated extensions were permitted under the applicable provisions of the domestic law. The Court has already examined a similar situation in the Korchuganova v.\u00a0Russia case, in which it had regard to the interpretation given by the Russian Constitutional Court of the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u00a7 51, case cited above). The Court noted that, according to the Constitutional Court's binding clarifications of 13 June 1996 and 25 December 1998 (cited in paragraphs 41 and 42 above), in the absence of an express legal provision for repeated extensions of detention on the ground that the defendant has not finished studying the file, the granting of such repeated applications for extension of the defendant's detention was not permitted by law and incompatible with the guarantee against arbitrary detention. The restrictive interpretation adopted by the Constitutional Court is consonant with the requirements of Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see, among others, Sherstobitov v. , no.\u00a016266/03, \u00a7 113, 10 June 2010; Shukhardin v. , no. 65734/01, \u00a7\u00a067, 28 June 2007; Nakhmanovich v.

It did not, however, give any grounds for maintaining the custodial measure or fix a time-limit for the extended detention. This situation has been examined in many cases against Russia in which the Court found that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time was incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1. Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Avdeyev and Veryayev v. Russia, no. 2737/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, 9 July 2009; Bakhmutskiy v. Russia, no. 36932/02, \u00a7\u00a7 112-114, 25 June 2009; Gubkin v.

The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. It considers that the decision of 14 May 2009 did not comply with the requirements of clarity, foreseeability and protection from arbitrariness and that the ensuing period of the applicant's detention was not \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1.",
