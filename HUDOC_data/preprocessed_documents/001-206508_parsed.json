It appears that before the dispute arose, the plot of land at issue had been a green zone which had already included 335 trees (see paragraph 8 above). Environmental considerations were clearly behind the decision of Kyiv City Council to reclassify the plot of land as a public garden zone. The Court has stated that protection of the environment is an increasingly important consideration in today\u2019s society (see O\u2019Sullivan McCarthy Mussel Development Ltd v.

In so determining, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard to the means to be employed and to the question of whether the consequences are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the objective pursued (see G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others v. Italy [GC], nos. 1828/06 and\u00a02\u00a0others, \u00a7 293, 28 June 2018).",

The decision to reclassify the plot of land as a public garden zone might have been an important measure to comply with public opinion as regards the fate of the land. However it was hardly compatible with the authorities\u2019 obligations under the lease contract and the domestic-law requirement prescribing that the lessor must not prevent the lessee from using the plot of land (see paragraph 27 above). The impugned measure of Kyiv City Council thus frustrated the applicant\u2019s company legitimate expectation for legal certainty based on the idea of sanctity of contracts and explicit rule of domestic law. The Court has stated earlier that uncertainty \u2013 be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities \u2013 is a serious source of concern when assessing the State\u2019s conduct under Article 1 of Protocol 1 (see Broniowski v.

The applicant company clearly set out the factual and legal basis for its claim for damages and made out a principal argument that in taking the impugned measure, Kyiv City Council had failed to honour the obligations of the lessor with the effect that the construction work could not be carried out lawfully. In other words, the claim for damages was essentially based on the allegation that the effective use of the plot of land had been thwarted by Kyiv City Council, despite the valid lease contract. The courts did not address this pertinent and important argument, focusing their analysis on the finding that the lease contract had remained valid and binding. The absence of a response to this key argument on the part of the courts discloses in itself a serious issue in terms of protection against arbitrariness and manifest unreasonableness (see, mutatis mutandis, Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2007I). Nor did the domestic courts carry out any balancing exercise to assess the public and private interests at stake and the conduct of the parties in order to strike a fair balance in the case (see\u00a0Megadat.com SRL v. Moldova, no.\u00a021151/04, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2008). The Court notes in this context that domestic law provided a sufficient framework enabling the courts to make the assessment of the alleged damages, taking into account the relevant facts, including the comportment of the party claiming damages (see paragraph 25 above). In the present case, however, absent any reasoning by the courts on those issues, it must be concluded that the judicial review of the dispute did not constitute a meaningful procedural guarantee for the purpose of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",
