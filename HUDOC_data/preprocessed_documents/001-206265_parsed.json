The Court further points out that the adverse effects of environmental pollution must attain a certain minimum level if they are to fall within the scope of Article\u00a08. The assessment of that minimum is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects (see Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a068-9, ECHR 2005-IV (with further references), and Olui\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a061260/08, \u00a7 49, 20 May 2010).

In this regard, the Court notes that, with particular regard to the noise in his flat, the applicant has not submitted any direct evidence to show that it exceeded acceptable levels or that any relevant measurements were carried out. However, the Court takes note of the inspection report issued by the State-controlled consumer protection agency on 20 February 2006 attesting to the applicant\u2019s complaints. Its conclusions indicate the State authorities\u2019 failure to comply with applicable domestic regulations on noise specifically, and on other nuisances generally, such as unregulated garbage deposits and the poor sanitary state of the premises (see paragraph 19 above). The fact that this report was drafted in 2006 is not decisive for the present analysis because it only highlighted and formalised further the nuisances about which the applicant had consistently been notifying the authorities since 1996 in his complaints to various bodies. It affirmed the allegations made by him in 2000, and the Government did not show that the nuisances arose only in 2006. Furthermore, the Kostomuksha City Court of the Republic of Kareliya, having heard the applicant and the witnesses, determined that the applicant\u2019s right to peaceful rest had been breached by the activities of the police station and the noise emanating from the detention cells. It follows from the case file that the State authorities themselves admitted that the police station had been located in a building which was not designated for housing it (see paragraph 4 above). The efforts of the authorities in enforcing the judgment focused on finding a suitable place for relocation of the police station, yet no tangible steps were taken to remedy the situation which lasted for more than ten years for the applicant. Lastly, even though it does not appear from the case material that the applicant\u2019s health was endangered at the relevant time, the Court nevertheless considers, on the basis of the applicant\u2019s submissions and material in the case file, that over the course of thirteen years the applicant suffered during day and night time from activities of the police station and the poor sanitary maintenance of its premises. Accordingly, considering this evidence, the Court finds that the disturbance, resulting from housing of the police station in the residential building, the unlawfulness of which was admitted by the local police department (see paragraph 4 above) and which continued over a number of years, had a compound and lasting effect on the applicant\u2019s private life and enjoyment of his home.",

Russia [GC], no. 21272/03, \u00a7\u00a067, 2 November 2010, and Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a0180, ECHR 2006\u2011V (with further references)). The Court notes that in the present case, even though the domestic court expressly acknowledged the violation of the applicant\u2019s rights, he did not receive any redress. The applicant\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damage was refused by the domestic court, and the Government have not shown that the applicant had received any other compensation. Nor does the Court agree with the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant had ceased to be a victim of the alleged violation because he had sold his flat. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s victim status in the present case can be compared to that of the applicant in the case of L\u00f3pez Ostra, cited above (\u00a7\u00a7 41-2), in which the Court held that someone who had been forced by adverse environmental conditions to abandon her home and subsequently to buy another house did not cease to be a victim.

Referring to the cases of Osman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 23452/94, 28\u00a0October\u00a01998, \u00a7 116, ECHR 1998-VIII and Hatton and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, the Government argued that they had to be allowed a wide margin of appreciation in making its operational choices in terms of priorities and available resources. Therefore, the relocation of the police station was not possible until all the financial and organisational matters had been resolved \u201cin accordance with domestic legislation\u201d and in a manner \u201cwhich [the Government] consider[ed] most acceptable\u201d.",

The State authorities enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to solve this problem and to strike the required balance between the competing interests of the public and the applicant and, in any case, they were better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions (see Hatton and Others, cited above, \u00a7 98 and \u00a7 97, respectively). However, the Court considers that the measures ordered by the domestic authorities in the present case were either insufficient, not having been applied in a timely and effective manner, or not taken at all.",

Furthermore, it appears that the authorities failed to react in any way to a collective complaint brought by the applicant and his neighbours in May 2000 (see paragraph 5 above).",

However, the Court considers that the State authorities took a formalistic approach to interpreting the operative part of that judgment (see paragraphs 16, 18 and 51 above), thereby causing significant delays in the enforcement proceedings, which only prolonged the applicant\u2019s suffering from the noise and other nuisances (see, for similar reasoning, Cuenca Zarzoso v. Spain, no. 23383/12, \u00a7\u00a7 50-1, 16 January 2018, and Moreno G\u00f3mez v. Spain, no. 4143/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2004X). In this regard, the Court is mindful of the difficulties and time delays which are typically encountered by the authorities in finding and allocating relevant resources and securing the necessary funding for public projects such as the one in the present case. However, in the applicant\u2019s case it took the authorities almost seven years from the day on which the judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour was issued merely to approve the project and the corresponding budget for the construction of a new police station (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above). The Court has not received any information on the reasons for that delay, on whether any inter-agency work and negotiations were carried out in this respect in the meantime or whether any temporary solution (that is to say the temporary relocation of the police station or temporary municipal housing for the applicant) could have been proposed pending the final resolution of the problem. In the Court\u2019s view, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation from the Government, that process took an unconscionably long time, which rendered the measures taken by the State authorities ineffective and incapable of effectively protecting the applicant\u2019s rights.",

Even if the Government are correct in stating that the placement of the police station in the basement of the applicant\u2019s residential building was lawful at the time of its construction (pursuant to the building regulations of 1971), and assuming that that arrangement was indeed in accordance with the applicable regulations, in 2006 the State authorities were made aware by one of their own organs (regional consumer protection agency) that they were in violation of the sanitary norms and regulations applicable at the time (see paragraph 19 above); yet no real action was taken in order to reduce the nuisances from which the applicant suffered, and the process of relocation of the police station mandated by the Kostomuksha City Court of the Republic of Kareliya as a solution was unduly protracted until 2008. This situation continued for thirteen years in respect of the applicant and resulted in the applicant\u2019s having considered himself obliged to sell his flat in 2008 and move to another flat which he had bought with his own finances.",
