The competent court thus has to examine not only compliance with the procedural requirements set out in domestic law but also the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention (see Sch\u00f6ps v. Germany, no.\u00a025116/94, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2001I).",

Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, \u00a7 36). It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an ongoing investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial (see Sch\u00f6ps v. Germany, cited above, idem). A court examining an appeal against detention must thus provide guarantees of a judicial procedure. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the parties, the prosecutor and the detained person (see Nikolova v.  [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7\u00a058, ECHR\u00a01999II.",
