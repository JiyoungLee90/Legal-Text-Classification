While it is true that from the critical date onwards all of the State\u2019s acts and omissions must conform to the Convention, the Convention imposes no specific obligation on the Contracting States to provide redress for wrongs or damage caused prior to that date. Thus, in order to establish the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction it is essential to identify, in each specific case, the exact time of the alleged interference. In doing so, the Court must take into account both the facts of which the applicant complains and the scope of the Convention right alleged to have been violated (see Janowiec and Others v.\u00a0Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, \u00a7\u00a7 128-30, 21 October 2013, with further references).",

That period falls outside the Court\u2019s temporal competence in respect of Russia. However, the thrust of the applicant\u2019s complaint is that the confession statement given during that period was used for his conviction. Both the first-instance judgment of 15 January 2001 and the appeal judgment of 18\u00a0October 2006 which determined the merits of the applicant\u2019s criminal case were taken after the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Russia on 5 May 1998. Both judgments relied on the applicant\u2019s confession statement of 2\u00a0May 1997. The Court reiterates in that connection that compliance with the requirements of a fair trial must be examined in each case having regard to the development of the proceedings as a whole and not on the basis of the isolated consideration of one particular aspect or one particular incident (see, among other authorities, Moiseyev v. Russia, no.\u00a062936/00, \u00a7\u00a0201, 9\u00a0October 2008). It follows that the Court is competent to check whether the proceedings as a whole complied with the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Klimentyev v.

This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. Accordingly, in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first questioning of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict that right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction - whatever its justification - must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will, in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 50-55, ECHR 2008, and Panovits v. Cyprus, no. 4268/04, \u00a7\u00a7 64-66 and 83, 11\u00a0December 2008).",

Given that the applicant was questioned before his arrest record was read out to him, his request for legal assistance was denied. As a result, he did not have the benefit of legal advice when he made his confession statement to the police.",

The Court has previously found that a systematic restriction of the right of access to legal assistance, on the basis of statutory provisions, is sufficient in itself for a violation of Article 6 to be found (see Dayanan v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 7377/03, \u00a7 33, 13 October 2009). Moreover, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that that provision was subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Russian Constitutional Court (see paragraph 16 above).",
