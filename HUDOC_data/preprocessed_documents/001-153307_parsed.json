The Court considers that, taken as a whole, the applicant\u2019s speech does not encourage violence, armed resistance or an uprising (see, Gerger v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a024919/94, \u00a7\u00a050, 8 July 1999, and contrast Halis Do\u011fan v. Turkey, no. 75946/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03538, 7 February 2006). Moreover, the speeches in question delivered by the applicants were not capable of inciting violence by instilling a deepseated and irrational hatred against identifiable persons (S\u00fcrek v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, \u00a7 62, ECHR 1999IV) and therefore did not constitute hate speech.",

The Court, however, notes that it was not indicated in the reasoning of the domestic courts\u2019 judgments whether they had examined the proportionality of the interference and the balancing of rights taking into account freedom of expression. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the reasons given by the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court for convicting and sentencing the applicants cannot be considered relevant and sufficient to justify the interference with their right to freedom of expression. The Court concludes that the applicants\u2019 conviction was disproportionate to the aims pursued within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 10 of the Convention and therefore not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
