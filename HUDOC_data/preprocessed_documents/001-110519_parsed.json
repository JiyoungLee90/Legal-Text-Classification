In this respect the Court reiterates that, although the right to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence cannot be asserted independently (see Perez v. France [GC], no. 47287/99, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2004I), the Court has stated on a number of occasions that an effective judicial system, as required by Article 2, may, and under certain circumstances must, include recourse to the criminal law. However, if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case (see Fedina v. Ukraine, no. 17185/02, \u00a7 62, 2 September 2010, with further references). In the circumstances of the present case, even if the applicant could have recourse to a civil remedy, which was not dependent on the outcome of any criminal investigation, any relevant findings in the criminal proceedings would have influenced the outcome of the civil proceedings and the amount of compensation, which could be different depending on finding of a guilt of Mr B. Therefore, the Government\u2019s objection in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 2 \u00a7 1 of the Convention must be rejected.",

Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7 58, 15\u00a0October 2009). The Court notes that both remedies served the same purpose and were equally available to the applicant. The Government did not demonstrate that in the circumstances of the present case that separate civil proceedings would a priori have been a more effective remedy than the examination of a civil claim within the criminal proceedings. The Court therefore also dismisses this objection of the Government in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

It notes that despite the substantial number of investigative measures taken, the investigation was criticised by the national authorities themselves for a lack of efficiency (see paragraph 15 above). Furthermore, the criminal proceedings in question were marked by numerous changes of investigator and an unusually high number of repeated expert examinations. It could be accepted that in certain circumstances a repeated expert examination might be required to clarify the circumstances of the case. At the same time, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the fact that the same type of forensic examination was ordered several times (see paragraphs 11, 14, 18, 22 and 27 above) within the same criminal case suggests the lack of a comprehensive approach to the collection of evidence during the pre-trial investigation phase. The Court considers that a delay of seven years in bringing to accountability the person responsible for the death of the applicant\u2019s son was incompatible with the State\u2019s obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation of suspicious deaths.",

                        "content": "The Court has constantly widened the scope of applicability of Article 2 of the Convention. The procedural obligation under Article 2 has been applied not only in cases where the State could be held responsible for a person\u2019s death, but also where private persons were responsible (see Anna Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, \u00a7 72, 24 May 2011, and \u0160ilih v. Slovenia ([GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7\u00a0192, 9 April 2009). This approach has been applied in respect of deaths resulting from medical negligence (see \u0160ilih, cited above) and also in respect of fatal road-traffic accidents (see Rajkowska v. Poland (dec.), no. 37393/02, 27\u00a0November 2007). However, up to now the Court has found a violation of the procedural limb of Article 2 only where the investigation was not only long and ineffective, but also, as a consequence of the length and of the lack of diligence, the perpetrator could either not be identified or his or her responsibility could not be proven, so that ultimately the victim was deprived of any redress (see Anna Todorova, cited above; \u0160ilih, cited above; and Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dek and Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 v. Slovakia, no. 30754/04, 28 July 2009, which became final on 28 October 2009). Contrary to the approach taken in the present case, delays in the investigation have up to now been considered as a violation of Article 6 alone (see Fedina v. , no. 17185/02, 2 September 2010). Consequently, in Rajkowska v. Poland, cited above, the Court did not find a violation because the driver responsible for the accident was ultimately convicted of the offence and sentenced.",

                        "content": "The present case is the first case in which the Court has found a violation of Article 2 despite the fact that the perpetrator was identified and punished and compensation was paid. It is true that the victim had to wait seven years before that result was achieved. This, however, is a problem of inefficiency in long civil and criminal proceedings, which is covered by Article 6 of the Convention. I do not therefore see any need for a further widening of the scope of applicability of Article 2. There is no lacuna to be filled. This departure from settled case-law does not improve the protection of victims, but rather mitigates the stigmatizing effect which the finding of a violation of Article 2 should have. Article 2 ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions of the Convention (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7 147, Series A no. 324). Therefore it matters whether a State is reproached for having violated Article 2 or Article 6. Delays in investigating a road accident cannot be equated with an intentional killing by State agents. In my view, this departure from the caselaw blurs the nuanced approach to different types of human rights violations enshrined in the Convention.",
