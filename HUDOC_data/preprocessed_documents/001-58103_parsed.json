Unlike an accused, a witness was obliged, on pain of the penalties provided in Article\u00a0109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to take an oath to tell the truth and to answer the questions put to him. It was therefore precisely in order to avoid the risk of self-incrimination that he had refused to take the oath and give evidence. He added that, even though it was not mentioned in the records of his interviews, he had explained to the investigating judge that his refusal was based on Article\u00a0105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which precluded his being heard as a witness. In any event, it could not be disputed that he had given that explanation to the appellate court.",

Accordingly, Mr Serves could not avoid his obligation in law to take the oath and give evidence. On the other hand, after answering questions and if he had been charged, he could, if appropriate, have relied on Article\u00a0105 before the appellate court and obtained a declaration that his deposition was void. In addition, there was no connection between the events in issue and the applicant\u2019s being charged for a second time at a much later date (May\u00a01992); that charge was brought solely because of the progress of the investigation and, in particular, the fact that new evidence against him had come to light.

In the circumstances of the case, however, we consider that the applicant must in fact have felt that he would be forced to give evidence once he took the oath. In our view, this was not so much \u201ca degree of coercion\u201d (see paragraph 47 of the judgment) as \u201cdefinite coercion\u201d. The Court has held on several occasions that the right of any person charged to remain silent and not to incriminate himself lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 of the Convention. That right is at stake in the present case. By insisting on the applicant\u2019s obligation to take the oath, without giving him an opportunity to explain the reasons for his refusal, the investigating judge put him in the position prohibited by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. He must in reality have felt forced to give evidence that could incriminate him. It is of little consequence, in the circumstances of the case before us, whether he was under that obligation as a person charged or as a witness.",
