In answering this question the court began by noting that the reason for the non-renewal had been the article in a regional newspaper, regarded as causing a scandal according to the arguments of the Diocese of Cartagena in its official memorandum of 11\u00a0November 1997. On this point, the court took the view that the duty of neutrality precluded it from ruling on the notion of \u201cscandal\u201d invoked by the Diocese or on the merits of the \u201coptional celibacy of priests\u201d advocated by the applicant. It further observed that the judgment of the High Court of Justice provided for judicial review of the Bishop\u2019s decision, in particular concerning his inability to propose candidates who did not have the requisite professional qualifications for the post and the obligation to ensure respect for fundamental rights and civil liberties.",

The Government referred on this point to the Court\u2019s analysis in Siebenhaar v. Germany (no. 18136/02, \u00a7\u00a040, 3 February 2011). In any event, they observed that in the cases of Obst v.

Germany (no. 1620/03, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2010) the Court had examined the positive obligations of the German authorities under Article\u00a08 in relation to the rights secured to churches by Articles\u00a09 and 11 of the Convention. Accordingly, they contended that, if the Court were to examine the present case under Article\u00a08 of the Convention, the arguments to the effect that there had been no violation of Article\u00a09 could also be relevant as regards the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life.",

It has thus reiterated that \u201cprivate life\u201d is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition (see Sch\u00fcth, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053, and Sidabras and D\u017eiautas v.\u00a0Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2004VIII). Article\u00a08 of the Convention protects the right to self-fulfilment (see K.A. and A.D. v. Belgium, no. 42758/98 and 45558/99, \u00a7 83, 17 February 2005), whether in the form of personal development (see Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2002VI) or from the standpoint of personal autonomy, which is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantees of Article 8 (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2002III). Whilst the Court recognises that everyone is entitled to live privately, away from unwanted attention (see Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2003IX), it would be too restrictive to limit the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d to an \u201cinner circle\u201d in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 251B). Article 8 thus guarantees \u201cprivate life\u201d in the broad sense of the term, encompassing the right to lead a \u201cprivate social life\u201d, through which an individual can develop his or her social identity. In that respect, the right in question enshrines the possibility of approaching others in order to establish or develop relationships with other human beings (see, to this effect, Campagnano v. Italy, no. 77955/01, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2006IV).",

Greece, no. 26713/05, \u00a7\u00a023, 28 May 2009). Restrictions on an individual\u2019s professional life may fall within Article 8 where they have repercussions on the manner in which he or she constructs his or her social identity by developing relationships with others. It should be noted on this point that it is in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have an opportunity of developing relationships with the outside world (see Niemietz, cited above, \u00a7 29). In addition, professional life often overlaps with private life, in the strict sense of the term, such that it is not always easy to distinguish clearly in what capacity an individual is acting at a given moment of time. In sum, professional life is part of the zone of interaction between a person and others which, even in a public context, may fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d (see M\u00f3\u0142ka v.

That right was closely linked to the right of parents to ensure that their children were taught religion and ethics in line with their own beliefs. The Government observed that the State could nevertheless intervene in such decisions when they infringed the constitutional public order or impaired the essence of the rights recognised in the Convention. They asserted that this scrutiny was not a mere formality and referred in this connection to Constitutional Court judgment no.\u00a038/2007 in which this system was described as a mechanism of cooperation between the State and the various faiths pursuant to the agreements that they had signed. The said judgment had emphasised that it was exclusively for the church authorities to issue the declaration of suitability in respect of candidates. The Government endorsed the reasoning of the  in the present case and took the view that it would not be reasonable, when proposing candidates who had freely applied for religious education teaching posts, to refrain from taking account of their religious beliefs. In their submission, this in itself constituted a guarantee of the right to freedom of religion.

In the Government\u2019s opinion, the State\u2019s duty of neutrality at the time of the proposal should also apply where the Church, in accordance with criteria of a strictly religious nature, decided, as in the present case, not to renew a person\u2019s contract for the following school year.",

Indeed, the teacher\u2019s personal example constituted an essential component of his or her beliefs and was a primary consideration in terms of suitability for teaching. The Government emphasised in this connection that there was a bond of trust between the Bishop and the proposed candidate, but that this did not exclude per se a review by the courts of the church authority\u2019s decision or the balancing of competing fundamental rights.

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In particular, in both instances regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the general interest and the interests of the individual; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76, ECHR 2007I; Rommelfanger v.

Accordingly, the Court, by examining how the Spanish courts balanced the applicant\u2019s right with the rights of the Catholic Church under Articles 9 and 11, will have to assess whether or not a sufficient degree of protection was provided to the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Sch\u00fcth, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057).",

The autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 affords. The Court further reiterates that, but for very exceptional cases, the right to freedom of religion as guaranteed under the Convention excludes any discretion on the part of the State to determine whether religious beliefs or the means used to express such beliefs are legitimate (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 78). Moreover, the principle of religious autonomy prevents the State from obliging a religious community to admit or exclude an individual or to entrust someone with a particular religious duty (see, mutatis mutandis, Svyato-Mykhaylivska Parafiya v. Ukraine, no. 77703/01, \u00a7 146, 14 June 2007). Lastly, where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions are at stake, on which opinion in a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, the role of the national decision-making body must be given special importance (see Leyla \u015eahin v.

The Bishop was required to refrain from proposing candidates who did not have the requisite professional qualifications for the post and to respect fundamental rights and civil liberties. The judgment further observed that the definition of the religious or moral criteria underlying the non-renewal was the exclusive prerogative of the religious authorities.

The decision was taken after the publication of an article in the newspaper La Verdad in which the applicant was shown with his wife and five children and which reported certain comments by members of the Movement for Optional Celibacy, including the applicant, described as the former rector of a seminary. In particular, the persons interviewed stated that they were in favour of the optional celibacy of priests and also criticised the Church\u2019s position on a number of subjects, such as abortion, divorce, sexuality or contraception.

It is therefore not unreasonable to impose a heightened duty of loyalty on religious education teachers.

In the present case, the applicant must have or should have been aware, on signing his contract of employment, of the particularities of the employment relationship for that type of post and of the Bishop\u2019s right to decide whether or not to propose candidates, in accordance with Canon 805 of the Code of Canon Law (see under \u201cdomestic law\u201d, paragraph 42 above, and compare, mutatis mutandis, Ahtinen v.\u00a0Finland, no. 48907/99, \u00a7 41, 23\u00a0September 2008), especially as at the time when the applicant began to teach he had not yet received the dispensation from the Vatican and was thus a \u201cmarried priest\u201d in the eyes of the Catholic Church.

It notes in this connection that the applicant did not hide from the press, but that he was among the few members of the \u201cMovement\u201d who remained at the gathering even after realising that the media were present, and that those interviewed openly expressed their disagreement with the Church\u2019s policies in various matters (contrast Sch\u00fcth, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072).",

Whilst that difference certainly obtains, I consider that there is an even more important one: in the present case, the non-renewal decision was taken by the public authority responsible for education and not by the church authority. Admittedly, it was adopted on the proposal of the diocese, but not actually by the latter. This point is a new one \u2013 and in that respect the present case also differs from Lombardi Vallauri v. Italy (no.\u00a039128/05, 20 October 2009) \u2013 and it is a point which, in my view, the Court has not sufficiently taken into account, seeming on the contrary to disregard it when, in paragraph 87 of the judgment, it implicitly alludes to the diocese in the following terms: \u201can employer whose ethos is based on religion ...\u201d.

The term \u201cpublicity\u201d refers here to the article illustrated by a photograph published in a newspaper. In the diocese\u2019s view, this article had caused a scandal. Like the Murcia High Court of Justice and the Constitutional Court, this Court has accepted the argument about the scandal, the justification for which is said to lie in the application of the Code of Canon Law, and which is seen as encapsulating the breach of the undeniable special duty of loyalty of such teachers of religion. By reasoning in this manner, it seems to me that the Court is disregarding, or at least insufficiently focusing on, the context or actual circumstances of the relationship between the applicant and the Church. The Court has ultimately acted in the same way as the domestic courts, placing the emphasis on the religious basis for the non-renewal of the contract, without giving weight, in the present case, to the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life.",

None of these factors, known as they were to the church authority responsible for the proposal, had constituted an obstacle to his appointment or had been regarded as potentially scandalous. The facts as established in the judgment of the Murcia Employment Tribunal no.\u00a03 show that the administration of the two centres where the applicant taught, along with the other teachers, the pupils and their parents, all knew that he was a married priest \u201cwithout any complaints having been made\u201d about the matter. At no point was it suggested that the applicant was proselytising or had in his classes criticised the tenets of his Church, including the celibacy of priests.

It was already known to the applicant\u2019s professional circle before the publication of the article. It is in this context that, in my opinion, one cannot invoke the notion of \u201cscandal\u201d, based on the application of canon law and justifying the non-renewal of the contract solely by the official document granting the applicant dispensation from celibacy. Such a justification would have been possible if the Church or the applicant\u2019s professional circle had been unaware of his personal and family situation before the publication of the article. However, it is established that this information was already known to the diocese, the other teachers, the parents and the pupils. It is also appropriate to consider why the scandal did not emerge between 11\u00a0November 1996, when the article was published, and 29 September 1997, when the diocese proposed the non-renewal, almost eleven months later.",

In reality, the Court has not weighed those principles against the applicant\u2019s rights, because that would have obliged it to explain why his public situation as married priest and father, being known to the diocese, suddenly became a ground for finding that he was unfit to teach. The failure to carry out this balancing exercise implies that the Court accepts, like the diocese, that the publicising of the applicant\u2019s personal situation was a sufficient reason for turning a teacher who was once fit to teach into someone who was no longer capable of doing so, without there being any need to justify the scandal argument to the education authority, which had sole competence to appoint the teacher and pay him a salary. Such a position was in fact at odds with the note previously sent to the Bishop of Murcia by the director of the secondary education institute where the applicant was teaching, stating as follows: \u201cThe council of teachers ... wishes to declare ... that the above-mentioned teacher gave his classes during the school year 1996/1997 to the complete satisfaction of the teachers, the pupils and their parents, and the administration of this institution ...\u201d (facts found established in the judgment of the Murcia Employment Tribunal no. 3).",

The consequences for the applicant\u2019s professional life have been evident: for the six years that remained until his retirement at the time he lost his teaching job, he has either been unemployed or has been working in a museum \u2013 situations that are very different from the professional activity that he had exercised throughout his life, always within the Catholic Church, as priest in Latin America, Rector of the Seminary of Murcia, Episcopal Vicar and, finally, teacher of religious education.",
