The reason for that was a change in circumstances \u2013 there had been an incident on 5\u00a0October 2009 in which two people had been shot (see paragraphs\u00a016 and 17 below), and State protection had been instituted in respect of both the applicant and her daughter. When upholding the temporary protective measure as set out earlier, the Regional Court highlighted the principle that priority had to be given to the interests of the child. It relied on Article 3.3 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Civil Code and Article 4 \u00a7 1 (1) of the Law on the Fundamentals of Protection of Children\u2019s Rights (see paragraphs\u00a077 and 79 below). The Regional Court also considered that the District Court had properly assessed the situation, having taken into account the opinion of the Kaunas childcare authorities, which had been the institution providing a conclusion in the case.

That said, it was not possible to ascertain whether the girl\u2019s experience had been direct, that is, whether the acts of sexual molestation had been performed on her, or whether that experience had been indirect, that is, whether she had watched the sexual acts of others, seen pornographic films, or heard adult conversations and questions on the topic.

The psychologist also addressed, as a separate matter, the video material provided by D.K. with the girl\u2019s accounts of sexual abuse. The psychologist pointed out that the very clear and specific description of A.\u016a. provided by the girl in the video-recordings, that her father had given to the authorities, had differed from how she had described him in her interview with the authorities of 17\u00a0December 2008.

For children of her age, recognition and positive evaluation by adults, especially those who were important to them and had authority, was important. Accordingly, in order to please, children would adjust their statements and answer as asked.",

It ruled that the girl should reside with her mother. A counterclaim by N.V. that the girl should stay with her was dismissed. The court ruled out that there would be any danger for the girl if she was returned to her mother.

It followed that it was necessary to reunite the applicant with her daughter as soon as possible. In that context the District Court also held that accusations which N.V. had flaunted against the applicant \u2013 that she had assisted in her daughter\u2019s molestation \u2013 had been nothing more than a continuation of D.K.\u2019s earlier efforts to have residence and to completely prohibit the mother from seeing her daughter.",

Even so, that was not sufficient to limit the applicant\u2019s parental rights towards the child. On this point the District Court relied on the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that in such cases the child\u2019s best interests were of paramount concern. This had two aspects: on the one hand, it was necessary to ensure that the child grew in a safe environment, and that in no circumstances could a mother have recourse to measures which could harm the child\u2019s health and development (the court relied on Johansen v. Norway, 7\u00a0August 1996, \u00a7\u00a078, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). On the other hand, it was also obvious that the best interests of the child were to grow with his family, unless it was proven that the family was inappropriate, because to do otherwise would mean separating the child from his roots. Moreover, even though the national authorities had wide discretion when deciding whether to give the child to his or her biological parents, the family connection could be restricted only in \u201cparticularly special circumstances\u201d and everything had to be done in order to safeguard the personal connection and, if and when possible, \u201crestore the family\u201d (the court cited Amanalachioai v.

One of the fundamental principles is that all children have a right to be consulted and heard in proceedings involving or affecting them. The best interests of the children are a primary consideration for the Member States. The Guidelines also provide that children should be treated with care and sensitivity throughout any procedure or case, with special attention for their personal situation, well-being and specific needs, and with full respect for their physical and psychological integrity. This treatment should be given to them, in whichever way they have come into contact with judicial or nonjudicial proceedings or other interventions, and regardless of their legal status and capacity in any procedure or case. Judges should respect the right of children to be heard in all matters that affect them or at least to be heard when they are deemed to have a sufficient understanding of the matters in question. Judgments and court rulings affecting children should be duly reasoned. In all proceedings involving children, the urgency principle should be applied to provide a speedy response and protect the best interests of the child, while respecting the rule of law. In family law cases (for example, custody), courts should exercise exceptional diligence to avoid any risk of adverse consequences on the family relations. When necessary, judicial authorities should consider the possibility of taking provisional decisions. Once the judicial proceedings are over, national authorities should take all necessary steps to facilitate the execution of court decisions involving and affecting children without delay. Lastly, after judgments in highly conflictual proceedings, guidance and support should be offered to children and their families by specialised services (see point nos. 44-48, 50-54, 76 and 79).",

In particular, there had been no justifiable grounds for not implementing a court order regarding the daughter\u2019s return, and the return had taken place only after a delay of five months. The applicant also disputed the Government\u2019s defence that the case had been extraordinary, and that the biggest burden for the execution of the court decision to hand over the girl to her mother had rested on the guardian N.V. and her supporters (see paragraphs\u00a0108 and 109 below). For the applicant, and notwithstanding N.V.\u2019s failure to comply with the bailiff\u2019s demands, the State authorities, especially since they had been aware of the impact the case had had on Lithuanian society and the support that N.V. had among the Lithuanian people, had retained a duty to be prepared for the execution of the court decision. In that context the applicant pointed out that three months after the K\u0117dainiai District Court\u2019s decision, on 22\u00a0March 2012, the court had given permission for the use of force for its execution (see paragraph 60 above), allowing the removal of obstacles hindering the girl being taken from N.V.\u2019s home. After that decision had been issued, it had still taken almost two months for the child to be handed over to the applicant (see paragraph\u00a067 above). The applicant indicated that when the officials had finally been prepared to implement the court order, it had taken them less than an hour to finish the operation, which showed that prior to this the State authorities had been passive. In sum, unjustified reasons  such as outstanding public interest in the case, the ill will of the guardian N.V., and the authorities\u2019 possible fear of taking action  had taken priority over the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her family life.",

Afterwards, on 23\u00a0December 2008 temporary protective measures had been imposed on her in the case concerning the restriction of her parental rights in connection with the suspected molestation of her daughter and the applicant\u2019s alleged involvement therein (see paragraph\u00a011 above). The applicant, for her part, had started civil court proceedings for her daughter\u2019s return only on 23\u00a0December 2009 (see paragraph 30 above). Afterwards, the K\u0117dainiai District Court decision of 16\u00a0December 2011 had created yet another legal situation when the child\u2019s place of residence had been changed.

The course of the criminal proceedings concerning the alleged sexual abuse of the girl and the civil proceedings concerning the restriction of the applicant\u2019s parental rights and residence had been closely observed by the media. A large part of Lithuanian society had been touched by the girl\u2019s story and had expressed their support towards the girl\u2019s temporary guardian in various ways, including spontaneous gatherings of crowds near her house. Speeches, concerts and other events had been organised. The crowds had also declared their discontent with the K\u0117dainiai District Court\u2019s decision of 16\u00a0December 2011, and had objected to its execution. The case had had significant repercussions, and the national authorities had thus been placed in a unique situation when seeking to execute the court\u2019s decision.",

For those reasons, the authorities had first tried to achieve the execution in goodwill, seeking to reduce the inevitable emotional distress for the girl, and it had only been afterwards, when it had become clear that N.V. had had no intention of giving up the girl, that the authorities had applied force in executing the court decision. The Government also pointed out that the Lithuanian institutions which had participated in the execution of the court\u2019s decision had not had prior experience with enforcement in such challenging situations as the one at issue.

This contact order was maintained until the K\u0117dainiai District Court\u2019s decision of 16\u00a0December 2011 (see paragraphs 40 in limine, 44 in limine and 45 above).\u00a0\u00a0The Court thus finds that at no stage of the civil proceedings for her daughter\u2019s return was the applicant prohibited from being in contact with her child (see paragraph\u00a032 above).

Likewise, on the basis of the documents submitted by the parties, the Court considers that the childcare authorities were sufficiently proactive in monitoring the situation and assisting the courts (see paragraphs\u00a012 and 14 in fine above).

It is also clear that on already the same day N.V. took measures, such as taking the girl out of school in order to keep her at home (see paragraphs\u00a046 and 58 above), which made the authorities\u2019 task of reuniting the daughter and the mother more difficult. Notwithstanding this, the Court has had occasion to hold that lack of cooperation between separated parents is not a factor which can by itself exempt the authorities from their positive obligations under Article\u00a08. It rather imposes on the authorities an obligation to take measures to reconcile the conflicting interests of the parties, keeping in mind the paramount interests of the child which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parent (see Diamante and Pelliccioni v. San Marino, no.\u00a032250/08, \u00a7\u00a0176, 27\u00a0September 2011, and the case-law cited therein).

The first attempt to hand over the girl failed because N.V. did not take her to school (see paragraphs\u00a046 and 56 above). The second attempt did not come to fruition because of the calamity at N.V.\u2019s parents\u2019 home, when the bailiff was reluctant to use physical force to pull the child from her grandparents (see paragraph\u00a062 above). The bailiff\u2019s conclusion, which was based on the domestic court\u2019s instruction (see paragraph\u00a060 above) that physical force against the child was not a measure to be used in such situations and that another method of enforcement was necessary to protect the child\u2019s interests, is tantamount to the Court\u2019s position that any obligation to apply coercion to facilitate the reunion of a parent with a child must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, in particular the best interests of the child (see Hokkanen v. Finland, 23\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7\u00a058, Series A no.\u00a0299A). Accordingly, the fact that until 23\u00a0March 2012 the authorities\u2019 efforts foundered does not automatically lead to the conclusion that they failed to comply with their positive obligations under Article\u00a08 of the Convention (see G.B. v. Lithuania, no.\u00a036137/13, \u00a7\u00a093, 19\u00a0January 2016).",

Eventually, the steps undertaken brought positive results and the girl was on 17 May 2012 reunited with the applicant (see paragraph\u00a067 above). As noted by the Government, who have not been contradicted on this point by the applicant, psychological support was provided to the two of them afterwards (see paragraph 111 in fine above).",

(see also paragraph\u00a046 above), the State did not remain a bystander to the situation. The bailiff thus requested that N.V. be fined for ignoring the K\u0117dainiai District Court\u2019s decision, and that request received a serious response in the court, which acknowledged N.V.\u2019s ignorance of the law and gave her a fine which could not be considered insignificant (see paragraph\u00a057 above). She was also found to be at fault for providing the media with information about the girl\u2019s inner emotional state, in breach of the child\u2019s interests (see paragraph 42 above). Likewise, and although the applicant pleaded that the State had taken the public reaction which N.V.\u2019s actions had caused to the applicant and her daughter light-heartedly, the Court is satisfied that a number of actions, including criminal prosecution, were pursued in respect of N.V. (see paragraphs\u00a070-75 above) as well as her relatives (see paragraphs 68 and 69 above), which for the Court shows the State\u2019s serious stance. In the light of these findings the Court also dismisses the Government\u2019s objection that the applicant had not exhausted the domestic remedies in respect of her complaint concerning the State authorities\u2019 actions in the course of the court proceedings for her daughter\u2019s residency (see paragraph\u00a099 above).",

Notwithstanding this, with the authorities\u2019 assistance, and at least until the unsuccessful attempt to return the girl on 23\u00a0March 2012, she could still see the child at N.V.\u2019s home or that of N.V.\u2019s parents, even if that environment was not without fault (see paragraphs\u00a021, 62, 68 and 69 above). Afterwards, the authorities still continued pursuing any available avenues to enforce the applicant\u2019s contact rights which could reasonably have been required in the very difficult situation at hand (see paragraph\u00a055 above; also see Pascal v.\u00a0 Romania, no.\u00a0805/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a085 and 88, 17\u00a0April 2012).
