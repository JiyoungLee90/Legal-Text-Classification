Basic banks had separate legal personality, but were integrated into the organisational structure of one of the nine associated banks. As a rule, basic banks were founded and controlled by socially owned companies based in the same territorial unit (that is, in one of the Republics \u2013 Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia \u2013 or Autonomous Provinces \u2013 Kosovo and Vojvodina \u2013 of the SFRY). Socially owned companies were the flagship of the Yugoslav model of self-management: neither private nor State-owned, they were a collective property controlled by their employees, based on a communist vision of industrial relations (the phenomenon and the current status of such companies in Serbia, where they continue to exist, has been described in R.\u00a0Ka\u010dapor and Others v.

Similarly, Investbanka, at which one of the present applicants had opened accounts, had, together with some other basic banks, formed an associated bank called Beogradska udru\u017eena Banka.",

In response, the SFRY introduced a system for \u201credepositing\u201d foreign currency, allowing banks to transfer citizens\u2019 foreign-currency deposits to the NBY, which assumed the currency risk (section 51 of the Foreign-Currency Transactions Act 1977). Although the system was legally optional, in practice the banks did not have another option as they were not allowed to maintain foreign-currency accounts with foreign banks, which were necessary to make payments abroad, nor were they allowed to grant foreign-currency loans. Virtually all foreign currency was therefore redeposited with the NBY according to one of the following two methods: either the \u201caccounting\u201d or \u201cpro forma\u201d method, or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY. The accounting method was used far more often, as it enabled commercial banks to shift currency risks to the NBY without having to pay fees to foreign banks (see Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Slovenia [GC], nos. 44574/98, 45133/98 and 48316/99, \u00a7 36, 3 October 2008; see also decision AP 164/04 of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 1 April 2006, \u00a7 53). According to an internal report of the NBY of September 1988, by 30 June 1988 an equivalent of approximately USD\u00a09 billion had been redeposited with the NBY, of which only around USD\u00a01.4 billion (that is, slightly above 15%) had been physically transferred to the NBY\u2019s many foreign accounts. It would appear that the funds in the NBY\u2019s foreign accounts have recently been divided among the successor States (see paragraph 65 below).",

Some of those funds were transferred back to Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo at the request of that bank in order to meet its liquidity needs (during periods when more foreign currency was withdrawn than deposited). Indeed, in the period from 1984 to 1991, DEM 244,665,082 was transferred to Ljubljana and DEM 41,469,528 (that is, less than 17%) back to Sarajevo. The funds which had not been transferred back to Sarajevo were redeposited with the NBY according to one of the two methods described in paragraph 17 above: the \u201caccounting\u201d or \u201cpro forma\u201d method (in which case there is no proof that the funds actually left Ljubljana), or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY.

Slovenia thus undertook to repay original deposits and interest accrued by 31 December 1990 at the original rate, as well as interest accrued from 1 January 1991 until 31 December 1992 at an annual rate of\u00a06% (section 2 of the Old Foreign-Currency Savings Act 1993). As regards the period thereafter, the interest rate depended on whether a depositor had opted for government bonds or cash. The depositors were entitled to obtain either government bonds, which were to be amortised by 2003 in twenty biannual instalments and earned interest at an annual rate of\u00a05%, or cash from the banks in which they had money, together with interest at the market rate plus 0.25% in ten biannual instalments. In the latter case, the banks were to be issued with government bonds. Some depositors opted for government bonds as they could use them to purchase State-owned flats and companies and to pay taxes and pension contributions.",

The court explained that, according to the SFRY law, branches had acted on behalf and for the account of parent banks. Moreover, according to the Slovenian law, the old Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana retained liability for \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings in its Sarajevo branch. The court considered it irrelevant that a homonymous bank, Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo, had assumed liability of the old Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana for savings at the Sarajevo branch in 1993 (see paragraph 30 above) as that had been done without the approval of the parent bank or the depositors. In any event, the competent court in Bosnia and Herzegovina had deleted the 1993 entry in the companies register to that effect in 2004 (see paragraph 35 above).

Although the latter treaty is not yet in force and only three of the respondent States are Parties to it as of now (Croatia, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), it is a well-established principle of international law that, even if a State has not ratified a treaty, it may be bound by one of its provisions in so far as that provision reflects customary international law, either codifying it or forming a new customary rule (see Cudak v. Lithuania [GC], no. 15869/02, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2010, and the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, judgment of 20 February 1969, ICJ Reports 1969, \u00a7 71).",

It implies a willingness for the purpose of negotiation to abandon earlier positions and to meet the other side part way. The language of the Agreement cannot be construed to mean that either side intends to adhere to its previous stand and to insist upon the complete capitulation of the other side.

An undertaking to negotiate involves an understanding to deal with the other side with a view to coming to terms. Though the Tribunal does not conclude that Article 19 in connection with paragraph II of Annex I absolutely obligates either side to reach an agreement, it is of the opinion that the terms of these provisions require the parties to negotiate, bargain, and in good faith attempt to reach a result acceptable to both parties and thus bring an end to this long drawn out controversy ...",

No doubt this does not imply \u2018an obligation to reach an agreement\u2019 (Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, Advisory Opinion, 1931, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 42, p. 116; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 68, para. 150), or that lengthy negotiations must be pursued of necessity (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 13). However, States must conduct themselves so that the \u2018negotiations are meaningful\u2019. This requirement is not satisfied, for example, where either of the parties \u2018insists upon its own position without contemplating any modification of it\u2019 (North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 47, para. 85; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 67, para. 146) or where they obstruct negotiations, for example, by interrupting communications or causing delays in an unjustified manner or disregarding the procedures agreed upon (Lake Lanoux Arbitration (Spain/France) (1957), Reports of International Arbitral Awards (RIAA), Vol. XII, p. 307). Negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement also imply that the parties should pay reasonable regard to the interests of the other (Fisheries Jurisdiction (United Kingdom v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 33, para. 78). As for the proof required for finding of the existence of bad faith (a circumstance which would justify either Party in claiming to be discharged from performance), \u2018something more must appear than the failure of particular negotiations\u2019 (Arbitration on the Tacna-Arica Question (Chile/Peru) (1925), RIAA, Vol.\u00a0II, p. 930). It could be provided by circumstantial evidence but should be supported \u2018not by disputable inferences but by clear and convincing evidence which compels such a conclusion\u2019 (ibid.).\u201d",

Admittedly, all foreign-currency deposits had been guaranteed by the SFRY, but the guarantee had never been activated as the banks under consideration had remained solvent until the dissolution of the SFRY.

Notably, the Slovenian government had, by virtue of law, transferred most of the assets of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana to a new bank (see paragraph 49 above); the Serbian government had written off the debts of State-owned companies to Investbanka in order to be able to privatise them and gain millions in profit.",

The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be read in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among other authorities, Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v.

While, initially at least, the freezing of the bank accounts could be viewed as intended to control the use of their possessions in the sense of the third rule, it may be questioned whether the fact that their deposits remained unavailable for such a long period did not amount to a \u201cdeprivation\u201d in the sense of the second rule. However, bearing in mind the findings in paragraphs 77 to 81 above that the legislation of the respondent States did not extinguish the applicants\u2019 claims or otherwise deprive them of legal validity, as well as those States\u2019 acceptance in principle that deposit holders such as the applicants should also be able to dispose of their savings, it cannot be said that the applicants have been formally deprived of their savings. For the same reasons, the Court does not find that the subject matter could be regarded as clearly amounting to de facto expropriation. Against this background, and in view of the complexity of the legal and factual issues involved in this case, the Court considers that the alleged violation of the right of property cannot be classified as falling into a precise category (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2000I, and Zolotas v. Greece (no. 2), no.\u00a066610/09, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2013).

Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are not distinct, in the sense of being unconnected, and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a public interest required under the second sentence, or the general interest referred to in the second paragraph, are corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest (see Beyeler, cited above, \u00a7 111).",

Since the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies is wide, the Court will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is in the public interest, unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7 149, with further references). The Court has already held that this logic applies necessarily to such fundamental changes as the dissolution of a State followed by a war, phenomena which inevitably involve the enactment of large-scale economic and social legislation (see Suljagi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

The other respondent States did not comment on this issue. However, the Court is prepared to accept that following the dissolution of the SFRY and the subsequent armed conflicts, the respondent States had to take measures to protect their respective banking systems and national economies in general. In view of the overall size of the \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings, it is clear that none of the successor States was able to allow the uncontrolled withdrawal of such savings. The Court will thus proceed to examine the key issue, namely whether a \u201cfair balance\u201d has been struck between the general interest and the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

The key criteria used in the above-mentioned cases to determine whether the State was indeed responsible for such debts were as follows: the company\u2019s legal status (under public or private law); the nature of its activity (a public function or an ordinary commercial business); the context of its operation (such as a monopoly or heavily regulated business); its institutional independence (the extent of State ownership); and its operational independence (the extent of State supervision and control).",

It is moreover crucial that by virtue of an amendment to the 1991 Constitutional Act, Slovenia transferred most of that bank\u2019s assets to a new bank, to the detriment of the bank and its stakeholders (ibid.). The State thus disposed of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana\u2019s assets as it saw fit (compare Khachatryan, cited above, \u00a7 51).

The Court considers the present case to be special for the following reasons. Firstly, when the applicants deposited their money, the SFRY still existed and the branches in question were not foreign branches. Moreover, Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana was State-owned even before its rehabilitation. Indeed, both that bank and Investbanka have always been either State-owned or socially-owned. The present case is thus evidently different from a standard case of rehabilitation of an insolvent private bank. The EFTA Court\u2019s judgment on which the Slovenian Government relied is of little relevance in the present case as it concerned the rehabilitation of a failed private bank in the particular legal framework applicable to Iceland. Moreover, the savers in issue, unlike the present applicants, had already been repaid by the Dutch and United Kingdom authorities (see paragraphs\u00a071-73 above).",

The Court held that given the dire reality of the Serbian economy at the material time and the margin of appreciation afforded to the States in respect of matters involving economic policy, the impugned provisions had struck a fair balance between the general interest and the applicant\u2019s rights.

The explanation of the Serbian and Slovenian Governments for the delay is essentially that the international law on State succession required only that succession issues be negotiated in good faith, without imposing any time-limits for the settlement of such issues. They further argued that their insistence on the responsibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina for \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings in Bosnian-Herzegovinian branches of Slovenian and Serbian banks during succession negotiations was fully in line with the main principle of international law on State succession \u2013 the territoriality principle.",

While it is true that the 2001 Resolution on State Succession in Matters of Property and Debts of the Institute of International Law provides that the territoriality principle applies specifically to local debts, the applicants\u2019 savings evidently did not belong to that category of State debts (see paragraph 60 above).

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. Although the scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant.

The aim of that procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order (see Wolkenberg and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 50003/99, \u00a7\u00a034, 4 December 2007).

The Court may decide to adjourn the examination of similar cases, thus giving the respondent States a chance to settle them in such various ways (see, for example, Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, \u00a7 127, ECHR 2009). If, however, the respondent State fails to adopt such measures following a pilot judgment and continues to violate the Convention, the Court will have no choice but to resume the examination of all similar applications pending before it and to take them to judgment in order to ensure effective observance of the Convention (see E.G. v. Poland and 175 other Bug River applications (dec.), no. 50425/99, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2008, and Kuri\u0107 and Others v. Slovenia (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 26828/06, \u00a7 136, ECHR 2014).",

The Court largely resolves the issue by reiterating and emphasising the principles concerning the obligation to negotiate in State succession situations (see Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others, cited above, concurring opinion of Judge Ress, point 4) and the principle of equitable proportion in dividing up the debts of the predecessor State. Given the limited scope of the present case, the Court does not (see paragraph 123 of the present judgment) enter full speed into the question of equitable apportionment of debts as such and certainly does not reflect on the unjust enrichment principle, which in my view might also be relevant to the facts of the case (see Articles 37, 40 and 41 of the 1983 Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of State Property, Archives and Debts, Badinter Arbitration Commission Opinion no. 1, and Article 8 of the 2001 Resolution on State Succession in Matters of Property and Debts of the Institute of International Law). However, even without expressis verbis reference to these principles, one could argue that the solution is in line with their essence and with their application in international practice.",

The nature of the rights claimed is important. The Court traces the responsibility for the banks where the applicants\u2019 foreign-currency accounts are frozen to Serbia and Slovenia (see paragraphs 116-17 of the present judgment). One can compare this approach with that taken by the Court in Likvid\u0113jam\u0101 p/s Selga and Vasi\u013cevska v. Latvia ((dec.), nos. 17126/02 and 24991/02, 1 October 2013), which concerned frozen foreign-currency accounts in a bank in the Russian Federation. It is true that the international legal position of Latvia is different from that of the respondent States in the present case, since Latvia is not a successor State in the context of the demise of the USSR. However, the Russian Federation is a predecessor State and, also in such a scenario, the principle of territoriality, as claimed by the applicants in the Latvian case, could not be applied.",

At the same time, I retain serious doubts as to the dicta in relation to the execution part of the judgment, even though I voted with the majority in the end (see operative paragraphs 10 and 11 of the present judgment). The Court has begun from time to time to set deadlines within which States have to execute a judgment under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers. Practice shows that the Court has repeatedly had to come back to its original decision regarding deadlines. This is to my mind inevitable since judgments of the Court typically involve questions of principle and require legislative reforms, and such political processes are complicated (see, for example, L. v. Lithuania, no. 27527/03, ECHR 2007IV), even more so in the context of State succession. There is no question that it is in the general interest in Europe that judgments of the European Court of Human Rights be implemented swiftly and that the broader consequences be assumed where possible. As far as the Court\u2019s share in the common responsibility is concerned, it has done its utmost, even indicating possible solutions to the problem under Article 46 where applicable. It is high time that the States attend to their \u201chomework\u201d in complying with the Court\u2019s case-law, since this also directly affects the efficiency of the Court. It is in this context that the Court has decided on occasion, including in the present case, to indicate deadlines of compliance to the respondent States. This is a somewhat desperate measure. It is a great pity that the Court has been placed in a situation where it has to resort to such measures. It is also a risk for the Court, since it may be asked to take another look at its decision and that raises serious questions in terms of the principles of legal certainty and finality of judgment. I would much prefer the States Parties to the Convention and the Committee of Ministers to tighten up their approach as regards the execution of judgments, rather than the Court having to take such a risk.",

In socialist times the associated banks in Slovenia and Serbia had transferred back some of the funds they had received to meet the liquidity needs of the basic banks (see paragraphs 18-19 of the present judgment). As dinar loans (initially interest-free) were granted by the National Bank of Yugoslavia to domestic companies on the basis of the redeposited foreign currency and thus benefited the local economy, the rule of international law concerning local debts (Article 29 of the 2001 Resolution on State Succession in Matters of Property and Debts of the Institute of International Law, see paragraph 60 of the present judgment) is not \u201cevidently\u201d inapplicable, as deemed by the majority of the Grand Chamber (see paragraph 121). Secondly, the fact that redepositing payments were made to the National Bank of Yugoslavia in Belgrade is not contested. Thirdly, as emergency measures were deemed necessary and adopted by the SFRY (see paragraph\u00a022) it is highly likely that most of the money was already lost in \u201cYugoslav times\u201d.",

In its recent judgment in Kuri\u0107 and Others v. Slovenia (just satisfaction) ([GC], no. 26828/06, ECHR 2014), where the parties had failed to reach a friendly settlement, the Court had due regard to the fact that the Slovenian Government had set up an ad hoc domestic compensation scheme after the expiry of the time-limits indicated in the principal judgment in order to secure proper redress to the \u201cerased\u201d at national level (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 138-40). The Grand Chamber observed in that connection that, according to the principle of subsidiarity and the margin of appreciation which went with it, the amounts of compensation awarded at national level to other adversely affected persons in the context of general measures under Article 46 of the Convention were at the discretion of the respondent State, provided that they were compatible with the Court\u2019s judgment ordering those measures (ibid., \u00a7 141; see also, mutatis mutandis, Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v.
