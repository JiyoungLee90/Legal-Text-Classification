These provisions required that the applicant organisation be registered as an educational institution and possess a licence, and they had been accessible to and foreseeable for the applicant organisation which, nevertheless, had failed to comply with them.

According to the Government, the applicant organisation had been repeatedly reminded that it needed to obtain a licence and that it had previously been found liable in administrative proceedings for that breach of the law.",

In these circumstances, the novel interpretation of the Education Act with regard to the mandatory licensing of Sunday schools adopted by the courts in the present case was not sufficiently foreseeable for the applicant organisation so that it could anticipate its application and adjust its conduct accordingly (see, by contrast, Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25\u00a0May 1993, \u00a7 40, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0260A). It is to be noted in this connection that some nine months after it gave judgment upholding the applicant organisation\u2019s dissolution, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, sitting in a formation that included two of the three judges who had heard the applicant organisation\u2019s case, reversed its stance on the licensing of Sunday schools and held that teaching religion to children in such schools did not amount to education and that alleged breaches of sanitary standards could not justify the dissolution of a religious organisation (see paragraph 39 above). In neither case did the Supreme Court give reasons as to why it considered it necessary to depart from the previous case-law and to adopt a different interpretation of the same legal provisions.",

The town prosecutor instituted administrative proceedings against the applicant organisation\u2019s director for operating an unlicensed educational institution on 28 May 2007, that is the same day on which he filed an application for dissolution (see paragraphs 15 and 21 above). The Supreme Court of the Chuvash Republic ordered the dissolution of the Biblical Centre just one day after the same court had found the applicant organisation liable for a violation of sanitary rules (see paragraphs 20 and 25 above). By filing a claim for dissolution without waiting for the outcome of the administrative proceedings, the domestic authorities revealed their determination in seeking to put an end to the applicant organisation\u2019s existence. The Government conceded that some of the defects were technical in nature and could easily have been eliminated. Others could have necessitated more time and resources, but there is nothing to indicate that any of them were irremediable or constituted a clear and imminent danger to the life and limb of the students. Be that as it may, the Court considers that the applicant organisation should have been offered a choice between rectifying the alleged shortcomings and discontinuing the activities related to the instruction of its followers.",

As the text of the Prosecutors Act and the federal court\u2019s judgment in an earlier case indicate (see paragraphs 36 and 37 above), it was open to the prosecutor to seek discontinuation of any activity that it considered harmful or unlawful. The prosecutor could have asked for the school and college to be reorganised but he did not make use of that power and immediately filed an action for dissolution. The applicant organisation demonstrated goodwill in seeking to remedy the alleged violation by amending its statute, and also reminded the court of its discretion to issue a special ruling directing the defendant to comply with the legal requirements instead of ordering its dissolution (see paragraph 22 above). The courts nevertheless granted the prosecutor\u2019s claim without addressing the latter argument. Nor did the courts explain what other, less intrusive means of achieving the declared aim of the protection of the rights of students had been considered and why they had been deemed insufficient. Accordingly, the domestic authorities have not shown that the dissolution, which undermined the very substance of the applicant organisation\u2019s rights to freedom of religion and association, was the only option for the fulfilment of the aims they pursued.",

Before the decision to dissolve it was made, the applicant organisation of Pentecostals had existed and legally operated in the Chuvash Republic for more than fifteen years, from 1991 to 2007. The decision by the Russian courts to dissolve the applicant organisation had the effect of stripping it of legal personality and prohibiting it from exercising the rights associated with legal-entity status, such as the right to own or rent property, to hold bank accounts, to hire employees and to ensure judicial protection of the community, its members and its assets, which, as the Court has consistently held, are essential for exercising the right to manifest one\u2019s religion. Moreover, in addition to the above-mentioned rights normally associated with legal-entity status, the Russian Religions Act reserved a panoply of rights for registered religious organisations and explicitly excluded the possibility of such rights being exercised by either non-registered religious groups or non-religious legal entities. The exclusive rights of religious organisations with legal-entity status included, in particular, such fundamental aspects of religious practice as the right to establish places of worship, the right to hold religious services in places accessible to the public, the right to produce, obtain and distribute religious literature, the right to create educational institutions, and the right to maintain contacts for international exchanges and conferences (see Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses of Moscow, cited above, \u00a7 102). It follows that, as a result of the Russian courts\u2019 decisions, the Biblical Centre ceased to exist as a registered religious organisation and a group of Pentecostal Christians who were its members were divested of the right to manifest their religion in community with others and to engage in the activities which are indispensable to their religious practice.",

The sanction of dissolution could be applied indiscriminately without regard to the gravity of the breach in question (see Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses of Moscow, cited above, \u00a7 159), a practice which the Constitutional Court found to be incompatible with the constitutional meaning of the relevant provisions as early as 2003 (see paragraph 38 above). In pronouncing the applicant organisation\u2019s dissolution, the Russian courts did not give heed to the case-law of the Constitutional Court or to the relevant Convention standards and their decision-making did not include an analysis of the impact of the applicant organisation\u2019s dissolution on the fundamental rights of Pentecostal believers.

It further reiterates that, where the Court finds a violation, the respondent State has a legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention to select, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress, in so far as possible, its effects. In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention. In the instant case the Court found a violation of Article 9 read in the light of Article 11 on account of the dissolution of the applicant organisation that was ordered in the domestic proceedings. It is to be recalled that the Court\u2019s judgments are binding on Russia and a finding of a violation of the Convention or its Protocols by the Court is a ground for reopening civil proceedings under Article 392 \u00a7\u00a7 2(2) and 4(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure and a review of the domestic judgments in the light of the Convention principles established by the Court (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above). The Court considers that such a review would be the most appropriate means of remedying the violation it has identified in the judgment. Furthermore, the respondent State remains free, subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, to choose any other additional means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses of Moscow, cited above, \u00a7 206, with further references).",
