Finally, one had also to take into account that children had a legitimate interest in being informed about their actual descent, which, with donated sperm and ova, would in most cases be impossible. With the use of donated sperm and ova within the framework of medically assisted procreation, the actual parentage of a child was not revealed in the register of births, marriages and deaths and the legal protective provisions governing adoptions were ineffective in the case of medically assisted procreation. The reasons for allowing artificial insemination, as set out in the explanatory report to the Government\u2019s bill on the Artificial Procreation Act, were that because it was such an easily applicable procreation method, compared with others, it could not be monitored effectively. Also, this technique had already been in use for a long time. Thus, a prohibition of this simple technique would not have been effective and consequently would not constitute a suitable means of pursuing the objectives of the legislation effectively.",

This would be an absolute novelty in nature and in the history of mankind. In legal, historical and cultural terms, the unambiguousness of motherhood represented a fundamental and basic social consensus and, for this reason alone, was considered indispensable by German legislators. In addition, the relationship with the mother was assumed to be important for the child\u2019s discovery of identity. As a result, the child would have extreme difficulties in coping with the fact that in biological terms two women had a part in his or her existence.  motherhood and the resulting ambiguousness of the mother\u2019s identity might jeopardise the development of the child\u2019s personality and lead to considerable problems in his or her discovery of identity.

The State\u2019s wide margin in principle extends both to its decision to intervene in the area and, once having intervened, to the detailed rules it lays down in order to achieve a balance between the competing public and private interests (see Evans, cited above\u00a0\u00a7 75). However, the differences in the approaches adopted by the Contracting States do not, as such, make any solution reached by a legislature acceptable. It does not absolve the Court from carefully examining the arguments discussed in the legislative process and from examining whether the arguments advanced by the Government for justifying the difference of treatment in issue are relevant and sufficient.

In the present case the Court is not persuaded that a complete ban was the only means at the disposal of the Austrian legislature. Given that the Artificial Procreation Act reserves this kind of intervention to specialised medical doctors, who have particular knowledge and experience in this field and are themselves bound by the ethical rules of their profession, and that the Act provides for further safeguards in order to minimise the risk, the Court finds that the prohibition of ova and sperm donation for in vitro fertilisation cannot be considered the only or the least intrusive means of achieving the aim pursued.",

As to the question of whether the prohibition was proportionate to the aims it pursued, it is of importance that it prevents the applicants from their only possibility to biologically have children of their own. However, other, less restrictive, but still effective means do not seem to have been practically feasable. Furthermore, it must be taken into account that though  is in a minority among the European States, there is no European consensus with respect to artificial procreation with the use of donor material. Because of this, and the fact that the case concerns a very sensitive issue, the State should in my opinion be afforded a wide margin of appreciation (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7 77, ECHR\u00a02007IV). Bearing in mind that the Austrian legislators have weighed the competing interests carefully and concluded with a reasonable solution, which to a very large extent opens up for artificial procreation, I do not think it is for the Court to interfere.",

Even if that is the case, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation when assessing whether and to what extent a different treatment is justified, (Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52, ECHR 2006VI, Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2008...).",

This is a difference in treatment between persons whose position is similar because they all need medical assistance in order to conceive a child, but different with respect to the method to be applied. More important is the fact that this difference refers to the very essence of the prohibition in the Austrian legislation. Bearing in mind that the States have a certain margin of appreciation, and that the prohibition is based on reasons which are in my mind acceptable, I am not able to conclude that there has been a violation in respect of the difference in treatment discussed above.",

I find these applicants to be in a similar position as couples who can utilise the insemination method, in that both groups need sperm donation. The reason for the difference in treatment is partly historical, in that the insemination technique has been in use for many years, and partly practical, because insemination is so easily performed that a prohibition could not be effectively controlled. Referring again to the States\u2019 margin in such matters, I am convinced by the fact that the Austrian legislators have not by the above exception permitted sperm donation as such, but accepted the realities and avoided legislation which would be impractical. In such circumstances it would also in my opinion be very unfortunate to restrict the possibilities of one group of couples from obtaining assistance, in order not to discriminate against another.",
