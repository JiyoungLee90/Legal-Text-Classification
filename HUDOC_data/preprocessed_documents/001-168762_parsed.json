The reasoned decision must be communicated to the litigant sufficiently in advance so that he or she may dispose of adequate time for deciding on a further course of action for the defence of his or her rights. Finally, if the courts decide that the litigant\u2019s presence is not necessary, they must consider putting in place procedural arrangements aimed at guaranteeing his or her effective participation in the proceedings (see Yevdokimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 33-48).",

Nor did the appeal court consider any procedural arrangements aimed at ensuring the applicant\u2019s right to effective participation in the appeal hearing. Contrary to the Government\u2019s claim that the applicant could have effectively presented his case to the court because he had been duly informed of the hearings, merely informing the applicant of the appeal hearing date was clearly insufficient in a situation where the current state of the domestic law prevented him from attending. Nor can the Court accept the Government\u2019s argument about the absence of any legal norm making the applicant\u2019s presence mandatory, for the applicant cannot be expected to bear the burden of the legislator\u2019s failure to provide for the special situation of incarcerated parties to civil proceedings (see Yevdokimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 50, and Gryaznov v. Russia, no. 19673/03, \u00a7 50, 12 June 2012).
