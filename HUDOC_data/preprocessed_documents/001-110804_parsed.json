The court accepted the applicant\u2019s argument that Mrs K had accompanied him to his room voluntarily. It found, however, that despite Mrs K\u2019s inability to recall the events immediately before and after the attempted rape, her allegations of assault were credible. It noted in this regard that they were consistent with the other evidence obtained in the proceedings, namely the injuries to Mrs K witnessed by the police officers. The court did not believe the applicant\u2019s account that he had invited Mrs K for drinks all afternoon and then to his room out of sympathy for her. It further noted that the applicant could not give any convincing reason for the fact that strands of Mrs\u00a0K\u2019s hair had been spotted by a police officer on his clothes. Furthermore, it did not believe the applicant\u2019s assertions that Mrs K had injured herself in a fall on the way from the pub to his flat or that she had not suffered any other injuries, in particular the wound to her hand. Having regard to Mrs K\u2019s injuries and to the applicant\u2019s criminal record of eleven previous convictions, it sentenced the applicant to three years\u2019 imprisonment.

He argued that in view of the various inconsistencies in Mrs K\u2019s description of the events, the  should have visited the scene in order to stage a reconstruction. He further argued that the proceedings had been conducted contrary to the direct evidence rule (Unmittelbarkeit) in that the trial court had not seen the video recording of the hearing at which the depositions were taken. In view of this and of new evidence that had come to light at the trial, namely the statement by Mrs P that Mrs K frequently made up stories as she feared being beaten up by her partner, the trial court should have recalled Mrs K or, at least, allowed further questions to be put to Mr H.

The 1993 reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure has already taken account of the necessary rights for the defence to participate in the proceedings and to question [the victim] and these are also relevant to the provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights. However, it would also appear to be in the interest of victims of sexual offences aged over fourteen for them to be questioned only once, as, in general, making a statement places a heavy mental burden on them. On the other hand, it cannot be overlooked that if the victim is only questioned once and at an early date, there is a danger that it will not be possible to obtain complete consistency between this testimony and the results of subsequent investigations or examinations ... However, the argument in favour of nevertheless increasing procedural safeguards for the alleged victims of sexual offences is the danger of the court proceedings causing damage and traumatisation [to the victim] (secondary victimisation) which has, incidentally, been highlighted by all the experts who work with such victims. When responsibly weighing these interests of the victim against the interests of ascertaining the facts, preference must nevertheless be given to the protection of the victim, especially since it is usually possible to at least partly counterbalance the possible negative effects on evidence by corresponding \u2018case management\u2019 and since an examination at a potentially early date is not only in the interest of the witnesses but also promotes the purpose of the procedure, as recollections will still be fresh.\u201d",

In criminal proceedings concerning alleged sexual offences courts had to weigh the victim\u2019s interest against that of the accused and strike a fair balance. The legislature considered it necessary to restrict the questioning of victims of sexual offences to the extent necessary to protect the victim, for whom giving evidence was generally a traumatic experience. The Government referred in this regard to the explanations that had been given in the relevant government bill (see the section on \u201cRelevant domestic and European Union law\u201d above). The right of victims to refuse to give evidence at trial stemmed from the experience that requiring a victim to recount a sexual assault in detail under repeated questioning placed a special burden on him or her and had, therefore, to be kept to an absolute minimum. In this regard the Government further referred to EU legislation, namely Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA of 15 March 2001 on the Standing of Victims in Criminal Proceedings and its interpretation by the European Court of Justice in its judgment of 16 June 2005 in case no. C-105/03 (see the section on \u201cRelevant domestic and European Union law\u201d above). In the present case, a balance had been struck between Mrs K\u2019s and the applicant\u2019s rights as the first-instance court had not relied exclusively on Mrs\u00a0K\u2019s statements. It had dealt with the inconsistencies in Mrs K\u2019s own statements and between her statements and the statement of Mrs P. It had had regard to Mrs K\u2019s considerable alcohol consumption at the material time and the resulting gaps in her memory. It had then proceeded to follow those parts of Mrs K\u2019s description of the events it considered realistic and consistent with the other evidence. The domestic courts had also given sufficient reasons for dismissing the applicant\u2019s further requests to visit the scene and for leave to put further questions to the expert witness Mr H.",

The Court\u2019s task under the Convention is not to rule on whether witnesses\u2019 statements were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see Garc\u00eda\u00a0Ruiz v.  [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I). All the evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. There are exceptions to this principle, however. As a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article\u00a06 cannot be interpreted as requiring in all cases that questions be put directly by the accused or his lawyer, whether by means of cross-examination or by any other means, but rather that the accused must be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when the witness makes his statement or at a later stage. The use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with the provisions cited above, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected (see Sa\u00efdi v. France, 20 September 1993, \u00a7 43, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0261C). Even where such a statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission in evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1. However, the Court will examine in each case whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence (Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the  [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7 147, 15 December 2011).",

In the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the alleged victim.

The Court reiterates in this respect that there must be a good reason for the non-attendance of a witness and that this requirement for admitting the evidence of an absent witness is a preliminary question which must be examined before any consideration is given as to whether that evidence was sole or decisive (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 120).",
