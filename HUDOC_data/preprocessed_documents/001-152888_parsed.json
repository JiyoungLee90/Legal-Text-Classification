It held that following the incident the applicants had been restrained by police officers and taken to the police station for identification and questioning, because a car had been destroyed during the incident and police officers had been assaulted. It was further held that when they reached the police station it was already apparent from physical evidence that the applicants had been involved in a violent incident. There was therefore no evidence in the criminal investigation file to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the police officers who questioned the applicants at the police station, in particular A.S, F.L.C. and D.D.M., had acted violently against the applicants.

This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The investigation must be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny and that the competent authorities must act with diligence. Among other things, they must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, a detailed statement concerning the allegations from the alleged victim, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, additional medical reports. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Koky and Others v. Slovakia, no. , \u00a7 215, 12 June 2012). Thus, the authorities have an obligation to take action as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. A prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. Tolerance by the authorities towards such acts cannot but undermine public confidence in the principle of lawfulness and the State\u2019s maintenance of the rule of law (see Bat\u0131 and Others v.

Statements from the applicants and their mother were also taken during this period. Three years later, and with no further action having been taken in the meantime, the investigation was closed with respect to the three police officers who had questioned the applicants inside the police station. The prosecutor concluded that the applicants showed traces of violence which had been inflicted before their arrival at the police station, and that there was no evidence in the investigation file to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the police officers who questioned the applicants inside the police station had in any way harmed them. However, the Court observes from the documents submitted by the parties that this conclusion was drawn only from the statements of the police officers under investigation, and that no statements from the taxi drivers allegedly involved in the incident were ever submitted to the investigation file. In addition, the Court would point to the incident report, which mentions the taking of statements from four eyewitnesses (see paragraph 10 above), the statement of officer D.A.M., who declared that two eyewitnesses had been accompanied to the police station for statements to be taken from them (see paragraph 21 above), and the statement of officer F.L.C., who declared that he had taken statements from two eyewitnesses (see paragraph 24 above). Nevertheless, no such statements were ever submitted to the investigation file. In addition, the Court observes that in his decision of 1 June 2011 the prosecutor held as proven that the applicant Mihai Chinez had caused injuries to himself inside the police station, which was mentioned by officer F.L.C. only in his second statement, and was not corroborated by any other evidence.",
