He emphasised that he had not received any notice of the criminal proceedings or the judgment, not even when he had gone to the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor\u2019s office three months prior to the delivery of the impugned judgment to obtain his criminal record details for an unrelated matter. He added that the claimant in the criminal proceedings, \u0130.\u00d6., was his former girlfriend, and that he had given her a blank cheque as a guarantee that he would discharge their joint debt to a bank. They had in fact signed an official document on 12 March 1998 in the presence of a lawyer confirming that \u0130.\u00d6. would only be entitled to cash this cheque if the applicant failed to discharge their joint debt to the bank. Upon settling the debt with the bank, the applicant had requested that \u0130.\u00d6. return the blank cheque to him, but \u0130.\u00d6. had failed to do so, alleging that she had lost it. He had accordingly reported the cheque as missing to the bank, and had asked to be notified in the event of any attempts to cash it. On 27 April 1999, very shortly after his move to a new address, his former girlfriend had apparently attempted to cash the cheque, and when the cheque had not cleared, had brought a criminal complaint against him. Despite his instructions, he had not been contacted by his bank when the cheque in question had been deposited by \u0130.\u00d6., nor had he been advised that the cheque had bounced.",

Thus, it was within the scope of Article 225 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure. Reiterating that the impossibility of holding a trial by default may paralyse the conduct of criminal proceedings, in that it may lead, for example, to the dispersal of evidence, the expiry of the time-limit for a prosecution, or a miscarriage of justice (Colozza v. Italy, 12 February 1985, \u00a7 29, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a089), the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s trial in absentia had a legal basis under the Turkish law in force at the material time.",

The starting point of that assessment will inevitably focus on the question of whether the applicant had knowledge of the criminal proceedings against him, without which no valid waiver can take place (see Dilipak and Karakaya v. Turkey, nos.\u00a07942/05 and\u00a024838/05, \u00a7\u00a087, 4 March 2014, and compare Ait Abbou v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a044921/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06365, 2 February 2017).

France, no.\u00a043353/07, \u00a7 52, 11 October 2012).

In that connection, it makes the following observations. Firstly, although the applicant had issued the disputed cheque in his capacity as president of the executive board of his company, he was tried as an individual before the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Criminal Court of First Instance. However, that court first sent a summons together with the indictment to the address of the company indicated by the applicant on the cheque. That summons was returned on the grounds that the company had left the address, leaving \u201cPK. [post box] 5 Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y\u201d as the new address. At the same time, the trial court sought assistance from the prosecutor\u2019s office, which in turn asked the police and the relevant district mayor to locate the applicant. They concluded that the applicant had abandoned the address written on the cheque. Thereafter, the trial court issued a detention order in absentia in respect of the applicant under Article\u00a0223 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, with a view to bringing him before the court, and waited from 14 February 2000 to 13\u00a0October 2004 for that warrant to be executed. Lastly, the trial court decided to serve the summons at the address indicated on the cheque, pursuant to section 35 (4) of the Law of Notifications then in force.",

More importantly, the Ba\u011fc\u0131lar Criminal Court of First Instance, which is also situated in Istanbul, was able to serve a summons at the applicant\u2019s home address on 11 October 2001, in relation to criminal proceedings in which he was a complainant (for an almost identical situation, see Colozza, cited above, \u00a7 28). Moreover, the K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece public prosecutor\u2019s office, which is also situated in Istanbul, indicated the applicant\u2019s home address in its decision not to prosecute dated 16 July 2001, a decision made within the context of other criminal proceedings.
