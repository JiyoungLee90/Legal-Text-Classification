It found, however, that the applicants had proved that their predecessors had had continuous possession of the three plots of land in good faith for more than forty years before 6\u00a0April 1941, and had continued to do so until they had sold them to the applicants (see paragraph 11 above). The applicants\u2019 predecessors had therefore, under Article 1472 of the 1811 Civil Code (applicable in Croatia from 1852 until 1980, see paragraphs 18-20 and 22 below), acquired ownership of the land by adverse possession even before that date.",

It stated that even though the Municipal Court had established the facts correctly, the applicants\u2019 predecessors had only been in possession of the land in question (continuously and in good faith) since 1912. The forty-year time-limit for acquiring ownership by adverse possession set forth in Article 1472 of the 1811 Civil Code had not therefore expired by 6 April 1941 (see paragraph 22 below). In the subsequent period between 6 April 1941 and 8 October 1991 the relevant legislation had prohibited the acquisition of ownership of socially owned property by adverse possession (see paragraph 6 above and 25 below).

Under Article 1468 of the [1811] Civil Code the period of thirty years, or twenty years according to the interpretation adopted at the extended plenary session of the Federal Supreme Court of Yugoslavia of 4 April 1960, was necessary to acquire ownership by adverse possession. That period had not expired at the time the [1980] Basic Property Act entered into force, and thus continued to run [in accordance with that Act]. The period necessary for acquiring ownership by adverse possession would have expired in 1989. [However, by that time the property was already in social ownership, having been transferred in 1983]. Given that at the time the property was transferred into social ownership (1983) the period of twenty years for acquiring ownership by adverse possession had not expired because the time between 1983 and 8 October 1991 (when section 29 of the [1980] Property Act was repealed) does not count toward the period necessary to acquire ownership by adverse possession, the plaintiff did not become the owner of the property by adverse possession.\u201d",

Rather, what was important was whether ownership of the property in question had been vested in him by the operation of law at the time when section 388(4) of the 1996 Property Act in its original text had still been in force (see paragraphs 8, 10, 27-28 above).",

As that provision remained in force until the Constitutional Court invalidated it with ex nunc effect on 14\u00a0December 1999 (see paragraphs 10 and 17 above), the applicants also acquired ownership of the third plot of land, and so on the same day they bought and entered into possession of it, namely, on 20 July 1999 (see paragraph 11 above).

Italy, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 44, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 I). It further reiterates that the issue whether a particular Article of the Convention or a Protocol thereto is applicable or not, is a matter that goes to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction ratione materiae. The scope of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction is determined by the Convention itself, in particular by its Article 32, and not by the parties\u2019 submissions in a particular case. Accordingly, the Court, has to satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it, and is therefore obliged to examine the question of its jurisdiction of its own motion (see Ble\u010di\u0107 v.

The Court therefore considers that the concerns that prompted the Constitutional Court to invalidate section 388(4) of 1996 Property Act (see paragraphs 10 and 28 above) were not present in the applicants\u2019 case.

In fact, as a consequence of the invalidation, the ownership of the property the applicants acquired by adverse possession on the basis of the provision later on invalidated as unconstitutional, was returned to the local authorities (compare with Trgo, cited above, loc. cit.). In this way the State benefited from its own mistake (see Trgo, cited above, loc. cit.), it being understood that from the Court\u2019s perspective the hierarchy between different organs of the State (here between local and central authorities) is irrelevant while examining an application (see, for example, \u010cikanovi\u0107 v.

The Court reiterates that the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned, especially where no other conflicting private interest is at stake (see Trgo, cited above).",

In this connection, the Court notes that under section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act the applicants may now file a petition for reopening of the civil proceedings in respect of which the Court has found a violation of the Convention. Given the nature of the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and the reasons for which it has found a violation of that Article, the Court considers that in the present case the most appropriate way of repairing the consequences of that violation would be to reopen the proceedings complained of.

When the applicants bought the plots between 1993 and 1999, the vendors were not the lawful owners and therefore could not validly sell them to the applicants.

Second, and alternatively, they argued that the required period of adverse possession was not forty years, but only twenty years, and therefore the vendors\u2019 predecessors had fulfilled the requirement by 6 April 1941 (see paragraphs 41 and 50 of the judgment). In sum, the applicants argued that the County Court had been wrong in considering that the vendors\u2019 predecessors had not already met the forty-year requirement by 6 April 1941.",

By virtue of that provision, in force between 1 January 1997 (that is after two of the three purchases of the plots of land had taken place) and 20 December 1999, the period between 6 April 1941 and 8 October 1991 could also be taken into account for the calculation of the number of years of adverse possession (see paragraph 28 of the judgment). On that basis the majority hold that the vendors or their predecessors had acquired ownership in 1952 and that the applicants became the owners by buying the plots from the previous owners (see paragraph 46 of the judgment). The majority thus substitute their own opinion on a crucial aspect of the dispute for that of the County Court.

My understanding is that a complaint contains an allegation, and that it is characterised by the facts of the allegation.
