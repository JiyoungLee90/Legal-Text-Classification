The applicant\u2019s lawyer also requested that witnesses be examined at the trial in relation to the applicant\u2019s allegation that a third person had promised them employment in the Ministry of the Interior. The trial court refused that request, since they had already been examined.

Other written material was also admitted as evidence. In his closing arguments, the applicant complained that the trial court had not made sufficient efforts to clarify all relevant facts \u2013 particularly A.\u2019s role in the events at issue.

The court furthermore noted that the witnesses were not residents of Skopje and that several unsuccessful attempts had been made to summon them to appear at the trial. Any further attempts would have unnecessarily prolonged the proceedings, especially taking into account the fact that their statements corresponded with the material evidence. Referring to the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Solakov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (no. 47023/99, ECHR 2001X), the Supreme Court held that the applicant\u2019s defence rights had not been restricted to such an extent that he had not been afforded a fair trial, since those statements had not constituted the sole evidence against him. Lastly, the applicant had not presented any relevant arguments to cast doubt on the facts established by the trial court.

In the Court\u2019s opinion, that cannot be regarded as constituting a good reason for the non-attendance of the witnesses, who had previously been examined in the applicant\u2019s absence. Similar considerations apply to the grounds referred to by the trial court and the Supreme Court for admitting untested witness evidence (see paragraphs 8 and 19 above).

As can be seen from the case file, the applicant did not allege any incoherence or inconsistency in the witnesses\u2019 testimony (contrast Trampevski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 4570/07, \u00a7 48, 10 July 2012), but rather submitted that he also had been promised employment by the abovementioned A.

It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the impugned proceedings would have been had there been no violation on this ground. It therefore finds no causal link between the damage claimed and its finding of a violation of Article 6. Accordingly, the Court makes no award under this head (see Trampevski, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

France, no. 58148/00, \u00a7\u00a064, ECHR\u00a02004IV). Having regard to the available material and the above criteria, the Court finds that only the sum of EUR 720, relating to lawyer\u2019s fees, was expended with a view to seeking before the national courts to prevent the violation found by the Court (see, Trampevski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060). Furthermore, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a01,000 for the proceedings before it.
