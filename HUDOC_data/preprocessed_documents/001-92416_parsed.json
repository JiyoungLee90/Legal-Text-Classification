The necessity of the applicant\u2019s continued detention had been thoroughly examined by the courts which on each occasion had given sufficient reasons for their decisions. The applicant\u2019s case had been extremely complex on account of the number of charges (121) and defendants (21), and by reason of the volume of evidence. The Government further submitted that the domestic courts had acted diligently and speedily, in particular taking into account the complexity of the case, the number of witnesses to be heard and the number of co-accused, most of whom had been suspected of acting in an organised criminal group.",

However, as stated above, while this element is to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 and may justify a longer period of detention than in a case concerning an individual offender, a member of an organised criminal group is entitled to the protection against unreasonably lengthy detention afforded by this provision (see paragraphs 27, 30 and 31 above). As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant\u2019s continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraphs 2531 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to be in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of a practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, 4\u00a0May 2006; K\u0105kol v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a03994/03, 6\u00a0September 2007; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 15154/03, 16\u00a0October 2007). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings made in Kauczor as to the existence of a structural problem and the need for the Polish State to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06062 ).",
