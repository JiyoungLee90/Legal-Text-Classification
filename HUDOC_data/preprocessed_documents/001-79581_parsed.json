In support of that submission they relied on a report made by an expert working for the Ministry of Justice and who had been duly warned of his criminal responsibility for false statements. According to that report, when the applicant company was created on 29 December 1992 it had not yet included the property of H., which was only transferred the next day. After 1992 H. functioned independently of the applicant and had the right to sign contracts and use its own stamp and based its relations with the applicant on a contractual footing.

That situation persisted for at least eight years after the 1994 registration of the applicant\u2019s subsidiary, without being challenged by anybody.
