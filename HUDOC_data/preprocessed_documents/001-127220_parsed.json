Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7 44, 20 July 2004, and Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000IV). The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must, for a violation to be found, go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 92-94, ECHR 2000XI).",
