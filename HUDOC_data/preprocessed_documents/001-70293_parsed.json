Greece, (no. 37098/97, 14\u00a0December 1999) for two important reasons: unlike what happened in those two cases, in the present case the respondent Government never denied the existence of the debt owed to the applicant company, and no attempt was made at the national level to cancel, through legislation, a property right that had been recognised by national courts. Having considered that, due to the scarcity of funds, the simultaneous payment of all judgment debts was not feasible, the Georgian government introduced a mechanism for the staggered payment of outstanding debts, establishing an order of priority as to the enforcement of court decisions (see paragraph 27 of the judgment).",

I accept that in such circumstances the introduction of priorities in the payment of judgment debts could be said to fall within the margin of appreciation of the respondent State, which is, in principle, better placed than an international court to assess which sections of the population would suffer more as a consequence of belated payments. I have no problem in saying that such an interference may pursue a legitimate aim.
