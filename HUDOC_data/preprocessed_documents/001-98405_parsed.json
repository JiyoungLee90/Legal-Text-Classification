However, in so far as the judgment of 23 June 1998 ordered the eviction of the IDPs from the flat to which the applicant had the occupancy voucher, the situation at hand necessitated an action by the State in order to assist the applicant with the enforcement of the judgment when the IDPs, as a private party, refused to comply with it. In the instant case, it is undisputed by the parties that the judgment of 23 June 1998 had been enforceable under the domestic law at least until the delivery of the decision of 10 July 2007 by the Yasamal District Court concerning the postponement of the enforcement proceedings. It appears from the case file that, despite the fact that the enforcement proceedings had been instituted ten days after the delivery of the judgment of 23 June 1998, the Government had taken no action in this connection and had not advanced any justification for nonenforcement of the judgment in question during this period.",

Azerbaijan, no. 19853/03, \u00a7\u00a7 45-50, 27\u00a0September 2007). The Court found in that case that the order on the postponement of the judgment's execution without any lawful basis and justification was in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention; the Court further found that it was not necessary to examine the same complaint under Article 6 in that case. Unlike that case, in the present case the order on the postponement of the execution of the judgment was taken approximately nine years after the judgment became final and enforceable. The Court notes that in the instant case the postponement of the execution of the judgment was based on the Presidential Order of 1 July 2004. The Court notes, however, that this Presidential Order did not contain any specific provisions on civil procedure vesting the domestic courts with the competence to postpone indefinitely the execution of judicial eviction orders, which is what happened in the present case. Moreover, the Law of 21 May 1999 provided that if the settlement of the IDPs of their own accord infringed the rights and lawful interests of other persons, the domestic authorities must ensure the resettlement of the IDPs in other accommodation. Accordingly, the relevant presidential order appeared to be contradictory to the legislative act possessing superior force; in such circumstances, a question arises as to the lawfulness of the postponement order based on this Presidential Order. However, from the standpoint of Article 6 of the Convention, the Court is not concerned with the question whether such postponement was \u201clawful\u201d under the domestic law. The Court reiterates that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention would be illusory if the Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party (see \u00a7 35 above). Moreover, a formal postponement of execution of a final judgment for an indefinite period of time without compelling reasons is incompatible with the principle of legal certainty.",
