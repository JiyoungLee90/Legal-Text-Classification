At hearings held in December 1982 the court informed the applicant that the repossession claim had to be lodged within one year from the date on which possession had been infringed and requested him to lodge a claim for acquisition of the land by prescription. The initial proceedings were stayed pending the examination of this claim.
On 28 June 1983 the Piotrków Trybunalski District Court confirmed that the applicant had acquired title to the estate and on 3 August 1983 the applicant requested that the proceedings be resumed.
Upon the Tuszyn Municipality Office’s claim that the land at stake had been in perpetual usufruct and hence there was no point in taking it from the current users, the District Court decided not to resume the proceedings and stayed them to allow the possibility of a friendly settlement of the case to be explored.
On 23 March 1987 the applicant requested the resumption of the proceedings as a settlement had not been reached.
On 8 April, 10 May and 7 June 1988 hearings were held.
On 1 July 1988 the proceedings were stayed due to the intervention of the perpetual user of the land.
On 17 November 1992 the applicant complained to the President of the Piotrków Trybunalski District Court that her request of 1 June 1992 to resume the proceedings had not received a response from the court. On 18 February 1993 the proceedings were resumed.
A hearing scheduled for 20 September 1993 was cancelled due to the illness of the judge.

On 7 May 1994 the President of the Piotrków Trybunalski District Court, in reply to the applicant’s administrative hierarchical complaint, found the length of the proceedings to be excessive.
By its decision of 11 May 1994 the Piotrków Trybunalski District Office was summoned to take part in the proceedings, but in a letter of 18 May 1994 it stated that it was not competent to take part and referred to the Tuszyn Management Board as the competent authority.
On 14 June 1994 the Piotrków Trybunalski District Court delivered a judgment, ordering that the estate be restored to the applicant and dismissing the remainder of her claim against the State Treasury.
On 25 April 1995 the  dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
