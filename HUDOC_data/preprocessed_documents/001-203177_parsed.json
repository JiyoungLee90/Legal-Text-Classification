Any order to block access to content should be as narrowly targeted as possible and be the least restrictive means to deal with the alleged unlawful activity. It must take into consideration the overall effectiveness of the measure and the risks of \u201cover-blocking\u201d other lawful content, including by reference to the technologies available to comply with the order. The interveners cited judgments from European high courts, which concurred that blocking websites by IP address carried a greater risk of undesirable effects on third parties and of \u201cover-blocking\u201d (they cited the Antwerp Court of Appeals judgment of 26 September 2011 in VZW Belgian Anti-Piracy Federation v.\u00a0NV Telenet, 2010/AR/2541; two United Kingdom High Court judgments, Dramatico Entertainment Limited & Ors v.

Consistent with international standards, the law should provide for the following procedural standards: (i) blocking should be ordered by a court or an independent adjudicatory body; (ii) ISPs and other interested parties should be given the opportunity to intervene in proceedings in which a blocking order is sought; (iii) users and victims of collateral blocking should have the right to challenge, after the fact, the blocking order; (iv) anyone attempting to access the blocked website should be able to see the legal basis and reasons for the blocking order and information about avenues of appeal.",

As of 28 June 2017, 6,522,629 Internet resources had been blocked in Russia, of which 6,335,850 \u2013 or 97% \u2013 had been blocked collaterally, that is to say, without legal justification. At various times, due to collateral blocking, Russian users were not able to access widely-used Internet services such as Google, Wikipedia, Web Archive, Reddit, Amazon Web Services and Disney. In addition, the Russian blocking system had vulnerabilities that facilitated over-blocking and abuse, such as the possibility to change unilaterally the IP address of a blocked website to the IP address of any other website, rendering it immediately unavailable for Russian users. An approach to website blocking which was based on the principle of proportionality called for an assessment of the positive and negative effects of a blocking order in each particular case and the choice of the method of its implementation. If it was predictable that ISPs would choose the IP address blocking technique because of its lower cost, the State should bear a higher burden in order to create conditions for a human-rights compliant manner of blocking content.",

This was an incidental effect of a State agency\u2019s decision to block access to another website which was hosted on the same server and had the same IP address as the applicant\u2019s website. The Court reiterates that measures blocking access to websites are bound to have an influence on the accessibility of the Internet and, accordingly, engage the responsibility of the respondent State under Article 10 (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053).",

He was unable to share the latest developments and news about electronic publishing, while visitors to his website were prevented from accessing the entire website content. It follows that the blocking measure in question amounted to \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d with the right to receive and impart information, since Article 10 guarantees not only the right to impart information but also the right of the public to receive it (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 55, and Cengiz and Others, cited above, \u00a7 56).

In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention, and indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v.

The Russian authorities relied on that provision to block access to an online collection of cannabisthemed stories known as \u201cThe Rastaman Tales\u201d. The Court notes with concern that section 15.1 allows the authorities to target an entire website without distinguishing between the legal and illegal content it may contain. Reiterating that the wholesale blocking of access to an entire website is an extreme measure which has been compared to banning a newspaper or television station, the Court considers that a legal provision giving an executive agency so broad a discretion carries a risk of content being blocked arbitrarily and excessively (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above).",

However, the law did not require Roskomnadzor to check whether that address was used by more than one website or to establish the need for blocking by IP address. That manner of proceeding could, and did in the circumstances of the present case, have the practical effect of extending the scope of the blocking order far beyond the illegal content which had been originally targeted (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7 63). In fact, as the applicant and third-party interveners pointed out, millions of websites have remained blocked in Russia for the sole reason that they shared an IP address with some other websites featuring illegal content (see paragraphs 23 and 31 above).",

Whichever shared-hosting platform solution the applicant were to choose, he would incur the risk that the Russian authorities would declare illegal some content of co-hosted websites and that the owners of such websites and the hosting service provider would not heed their takedown orders.

In the instant case, Roskomnadzor gave effect to a decision by which a drug-control agency had determined the content of the offending website to be illegal. Both the original determination and Roskomnadzor\u2019s implementing orders had been made without any advance notification to the parties whose rights and interests were likely to be affected. The blocking measures had not been sanctioned by a court or other independent adjudicatory body providing a forum in which the interested parties could have been heard. Nor did the Russian law call for any impact assessment of the blocking measure prior to its implementation.

In reaching their decision, the courts confined their scrutiny to establishing that Roskomnadzor had acted in accordance with the letter of the law. However, in the Court\u2019s view, a Convention-compliant review should have taken into consideration, among other elements, the fact that such a measure, by rendering large quantities of information inaccessible, substantially restricted the rights of Internet users and had a significant collateral effect (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066).",

When exceptional circumstances justify the blocking of illegal content, a State agency making the blocking order must ensure that the measure strictly targets the illegal content and has no arbitrary or excessive effects, irrespective of the manner of its implementation. Any indiscriminate blocking measure which interferes with lawful content or websites as a collateral effect of a measure aimed at illegal content or websites amounts to arbitrary interference with the rights of owners of such websites. In the light of its examination of the Russian legislation as applied in the instant case, the Court concludes that the interference resulted from the application of the procedure under section\u00a015.1 of the Information Act which did not satisfy the foreseeability requirement under the Convention and did not afford the applicant the degree of protection from abuse to which he was entitled by the rule of law in a democratic society (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067).
