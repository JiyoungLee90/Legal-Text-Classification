In 2007 its members decided to discontinue registration on grounds of alleged pressure and intimidation from the State. In particular, they complained of the refusal of the Ministry of Justice to register amendments to the organisation's articles of association, the repeated freezing of its bank account, arbitrary arrest of its members, attempts to shut down its newspaper and other such interferences. Several of the organisation's leaders requested political asylum in western countries and it was decided to continue the activity under the same name but without being registered with the State authorities. It was also decided that the new unincorporated association would become the former organisation's successor. After the striking of the organisation out of the Government's list of non-governmental organisations, on 2 June 2008, Hyde Park's activity continued on the basis of new articles of association and all the activities were carried on. The association continued editing its newspaper and its internet page and continued staging protests and demonstrations.",

Moreover, they submitted that they had been told by a representative of the local authorities that the Municipality did not have time to deal with their request and that they could hold their protest as planned. The court dismissed the applicants' submissions and found that they had breached the provision of section 11(1) of the Assemblies Act by failing to submit the application within fifteen days in advance of the planned assembly. According to the court, the protest should have been held on 14 September 2007 at the earliest. Ghenadie and Oleg Brega were found guilty of organising an unauthorised demonstration and fined 800 Moldovan lei (MDL) each (approximately 48 euros (EUR)). Another Hyde Park member who is not applicant in the present case was fined MDL 200. The applicants' appeal was dismissed by the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal on the same grounds on 23 October 2007.",

The Government recalled that Hyde Park had been dissolved on 22 April 2007 so, when the demonstration took place on 4 September 2007, the other applicants could not be members of the organisation. The Government further submitted that, in his application for authorisation of 30 August 2007, Mr Juraveli had applied as a natural person (personne physique) and not for Hyde Park. This was confirmed by the authorisation granted by the Municipality to Mr Juraveli. He had not drawn the authorities' attention to the fact that he was applying for authorisation on behalf of Hyde Park or sought to challenge the terms of the Muncipality's authorisation. There was simply no link between Mr Juraveli as organiser of the demonstration and Hyde Park: it was immaterial that he was vice-president of Hyde Park. Consequently, Hyde Park could not be a victim for the purposes of Article\u00a011. Moreover, it was also clear from the police reports of the demonstration, which the Government submitted to the Court, that Mr\u00a0Juraveli had not participated in the demonstration of 4 September. He could not be a victim, nor could the other applicants.",

That objection was dismissed on the grounds that the other applicants had participated in the demonstration and had been arrested and detained by the police. In the present case, the Government make the opposite objection: that only Mr Juraveli had applied for authorisation so Hyde Park could not be a victim. The Court considers that it is evident from the case file, in particular Mr Juraveli's application for authorisation of 30 August 2007 and his addition of the words below his signature \u201cvice-president of the association Hyde Park\u201d, that he was applying on behalf of Hyde Park. Moreover, the Court considers it well-established in its case-law that associations can be victims of an interference with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly: see, for example, The Gypsy Council and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 66336/01, 14 May 2002; Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v.

If Mr Juraveli did not attend the demonstration, there could be no interference with his Article 11 rights. It would stretch the concept of a victim too far to find that it applied to anyone who argued that he would have gone to a demonstration had it gone ahead. To do so would be to allow an indeterminate number of people to complain that their Article 11 rights had been violated (see, mutatis mutandis, Patyi and Others v. Hungary, no. 5529/05, \u00a7\u00a7 25-28, 7 October 2008, where the authorities refused authorisation for a demonstration which did not then take place: the Court found the organiser of the planned demonstration was a victim but not forty-seven other applicants who stated they would have participated in the demonstration). The Court acknowledges that Mr Juraveli is closely connected to Hyde Park and to its demonstrations; indeed it was he who sought authorisation to hold a demonstration between 4 and 11\u00a0September. However, he has provided no evidence to indicate when he arrived at the scene of the demonstration, nor has he shown that he attempted to avail himself of his right to peaceful assembly that day and was prevented from doing so by the authorities; the fact that he was arrested at later demonstrations is relevant only to his victim status in respect of those demonstrations. The Court therefore upholds the Government's preliminary objection and declares that part of the application concerning Mr Juraveli and the demonstration of 4 September 2007 inadmissible.",

The former complaint was rejected on 19 September 2007 and the latter complaint never received a reply. Moreover, the Government have not suggested that these were inappropriate or ineffective remedies. The Court reiterates that, for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies, an applicant is not required to try more than one avenue of redress when there are several available (see Breabin v. Moldova, no. 12544/08, \u00a7 33, 7 April 2009). Accordingly, the Government's preliminary objection that the applicants should have also tried to complain on the basis of section 7 of the Code of Administrative Contraventions or taken proceedings on the basis of Articles 32 and 40 of the Constitution must be dismissed.",

                                                "content": "34.\u00a0\u00a0For the demonstration of 10 September, it is correct that, although Mr Oleg Brega complained to the Prosecutor General in respect of the actions of the police on 30 August and 4 September 2007, the same step was not taken in respect of the actions of the police on 10 September 2007. As the applicants have stated, nothing happened when they complained to the Prosecutor General about the actions of the police at the demonstrations of 30 August and 4 September. The Court considers, therefore, that it was reasonable for the applicants to consider that a similar complaint in respect of the demonstration of 10 September 2007 would have had no prospects of success (see, mutatis mutandis, Castravet v. Moldova, no. 23393/05, \u00a7 25, 13 March 2007). However, the mere fact that one domestic remedy is ineffective (and therefore does not need to be exhausted) does not absolve an applicant of the duty to exhaust other remedies which may prove effective. Consequently, the Court must also examine whether the second remedy suggested by the Government, an action based on Article 14 of the Civil Code and Law no. 1545 would have been effective. The Court observes that the principal difference between the demonstration of 10\u00a0September 2007 and those of 30 August and 4 September is that, for the former, administrative proceedings were brought by the police and discontinued by the Centru District Court on 21 September 2007. Therefore, it would, in theory, have been open to the applicants to commence proceedings for damages under Law no. 1545 (see, by converse implication, Sarban v. , no. 3456/05, \u00a7 59, 4 October 2005). Nonetheless, as in any case concerning the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, namely, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Demopoulos and others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46113/99 and others, 1 March 2010; Apostol v. Georgia, no.\u00a040765/02, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2006XIV; and X. v. Ireland (dec.), no.\u00a014079/04, 15 December 2009, with further references). The Court is not persuaded that the Government have met that burden in the present case. In particular, they have failed to provide any examples of successful actions based on Article 14 of the Civil Code and Law no. 1545 which would indicate that an action brought by the applicants would have stood a reasonable prospect of success. Consequently, the Court is unable to find that the applicants should have brought such an action and, accordingly, it rejects the Government's preliminary objection in respect of the demonstration of 10 September 2007.",

They relied on their preliminary objection that only Mr\u00a0Juraveli had applied for authorisation to demonstrate. Moreover, the applicants had failed to follow the statutory procedures for obtaining authorisation. The applicants were seasoned protestors and thus familiar with those procedures; mere disagreement with the law was not a reason for disobeying it. Since 31 August 2007 was a public holiday and 1 and 2\u00a0September were a Saturday and Sunday, 4 September was only the second working day after the application for authorisation: this demonstrated the bad faith of the applicants. Even if there were an interference it was prescribed by law: section 11 of the Assemblies Act provided that demonstrations could only take place if fifteen days' notice had been given to the relevant municipality. That notice period was reasonable within the terms of the Court's judgment in B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland, no.\u00a01543/06, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2007VI and it was accessible and foreseeable. It pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of disorder or crime and was necessary in a democratic society. The applicants had been taken to an administrative court \u2013 not a criminal one \u2013 and they had been given fines which were only 80% of the maximum fine which could have been imposed. This was a proportionate fine. The Court's observations in Ziliberberg v. Moldova (dec.), no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004 were apposite: since States had the right to require authorisation, they had to be able to apply sanctions to those who participated in demonstrations that did not comply with that requirement. The need for prior authorisation was particularly important because authorisation then imposed a number of duties on the municipality to ensure that the demonstration passed off peacefully, for example by protecting the demonstration from counter-demonstrations. Moreover, the District Court had examined diligently whether authorisation had been obtained and whether the Municipality had complied with the relevant deadlines imposed on it by the Assemblies Act.",

In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, mutatis mutandis, Jersild v.

The applicants, when asked, had produced the authorisation papers. It has not been suggested that those papers were not in order and it remains unclear as to why a further identity check was necessary. In the Court's opinion, even assuming that such a check were necessary, as the applicants have observed, it could have been carried out at the demonstration, or shortly after it had ended. Instead, by arresting the demonstrators and taking them to the police station, the demonstration was ended prematurely. Furthermore, in terms of the justification for the arrests, the Court finds that little relevance can be attached to the provocative nature of the demonstration. The applicants sought to protest against alleged harassment by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The street outside the Ministry was clearly the most appropriate place to carry out such a protest. Even if their signs and chants were calculated to insult the Minister, he was clearly a public figure of some prominence in Moldova. In a democratic society, greater tolerance should be shown to those expressing opinions which are critical of such figures, even if those opinions are expressed inarticulately or intemperately. As the Court stated in Sergey Kuznetsov v. Russia, no.\u00a010877/04, \u00a7 45, 23 October 2008: \u201cany measures interfering with the freedom of assembly and expression other than in cases of incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles \u2013 however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words used may appear to the authorities \u2013 do a disservice to democracy and often even endanger it.\u201d For these reasons, the Court concludes that the arrest of the four men was disproportionate and thus that it was not necessary in a democratic society. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention in respect of the demonstration of 30 August 2007.",

The applicant in that case was a student who had participated in an unauthorised demonstration, who had been arrested and detained for five and a half hours and who had later been given an administrative fine of MDL 36 (EUR 3). The Court, in finding the Article 11 complaint to be manifestly ill-founded, noted that the penalty was at the lower end of the scale and, while it was heavy relative to the applicant's revenue (a monthly stipend of MDL 50-60), it did not appear to be disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",

However, there is no evidence to suggest that the group in question represented a danger to public order, apart from possibly disrupting traffic. The Court was particularly struck by the authorities' impatience in seeking to end the demonstration and considered the police's forceful intervention to have been disproportionate. The Court reached similar conclusions in Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others v. Turkey, no. 25/02, 29 November 2007, where the police dispersed an unlawful but peaceful demonstration, allegedly with truncheons and tear gas, in Ek\u015fi and Ocak v. , no. 44920/04, 23\u00a0February 2010, and in Ayta\u015f and Others v. , no. 6758/05, 8\u00a0December 2009, where the applicants suffered serious injuries at the hands of the poilce.",

Upon hearing a sharp noise, and considering that it posed a threat to the reception, the police forced the demonstrators to a nearby park. The Court found that a prior-authorisation procedure did not normally encroach upon the essence of the right to peaceful assembly. However, in special circumstances when an immediate response, in the form of a demonstration, to a political event might be justified, a decision to disband the ensuing, peaceful assembly solely because of the absence of the requisite prior notice, without any illegal conduct by the participants, amounted to a disproportionate restriction on freedom of peaceful assembly.",

The right to hold spontaneous demonstrations could override the obligation to give prior notification to public assemblies only in special circumstances, namely if an immediate response to a current event was warranted in the form of a demonstration. In particular, such derogation from the general rule (of prior notification) could be justified if a delay would have rendered that response obsolete. In that case, there were no such special circumstances and the fact that the police did not break up the demonstration for several hours was a further reason for the finding of no violation.",

In contrast to Bukta, cited above, and in common with \u00c9va Moln\u00e1r, there are no special circumstances which would have justified an immediate response from the present applicants in the form of an unauthorised demonstration.

In Rai and Evans, the security zone in which the applicants demonstrated was a further reason for the proportionality of the sanction. By contrast, in the present case, no security zone existed at the site of the demonstration of 4 September 2007 and, consequently, the location of the demonstration was not, in itself, a relevant or sufficient reason for breaking it up. In Skiba, the police did not take any steps to break up the demonstration and the sanction was only imposed later and only then as a preventative measure; in the present case, Ghenadie and Oleg Brega were arrested in the course of the demonstration. Most importantly, the Court is struck by the level of fines imposed on Ghenadie and Oleg Brega. In contrast to the fines imposed in Rai and Evans and Skibu, these fines were not at the lower end of the scale: they were 80% of the maximum fines which could have been imposed and, moreover, were over twenty times the fine imposed and found by the Court to be proportionate in Ziliberberg. For these reasons, the Court concludes that the arrest of Ghenadie and Oleg Brega and the fines imposed upon them were disproportionate and thus were not necessary in a democratic society. Accordingly, there has also been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention in respect of the demonstration of 4 September 2007.",

From the video of the demonstration submitted by the applicants it is clear that, when asked, the applicants provided the police with the authorisation of the Municipality. It is also clear that, in the course of the eighteen-minute video, several police officers checked that authorisation and questioned the applicants, including Mr Juraveli. In the Court's opinion, that should have been enough to satisfy the police that the demonstration could go ahead; it is wholly unclear to the Court what further enquiries could have been made at the police station in order for the police to satisfy themselves that the demonstration was being conducted within the terms of the authorisation.",

The video does show a passer-by remonstrating with one demonstrator but that took place in the few first minutes of the demonstration and the passer-by had left the demonstration long before the police decided to arrest the applicants. For the most part, the video shows that the demonstration took place in the most peaceful manner possible and with minimal disruption to the public. It was well conducted and restrained. Although slogans were shouted in the course of the demonstration, this is a well established feature of peaceful protest. Moreover, in the context of the case, where the applicants had already been twice arrested for carrying out demonstrations, the Court readily understands their desire to do so. In failing to allow the applicants to conduct their peaceful demonstration, the police failed to show the necessary tolerance which is to be expected of the authorities in a democratic society. For those reasons, the Court finds that the arrest of Mr\u00a0Juraveli, Mr Oleg Brega and Mr Hristea-Stan on 10 September 2007 was disproportionate and thus that it was not necessary in a democratic society. Accordingly, there has also been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention in respect of the demonstration of 10 September 2007.",

Having regard to the fact that the present case involved three separate demonstrations, albeit of a more limited nature than the demonstration in Hyde Park (no. 4), it considers a higher award is justified. Ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards Hyde Park EUR 6,000. This should be paid to the applicants' representative, Mr Oleg Brega, to be held and managed on behalf of Hyde Park. For the individual applicants, having regard to the fact that, in the course of the three demonstrations, Mr Ghenadie Brega, Mr Juraveli, and Mr Hristea-Stan were arrested and detained twice and Mr Oleg Brega was arrested three times, the Court, ruling on an equitable basis, awards EUR\u00a02,000 each to Mr Ghenadie Brega, Mr Juraveli, and Mr Hristea-Stan and EUR 3,000 to Mr Oleg Brega.",
