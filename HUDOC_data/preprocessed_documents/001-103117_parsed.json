Furthermore, the applicants considered that the version of the events adopted by the authorities, which had led to Mr B.I.'s lenient punishment, namely that Mr\u00a0Gerasimov and his companions had been the first to attack and that Mr\u00a0B.I. had hit Mr Gerasimov only once, acting in self defence, had been unconvincing and was contrary to the evidence gathered. They indicated firstly that the post-mortem examination of Mr Gerasimov had found several wounds on his head and numerous wounds and bruises on the body (see paragraph 18 above). Furthermore, they noted that the authorities' version did not explain the fact that Mr Gerasimov had been hit on the back of the head with considerable force, given that, in the authorities' view, he had been wrestling face to face with Mr B.I. They also pointed out that it had been Mr Gerasimov's companions who had called the police to report that their companion had been beaten up, whereas Mr. B.I. and his companions had gone into hiding (see paragraphs 9-10 and 33 above). Lastly, the applicants argued that the authorities' version of the events did not explain why, if they were not looking for a fight, Mr B.I. and his companions had deliberately driven to the place where the Mr Gerasimov and his companions were. The area was open ground and they could easily have seen the horse they alleged they had been looking for if it had been in the area (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above).",

The applicants also stated that the authorities were wrong not to have obtained a more detailed report from Mr\u00a0Gerasimov's post-mortem examination and not to have taken other steps to establish the circumstances, such as, for example, examining the footprints at the site of the fight, which could have revealed the movements of the participants in the fight.",

It must therefore assess whether Mr B.I.'s conviction and sentence provided the applicants with appropriate and sufficient redress, that is, whether the investigation that led to this outcome was effective (see Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 56).

However, Article 237 \u00a7 6 of the Code provided that the prosecutor in charge was not required to adopt any formal decision to discontinue criminal proceedings in part in cases where the charges against the same person and in respect of the same facts were only being amended. This corresponded to an earlier interpretative decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 51 above). It appears that the situation in the present case, where the initial charges against Mr B.I., of murder committed in an especially cruel manner and with extreme ferocity were substituted with new charges, of causing death by a disproportionate reaction to an attack, fell under Article 237 \u00a7 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Nevertheless, the prosecutor adopted the decision to discontinue in part the proceedings to which the Government referred. While it is not for the Court to interpret national legislation and assess the legal effect of that decision, it notes that domestic law did not require it, viewing the charges as an unstable element, dependent on the course of the investigation, and their amendment as a mere adjustment and not a formal stage of the investigation (see paragraph 51 above). In view of that, and also noting that the Government have not presented any evidence which could persuade it to consider otherwise, the Court has serious doubts as to whether the domestic courts would have indeed admitted for examination an appeal by the applicants against the decision of 25 May 2004.",

That obligation requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have died in violent or suspicious circumstances, even if there is no indication that the death is due to State action (see, concerning interprisoner violence, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2002II; concerning homicides by prisoners benefiting from early release or social reintegration schemes, Mastromatteo v.

The Court is struck by the fact that in reaching that conclusion the authorities manifestly failed to take into account important evidence collected during the investigation. The Court refers, first of all, to the results of Mr\u00a0Gerasimov's post-mortem, which found a multi-fragment fracture of the skull, numerous wounds on the head and wounds and bruises on the body (see paragraph 18 above). Mr Gerasimov's hospital report of 31 May 2003 also indicated that he had four wounds to the head (see paragraph 11 above). For the Court, these findings alone, indicative of repeated blows and not of a single one, as accepted by the authorities, would have been sufficient to refute their version of the events. Furthermore, Mr Gerasimov's post-mortem found a multi-fragment fracture with a depression of the parietal bone (see paragraph 18 above), which might indicate that he had been hit in the back of the head with considerable force.

In adopting the version disputed by the applicants, the authorities failed to take into account other relevant facts established during the investigation, namely, that Mr N.S. had admitted that the group had been carrying wooden bats, that two bats and a knife had been found in his car (see paragraph 16 above), and that, furthermore, it was the van used by Mr Gerasimov and his companions which had been seriously damaged (see paragraph 13 above). Although this evidence could be seen as disproving the authorities' conclusions, they disregarded it completely. Furthermore, they never sought to explain how Mr Gerasimov had suffered numerous wounds and bruises or why there had been blood in the van used by him and his companions, which was not his but could have been Mr\u00a0B.I.'s (see paragraph 13 above).",

There were, in the first place, the testimonies of Mr V.V. and Mr I.I., who explained that Mr\u00a0Z.E. had been the first to attack Mr Gerasimov with a wooden bat.

In the second place, it is noteworthy that Mr Z.E., Mr P.K. and  attempted to abscond after Mr Gerasimov had been beaten up (see paragraphs 10 and 33 above). They were even briefly arrested (see paragraph 33 above). However, notwithstanding the existence of evidence indicating that the three of them could have been involved and their own suspicious behaviour, and the investigator's initial assessment that there existed a reasonable suspicion that they could have acted as accessories in Mr Gerasimov's beating up, which led to their arrests, they were never investigated (ibid.).",

The latter had been an eyewitness to the fight and had testified that he had recognised Mr B.I. and seen him grappling with someone else, who had then delivered a blow with a knife (see paragraphs 31 and 40 above). However, the prosecuting authorities did nothing to verify this key testimony, regardless of the fact that its credibility could appear doubtful, given that he had observed the fight from a considerable distance while driving (see paragraph 31 above). Moreover, although the prosecuting authorities found a knife (see paragraph 15 above), they did not take fingerprints from it, did not verify whether it had been the one Mr B.I. had been stabbed with and did not attempt to explain how it had ended up in Mr\u00a0N.S.'s car.

It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism and racist violence, thereby reinforcing democracy's vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 145, ECHR 2005VII). Furthermore, when investigating violent incidents, States have the duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any racist motive and to establish whether ethnic hatred or prejudice may have played a role in the events (ibid., \u00a7 160). However, while the authorities' duty to investigate the existence of a possible link between racist attitudes and an act of violence may be seen as implicit in their responsibilities under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 2 to secure the enjoyment of the right to life without discrimination, it is also an aspect of their procedural obligations arising under Article 2 alone. Owing to the interplay of the two Articles, issues such as those in the present case may fall to be examined under one of the them only, with no separate issue arising under the other, or may require examination under both. This is a question to be decided in each case on its facts and depending on the nature of the allegations made (ibid., \u00a7 161).",
