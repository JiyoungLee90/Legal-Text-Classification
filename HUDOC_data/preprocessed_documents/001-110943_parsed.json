Furthermore, they explicitly claimed non-exhaustion in respect of the third applicant. In this connection the Court recalls that the exhaustion requirement in respect of the length remedy provided for in the Courts Act of 2008 concerns applications that post-date the Adzi-Spirkoska and Others case. There is no such requirement in respect of cases already pending before it unless the impugned proceedings have not ended yet and the applicants can use the length remedy before the Supreme Court. The Court reaffirms that as regards length cases pending before it where applicants have used the length remedy, such as the first and third applicants, any redress provided by the Supreme Court shall be assessed through the prism of whether the applicants can still be considered to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see Ad\u017ei-Spirkoska and others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), nos. 38914/05 and 17879/05, 3 November 2011). Consequently, that the first applicant did not challenge the decision of the first-instance panel of the Supreme Court and that the third applicant\u2019s length remedy was rejected on procedural grounds do not have any bearing on their victim status in respect of the alleged violation complained of before the Court. The applicants can accordingly still claim to be \u201cvictims\u201d of a breach of their right to a hearing within a reasonable time. Consequently, the Government\u2019s objections must be dismissed.",

In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers that the sum claimed by the first applicant in respect of costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before it should be awarded in full, plus any tax that may be chargeable to it. It further finds the amount claimed by the second applicant under this head to be excessive and partly unsubstantiated, and awards instead the sum of EUR\u00a01,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable to her (see Spasovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 45150/05, \u00a7 45, 10 June 2010). Lastly, it rejects the third applicant\u2019s claim under this head since she did not submit any supporting documents or particulars. It also makes no award in respect of her claim for the costs and expenses incurred in the domestic proceedings since they were not incurred in seeking the prevention and redress through the domestic legal order of the alleged violation complained of before the Court (see Milo\u0161evi\u0107 v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 15056/02, \u00a7\u00a034, 20 April 2006).",
