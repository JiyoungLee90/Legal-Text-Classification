It observes that the investigator\u2019s decisions not to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment were set aside on at least six occasions by the supervising prosecutor and additional pre-investigation inquiries were ordered (see paragraph 23 above). In those circumstances, the Court is not convinced that an appeal to a court, which could only have had the same effect, would have offered the applicant any redress. It considers, therefore, that such an appeal in the particular circumstances of the present case would have been devoid of any purpose. The Court finds that the applicant was not obliged to pursue that remedy and holds that the Government\u2019s objection should therefore be dismissed (see Chumakov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a091; Khatsiyeva and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a05108/02, \u00a7\u00a0151, 17\u00a0January 2008; and Esmukhambetov and Others v.

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of the result to be achieved, but one of means employed. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see Tyagunova v. Russia, no.\u00a019433/07, \u00a7\u00a065, 31\u00a0July 2012). In cases under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v.

During that period, which amounted to approximately two and a half years, at least seven decisions were taken by the domestic authorities refusing the institution of criminal proceedings against police officers or any other people for lack of evidence that a crime had been committed. All these decisions, except the last one, were quashed by the supervising prosecutor as unfounded, and additional pre-investigation inquiries were ordered. As a result of its refusal to open a criminal case, the domestic investigating authority has therefore never conducted a preliminary investigation into the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment, that is, a fully-fledged criminal investigation in which the whole range of investigative measures are carried out, such as questioning, formal confrontations and identification parades (see paragraph 23 above).",

The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way, without restriction as to the possibility to put all the relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings. The facilities which should be enjoyed by people charged with a criminal offence include the opportunity to acquaint themselves, for the purposes of preparing their defence, with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings. The issue of adequacy of time and facilities afforded to an accused must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of each particular case (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0574 and 579).",

The case file was withdrawn from the defence on 2 October 2006 (see paragraph 56 above). The Court further notes that subsequently, in the course of the trial, the defence was granted additional time to complete their examination of the case file. Namely, the applicant and his lawyer studied the case file between 4\u00a0December and 28 December 2006 and on 5 March 2007 (see paragraphs 60 and 63 above). That means that the defence was allocated a total of six months and fifteen days to study the forty-nine volumes, fifteen audio and video tapes and physical evidence contained in the case file.",
