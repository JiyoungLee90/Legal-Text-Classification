The case originated in an application (no. 24143/11) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Franz Maier GmbH, an Austrian company (“the applicant company”), on 18 April 2011.
The applicant company was represented by Mr Georg Eisenberger, a lawyer practising in Graz. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs.
On 20 December 2013 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant company is a limited liability company with its seat in Bad Gleichenberg, producing building materials of concrete and using crushed stones (Schotter) for this purpose.
On 29 November 2002 the applicant company requested the Steiermark Regional Governor (Landeshauptmann) to issue a licence under the Water Act (wasserrechtliche Genehmigung) for dredging (Nassbaggerung) on its plot.
On 20 May 2003 the Steiermark Regional Governor decided to issue the licence for dredging and imposed certain conditions.
On 31 July 2003 H.P., the owner of the Sicheldorfer mineral water spring appealed against this decision, claiming that the dredging had a negative impact on the spring.
On 8 September 2004 the Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water (Bundesministerium für Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Umwelt und Wasserwirtschaft) (“the Ministry”) ordered the applicant company to submit a plan of the projected dredging area and of all the springs and wells concerned.
On 21 September 2004 the applicant company submitted some plans but stated that it had no knowledge about the location of the spring and H.P. refused to provide the necessary information.
On 13 October 2004 the applicant company submitted further plans to the authorities.
On 23 February 2005 the Ministry served an expert opinion on the applicant company. According to this expert opinion the information submitted by the applicant company was not sufficient to prove that there was no negative impact of dredging on the springs. The applicant company was requested to comment hereon.
On 19 April 2005 the Ministry quashed the decision of the Steiermark Regional Governor and remitted it back to the first instance authority on the grounds that the applicant company had failed to provide sufficient information in order to assess a possible negative impact on the spring.
On 17 May 2005 the Steiermark Regional Governor ordered the applicant company to submit the missing documents.
On 4 October 2005 the applicant company submitted a private expert opinion to the Regional Governor.
On 21 November 2005 an oral hearing was held.
On 13 February 2006 the Steiermark Regional Governor again issued the requested licence for dredging and imposed certain conditions.

On 31 July 2006 the applicant company submitted written comments to the Ministry.
On 25 September 2006 the applicant company complained to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) about the administration’s failure to decide (Säumnisbeschwerde).

On 24 November 2006 the Ministry transmitted another expert’s opinion to the parties and requested the applicant company to submit the missing documents.
On 28 November 2006 the Ministry requested the Administrative Court to extend the deadline for the decision to nine months as the proceedings were not finalised.
On 29 December 2006 the applicant company commented on the recently obtained expert opinion (see paragraph 21 above) claiming, inter alia, that the Ministry failed to determine which missing documents were to be submitted.
On 26 February 2007 the Administrative Court prolonged the deadline for the Ministry until 30 April 2007.
On 13 March 2007 the applicant company submitted another private expert opinion to the Ministry.

On 19 July 2007 the applicant company put forward further submissions in reply to the Ministry’s observations; H.P., the Bad Radkersburg municipality and the Bad Radkersburg spring company replied hereto on 2 August 2007.
On 30 October 2008 the Administrative Court quashed the decision by the Ministry as it was not clarified which documents the applicant company had to submit.

On 27 May 2009 the Administrative Court ordered the Ministry to decide within three months.
On 5 August 2009 the Ministry submitted another expert opinion to the parties and asked the applicant company to submit certain precisely mentioned documents within four weeks.
On 28 August 2009 the applicant company referred to the already submitted private expert opinions and claimed that the mentioned documents were not necessary. In addition, it requested to appoint another expert. Nonetheless, it submitted a supplementary expert opinion.
On 28 September 2009 the Administrative Court extended to 15 months the deadline for the Ministry to decide.
On 12 January 2010 the Ministry requested the Bad Radkersburg municipality and the Bad Radkersburg spring company (H. P.’s appeal had meanwhile been considered to be withdrawn) to submit written observations on the documents recently transmitted by the applicant company.
