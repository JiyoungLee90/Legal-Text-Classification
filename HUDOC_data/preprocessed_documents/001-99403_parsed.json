At the hearing, the applicant's defence counsel filed a motion with the court, arguing that the applicant's placement in a metal cage in the presence of many people, including relatives and friends, amounted to degrading treatment and humiliated him. Furthermore, this violated the principle of equality of arms, because the applicant, being in a cage, was not able to feel equal to the other parties. The fact that the applicant was a detainee was not sufficient justification to keep him in a metal cage during the court hearings. Nor did the law on arrested and detained persons prescribe placement of a detainee in a metal cage in the courtroom. The defence counsel requested the court to release the applicant from the cage and to allow him to be seated in the seats meant for the parties, namely next to his lawyer.",

However, only a few days after his discharge from the hospital the applicant was once again hospitalised \u2013 this time at the medical unit of the detention facility \u2013 since his state of health deteriorated (see paragraph 40 above). Furthermore, the above discharge certificate explicitly stated that the applicant had to undergo regular medical check-ups.

It is not for the Court to speculate whether the heart attack suffered by the applicant was a direct consequence of the failure to provide him with regular medical care.

The fact that a detainee needed and requested such assistance but it was unavailable to him may, in certain circumstances, suffice to reach a conclusion that such treatment was degrading within the meaning of that Article (see Sarban, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 86-87 and 90).",

However, even in the absence of publicity, a given treatment may still be degrading if the victim could be humiliated in his or her own eyes, even if not in the eyes of others (see Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, 25 April 1978, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 26; and Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 100).

Moreover, the applicant had no previous convictions or any record of violent behaviour and was accused of a non-violent crime. Furthermore, it can be inferred from the statements of the prosecutor and the Court of Appeal that the metal cage in the Court of Appeal's courtroom was a permanent installation which served as a dock and that the applicant's placement in it was not necessitated by any real risk of his absconding or resorting to violence but by the simple fact that it was the seat where he, as a defendant in a criminal case, was meant to be seated (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above).",

During this period the applicant was observed by the public, including his family and friends, in a metal cage. The Court considers that such a harsh appearance of judicial proceedings could lead an average observer to believe that an extremely dangerous criminal was on trial. Furthermore, it agrees with the applicant that such a form of public exposure humiliated him in his own eyes, if not in those of the public, and aroused in him feelings of inferiority. Moreover, such humiliating treatment could easily have had an impact on the applicant's powers of concentration and mental alertness during the proceedings bearing on such an important issue as his criminal liability (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, cited above, \u00a7 100).",

In particular, Article 271 \u00a7 1 of the CCP obliged the courts to summon all the persons mentioned in the prosecution's list of witnesses which was annexed to the indictment. The prosecutor did not have to file a motion seeking leave to call these persons and the question of whether they had to be called was not a matter of consideration by the court. On the other hand, if the defence wanted to call witnesses, it had to seek the court's leave, which put the defence on an unequal footing with the prosecution. Article 331 of the CCP invoked by the Government spoke about \u201cnew\u201d evidence and it was true that, as far as the calling of \u201cadditional\u201d witnesses was concerned, the domestic law created equal opportunities for both parties. However, as far as the evidence gathered during the investigation was concerned, including the testimonies of witnesses mentioned in the annex to the indictment, this evidence was subject to examination in court by all means. There has never been a single case in which the courts considered the matter of calling or not calling the persons indicated in the prosecution's list.",

Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003V). The national courts enjoy a margin of appreciation allowing them, with respect for the Convention requirements, to establish whether the hearing of witnesses for the defence is likely to be of assistance in discovering the truth and, if not, to decide against the calling of such witnesses (see Payot and Petit v. Switzerland, Commission decision of 2\u00a0September 1991, unreported).

Therefore, it does not find the Court of Appeal's refusal to call additionally that witness unreasonable. As regards accountant S.H., the Court of Appeal justified its refusal with the fact that it was unnecessary to call her in this particular case. The Court does not consider that, in doing so, the Court of Appeal overstepped its margin of appreciation or acted arbitrarily, taking into account that the applicant's conviction was based on numerous pieces of evidence presented and examined in court, including two court-ordered accounting expert opinions and the statements of the relevant accounting experts and accountant K.S (see paragraph 14 above).",
