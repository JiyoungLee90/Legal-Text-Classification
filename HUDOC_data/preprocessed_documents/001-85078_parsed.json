Thus the former Commission had considered that the wish to have one\u2019s ashes scattered on one\u2019s own land was covered by the first concept (see X\u00a0v. Germany, decision of 10 March 1981, no.\u00a08741/79, Decisions and Reports 24, p. 137). Later, in the case of Znamenskaya v.

In the case of Pannullo and Forte v.\u00a0France (no. 37794/97, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2001X), the Court considered the excessive delay by the French authorities in returning the body of their child following an autopsy to be interference with the private and family life of the applicants.

Sweden (no.\u00a061564/00, \u00a7\u00a024, ECHR 2006...), the Court considered that the refusal to authorise the transfer of the urn containing the applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s ashes was a matter falling within the scope of Article 8, without however stating whether the interference found related to the concept of private life or family life.",
