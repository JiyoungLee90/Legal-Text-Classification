Having regard to the fact that the administrative courts did not exercise discretion over the type of interest rate awarded in administrative proceedings, it is clear that an appeal against the judgment of 17 March 2008 would have had no prospects of success in respect of the applicant\u2019s Convention complaint. Therefore the applicant was not required to exhaust this remedy. As regards the Government\u2019s other objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, namely an additional action for further damage under Article 105 of the Code of Obligations, the Court observes that it dismissed a similar objection in the cases of Ok\u00e7u (cited above, \u00a7 67), Gezer v. Turkey (no. 18704/04, \u00a7\u00a036, 6\u00a0October 2009), and more recently, Zeki Kaya v. Turkey (no. 22388/07, \u00a7\u00a047, 12 February 2019).

Turkey, no. 42952/04, \u00a7\u00a016, 26\u00a0January 2010). The compensation was paid to the applicant on 29\u00a0December 2008. The Court reiterates that it has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in a number of applications in which the applicants complained about the insufficiency of the statutory interest rates vis-\u00e0-vis the high monetary inflation rates at a given period in Turkey (see ibid., Aka v. Turkey, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 48, Reports 1998-VI, and Ok\u00e7u, cited above, \u00a7 55). Having regard to the economic data for the period between the years 1996 and 2008, in particular the fact that the statutory interest rates applied between the years 1996 and 1999 was 30%, 50% and 60% respectively, whereas the actual inflation rate varied between 60% and 99%, the Court finds in the present case that the difference between the statutory interest rates applied to the compensation amount and the actual inflation rate must have caused the applicant to sustain financial loss. Consequently the applicant had to bear an individual burden that has upset the fair balance which must be maintained between the demands of the general interest and protection of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions.",

The Court further notes that in the recent case of Kaynar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey (nos.\u00a021104/06 and 2 others, 7 May 2019) where it found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the legislative interference that deprived the applicants of the possibility to obtain the registration of their land, it decided to strike out the part of the application relating to Article 41 of the Convention on the basis that the Compensation Commission could decide the question in a better-informed manner (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-78). In reaching that conclusion, the Court took into account the real difficulty it faced in calculating the pecuniary loss suffered by the applicants, since it was ill-equipped to determine from its seat in Strasbourg the amount corresponding to the value of the land in question at the time of the deprivation of the property, as well as the difficulty in assessing factors pertaining to the national context such as fluctuations in the value of the property over time. Moreover, the Court could not rely on the expert reports and the striking differences between the amounts proposed by those experts regarding the value of the land as those reports had not been obtained in an adversarial manner. Emphasising the subsidiary character of the Convention system of human rights protection and the importance of facilitating the performance of the respective tasks of the Court and the Committee of Ministers under Articles 41 and 46 of the Convention, the Court therefore concluded in that case that the Compensation Commission, as the national authority with expertise on compensation, having the appropriate legal and technical means, would be better equipped to calculate the question of compensation.",

However, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the determination of the question of just satisfaction poses no real difficulty for the Court, as the depreciation in value of the money awarded to the applicant by the domestic courts can be calculated by an objective and uncomplicated method which has been used by the Court in similar cases (see paragraph 38 below). Moreover, the Court emphasises that the present application was introduced in July 2008 and that the Court has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on account of a loss incurred by the applicant because of long term inflation not compensated by the statutory interest rate, effectively reducing the real value of the compensation awarded to her for an injury caused by medical negligence in the year 1996. There are thus particularly strong reasons in this case not to prolong the making of an award of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention. Bearing in mind the above considerations, the Court therefore does not see any advantage in prolonging the determination of the question of just satisfaction in the case at hand, which conclusion in no way calls into question the effectiveness of the Compensation Commission. The Court will therefore continue to examine this part of the application.",

According to the inflation calculation tool provided on the website of the Turkish Central Bank, that amount would have been worth approximately TRY 1,634,639 in December 2008 taking into account 19 November 1996 as the date of reference. That being so, the applicant only received a total of TRY 301,753 in December 2008 (that is the initial amount paid by the Ministry minus the amount the applicant had to give back as a result of the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s ruling on the re-calculation of the start date of the interest, see paragraphs\u00a013 and 17 above). The Court will therefore award compensation corresponding to inflation adjustment having regard to its approach in similar cases (see Aka, \u00a7\u00a7 53-57, and Zeki Kaya, \u00a7\u00a7 74-78, both cited above).",
