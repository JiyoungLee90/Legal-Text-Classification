In the Court\u2019s view, the authorities are not entitled to maintain over lengthy periods restrictions on the individual\u2019s freedom of movement without a periodic reassessment of their justification (see Riener, cited above, \u00a7 124). However, in the present case such a reassessment took place only once, at the applicant\u2019s request, which would indicate that the travel ban was in reality an automatic, blanket measure of indefinite duration. The Court considers that this ran counter to the authorities\u2019 duty under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to take appropriate care to ensure that any interference with the applicant\u2019s right to leave  remained justified and proportionate throughout its duration.",
