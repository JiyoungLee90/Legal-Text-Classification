In the present case, they mentioned the necessity to examine a number of expert opinions. The Government further observed that the defendant had delayed the proceedings by failing to cooperate with the experts. Moreover, his written submissions were frequently voluminous. The Government added that the hearings had repeatedly been adjourned due to the parties\u2019 failure to appear. The Government admitted that certain delays in the proceedings had been caused by the experts, but underlined that the courts had always tried to remedy the problematic situation. According to them, the length of the proceedings had been caused by circumstances which could not be imputable to State organs.",
