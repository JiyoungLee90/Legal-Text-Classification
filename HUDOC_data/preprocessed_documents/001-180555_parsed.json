It claimed that the first-instance court had misinterpreted the provisions of the Law on Administrative Proceedings, and thus limited the applicant company\u2019s right of access to a court. The applicant company thought that when the Government had approved the Management Plan, it had been implementing the function of public administration, and that that document had had a direct influence on the applicant company\u2019s rights and obligations, and was thus an individual legal act that had to be examined before the administrative courts. On 28 November 2012 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision of the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court of 23 July 2012. It held that the applicant company had questioned the lawfulness of both the Management Plan and the development plan. The Supreme Administrative Court held that when the Government had approved the Management Plan, it had been carrying out the function of State power. Moreover, the court had already ruled on the issue of the attribution of the Management Plan to the jurisdiction of the administrative courts and had decided that it had not been attributable to those courts (see paragraph 79 below). The court indicated that a legal act could consist of textual and graphic information (tables, drawings, schemes, plans, symbols, emblems). The Constitutional Court had already held that all parts of a legal act were interrelated and were of equal legal effect (see paragraph 77 below). The court further held that the present case was in substance identical to cases already examined by it, and that there were no grounds to reach a different conclusion on the nature of the Management Plan. The court explained that the applicant company could only raise the issue of the lawfulness of the Government Resolution in the context of an individual case regarding violation of its specific rights (by complaining against an individual legal act, by which the Government Resolution and the decisions of the Management Plan would be implemented). It could then ask the court examining that case to refer the issue to the Constitutional Court. The applicant company\u2019s request to organise the procedure to amend the Management Plan so that it included the land in question in the landscape management recreational zone was dismissed because the applicant company had failed to address the authorities or the courts after the approval of the Management Plan.",

The applicant company also asked the court to refer the question of whether the Management Plan was in accordance with the Constitution to the Constitutional Court. The court acknowledged that the authority\u2019s decision had lacked a seal of approval but held that that shortcoming could not be regarded as grounds to overrule the decision. The court also held that the authority had not acted unlawfully, so there were no grounds for awarding the applicant company pecuniary damages. Moreover, domestic law did not require that the Management Plan contain a compensation mechanism for the buildings to be \u201cremoved\u201d. However, the Management Plan in question indicated that an area in Juodkrant\u0117 had been designated to compensate for the losses incurred by the lawful owners of the buildings to be removed. Thus the Management Plan provided for the opportunity to compensate for possible losses. As regards the referral to the Constitutional Court, the court held that the applicant company had mistakenly stated that the decision to remove the buildings had only been indicated in the Management Plan. The court stated that it was a commonly known fact that the applicant company\u2019s buildings had been earmarked for removal at the time the purchase agreement had been concluded, and the applicant company, as a diligent legal entity, should have assessed the legal status of the buildings and the restrictions on their use. The legitimate expectations of the applicant company had not been breached as it had not proved the need to refer the issue to the Constitutional Court. The court also pointed out that the buildings had not been taken from the applicant company for the needs of society (see paragraph 45 below). However, when using them the applicant company had to follow the legal regulations, which established that construction in the area in question was not allowed and that it was attempting to protect its rights in the wrong way. The decision that had had legal consequences for the applicant company had been the decision to privatise the buildings and to sell them to the applicant company.",

In the Curonian Spit, one can still see the remains of landscape where evolutionary processes have ended. There is the ethnographic heritage of the Curonian tribe, which lived in the Curonian Spit for a long time (and which is now extinct). In the relevant documents, the following examples of cultural heritage in the Curonian Spit have been noted: fishermen\u2019s settlements where the interaction of man and nature is, from an ethno-cultural, historical and aesthetic point of view, of exceptional universal value; a wealth of unique works of architecture which, from an artistic and scientific point of view, were of exceptional value; and archaeological sites which are especially significant, owing to villages being swallowed up by moving sand. The particular importance of the Curonian Spit is also reflected by natural and cultural heritage, which is woven together in a picturesque manner and which is related not only to material or spiritual aspects, but also to the experience gained by every generation of the local people. This helps to rebuild the lost natural ecosystems of the Curonian Spit.",

In respect of that complaint, the applicant company pursued a number of available legal remedies before the administrative and judicial authorities (see paragraphs 12, 16-19, 23-24, 31, 33-34, 27, 39 and 41 above). It also applied for compensation for the pecuniary damage it had sustained as a result of the fact that it had been unable to do anything with the buildings (see paragraph 34 above). The domestic courts never stated that the authorities had acted unlawfully by including the buildings in the list of objects to be privatised and the Court is not convinced that the remedy under Article 6.271 of the Civil Code, referred to by the Government, would have been effective. The Court further observes that the Government refers in this respect to a decision by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court from 2016 while the application was lodged by the applicant company before the Court in 2014. The Court does not see how the remedy under Article 6.271 of the Civil Code would have been effective at the material time. The Court thus dismisses the Government\u2019s objection in this respect.",

The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2000-I, and Sargsyan v.\u00a0Azerbaijan [GC], no. 40167/06, \u00a7 217, ECHR 2015).",

Subsequently, the Management Plan (see paragraphs 26 and 53 above) and relevant domestic regulations proscribed any construction in the area where the applicant company\u2019s buildings were located. In fact, the only legal action the applicant company could take with regard to the buildings was to demolish or resell them. The inability to develop his or her own property constitutes a limitation of the rights normally enjoyed by a property owner (see Matczy\u0144ski v.

The applicant company\u2019s buildings were designated for demolition in 1994. It cannot be said that the applicant company was deprived of its possessions. Moreover, contrary to its statements, it did not look after the buildings as required by domestic law, which resulted in an inspection (see paragraphs 32 and 57 above) and the requirement to repair the buildings and to remove the parts that were falling down. That cannot be regarded as equivalent to carrying out major repair work (see paragraph 55 above). The Court therefore considers that the applicant company\u2019s ownership right with respect to the buildings did not disappear. The restrictions thus may be regarded as measures to control the use of property (see Potomska and Potomski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 33949/05, \u00a7 63, 29\u00a0March 2011).

Although a number of provisions of the development plan have been changed by the Management Plan in 2012, the provisions concerning the applicant company\u2019s buildings remained unchanged since 1994 (see paragraph 40 above). The Court thus considers that the applicant company knew, or should reasonably have known, that under the domestic law in force at the time when it bought the buildings in question, the property was designated for demolition and although the date of the demolition had not been set, it had to take place at some point in time. The whole text and schemes of the development plan were accessible to all those who wanted to access them (see paragraph 69 above). The applicant company thus could not reasonably have expected to obtain planning permission to redevelop the buildings, in particular to reconstruct them by changing their designation, function or size, even if such possibility might have been considered at some point in time (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above) and must already have accepted the risk at the time of purchase because the demolition had to take place at some point in time. Contrary to the applicant company\u2019s arguments, as is apparent from the documents submitted by the parties, the Management Plan of 2012 did not change the designation of the property, and its classification has not changed since. The applicant company thus was never entitled to any compensation for demolition of the buildings, irrespective of when such demolition had to take place.",

In the absence of an individual constitutional complaint, the latter right can be implemented through the domestic courts (see paragraph 60 above), which have discretion to decide whether to refer an issue to the Constitutional Court.

In the instant case, the Court notes that the domestic administrative courts at two levels of jurisdiction did not allow the applicant company\u2019s complaint on the grounds that it was outside their jurisdiction, and the applicant company\u2019s request for reopening of the proceedings was rejected as the case had not been examined on the merits (see paragraphs\u00a028-30 above). Indeed, the first-instance court provided rather succinct reasoning when dismissing the applicant company\u2019s claim, limiting itself to re-citing statutory provisions (see paragraph 28 above). However, after the applicant company had lodged a separate complaint, the Supreme Administrative Court addressed the essential issues which had been submitted to it. It did not merely endorse, without further ado, the findings of the lower court, but thoroughly explained why it could not hear a case involving the lawfulness of the Government Resolution, which concerned State power issues (see paragraph 29 above).",

Moreover, in several other cases the Supreme Administrative Court had already ruled that the administrative courts could not examine the lawfulness of the Management Plan (see paragraph 79 above). Given the nature of the applicant company\u2019s complaint, the Court considers it sufficiently proved that the domestic courts had ruled out the individual nature of the Management Plan. The Court sees no reason why the Supreme Administrative Court should have reached a different conclusion in the applicant company\u2019s case, especially given that in the domestic proceedings, the applicant company limited its complaint to this exact issue, which had already been decided upon by the domestic courts (see paragraph\u00a029 above).",
