Referring to the statements made by the witnesses at the trial, the court concluded that the applicant had not taken any steps to return the money to Mr A. or to inform anyone. In support of its findings, it referred to the statement made by Mr. D., to whom the applicant had also failed to report the bribe. The court also found that the police had waited to see whether the applicant would report the bribe and had acted when there had been no reaction on his part. The penalty was determined on the basis of, inter alia, the applicant\u2019s behaviour at the trial, the fact that he had previously performed his duties in accordance with the regulations and his lack of a criminal record.",

The Court considers, however, that Mr A. cannot be regarded an agent provocateur nor his actions amounted to incitement prohibited by Article 6 of the Convention. In drawing this conclusion, the facts of the case and the manner in which the domestic proceedings were conducted are the starting point. In this connection, the Court observes that there were two hearings held at first and second instance. The Supreme Court further examined the extraordinary request submitted by the applicant\u2019s representative, which it considered to have been submitted within the statutory time-limit. The proceedings were adversarial and the domestic courts reached their verdicts after hearing oral evidence from the applicant, Mr A., Mr P. and Mr D., and considering documentary evidence. The trial court further heard evidence from Mr T. and Ms S., who had been called as witnesses by the applicant. It is true, as the applicant contended that the Court of Appeal had wrongly believed that Mr O. had already given evidence before the trial court. However, the Court notes that this witness was called to give evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s conduct after the money had changed hands (see paragraph 26 above). His testimony would not have concerned the events preceding the incident of 29 July 1999 or the incident itself. On the material before them, the courts came to the conclusion that the critical incident of 29 July 1999 had occurred as a result of the discussion between the applicant and Mr A. on 27 July 1999. They established that on that date, the applicant had told Mr A. that he was changing his working methods, which they interpreted as meaning that the applicant had actually demanded a bribe. The police only became involved in the operation once the applicant had already contacted Mr A. with a view to demanding a bribe. Mr A., who was not a State agent, but a private person importing food and products for general use, considering the consequences of the applicant having demanded a bribe, reported the matter to the police. The Court sees nothing inadequate or arbitrary in that decision.",

The applicant did not present any evidence, either in the domestic proceedings or in the proceedings before it, which would cast doubt on the conclusion that he was not entrapped into committing the offence. Nor did he take any steps to inform the authorities that Mr A. had attempted to offer him a bribe before the critical incident of 29 July 1999 took place (see paragraph 11 above). The actions of Mr A. did not incite the commission by the applicant of the offence of which he was convicted, since at the time Mr A. offered to pay the bribe the police were already in possession of information suggesting that the applicant had actually demanded a bribe.",
