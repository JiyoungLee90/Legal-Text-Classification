The expression \u201cany form of pressure\u201d must be taken to cover not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation of applicants or their legal representatives but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage them from pursuing a Convention remedy or having a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the exercise of the right of individual petition by applicants and their representatives (see Fedotova v.

Admittedly, the authorities needed certain time to readdress the Court\u2019s letter in view of the applicant\u2019s transfer to another detention facility. However, the Court finds it striking, as pointed out by the applicant, that for almost four months the administration of the remand prison did nothing in order to send the letter to the applicant\u2019s new place of detention.
