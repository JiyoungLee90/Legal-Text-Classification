The Court is of the opinion that mainly the period of two years and six months that lapsed from the date the applicant lodged his appeal and the date the case was initially set for hearing was excessive and was completely attributable to the national authorities. Thus, the Court observes that the national courts\u2019 handling of the case did not facilitate and unjustifiably prolonged its timely completion. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the length of the proceedings can be explained by the failure of the domestic courts to deal with the case diligently (see G\u00fcm\u00fc\u00fften v.
