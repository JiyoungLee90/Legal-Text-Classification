A policeman addresses the citizens through a loudspeaker with a request to disperse and not to block the passage, but Mr Nemtsov remains standing in one place addressing the gathered citizens. The video operator is at such a distance from the applicant that he is separated from him by several rows of people, including the gathered citizens and the riot police, and it is impossible to understand what these citizens and the applicant are saying. Subsequently the recording of the applicant is interrupted as the camera points away onto the policemen putting the first arrested person, and then another one, into the police vans. Only afterwards does the video recording show the applicant being led to a police van by policemen, and he puts up no resistance at this moment of the footage.",

The place designated for the meeting was cordoned off by the riot police, and the only exit from the meeting was at Tverskaya Street; the exit was heavily guarded by the riot police. During the meeting the applicant addressed the participants with a speech expressing strong political views that could have been seen by the officials as controversial and even provocative. Having finished his speech he headed towards the exit, accompanied by his daughter and her friend. The applicant was arrested at the exit to Tverskaya Street before he could leave the restricted area. The time between the moment when the applicant, his daughter and her friend reached the police cordon in front of the exit to Tverskaya Street and the applicant\u2019s arrest did not exceed one or two minutes.

However, the reference to this provision was contested by the applicant on the grounds that the underlying events had not, in fact, taken place, and the Court has upheld this view (see paragraph 71 above). In particular, it has found above that the authorities had not proven that the applicant had received an order from the police, or that it was lawful, or that the applicant had disobeyed it (ibid.). On the contrary, it found that the applicant had arrived at the police cordon and was arrested after having shouted out that Article 31 of the Constitution guaranteed freedom of assembly, without having received any orders or having disobeyed them. The Court therefore concludes that the arrest and the ensuing administrative liability were imposed on the applicant without any connection with the intended purpose of the legal provision for disobeying lawful orders of the police. The interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly on such a legal basis could only be characterised as arbitrary and unlawful (see Hakobyan and Others, cited\u00a0above, \u00a7 107).",

While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a casebycase basis. Moreover, the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 varies to a certain extent, depending on the type of detention involved (see Mooren v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. , \u00a7 77, ECHR\u00a02009...). In this connection, mere mistakes are to be distinguished from a flagrant denial of justice undermining not only the fairness of a person\u2019s trial, but also the lawfulness of the ensuing detention. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, detention following a conviction imposed in manifestly unfair proceedings amounting to a flagrant denial of justice is unlawful and automatically implies a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Stoichkov v. Bulgaria, no. , \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 58-59, 24\u00a0March 2005, and Shulgin v. Ukraine, no. 29912/05, \u00a7 55, 8 December 2011).",
