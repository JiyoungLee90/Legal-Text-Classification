The case was referred to the Court by a Slovenian national, Mr Ljubo Majarič (“the applicant”) on 21 January 1999, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 § 1 and 47 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom (“the Convention”). It originated in an application (no. 28400/95) against Slovenia lodged by Mr Majarič with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 on 13 December 1994.
Before the Court the applicant is represented by Mr E. Dokič, a lawyer practising in Piran. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, the Attorney-General.
In accordance with Article 5 § 4 of Protocol No. 11 taken together with Rules 100 § 1 and 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, a panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 22 April 1999 that the case should be dealt with by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court. Subsequently, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the First Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mr B. Zupančič, the judge elected in respect of Slovenia, and Mrs E. Palm, the President of the Section (Rule 26 § 1 (a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr L. Ferrari Bravo, Mr Gaukur Jörundsson, Mr R. Türmen, Mr T. Panţîru and Mr R. Maruste (Rule 26 § 1 (b)).
On 13 October 1999 the President exempted Mr B. Zupančič from sitting after his withdrawal from the case on the ground that he had participated in its examination as a judge of the Constitutional Court of Slovenia (Rule 28 § 3). On 9 November 1999 the Government notified the Registry that they would not appoint an ad hoc judge. The President subsequently designated Mr J. Casadevall to complete the Chamber. Later Mrs W. Thomassen replaced Mr Panţîru, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 26 § 1 (c)).
On 26 April 1999 the President invited the parties to submit memorials on the issues arising in the case (Rule 59 § 3). The applicant was further invited to submit his claim for just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention (Rule 60 § 1). The Government submitted their memorial on 21 June 1999. The applicant replied on 10 and 12 August 1999.
After consulting the Agent of the Government and the applicant’s lawyer, the Chamber decided that it was not necessary to hold a hearing.
On 6 December 1991 the applicant was charged with sexual assault of a minor and abduction of minors. He was remanded in custody. On 30 April 1992 the applicant was released.
On 5 June 1992 the applicant’s trial started before the Nova Gorica District Court (Okrožno sodišče – “the District Court”). On the same day the case was adjourned.
On 16 June 1992 the District Court ordered the redetention of the applicant.
On 28 August 1992 a number of witnesses were heard and on 3 September 1992 the District Court again adjourned the applicant’s trial due to the applicant’s illness.
By decision of the District Court dated 17 September 1992, the applicant was again released.
A hearing scheduled for 28 September 1992 had to be adjourned sine die as the applicant was ill.
On 21 July 1992 the applicant was accused of another sexual assault of a minor. An indictment was filed on 18 January 1993. The applicant entered a plea against the indictment which was rejected on 15 February 1993. On 17 March 1993 the District Court joined the two sets of proceedings.
On 2 June 1993 the public prosecutor requested further investigations on the ground that there was reasonable suspicion that the applicant had also criminally neglected and ill-treated a minor within the meaning of Article 96 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code.
On 21 October 1993 a preliminary charge was filed in respect of the aforesaid acts. On 28 March 1995 the District Court decided to deal with all charges against the applicant in a single set of proceedings.
In the period from 18 February 1997 to 9 July 1997 the District Court held several hearings.
On 9 July 1997 the District Court convicted the applicant of sexual offences on several counts. A combined prison sentence of two years and eight months was imposed on the applicant. Both the applicant and the public prosecutor appealed.
On 12 February 1998 the Koper High Court (Višje sodišče) rejected the applicant’s appeal and increased the sentence to three years’ imprisonment.
On 26 March 1998 the applicant lodged a plea of nullity (zahteva za varstvo zakonitosti). The District Court transmitted it to the Supreme Court (Vrhovno sodišče), together with the file, on 5 June 1998. The Supreme Court dismissed this complaint on 17 September 1998.
On 24 March 1998 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Koper High Court’s judgment of 12 Februrary 1998. It was dismissed by the Constitutional Court (Ustavno sodišče) on 15 June 1998.
On 12 October 1998 the applicant filed a further constitutional complaint concerning the Supreme Court’s decision of 17 September 1998 (see paragraph 17 above). He alleged, inter alia, a violation of Article 6 § 3 of the Convention in the criminal proceedings against him.
On 1 December 1998 the Constitutional Court refused to send the case back to the lower courts for a new examination as it found no violation of the applicant’s right to a fair hearing.
Mr Majarič applied to the Commission on 13 December 1994. He complained about his detention on remand and that the criminal proceedings against him were unfair and lasted unreasonably long. He alleged a violation of Articles 5 § 1 and 6 § 1 of the Convention.
On 3 December 1997 the Commission declared the application (no. 28400/95) admissible as regards the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings. It noted the following in respect of the Government’s written observations of 21 June 1996:
“The Government state that the only remedy the applicant had at his disposal to accelerate the criminal proceedings was the ‘supervisory appeal’ in accordance with Article 72 of the Law on Courts. In the case of ‘supervisory appeal’ the president of the court or the Ministry do not issue any decision, but merely report to the party on their findings. The Government noted that the applicant filed such an appeal several times, last on 27 May 1994.
The Government conclude that, in the case of delay of proceedings, it is not possible to lodge a constitutional complaint.”
In its report of 21 October 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention) the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1.
In his memorials the applicant requested the Court to hold that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to award him just satisfaction.
The Government contended that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies. With regard to the merits, the Government asked the Court to find that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
