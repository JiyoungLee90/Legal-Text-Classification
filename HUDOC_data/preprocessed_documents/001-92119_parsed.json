In support of their position they referred to the following facts. The investigation established that none of the three missing men had been involved in the activities of illegal armed groups. Moreover, two of them were police officers. No special operations had been conducted in the Oktyabrskiy district of Grozny on the night of 10 December 2002. There was no convincing evidence that the applicants\u2019 relatives were dead. The fact that the perpetrators of the abduction spoke unaccented Russian and were wearing camouflage uniforms did not mean that these men could not have been members of illegal armed groups or criminals pursuing a blood feud. The Government further alleged that the applicants\u2019 description of the circumstances surrounding the abduction was inconsistent. In particular, the applicants\u2019 allegations that the abductors were drunk was based on just one witness statement; their allegations that the abductors had opened fire were unsubstantiated and the applicants were inconsistent in their descriptions of the number of the shots fired by the perpetrators. The Government referred to the witness statements made to the domestic investigation; but they did not submit them to the Court.",

While this delay in itself was not very long, the Court, having regard to the absence of any explanations by the Government in this respect, cannot accept that it was justified in a situation where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were not taken by the investigators. For instance, the investigators had failed to take such basic steps as identifying and questioning the servicemen who had manned the checkpoints in the Oktyabrskiy district of Grozny on the night of abduction; questioning the servicemen of the military commander\u2019s office which was located in the vicinity of Isa Dokayev\u2019s house; establishing which military units could have used the military vehicles described by the relatives of the abducted men; identification and questioning of the staff of the military commander\u2019s office and of the ROVD who could have been involved in the abduction of Ruslan Askhabov, Isa Dubayev and Isa Dokayev. \u00a0It is obvious that if these investigative measures were to produce any meaningful results they should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. The failure to undertake these basic investigative measures not only demonstrates the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitutes a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",
