The court held that this defence was contradicted by the evidence before it. With regard to Mrs Wellington the court referred to the fact that the evidence adduced by the applicant himself showed that he had only partly settled his debt to her. He was also ordered to pay ATS 80,890 to two private parties (Privatbeteiligte) who had appeared as witnesses for the prosecution and who had claimed compensation (section 47 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).

Law Gazette No. 96/1868 as amended) now provides that, in certain cases including conflict of interest or bias, the officially assigned defence lawyer shall be replaced by another defence lawyer (section 45 \u00a7 4 in the version of Bundesgesetzblatt f\u00fcr \u00d6sterreich No. 383/1983). This provision did not exist at the relevant time. However, in practice an officially assigned defence lawyer could be replaced by the Committee of the Bar Association if this seemed appropriate.",

Under section 11 \u00a7 1, he is obliged to carry out his mandate as long as it has not been terminated and he is responsible for failure to do so.

The numerous complaints made in his application included the following. During the proceedings at first instance he had been denied the rights guaranteed to the defence by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 (art. 6-2, art. 6-3) of the Convention. In addition, he had not received a fair trial in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) and he had been the victim of discrimination in breach of Article 14 (art. 14), notably because of differential treatment between German-speaking and non-German-speaking defendants. The nullity proceedings had been unfair because he had not had the opportunity of commenting on the evidence obtained by the Supreme Court in its inquiry. There had been discrimination in the appeal proceedings since, unlike an accused at liberty and the \"civil parties\" in his own case, he had not been allowed to attend the public hearing before the Supreme Court. Contrary to Article 13 (art. 13), he had not had available to him under Austrian law an effective remedy to redress alleged violations of Article 6 (art. 6).",

This request cannot be regarded as tantamount to notifying the trial court that there were grounds to intervene as regards his legal representation. In contrast, after the trial and his conviction Mr Kamasinski made a written request on 6 April 1981 for the appointment of a new lawyer on the ground that he did \"not get along with Dr Steidl\".

Whilst this provision does not specify that the relevant information should be given in writing or translated in written form for a foreign defendant, it does point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the \"accusation\" to the defendant. An indictment plays a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of its service that the defendant is formally put on written notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him. A defendant not conversant with the court\u2019s language may in fact be put at a disadvantage if he is not also provided with a written translation of the indictment in a language he understands.",
