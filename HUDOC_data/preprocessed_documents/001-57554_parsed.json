He argued that it was only through a defence counsel that Mr. Pakelli could have availed himself of his right to be heard: he lived in , lacked financial resources and had an insufficient command of German. In addition, the legal issues involved were particularly complex, as was shown by the length of the memorial setting out the grounds of appeal (see paragraph 13 above) and the Federal Court\u2019s decision to hold a hearing. Mr. Pakelli should therefore have been given the opportunity of stating his views on the submissions of the Federal public prosecutor\u2019s office.

Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) guarantees three rights to a person charged with a criminal offence: to defend himself in person, to defend himself through legal assistance of his own choosing and, on certain conditions, to be given legal assistance free. To link the corresponding phrases together, the English text employs on each occasion the disjunctive \"or\"; the French text, on the other hand, utilises the equivalent - \"ou\" - only between the phrases enouncing the first and the second right; thereafter, it uses the conjunctive \"et\". The \"travaux pr\u00e9paratoires\" contain hardly any explanation of this linguistic difference. They reveal solely that in the course of a final examination of the draft Convention, on the eve of its signature, a Committee of Experts made \"a certain number of formal corrections and corrections of translation\", including the replacement of \"and\" by \"or\" in the English version of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) (Collected Edition of the \"Travaux pr\u00e9paratoires\", vol.

Accordingly, a \"person charged with a criminal offence\" who does not wish to defend himself in person must be able to have recourse to legal assistance of his own choosing; if he does not have sufficient means to pay for such assistance, he is entitled under the Convention to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.",

Thus, there is no reason to suppose that Mr. Rauschenbusch would have been unable to obtain the above-mentioned certificate; in this connection, it has to be noted that his client had spent two years in custody in the Federal Republic of Germany before returning to Turkey in 1976 (see paragraphs 15 and 19 above). In addition, Mr. Pakelli supplied to the Commission in 1979 a statement of means and certificates from the competent Turkish authorities, the latter being based on the declaration of assets and income which he had made for tax purposes the previous year; it appeared from these documents that he was engaged in business on a small scale and that his financial situation was modest.

Mr. Pakelli had had a defence counsel during the written stage of the proceedings; as for the hearings, their object was circumscribed by the grounds of his appeal on points of law: since he was challenging the judgment of 30 April 1976 solely on account of alleged procedural errors, he could neither raise new complaints nor supplement his memorial setting out the grounds of appeal by referring to other questions of fact. Only legal arguments and submissions could have been put to the court at the hearings. The issues involved were not complicated and it could not be said that their determination would entail serious consequences, for the proceedings could not have led to any aggravation of the decision complained of. Moreover, Mr. Pakelli could have appeared in person. Finally, the Commission had misunderstood the role of the Federal public prosecutor\u2019s office in appeals on a point of law. That role consisted of examining the grounds of appeal from a completely independent standpoint and, in particular, of ensuring that the law was uniformly applied and that case-law remained consistent; it was thus very similar to the role of the Procureur g{n{ral attached to the Belgian Court of Cassation (see the above-mentioned Delcourt judgment).",

The Court notes firstly, as did the Commission, that this was one of the rare cases in which the Federal Court held a hearing: this occurs in only ten per cent of the appeals on a point of law in criminal cases (see paragraph 23 above). In fact, on the present occasion the Federal Court was obliged to arrange for oral proceedings since the appeal proved to be admissible and the public prosecutor\u2019s office had not applied for it to be rejected as manifestly ill-founded (Article 349 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; see paragraph 23 above). This shows that the hearing could have been of importance for the decision to be given. It therefore became necessary, in order to ensure a fair trial, to comply with the rule that oral proceedings shall take place with the participation of both parties (d\u00e9bat contradictoire).",

However, Mr. Pakelli would have been able, had his lawyer appeared before the court, to explain his complaints, to supply further particulars thereof if need be and to develop his written arguments. He would, for example, have been able to comment on the statement made by the judge acting as rapporteur (Article 351 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; see paragraph 25 above).

Moreover, Mr. Rauschenbusch did not contest this interpretation. However, he endeavoured to demonstrate that there had been a conflict of interests in the present case. In addition, it could be predicted that the judgment that the Federal Court was going to deliver would not be without importance for the development of case-law. The Government themselves stated that the case-law on this point has remained constant since the judgment of 29 November 1977 dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal; they recognised that oral argument on the interpretation of Article 146 would have been of some value.",
