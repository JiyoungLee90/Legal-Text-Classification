In its decision of 25 December 2008, in the context of the constitutional appeal\u2019s timeliness, the Constitutional Court examined the detention orders issued between 8\u00a0November 2007 and 30 May 2008 and concluded that they should be considered jointly (given the \u201cexistence of temporal continuity\u201d and the fact that the third applicant had still been detained). The Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 8 October 2009 concerned the detention order of 1 June 2009.",

Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999V). While it is not, in principle, the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts, the Court is nevertheless not bound by the domestic courts\u2019 findings in this regard (see, for example, Ribitsch, cited above, \u00a7 32). In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18\u00a0January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see, for example, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

The issue that hence remains to be resolved is the time of their infliction. In this regard, even assuming that the applicants had indeed resisted arrest or tried to escape as argued by the Government and thus sustained injuries, the Court is of the opinion that this alone cannot refute the allegation that the first, second and third applicants had indeed been subjected to abuse whilst in police custody. Specifically, there were conspicuously fewer injuries referred to in the police officers\u2019 reports to their superiors of 7 November 2007 compared to those established in the report based on the first, second and third applicants\u2019 medical examination carried out on 13 December 2007 (see paragraphs 8, 11 and 16 above). The medical report of 22 September 2008 also essentially confirmed the findings of this examination, as well as the existence of the injuries photographed on 8 November 2007 (see paragraph 16 above). Similarly, regarding the fourth applicant, although he was not medically examined on 13 November 2007, or thereafter, the minutes prepared by the investigating judge and the photographs taken on 8\u00a0November 2007, whose authenticity was never called into question, had likewise documented additional injuries compared to the ones listed in the relevant police report of 7 November 2007 (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above).",

The investigation must also be thorough: the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. Furthermore, the investigation must be prompt and independent. Lastly, the investigation must afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny to secure accountability. While the degree of public scrutiny required may vary, the complainant must be afforded effective access to the investigatory procedure in all cases (see Bat\u0131 and Others v.

Yet, despite the Convention and the domestic law requiring that an allegation of this sort be examined ex officio (see paragraphs 80 and 35 above, in that order), no separate abuse-related investigation, aimed at the identification and punishment of those responsible, was ever instituted by the competent authorities (see Hajnal v. Serbia, no. 36937/06, \u00a7 99, 19 June 2012). The criminal case against the first, second and third applicants, wherein they raised their abuse complaints in order to have some of the impugned evidence excluded, was certainly not capable of the latter. It is thus clear that the aforementioned standards have not been satisfied.

The national courts extended their detention on eleven occasions, relying on the severity of the potential sentence and the nature of the crime alleged (see paragraphs 6, 9 and 24 above). While it is true that by reason of their particular gravity and public reaction to them certain offences may give rise to a social disturbance capable of justifying pre-trial detention, this ground can be regarded as relevant and sufficient only provided that it is based on facts capable of showing that the release of the accused would actually disturb public order (see Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 51). In the present case these conditions were not satisfied. The national courts assessed the need to continue the pre-trial detention from a rather abstract and formalistic point of view, taking into consideration only the severity of the potential sentence and the nature of the crime alleged. In their repetitive reasoning they never discussed the possible public reaction to the first, second and third applicants\u2019 release or even referred to the issue. This was only mentioned by the police at the press conference, but as such could not have been appealed within the criminal proceedings, as well as the Government in their observations before the Court, but even then merely in the context of the local population setting up village guard units before the said applicants\u2019 arrest.",

In its analysis of the merits of the allegation of police brutality, the Court stated that there should be an effective official investigation. The Court continued as follows: \u201cEven when, strictly speaking, no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that ill-treatment has been used (see Stanimirovi\u0107 v. Serbia, no.\u00a026088/06, \u00a7 39, 18 October 2011). Victims of alleged violations are not required to pursue the prosecution of officers suspected of ill-treatment on their own. This is a duty of the public prosecutor who is better equipped in that respect (Stojn\u0161ek v. Slovenia, no. 1926/03, \u00a7 79, 23 June 2009; and Ota\u0161evi\u0107 v.

The Court is of the view that in similar situations an ex officio investigation is required. The admissibility issue is, however, slightly different. It concerns the use of available remedies in cases where the investigation fails to occur. Where there is an effective remedy to correct the lack of, or shortcomings in, an investigation, the subsidiarity principle requires that such effective remedy be used. In the present case the possibility of bringing a \u201csubsidiary\u201d prosecution was available, in principle, to the applicants. This possibility exists irrespective of the fact that the prosecution of officers suspected of ill-treatment is the duty of the prosecutor (when he or she becomes aware of it, even in the absence of a formal complaint). There can be no doubt that this Court requires the exhaustion of a domestic remedy where the national system offers the possibility of appeal to a court against a decision by the prosecutor not to prosecute in Article 3 cases. The same logic applies where the national system offers the option of bringing a subsidiary prosecution, as long as that remedy is effective.",

In other words, only after being informed of the prosecutor\u2019s negative decision can an applicant act as a \u201csubsidiary prosecutor.\u201d In the present case, notwithstanding the order of the judge for medical evidence to be obtained, the public prosecutor took no investigative action (see paragraphs 11 and 16). It is not clear how the applicants could have made use of their right to bring a subsidiary prosecution, which is in any case governed by extremely short deadlines. The burden of proving the effectiveness of a remedy falls on the Government. The Government do not specify how, in the specific circumstances, a subsidiary prosecution could have been effective. Therefore, the Article 3 complaints are admissible.",
