In coming to such a conclusion the District Court took into account that previously, on 23\u00a0October 2001, the applicant had been convicted of attempted bribery and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for three years. By the same judgment the applicant, a former officer of the criminal investigations department in police operational work, had also been deprived of the right to work in the police force for three years. The custodial measure in respect of the applicant was chosen and extended by the competent domestic authorities in compliance with the procedure established by domestic law and in accordance with the guarantees of Article 5 of the Convention. On each occasion the court took into account circumstances which gave grounds to believe that, if released, the applicant might obstruct the course of justice by putting pressure on victims and witnesses. The Government particularly emphasised the fact that the grounds warranting the choice of custodial measure had remained unchanged throughout the proceedings. They concluded that the applicant\u2019s remand in custody had been based on relevant and sufficient reasons and had been in line with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

His detention pending trial between 1 February 2005 and 26 December 2006 had also not been justified: the domestic courts had failed to address specific facts relevant to the grounds for continuing to remand him in custody or to consider alternative, more lenient, preventive measures. Following his release on 26\u00a0December 2006, on 26\u00a0January 2007 the District Court again ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody, having indicated that he might interfere with the witnesses, abscond or otherwise obstruct the examination of the case on the merits. The above conclusions were not supported by any specific facts, and the applicant\u2019s proper conduct while at liberty between 26\u00a0December 2006 and 26\u00a0January 2007 was not taken into account. The court took its decision in disregard of the fact that throughout that period the applicant had not obstructed the proceedings in any way, had not absconded and had faultlessly appeared before the investigator and the court. No alternative preventive measure was considered by the court. The applicant\u2019s subsequent applications for release had been dismissed without regard to the arguments in favour of release and without reference to any specific facts.

Therefore, he had considered himself entitled to claim compensation before a domestic court, within the meaning of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a05 of the Convention. However, on 10\u00a0December 2007 the Tverskoy District Court had dismissed his claim on the grounds that he had failed to produce evidence showing that the custodial measure had been applied to him unlawfully and that his right to rehabilitation had been recognised in accordance with the established procedure. The applicant claimed that he had not appealed against the above judgment as he had not believed that an appeal would constitute an effective remedy. He argued that, as the relevant provisions of domestic law and the manner in which they were currently applied by the domestic courts did not fully comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 5, the domestic court could not but have refused his claim for compensation on appeal, just as it had refused it at first instance. The applicant maintained that he had not therefore been afforded a realistic opportunity to receive compensation for his detention between 12\u00a0October and 26\u00a0December 2006, in breach of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a05 of the Convention.",

In the present case, however, the domestic court did not find unlawful any period of the applicant\u2019s remand in custody. The applicant had, therefore, no grounds to claim compensation for his detention which had been effected in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Fedotov v. Russia, no.\u00a05140/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a083-87, 25 October 2005; Nolan and K. v. Russia, no.\u00a02512/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102-105, 12\u00a0February 2009; and Boris Popov v. Russia, no.\u00a023284/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a081-87, 28 October 2010). The period of the applicant\u2019s detention between 12\u00a0October and 26\u00a0December 2006 is no exception. The Court observes, in this respect, that on 26\u00a0December 2006 the Presidium of the Regional Court quashed, by way of supervisory review, the decision of 12 October 2006 in so far as it concerned the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention. The court reasoned its decision by the fact that, in violation of the relevant provisions of domestic law, the application of the custodial measure had been extended in the applicant\u2019s absence, without reference to any reasons for such a decision and without indicating the specific date to which the detention had been extended (see paragraph 22 above). Having considered that the above findings of the Presidium of the Regional Court had constituted an acknowledgment of the unlawfulness of his detention in the period under consideration, the applicant lodged a claim for compensation. The Court observes, however, that on 10\u00a0December 2007 the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow rejected his claim, having found, in particular, that the applicant had failed to produce evidence showing that the custodial measure had been applied to him unlawfully (see paragraph 32 above). It appears, therefore, that in the absence of an explicit and formal acknowledgement by the domestic court of the unlawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention between 12\u00a0October and 26\u00a0December 2006, the applicant had no grounds to claim compensation. The Court considers, therefore, that the applicant\u2019s claim had no prospects of success and that the applicant was not required to exhaust that remedy.",
