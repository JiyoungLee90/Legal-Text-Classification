Ukraine (dec.), no. 43788/05, 3 April 2007). In this context, the Court reiterates that the Convention does not guarantee a right to have a case re-opened by means of an extraordinary remedy (see, mutatis mutandis, Prystavska v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 21287/02, 17 December 2002). Having regard to the parties' submissions on this aspect of the case, and, in particular, given the Government's failure to submit any examples of cases in which the present issue of access to a court of cassation was resolved through the impugned procedure, the Court discerns no grounds to depart from the findings it reached in Karuna (cited above). Moreover, the Court notes that such findings are consistent with its practice concerning the extraordinary review procedure in the civil law matters in the Ukrainian legal system (see Nesterova v. Ukraine, no. 10792/04, \u00a7 36, 28 May 2009).
