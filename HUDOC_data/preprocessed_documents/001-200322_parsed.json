Those activities concerned the other suspect and not the applicant. Moreover, between each such action there had been long periods of inactivity.

At the initial stage of the investigation the prosecutor took evidence from the applicant and in June 2013 obtained an expert opinion on his handwriting (see paragraph 6 above). However, during the subsequent four years the prosecutors\u2019 procedural activity concentrated exclusively on the other suspect, who had apparently fled Poland. There is no evidence of any action of the prosecutor during this period, which would concern the applicant (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above). In consequence, the case against the applicant lay dormant for the period of four years until the prosecutor decided to follow the Elbl\u0105g Regional Court\u2019s suggestion to severe charges against him to a separate set of the proceedings. The Court fully endorses the domestic court\u2019s critical assessment of the prosecutor\u2019s inactivity in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 13 above).",
