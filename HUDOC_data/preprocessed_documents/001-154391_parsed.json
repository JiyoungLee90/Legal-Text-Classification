This is particularly true with respect to complaints relating to an obligation under the Convention to investigate certain events. As the passage of time leads to the deterioration of evidence, time has an effect not only on the fulfilment of the State\u2019s obligation to investigate but also on the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the Court\u2019s own examination of the case. An applicant has to become active once it is clear that no effective investigation will be provided, in other words once it becomes apparent that the respondent State will not fulfil its obligation under the Convention (see Chiragov and Others\u00a0v.
