However, in its decision of 26 December 2001, the  rejected the applicant\u2019s compensation claim with reference to the fact that the criminal proceedings against him had been discontinued on non-exonerating grounds (see paragraph 28 above). This decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal after the applicant\u2019s complaint against the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings on non-exonerative grounds had finally been rejected (see \u00a7 19 above). The Court does not consider it necessary to determine in the present case whether in principle the refusal to award compensation on the basis that the criminal proceedings were terminated on \u201cnon-exonerative\u201d grounds in itself violates the presumption of innocence. It notes that in the present case the court decisions terminating the criminal proceedings against the applicant were couched in terms which left no doubt as to their view that the applicant had committed the offence with which he was charged. In particular, the  indicated that the investigation case file contained sufficient evidence to establish that the applicant had forged a notarial document and had wittingly carried out an invalid notarial action, its only reason for discontinuing the proceedings being the impracticality of prosecuting an insignificant offence. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation. In the Court\u2019s view, the language employed by the  was in itself sufficient to constitute a breach of the presumption of innocence. The fact that the applicant\u2019s compensation claim was rejected on the basis of the findings reached in the criminal proceedings merely exacerbated this situation. Although the  reached its conclusion after a hearing held in the presence of the applicant, the proceedings before it were not criminal in nature and they lacked a number of key elements normally pertaining to a criminal trial. In that respect, it cannot be concluded that the proceedings before that court resulted, or were intended to result in the applicant being \u201cproved guilty according to law\u201d.\u00a0In these circumstances, the Court considers that the reasons given by the , as upheld on appeal, combined with the rejection of the applicant\u2019s compensation claim on the basis of those same reasons, constituted an infringement of the presumption of innocence.",
