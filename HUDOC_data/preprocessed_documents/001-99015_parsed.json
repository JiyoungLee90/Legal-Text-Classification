However, the court did not find it established that the applicant had also been threatened with sexual abuse or had been otherwise influenced.

By doing so, he had acted against the advice of all his subordinate heads of department entrusted with the investigation into J.\u2019s kidnapping. The heads of department had opposed this measure, which D. had previously ordered on the evening of 30 September 2002 and then twice on the morning of 1 October 2002. The heads of department had resisted the orders, proposing instead further questioning and confrontation of the applicant with J.\u2019s family. D. had then issued an order to detective officer E. directing him to comply with his instructions that the applicant should be threatened with torture and, if necessary, subjected thereto. The subjection to pain was to be carried out under medical supervision, without any traces being left, by another specially trained police officer, who would be brought to the police station by helicopter. A police doctor had agreed to supervise the execution of D.\u2019s order. The court noted that the measure had been aimed at finding out where the applicant had hidden J., whose life D. believed was at great risk. Therefore, E. had threatened the applicant in the manner ordered by D. and had also informed him that a \u201ctruth serum\u201d would be administered. After approximately ten minutes, the applicant confessed that he had hidden J.\u2019s body under a jetty at a pond near Birstein.",

They had been exhausted at the relevant time and had acted in a very tense and hectic situation. They did not have any previous convictions. Moreover, D. had taken responsibility for his acts by admitting and explaining them in a note for the police file on the same day. The proceedings had lasted a long time and had attracted immense media attention. The defendants had suffered prejudice in their professional career: D. had been transferred to the Hessian Ministry of the Interior, and E. had been prohibited from acting in the prosecution of criminal offences. Furthermore, it was the first time that a conflict situation such as the one in the defendants\u2019 case had been assessed by a German criminal court. The court took into consideration as aggravating factors that D. had not acted spontaneously as he had already directed the use of force on the evening before he had given the order to E. Moreover, by their acts, the defendants had risked compromising the applicant\u2019s conviction for murder. The court further found that the preservation of the legal order did not warrant the enforcement of the fines imposed.

In addition to that, it was not obvious that the physical injuries the applicant claimed to have suffered in the course of the interrogation, during which he had been handcuffed, could be considered to be of minor importance. Moreover, the question whether the violation of the applicant\u2019s human dignity necessitated the payment of damages despite the satisfaction he had already obtained was a difficult legal question on which no precedent existed in a judgment of a court of final instance.

Williams, decision of 11\u00a0June 1984, 467 US 431 (1984), pp. 441 et seq.; US Supreme Court, no.\u00a082-5298, Segura v.

A., with further references). The prohibition applies to information obtained from coerced confessions (see, on the issue of coercion, US Supreme Court, no. 50, Blackburn v. Alabama, decision of 11 January 1960, 361 US 199 (1960), pp. 205-07, and US Supreme Court, no. 8, Townsend v. Sain, decision of 18 March 1963, 372 US 293 (1963), pp. 293 and 307-09), meaning that if the confession leads to additional evidence, such evidence is also inadmissible in court in addition to the confession itself (compare Nix, cited above, p. 441, and Segura, cited above, p. 804). The evidence is to be excluded, however, only if the illegality is the proximate cause of the discovery of the evidence. In other words, evidence will be excluded if it can be shown that \u201cbut for\u201d the illegal conduct it would not have been found. The exclusionary rule does not apply where the connection between the illegal police conduct and the discovery of the evidence is so remote as to dissipate the taint. This is the case, for example, where the police relied on an independent source to find the evidence (see Nix, cited above, pp.\u00a0441-44, and Segura, cited above, pp. 796-97, 804-05 and 815, with further references) or where the evidence would ultimately or inevitably have been discovered even had no violation of any constitutional provision taken place (see Nix, cited above, pp. 441-44).",

Mental harm in and of itself was a prevalent form of torture. Moreover, the Court had confirmed that a mere threat of conduct prohibited by Article 3 could itself give rise to a violation of that Article (the third party cited Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1982, \u00a7 26, Series A no. 48). Various international bodies, including, inter alia, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (see paragraph 66 above), the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights (see paragraph 67 above) and the United Nations Human Rights Committee (see paragraph 68 above), had likewise found that a threat of serious physical injury could, depending on the circumstances and the impact on the particular individual, constitute torture or another form of ill-treatment. In any event, making a distinction between torture and other ill-treatment was unnecessary in relation to Article 3 of the Convention since, unlike the United Nations Convention against Torture in Articles 1, 15 and 16 (see paragraph 64 above), the relevant Convention Article did not attach any different legal consequences to torture compared to other forms of prohibited ill-treatment. Referring, inter alia, to the case of Labita v. Italy ([GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000IV), the Redress Trust underlined that the prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment was absolute and afforded no exceptions, justifications or limitations, irrespective of the circumstances of the case or the conduct of the victim.",

The Court has held, in particular, that where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (compare Tomasi v.

Torture, inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be inflicted even in circumstances where the life of an individual is at risk. No derogation is allowed even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation. Article 3, which has been framed in unambiguous terms, recognises that every human being has an absolute, inalienable right not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment under any circumstances, even the most difficult. The philosophical basis underpinning the absolute nature of the right under Article 3 does not allow for any exceptions or justifying factors or balancing of interests, irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned and the nature of the offence at issue.",

In particular, the fear of physical torture may itself constitute mental torture. However, there appears to be broad agreement, and the Court likewise considers, that the classification of whether a given threat of physical torture amounted to psychological torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment depends upon all the circumstances of a given case, including, notably, the severity of the pressure exerted and the intensity of the mental suffering caused. Contrasting the applicant\u2019s case to those in which torture has been found to be established in its case-law, the Court considers that the method of interrogation to which he was subjected in the circumstances of this case was sufficiently serious to amount to inhuman treatment prohibited by Article 3, but that it did not reach the level of cruelty required to attain the threshold of torture.",

Firstly, an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for any ill-treatment was required (it cited, inter alia, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 102, Reports 1998VIII). Secondly, States were obliged to have an effective criminal justice system capable of effectively punishing those who perpetrated torture and other prohibited ill-treatment and of deterring the commission of future offences. The punishment for a violation of Article 3 should reflect the gravity of the offence and the State\u2019s obligation to punish the agents responsible had to be complied with seriously and not as a mere formality (by way of comparison, it cited Nikolova and Velichkova v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a07888/03, \u00a7 63, 20 December 2007). Thirdly, adequate and sufficient remedies for torture and other forms of ill-treatment included effective civil remedies; in particular, compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. The Court itself had repeatedly found that a judgment per se was not sufficient to constitute just satisfaction in cases of serious violations, such as those of Article 3, and had made an award for non-pecuniary damage (it cited, for instance, Sel\u00e7uk and Asker v. Turkey, 24 April 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0117-18, Reports 1998II). Fourthly, a restoration of rights addressing the continuing impact of the torture, such as the exclusion of involuntary confessions, was required. Fifthly, the State had to provide for measures guaranteeing the non-recurrence of the prohibited conduct.",

In cases of willful ill-treatment by State agents in breach of Article 3, the Court has repeatedly found that two measures are necessary to provide sufficient redress. Firstly, the State authorities must have conducted a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see, inter alia, Krastanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a048; \u00c7amdereli v. , no. 28433/02, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29, 17 July 2008; and Vladimir Romanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79 and 81).

The Court has already had occasion to indicate in the context of other Convention Articles that an applicant\u2019s victim status may depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level, having regard to the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (see, for instance, Normann v.

It notes in this connection that in the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court, in its decision dated 9 April 2003, expressly stated that the threat to cause the applicant pain in order to extract a statement from him had not only constituted a prohibited method of interrogation under Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure; the threat had also disregarded Article 3 of the Convention, which underlay that provision of the Code (see paragraph 26 above). Likewise, the Federal Constitutional Court, referring to the Regional Court\u2019s finding of a violation of Article 3, observed that the applicant\u2019s human dignity and the prohibition on subjecting prisoners to ill-treatment (Article 1 and Article 104 \u00a7 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law) had been disregarded (see paragraph 42 above). In addition to that, in its judgment of 20 December 2004 convicting police officers D. and E., the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court found that such methods of investigation could not be justified as an act of necessity because \u201cnecessity\u201d was not a defence to a violation of the absolute protection of human dignity under Article 1 of the Basic Law, which also lay at the heart of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 48 above). In view of this, the Grand Chamber, which agrees with the findings of the Chamber in this respect, is satisfied that the domestic courts which were called upon to rule on this issue acknowledged expressly and in an unequivocal manner that the applicant\u2019s interrogation had violated Article 3 of the Convention.",

In doing so, the Court has previously taken into account several criteria. Firstly, important factors for an effective investigation, viewed as a gauge of the authorities\u2019 determination to identify and prosecute those responsible, are its promptness (compare, inter alia, Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 78-79; Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059; and Vladimir Romanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 85 et seq.) and its expedition (compare Mikheyev v. , no. 77617/01, \u00a7 109, 26 January 2006, and Dedovskiy and Others v. , no. 7178/03, \u00a7 89, 15 May 2008). Furthermore, the outcome of the investigations and of the ensuing criminal proceedings, including the sanction imposed as well as disciplinary measures taken, have been considered decisive. It is vital in ensuring that the deterrent effect of the judicial system in place and the significance of the role it is required to play in preventing violations of the prohibition of ill-treatment are not undermined (compare Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v. Turkey, no.\u00a042942/02, \u00a7 62, 8 April 2008; \u00c7amdereli, cited above, \u00a7 38; and Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60 et seq.).",

Even though the Court notes that the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court mitigated their sentence in view of, among many other factors, the long duration of the proceedings (see paragraph 50 above), it is prepared to accept that the investigation and the criminal proceedings were, nevertheless, sufficiently prompt and expeditious to meet the standards set by the Convention.",

However, the Court notes that they were sentenced for this contravention only to very modest and suspended fines. The Court reiterates in this connection that it is not its task to rule on the degree of individual guilt (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2004XII, and Nachova and Others v.

However, under Article 19 of the Convention and in accordance with the principle that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory, but practical and effective, the Court has to ensure that a State\u2019s obligation to protect the rights of those under its jurisdiction is adequately discharged (see Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 61, with further references). It follows that while the Court acknowledges the role of the national courts in the choice of appropriate sanctions for illtreatment by State agents, it must retain its supervisory function and intervene in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity of the act and the punishment imposed. Otherwise, the State\u2019s duty to carry out an effective investigation would lose much of its meaning (see Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 62; compare also Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran, cited above, \u00a7 66).",

It accepts that the present application is not comparable to other cases concerning arbitrary and serious acts of brutality by State agents which the latter then attempted to conceal, and in which the Court considered that the imposition of enforceable prison sentences would have been more appropriate (compare, for instance, Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 63, and Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67-72). Nevertheless, imposing almost token fines of 60 and 90 daily payments of EUR\u00a060 and EUR 120 respectively, and, furthermore, opting to suspend them, cannot be considered an adequate response to a breach of Article 3, even seen in the context of the sentencing practice in the respondent State. Such punishment, which is manifestly disproportionate to a breach of one of the core rights of the Convention, does not have the necessary deterrent effect in order to prevent further violations of the prohibition of ill-treatment in future difficult situations.",

D. was later transferred to the Police Headquarters for Technology, Logistics and Administration and was appointed its chief (see paragraph 52 above). In this connection, the Court refers to its repeated finding that where State agents have been charged with offences involving illtreatment, it is important that they should be suspended from duty while being investigated or tried and should be dismissed if convicted (see, for instance, Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055; Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 63; and Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran, cited above, \u00a7 64).

However, it has also found that the question as to what measures of redress are appropriate and sufficient in order to remedy a breach of a Convention right depends on all the circumstances of the case (see paragraph 116 above). It would not, therefore, exclude the possibility that in cases in which the deployment of a method of investigation prohibited by Article 3 led to disadvantages for an applicant in criminal proceedings against him, appropriate and sufficient redress for that breach may have to entail, in addition to the above-mentioned requirements, measures of restitution addressing the issue of the continuing impact of that prohibited method of investigation on the trial, in particular the exclusion of evidence obtained by breaching Article 3.",

The Court notes that in his appeal on points of law to the Federal Court of Justice, the applicant referred to that application and submitted a full copy of it to that court (see paragraph 37 above). The Federal Court of Justice itself dismissed his appeal as ill-founded without giving reasons for its decision. In these circumstances, the Court is persuaded that, in accordance with the requirements of its case-law, the applicant raised the substance of his complaint under Article 6 in the proceedings before the Federal Court of Justice. In particular, it cannot speculate as to whether the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s possibly different interpretation of the scope of the applicant\u2019s appeal was adopted by that court. As the applicant again argued before the Federal Constitutional Court that the use of the unconstitutional methods of investigation should have entailed a prohibition on the admission of the impugned items of evidence at his trial (see paragraph 40 above), the Court finds that he raised the substance of his complaint under Article 6 throughout the proceedings before the domestic courts.",

The  declared his constitutional complaint on this account inadmissible for failure to substantiate it sufficiently. The Court notes, however, that in its decision, the Federal Constitutional Court confirmed that the police officers\u2019 threat to inflict pain on the applicant in the investigation proceedings had violated human dignity and the prohibition on subjecting the applicant to ill-treatment, as enshrined in the Basic Law. That court further held that the procedural flaw of having applied unconstitutional methods of investigation had been sufficiently remedied by the criminal courts by the exclusion from trial of the statements made under threat and had not, in addition, required the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 42-44 above). The Court considers that through these observations, the Constitutional Court examined, at least partly, the substance of the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint concerning the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against him.

The United Nations Human Rights Committee, for instance, in its General Comment No. 7 of 30 May 1982 (see paragraph 70 above) had found that, in order to secure effective control of the prohibition of torture, it was essential to make both confessions and other evidence obtained through torture or inhuman or degrading treatment inadmissible in court. Likewise, the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa, in its judgment of 10 April 2008 in the case of Mthembu v. The State (see paragraph 74 above), had held that any use of evidence obtained by torture, including real evidence derived from it, rendered proceedings unfair. This had to apply in equal measure to other forms of ill-treatment. The findings of the Court in its judgments in Jalloh (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 99 and 104-07) and Harutyunyan v.

It refers to its above finding that the applicant\u2019s statement on the morning of 1 October 2002 during his interrogation by E. was extracted in violation of Article 3 (see paragraph\u00a0108 above).

There is no doubt that the victims of crime and their families as well as the public have an interest in the prosecution and punishment of criminals, and in the present case that interest was of high importance. Moreover, the instant case is particular also in that the impugned real evidence was derived from an illegal method of interrogation which was not in itself aimed at furthering a criminal investigation, but was applied for preventive purposes, namely in order to save a child\u2019s life, and thus in order to safeguard another core right guaranteed by the Convention, namely Article 2. On the other hand, a defendant in criminal proceedings has the right to a fair trial, which may be called into question if domestic courts use evidence obtained as a result of a violation of the prohibition of inhuman treatment under Article 3, one of the core and absolute rights guaranteed by the Convention. Indeed, there is also a vital public interest in preserving the integrity of the judicial process and thus the values of civilised societies founded upon the rule of law.",

In the Court\u2019s view, neither the protection of human life nor the securing of a criminal conviction may be obtained at the cost of compromising the protection of the absolute right not to be subjected to ill-treatment proscribed by Article 3, as this would sacrifice those values and discredit the administration of justice.",

However, it does not oblige States to do so by conduct that violates the absolute prohibition of inhuman treatment under Article 3 or in a manner that breaches the right of every defendant to a fair trial under Article 6 (compare, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, \u00a7 116). The Court accepts that the State agents in this case acted in a difficult and stressful situation and were attempting to save a life. This does not, however, alter the fact that they obtained real evidence by a breach of Article 3. Moreover, it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies (compare Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2008).",

The Court must therefore determine what measures are to be considered both necessary and sufficient in criminal proceedings concerning evidence secured as the result of a breach of Article 3 in order to secure effective protection of the rights guaranteed by Article 6. As established in its case-law (see paragraphs 165-67 above), the use of such evidence raises serious issues as to the fairness of the proceedings. Admittedly, in the context of Article 6, the admission of evidence obtained by conduct absolutely prohibited by Article 3 might be an incentive for law-enforcement officers to use such methods notwithstanding such absolute prohibition. The repression of, and the effective protection of individuals from, the use of investigation methods that breach Article 3 may therefore also require, as a rule, the exclusion from use at trial of real evidence which has been obtained as the result of any violation of Article 3, even though that evidence is more remote from the breach of Article 3 than evidence extracted immediately as a consequence of a violation of that Article. Otherwise, the trial as a whole is rendered unfair. However, the Court considers that both a criminal trial\u2019s fairness and the effective protection of the absolute prohibition under Article 3 in that context are only at stake if it has been shown that the breach of Article 3 had a bearing on the outcome of the proceedings against the defendant, that is, had an impact on his or her conviction or sentence.",

He did so notwithstanding the fact that he had previously failed in his attempt to have the impugned real evidence excluded. There is no reason, therefore, for the Court to assume that the applicant did not tell the truth and would not have confessed if the Regional Court had decided at the outset of the trial to exclude the impugned real evidence and that his confession should thus be regarded as a consequence of measures which extinguished the essence of his defence rights.",

It requires a range of factors to be taken into account, as well as knowledge of, and hence closeness to, the facts, situations and persons concerned. It is normally the role of the national courts and not the Court, which should involve itself in this process only with the utmost caution and in cases of absolute necessity. Secondly, we wonder whether the Court, in making the assumption that more severe criminal penalties have a deterrent effect, is not at risk of creating or maintaining an illusion. The (general or individual) preventive effect of sentences has long been the subject of extensive studies and research, particularly of an empirical nature. Such studies have concluded that this effect is relative, if not limited. Lastly, even \u2013 and no doubt especially \u2013 where criminal punishment serves the purpose of protecting rights and freedoms, at the risk of obscuring the fact that it is also a threat to rights and freedoms, we should not lose sight of the subsidiarity principle, which is a basic axiom of criminal law: use of the weapon of punishment is acceptable only if there are no other means of protecting the values or interests at stake.",

The Court could have answered that question categorically by asserting, in an unequivocal manner, that irrespective of the conduct of an accused, fairness, for the purpose of Article\u00a06, presupposes respect for the rule of law and requires, as a self-evident proposition, the exclusion of any evidence that has been obtained in violation of Article 3. A criminal trial which admits and relies, to any extent, upon evidence obtained as a result of breaching such an absolute provision of the Convention cannot a fortiori be a fair one. The Court\u2019s reluctance to cross that final frontier and to establish a clear or \u201cbright-line\u201d rule in this core area of fundamental human rights is regrettable.",

Heretofore, the Court took the view that even if proper procedural safeguards are in place, it would be unfair to rely on material if its nature and source were tainted by any oppression or coercion. The use of statements obtained as a result of violence, brutality or other conduct which could be characterised as torture or ill-treatment in breach of Article 3 always rendered the proceedings as a whole unfair, irrespective of whether such evidence was decisive in securing the applicant\u2019s conviction. Whether that principle applied with equal force to other types of evidence remained to be considered. In Jalloh, the Court indicated that an issue may arise under Article 6 \u00a7 1 in respect of any evidence obtained in violation of Article 3 even if its admission was not decisive in securing a conviction. On the facts of that case, the general question as to whether the use of real evidence obtained by an act falling short of torture but still within the scope of Article 3 automatically renders a trial unfair was left open. Regrettably, the answer now given and the reasoning adopted by the majority risks undermining the effectiveness of the absolute rights guaranteed by Article 3. A distinction has been introduced into the Court\u2019s jurisprudence between the admissibility of statements obtained in breach of the absolute prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment and the admissibility of other evidence obtained in the same manner. Such a distinction is difficult to sustain.",

That prohibited conduct resulted in a coerced confession followed by a journey to the scene of vital evidence where the applicant, upon the order of the police, pointed out the locus of the body (while being filmed) and, thereafter, assisted in the gathering of other self-incriminating evidence. There is no doubt from the proceedings before the domestic courts that this evidence was then admitted, adduced, examined and relied upon at the trial and referred to in the Regional Court\u2019s judgment (see paragraphs 32 and 34). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the majority has nevertheless concluded that the applicant\u2019s trial was fair because of \u201ca break in the causal chain\u201d (see paragraph 180) leading from that breach to the applicant\u2019s conviction and sentence.

An event that occurs at one stage may influence and, at times, determine what transpires at another. When that event involves breaching, at the investigation stage, a suspect\u2019s absolute right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, the demands of justice require, in our view, that the adverse effects that flow from such a breach be eradicated entirely from the proceedings. This approach has previously been confirmed and underlined, in principle, by the Court in its consideration of the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of criminal proceedings by finding that the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial. Thus, in Salduz v. Turkey (which involved restrictions on the applicant\u2019s access to a lawyer while in police custody) the Court found that neither the legal assistance provided subsequently nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings could cure the defects which had occurred during the time spent in police custody and it proceeded to find a violation of Article 6. If that is so when considering a breach of the right to consult a lawyer, then surely the same reasoning must apply with even greater force when confronted with a breach of a suspect\u2019s right not to be subjected to inhuman treatment and the subsequent admission into criminal proceedings of the evidence obtained as a result of such a breach.",

Such an approach, in our view, is not only formalistic; it is unrealistic since it fails altogether to have regard to the practical context in which criminal trials are conducted and to the dynamics operative in any given set of criminal proceedings. The majority\u2019s judgment pays no regard to the fact that the applicant\u2019s confession which, it is claimed, \u201cbroke\u201d the causal chain, was made immediately after his failed attempt to exclude the incriminating evidence and that it was repeated, more fully, only after all of that evidence had been adduced at trial. Having failed to have it excluded, he cannot but have been aware that the trial court would have before it forensic and other compelling evidence which he himself had pointed out on the order of the police authorities and which would clearly establish his guilt. We consider it telling that both the Federal Public Prosecutor and counsel for J.\u2019s parents argued that the applicant\u2019s confession \u201cwas worth nothing\u201d since he had only confessed to what had, in any event, already been proven (see paragraph 35 of the judgment).

Once the incriminating evidence had been admitted, his freedom to mount a defence was restricted substantially, if not entirely, and a conviction for the charges upon which he stood accused was all but inevitable. That such inevitability was articulated by the prosecuting parties who participated in the trial confirms us in our view that serious doubt must be cast over the capacity of the applicant, at the outset of the trial, to defend himself effectively.",

The only way to ensure effective protection of the applicant\u2019s fundamental right to a fair hearing would have been to exclude all impugned evidence and to have proceeded (albeit on other charges, such as kidnapping with extortion causing death; see paragraph 35 of the judgment) on the basis of the non-contaminated evidence that was available to the prosecution.

In effect, the Court has concluded that real evidence obtained by inflicting inhuman treatment upon an accused person may be admitted into trial and that such a trial may nevertheless be regarded as \u201cfair\u201d so long as such evidence has no bearing on the outcome of proceedings. If it can have no bearing, what, one wonders, is the purpose of its admission? And why, in principle, should the same reasoning not now apply to real evidence obtained by torture? If a break in the causal chain from torture to conviction can be established \u2013 where, for example, a torture victim chooses to confess during trial \u2013 why not permit the admission of such evidence at the outset of his trial and wait to see if any break in the causal chain might occur? The answer is manifestly obvious. Societies that are founded upon the rule of law do not tolerate or sanction, whether directly, indirectly or otherwise, the perpetration of treatment that is absolutely prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. Neither the wording of Article 3 nor that of any other provision of the Convention makes a distinction between the consequences to be attached to torture and those attaching to inhuman and degrading treatment. There is thus no legal basis, in our view, for regarding inhuman treatment as different from torture in terms of the consequences that flow from the perpetration thereof. Neither \u201ca break in the causal chain\u201d nor any other intellectual construct can overcome the inherent wrong that occurs when evidence obtained in violation of Article 3 is admitted into criminal proceedings.",

In our view, criminal activity may not be investigated nor an individual\u2019s conviction secured at the cost of undermining the absolute right not to be subjected to inhuman treatment as guaranteed under Article 3.
