The court, however, found that the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights would be breached if, as a result of his being divested of his citizenship, he became an alien. His de jure family (in respect of the second marriage) would suffer irremediable upset if, as a father (of the two Maltese children of that marriage), he were required to move to another country.

Following information from the Austrian authorities that Dr Rottmann was the subject of an arrest warrant in their country, the German authorities sought to annul his acquisition of German citizenship on the grounds that he had obtained it fraudulently. Such a decision, however, had the effect of rendering him stateless. The referring court wished to know if this was a matter that fell within the scope of EU law, as Dr Rottmann\u2019s statelessness also entailed the loss of EU citizenship. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that an EU Member State\u2019s decision to deprive an individual of citizenship, in so far as it implied the loss of the status of EU\u00a0citizen and the deprivation of the attached rights, fell within the ambit of EU\u00a0law and, therefore, must be compatible with its principles.",

In the present case, despite the lack of any interim measure by the Court, no removal order was awaiting execution or implementation, as no such order had been issued, and no practical steps had been taken by the authorities in order to remove the applicant from Malta.

Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR\u00a01999VII). In other words, the person concerned must be directly affected by it or run the risk of being directly affected by it (see, for example, Norris v. Ireland, 26 October 1988, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03031, Series A no. 142, and OttoPremingerInstitut v. Austria, 20\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 39, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0295A). It is not therefore possible to claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of an act which is deprived, temporarily or permanently, of any legal effect (see Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 60654/00, \u00a7\u00a092, ECHR 2007I). With reference to the specific category of cases involving the deportation of non-nationals, the Court has consistently held that an applicant cannot claim to be the \u201cvictim\u201d of a deportation measure if the measure is not enforceable (see Vijayanathan and Pusparajah, cited above, \u00a7 46; see also Pellumbi v. France (dec.), no.\u00a065730/01, 18 January 2005, and Etanji v.\u00a0France (dec.), no.\u00a060411/00, 1\u00a0March 2005). It has adopted the same stance in cases where execution of the deportation order has been stayed indefinitely or otherwise deprived of legal effect, and where any decision by the authorities to proceed with deportation can be appealed against before the relevant courts (see Sisojeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 93, with further references to the cases of Kalantari v. Germany (striking out), no. 51342/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05556, ECHR\u00a02001X, and Mehemi v. France (no. 2), no. 53470/99, \u00a7\u00a054, ECHR\u00a02003IV; see also Andric v.

Although during the intervening period, proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s complaints have been pending before the domestic courts and subsequently before the Court, neither the domestic courts nor the Court have ordered interim measures (capable of giving any legitimacy to the letter sent to the authorities by the applicant\u2019s legal representative \u2013 see paragraph 28 above).

France [GC], no. 22689/07, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR\u00a02012). However, domestic courts must seriously examine the circumstances and legal arguments in favour of or against a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in the event of the removal order being enforced. Haste in the execution of a removal order may have the effect of rendering the available remedies ineffective in practice and therefore inaccessible (ibid, \u00a7 95). At this stage there is no indication that any eventual removal would be executed in a perfunctory manner and with such haste that it would have the effect of rendering the available remedies ineffective in practice and therefore inaccessible (contrast De Souza Ribeiro, cited above, \u00a7 96).",

This is particularly so in the absence of exceptional circumstances which would explain the delay in raising such matters.

The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking account of both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no. 25551/05, ECHR 2010). Thus, the absence of any such disadvantage can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant (see Adrian Mihai Ionescu v.\u00a0Romania (dec.) no. 36659/04, \u00a7 34, 1 June 2010; Rinck v.\u00a0France (dec.), no. 18774/09, 19 October 2010; and Kiousi v.\u00a0Greece\u00a0(dec.), no. 52036/09, 20 September 2011).

In the present case (until the time of filing observations), it transpired that the applicant had not been hindered in his movement in and outside Malta. Indeed, he had continued to work in Malta and to reside there with his new family. Thus, in view of the above, there had not been an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights. Also, the Government submitted that the applicant could apply for a work permit which was valid for a period of time and renewable on request, and subsequently obtain a residence permit on that basis. Furthermore, once his immigration status had been regularised, he would be eligible for long-term residence status after five years of legal stay. However, the applicant had not attempted to pursue any of those avenues.

Nevertheless, the Court considers that the loss of citizenship already acquired or born into can have the same (and possibly a bigger) impact on a person\u2019s private and family life. It follows that there is no reason to distinguish between the two situations and the same test should therefore apply. Thus, an arbitrary revocation of citizenship might in certain circumstances raise an issue under Article 8 of the Convention because of its impact on the private life of the individual. Therefore, in the present case it is necessary to examine whether the decisions of the Maltese authorities disclose such arbitrariness and have such consequences as might raise issues under Article 8 of the Convention.",

The Court notes that Article 27(1) only states that the amendments to the Act would not affect the granting or retention of citizenship obtained prior to the enactment of such amendments, and thus it has no bearing on the application of Article 14 (former Article 9), which has not undergone any amendments. The Court further accepts the Government\u2019s argument that the transitory provision in Article 27(2) of the Act (see paragraph 32 above) does not apply to the applicant, as his application had already been processed and determined. Thus, his citizenship was obtained prior to the amendments to the Act enacted in 2000. It follows that the deprivation of citizenship was in accordance with the law.",

If it allows the holder to reside within the territory of the host country and to exercise freely there the right to respect for his or her private and family life, the granting of such a permit represents in principle a sufficient measure to meet the requirements of that provision. In such cases, the Court is not empowered to rule on whether the individual concerned should be granted one particular legal status rather than another, that choice being a matter for the domestic authorities alone (see Sisojeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 91; Aristimu\u00f1o Mendizabal v.

In this connection, the Court notes that various possibilities appear to be open to the applicant (see paragraph\u00a037 and 79 above), such as applying for a work permit, and subsequently a residence permit, which could eventually again make him eligible for citizenship. However, the applicant has taken no such steps, which could have prevented any adverse impact on his private and family life (compare Savoia and Bounegru (dec.), cited above), and no valid explanation has been given for his inaction. The Court notes that the only alleged obstacle referred to by the applicant is a legal provision which is not yet in force (see paragraphs 37 and 39 above).",

For me, there has been a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention), in view of the unjustified, draconian measure taken by the national authorities against the applicant. The features of the present case are unique in the history of the European Court of Human Rights (the Court). The case concerns the revocation of the applicant\u2019s citizenship, which he had obtained on 19 April 1994 as a result of his marriage to a Maltese citizen. Such citizenship was revoked more than thirteen years later, on the basis that a domestic court had annulled the said marriage because it considered that the applicant\u2019s only reason to marry had been to remain in Malta and obtain Maltese citizenship. In addition to my serious doubts regarding the correctness of the annulment judgment, I entertain principled reservations to the majority\u2019s assessment of the fairness of the revocation procedure and the proportionality of the revocation order, in view of the applicant\u2019s ensuing statelessness, the risk of his imminent expulsion from Malta and its impact on his family life. Although this case had all the ingredients for the Court to revisit its still insufficient case-law on the right to citizenship, unfortunately the Chamber did not seize the opportunity. Hopefully the Grand Chamber will do this at the request of the applicant and finally affirm the existence of an autonomous Convention right to citizenship.",

States parties should introduce safeguards to prevent statelessness by granting their nationality to persons who would otherwise be stateless and are either born in their territory or are born abroad to one of their nationals.

States enjoy a degree of discretion with regard to the criteria governing acquisition of citizenship, but these criteria must not be arbitrary. In particular, international human rights law places a clear responsibility that the State should refrain from implementing citizenship policies that would contribute to the creation or perpetuation of statelessness. In addition to the right to citizenship, two core rights of international human rights law are also of particular relevance to statelessness and the protection of stateless persons.

It was also noted that it would be very difficult to prove whether or not the deprivation of nationality had been ordered with the intention of expelling the person concerned. In 1988 the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Experts for the Development of Human Rights started examining the question of the right to a nationality as a human right and considering the possibility of inserting such right into the ECHR through an additional protocol to the Convention.

This principle should be read in the light of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers\u2019 Recommendation no.

In addition, his trading permits were continuously renewed. This conduct of the competent national authorities over more than eight years led the applicant, as it would indeed have led any reasonable person, to consider that his citizenship was under no threat. And since there was no such pending threat, the applicant could genuinely aspire to create a second family in Malta after the failure of his first marriage. Hence, it cannot be argued, as the Government did, that when the applicant got married for the second time, to a foreigner, he was aware that the persistence of his new family in Malta would be precarious from the outset.",

It is also worth noting that the 2007 ministerial decision of revocation of citizenship was not based on the applicant\u2019s criminal record. This disregard for his criminal record makes perfect sense, since the act of aggression had occurred in 1994 in the context of an episode of domestic violence, was not followed by any subsequent similar incidents and the applicant was given a mere suspended sentence, which ultimately shows that the competent court did not find the offence serious enough to require imprisonment and, on the contrary, found the offender able to live a crimefree life in Maltese society. I find it very unfortunate, to say the least, that the respondent Government now invoke this argument when the competent Minister himself did not find it necessary or even appropriate to do so in 2007. In fact, as it will be demonstrated, his order was totally silent on any public order consideration.",

Furthermore, it failed to consider that the applicant would become a stateless person as a result of the decision, and that at the time of his application for Maltese citizenship it had been a prerequisite for the applicant to renounce his Egyptian citizenship, which he in fact did, since dual nationality was not possible from an Egyptian perspective.",

The negative formulation of Article 14 (3) of the same Maltese law, according to which the Minister should not deprive someone of citizenship unless he is satisfied that it is not conducive to the public good that that person should continue to be a citizen of Malta, does not hinder the conclusion that the public good had to be factored into the ministerial decision. But no explicit consideration was given in the ministerial order to this matter, since quite paradoxically Article 19 of the said Maltese law does not even require the Minister\u2019s decision to be reasoned. The lack of reasoning was further compounded by the secrecy of the decision-making procedure. The committee\u2019s final recommendation to the Minister was not made available to the applicant, and the many requests by the applicant\u2019s lawyers for a copy of the records of these proceedings remained unsatisfied.

This right to citizenship should neither be amalgamated with the right of an alien to enter, to reside or to work in a particular country, nor with the alien\u2019s right to family life. The right of States to decide who their citizens are is not absolute, since States must comply with their international human rights obligations when adopting practices or laws concerning citizenship.
