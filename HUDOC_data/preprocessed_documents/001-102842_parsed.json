In Babjak, a police decision had similarly stated that the applicant had committed a criminal act, even though no criminal proceedings had been instituted against him due to his lacking criminal responsibility on account of his young age. Notwithstanding, the Court considers it to be of crucial importance that although the impugned decision in Babjak was never quashed, it was nevertheless supplanted by a later police decision which unequivocally clarified that it had not been established that the applicant's actions had constituted a criminal offence. In the Court's view, this is sufficient to distinguish the facts of the present case from those of the Babjak decision on which the respondent Government seek to rely. In this respect, it is clear that an action under Articles 11 et seq. of the Civil Code, allows for non-pecuniary compensation in the event that an \u201cinjured party's dignity or social standing has been considerably diminished\u201d (see paragraph 18 above). It has not been shown however that any action under the Civil Code would have allowed the present applicant an opportunity to seek a subsequent official retraction and clarification from the police that it had never been proved that she had committed a criminal act, as had been afforded to the applicant in Babjak.",

In this connection, the Court recalls its judgment in the case of Borovsk\u00fd v. , no. 24528/02, 2\u00a0June 2009 which concerned the right to be presumed innocent under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. The\u00a0Court dismissed the Government's objection in Borovsk\u00fd that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies by omitting to pursue an action under Articles 11 et seq. of the Civil Code for protection of his personal integrity. In declaring the application admissible, the Court noted at paragraph 39 of its judgment that the  had addressed the merits of that applicant's complaint even though he had not first pursued an action under the Civil Code against the police officers whom he alleged had violated his right to be presumed innocent.

In this connection, the Court recalls that an applicant who has exhausted a remedy that is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried others that were available but probably no more likely to be successful (see T.W. v.  [GC], no. 25644/94, \u00a7 34, 29 April 1999, Okkal\u0131\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 52067/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2006XII (extracts) and Lazoroski v.\u00a0\u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, no. 4922/04, \u00a7\u00a037, 8\u00a0October 2009, among other authorities).

It notes, in this respect, that this was the course of action pursued by the applicant in the Borovsk\u00fd case, which ultimately led to the Court rejecting the Government's preliminary objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.

It may thus be defined as \u201cthe official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence\u201d, a definition that also corresponds to the test whether \u201cthe situation of the [suspect] has been substantially affected\u201d (see, for example, the Deweer v.

A \u201ccharge\u201d may in some instances take the form of other measures which carry the implication of such an allegation and which likewise substantially affect the situation of the suspect (see Foti and Others v.

The prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial favours a \"substantive\", rather than a \"formal\", conception of the \"charge\" referred to by Article 6; it impels the Court to look behind the appearances and examine the realities of the procedure in question in order to determine whether there has been a \"charge\" within the meaning of Article 6 (see the above-mentioned Deweer\u00a0judgment, p. 23, \u00a7\u00a044). In particular, the applicant's situation under the domestic legal rules in force has to be examined in the light of the object and purpose of Article 6, namely the protection of the rights of the defence (see the Court's judgment in the case of Adolf\u00a0v.\u00a0Austria, 26 March 1982, \u00a7\u00a030, Series A no. 49).",

Notwithstanding, the Court must still consider whether the applicant could be said to have been officially notified or otherwise \u201csubstantially affected\u201d following her husband's filing of a criminal complaint against her on 30 June 2000. The Court observes in this connection that the applicant was not aware of the impugned police decision until 28 January 2002, when a health insurance company made reference to it in its claim for reimbursement of medical expenses. This was approximately one year and a half after the case against the applicant had been dropped by the Ko\u0161ice police department on the basis of her husband's refusal to consent to the pursuit of criminal proceedings against her. In other words, it appears that the applicant's husband in effect withdrew his complaint concerning the applicant's alleged behaviour on 25 June 2000, thereby barring the initiation of a criminal prosecution. Nor does it emerge from any of the documents in the case file that the applicant was questioned, summoned or in any other way notified by the police or any other domestic authority of her husband's complaint of 30 June 2000. Rather, the applicant submits that she first became aware of this complaint through the health insurance company's request in 2002, by which time the case against her had been dropped and closed.",

In this connection, the Court recalls, mutatis mutandis, its judgment in the case of Sidabras and D\u017eiautas (cited above) where it held at paragraph 49 that Article 8 could not be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation which was the foreseeable consequence of one's own actions such as, for example, the commission of a criminal offence. Applying this principle to the instant case, the Court lays emphasis on the fact that the applicant was never charged with or proved to have committed any criminal offence. It follows that the text of the police decision cannot be considered to be the foreseeable consequence of the applicant's own doing, precisely because she has never been charged with, let alone proved, to have committed any crime.",

On the other hand, the Court considers that it is not required to decide whether the disclosure of the police decision pursued a legitimate aim. In its view, this matter is closely related to compliance with the \u201cnecessity\u201d test. According to that test, a breach of Article 8 will be found if, in the particular circumstances of a case, an impugned measure fails to strike a fair balance between the competing public and private interests at issue. The requirement of proportionality demands that a respondent Government show relevant and sufficient reasons for the interference. While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment in all these respects, and a margin of appreciation must be left to the competent national authorities in this assessment, the final evaluation of whether the interference is necessary remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention (see Coster v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024876/94, \u00a7\u00a0104, 18\u00a0January\u00a02001; S and Marper v. the United Kingdom, [GC], applications nos.\u00a030562/04 and 30566/04, 4 December 2008, \u00a7\u00a7 101-102).",
