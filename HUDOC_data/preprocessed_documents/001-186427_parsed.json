It firstly notes that the domestic courts established, on the basis of reports submitted by domestic public healthcare authorities, that the temperature and the amount of natural light in some of the cells in which the applicant had been detained had not complied with domestic hygiene norms (see paragraph 9 above). The Court further observes that the CPT in its reports concerning Lithuania repeatedly stated that nearly all detainees in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison were locked up in their cells for twentythree hours a day, with no out-of-cell activities other than outdoor exercise lasting one hour in small and dilapidated yards (see paragraphs\u00a018 and 19 above). In such circumstances, the Court is unable to find that the lack of personal space was compensated for by appropriate material conditions of detention, sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities. It follows that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention during those periods when he had less than 3 sq. m of personal space at his disposal did not comply with Article 3 of the Convention.",

However, the Court observes that that conclusion was based on the applicant\u2019s own assessment and the failure of the administration of the correctional facility to provide evidence to the contrary. In the proceedings before this Court, the Government provided a table setting out the exact personal space available to the applicant during the different periods of his detention (see paragraph 30 above). The Court has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information provided by the Government (see, for a similar situation, Butkus and Remeikis v. Lithuania (dec.) [Committee], nos.\u00a042468/16 and 51911/16, \u00a7\u00a023, 10 April 2018).

Furthermore, the applicant was not confined to his room during the day and was free to move around the correctional facility, except when serving disciplinary penalties for breaching the internal rules of the facility. It also observes that the applicant himself never complained, either before the domestic courts or before this Court, that he had not had sufficient time outdoors or that there had not been adequate outofcell activities at his disposal.

However, it has also found that during other periods the conditions of their detention were in line with Article 3 (see paragraphs 35 and 3839 above). It therefore observes that even though the applicants remained in the same correctional facilities, the conditions of their detention varied over time. In such circumstances, the Court is unable to conclude that at the time when they lodged their applications, they were still detained in unsuitable conditions. Nor did the applicants provide any information allowing it to reach a different conclusion. Accordingly, in line with the Court\u2019s caselaw, a claim for monetary compensation constituted an effective remedy for the applicants\u2019 complaints (ibid.). Even though the compensation which the applicants were awarded could not be considered sufficient in the light of the Court\u2019s standards (see paragraph 25 above), it should be reiterated that the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article\u00a013 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see De\u00a0Souza\u00a0Ribeiro v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 22689/07, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR 2012).",
