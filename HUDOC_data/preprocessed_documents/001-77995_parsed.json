The application of those rules, to determine the liability of a particular person, is then a matter for independent and impartial tribunals such as the General or Special Commissioners or the courts. On the other hand, sometimes one cannot formulate general rules and the question of what the general interest requires has to be determined on a case by case basis. Town and country planning or road construction, in which every decision is in some respects different, are archetypal examples.

In Bryan, the inspector's decision that there had been a breach of planning controls involved some fact-finding, namely that the buildings which Mr Bryan had erected had the appearance of residential houses rather than agricultural barns. However, the inspector was also called upon to exercise his discretion on a wide range of policy matters involving development in a green belt and conservation area, and it was these policy judgments, rather than the findings of primary fact, which Mr\u00a0Bryan challenged in the High Court. The inspector lacked the requisite appearance of independence from the executive, since the Secretary of State had the power, albeit applied only in exceptional circumstances, to withdraw a case from him.

In contrast, in the instant case, the HBRB was deciding a simple question of fact, namely whether there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for the applicant's delay in making a claim. On this question, the applicant had given evidence to the HBRB that the first that she knew that anything was amiss with her claim for housing benefit was the receipt of a notice from her landlord \u2013 the housing association \u2013 seeking to repossess her flat because her rent was in arrears. The HBRB found her explanation to be unconvincing and rejected her claim for back-payment of benefit essentially on the basis of their assessment of her credibility. No specialist expertise was required to determine this issue, which is, under the new system, determined by a non-specialist tribunal (see paragraph 22 above).
