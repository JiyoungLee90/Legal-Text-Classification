As it has already held in other length-of-proceedings cases, the question of whether he or she has received reparation for the damage caused \u2013 comparable to just satisfaction as provided for under Article 41 of the Convention \u2013 is an important one. Regarding violations of the reasonable-time requirement, one aspect of sufficient redress which may remove a litigant\u2019s victim status concerns the amount awarded as a result of using the domestic remedy. The Court has already had occasion to indicate that an applicant\u2019s victim status may depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she has complained before the Court (see\u00a0Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 181 and 202, ECHR 2006V).",

Italy (no. 1), the Grand Chamber held that when, in order to prevent or to put right violations of the \u201creasonable time\u201d principle, Contracting States choose to introduce remedies of a compensatory nature, it might be easier for the domestic courts to refer to the amounts awarded at domestic level for other types of damage \u2013 such as personal injury, damage relating to a relative\u2019s death or damage in defamation cases \u2013 and to rely on their innermost conviction, even if that results in awards of amounts that are lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases. However, the Court is required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied has produced consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention, as interpreted in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law. It points out that, especially for States that have effectively incorporated the Convention into their legal systems, a clear error in assessment by the domestic courts may also arise as a result of a misapplication or misinterpretation of the Court\u2019s case-law (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 182-192).",
