The case originated in twenty-four applications against the Russian Federation (see application numbers in Appendix I) lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twenty-four Russian nationals whose names and the dates on which they introduced their applications are set out in Appendix I.
The names of the applicants’ representatives are listed in Appendix II. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants complained, in particular, that they had been denied an opportunity to appear in person before the appeal courts in the civil proceedings to which they had been parties.
The applicants were all parties to unrelated sets of civil proceedings.
Some applicants attended the hearings before the first-instance courts; all of them were absent from the appeal hearings. Whenever the appeal courts addressed the issue of their absence, they did not check whether the applicants or their representatives received the summons, whether it was necessary to adjourn hearings or whether their presence was required due to the nature of the claims.
The dates of the final judgments are set out in Appendix I.
The domestic provisions governing notification of litigants in civil proceedings are described in Gankin and Others v. Russia, (nos. 2430/06, 1454/08, 11670/10 and 12938/12, §§ 16-17, 31 May 2016).
