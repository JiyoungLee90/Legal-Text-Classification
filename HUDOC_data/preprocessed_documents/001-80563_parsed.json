Shortly afterwards, he had heard that there had been shooting and that an ambulance was needed. Superintendent Groenewegen had immediately made his way to the Huigenbos building. Upon arrival, he had seen a man lying on the ground, wounded in the neck. He had seen a silver-coloured pistol lying on the ground, about one metre from the man\u2019s feet.

The application was signed by Mr Hamer as the applicants\u2019 representative and by each of the applicants individually. They stated that the information available did not admit of the conclusion that the shooting of Moravia Ramsahai by Officer Brons was sufficiently justified. They also pointed out that certain key parts of the investigation after the shooting had been carried out by the Amsterdam/Amstelland police force \u2013 that is, Officer Brons\u2019s direct colleagues \u2013 and argued on that ground that the investigation had not been \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d. Further complaints addressed the failure to question Officers Brons and Bultstra until several days after the event, the failure to question all the police officers who had arrived at the scene after the shooting about what had been said by Officers Brons and Bultstra, the failure to determine the precise trajectory of the bullet (which the applicants submitted would have been possible), the failure to secure gunshot residue samples from the hands of Officers Brons and Bultstra, the failure to conduct a reconstruction of the incident, and the absence from the autopsy report of drawings or photographs showing the entrance and exit wounds caused by the bullet. Reference was also made to Police Commissioner Van Riessen\u2019s statement, as reported in the newspaper De Telegraaf, to the effect that he would not allow an independent inquiry, and to the fact that the Chief Public Prosecutor (hoofdofficier van justitie) of  retained overall responsibility for the investigation and any decision to prosecute.",

He considered it sufficiently clear from the evidence available that Officer Brons had acted in self-defence and was not convinced that Public Prosecutor De Vries, who had decided not to prosecute, was in any way biased. Although perhaps some might have preferred the non-prosecution decision to have been taken by an official body further removed from the  police, that was not a wish which needed to be taken into account by the courts. It followed that the applicants\u2019 complaint of 2 October 1998 was unfounded.",

It added that if there had been more time, it might have been possible to avoid inflicting a lethal wound; however, an immediate reaction had been required in the circumstances, as had subsequently been borne out by the fact that Moravia Ramsahai\u2019s pistol had had a round chambered and its hammer cocked in the firing position. This conclusion was reinforced by the available information that earlier that day he had stolen a vehicle at gunpoint and used the pistol in a threatening way on at least one other occasion, as well as by the retrospective finding of traces of alcohol and the active ingredient of hallucinogenic mushrooms in Moravia Ramsahai\u2019s body.

The Court concludes that there has been a procedural violation of Article 2 of the Convention on two points: the (excessively) late involvement of the National Police Internal Investigations Department in the investigation and the fact that the decision under Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure not to prosecute the policemen involved was not [given in] public. As to the involvement of the National Police Internal Investigations Department, a few matters should be noted. The Court does not criticise the position of the National Police Internal Investigations Department in relation to the police as such; it finds explicitly that that position is consonant with the independence required by Article 2 of the Convention. However, in this case the investigation into the shooting was carried out during the first fifteen hours by police officers belonging to the same police force as the police officer who had fired the fatal shot. Only afterwards was the investigation taken over by the National Police Internal Investigations Department. The Court finds that the (independent) National Police Internal Investigations Department became involved in the investigation too late in this specific case. Since the decision of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal of 23 June 2004 in the Mercatorplein case (unpublished), the duty system of the National Police Internal Investigations Department has been improved [aangescherpt], so that they can be at the place of the incident sooner. The National Police Internal Investigations Department now reaches the scene of events within, on average, one hour to one hour and a half after the incident is reported. It is therefore no longer possible to conclude that the procedures now followed in the  as regards investigations into fatal shootings involving police officers are not compatible with the Convention. I am therefore of the opinion that structural changes in the existing procedures are not needed. It is, however, useful to make the procedure more precise on some points, in particular as regards the involvement of the National Police Internal Investigations Department. To this end, the Board of Procurators General [College van procureursgeneraal] is drawing up a new \u2018Instruction on how to act in the event of the use of force by a (police) officer\u2019 [Aanwijzing handelwijze bij geweldsaanwending (politie) ambtenaar, hereafter \u2018the Instruction\u2019], to replace [an earlier instruction]. This Instruction will explicitly provide that the National Police Internal Investigations Department shall be informed immediately [terstond] in cases where there has been use of force by a police officer, and that the duty officer concerned from the National Police Internal Investigations Department shall proceed to the scene of the incident as quickly as possible. Until he arrives, the local police force shall only act to freeze the situation, for example by cordoning off the scene of the incident. However, the local force will, in principle, not carry out investigative measures. This Instruction is expected to enter into force early next year.",

The starting point, for the present, is that during the phase in which a decision has yet to be taken as to whether a person is to be prosecuted, that person\u2019s interest in avoiding publicity outweighs the complainant\u2019s interest in publicity. Since a decision under Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not concern a \u2018criminal charge\u2019 in the sense of Article 6 of the Convention, the requirement of publicity for such decisions does not flow from that Article. In the relevant judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, the requirement of publicity is however derived from Article 2 of the Convention. The Court takes the view that the decision should have been given in public, in view of the seriousness of the case and the fact that it concerned a person invested with public authority. It will not be possible to give effect to the judgment without amending Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

The fact that a public prosecutor is dependent on the police for the provision of information and support does not affect this finding. The Court notes in addition that the actions of the public prosecutor are subject to independent supervision by the courts. In this case the public prosecutor in charge of the case was a public prosecutor with particular responsibility for the area within which the work was carried out at Flierbosdreef police station, at which station the police officer concerned worked. I share the Court\u2019s view that it is undesirable (from the point of view of independence) for a public prosecutor to maintain excessively close ties with the police force to which the police officers concerned belong. In that connection I refer to the said Instruction of the Board of Procurators General. This Instruction will provide that in cases such as the present the investigation will in no circumstances be led by a public prosecutor who maintains close ties with the district to which the police officers belong, for example the district public prosecutor. I note in addition that the Advisory Board on Police Use of Firearms [Adviescommissie Politi\u00ebel Vuurwapengebruik] gives advice on the follow-up to investigations into police use of firearms actually involving firing and where investigations have actually been carried out by the National Police Internal Investigations Department. The Chief Public Prosecutor is obliged to submit to the Advisory Board the decision he proposes to take. In that way a kind of \u2018second opinion\u2019 is built into such cases.\u201d",

There was thus little likelihood that any authority involved in the case might have concealed relevant information from the Court of Appeal or the applicants. In addition, given that the applicants were not prevented from making the decision public themselves, the Court takes the view that the requirement of publicity was satisfied to an extent sufficient to obviate the danger of any improper cover-up by the  authorities.",

Despite the apparent inconsistency between the statements of the two officers directly concerned and those of Officers Braam and Van Daal to which reference is made in paragraph 331 of the judgment, it was clearly established by the investigation, and has not been disputed, that one round only was fired during the incident which resulted in the death, that it was fired by Officer Brons and that his service weapon, still loaded with seven out of the total of eight rounds, together with one spent cartridge was handed over to the Forensic Laboratory in Rijswijk (see paragraphs 234\u00ad38 and 263 of the Chamber\u2019s judgment). In these circumstances, it is not clear to us what a forensic examination of the hands of the two officers or of their weapons could have revealed.",

The judgment of the Grand Chamber records, in paragraph 224, that \u201cno drawings or photographs were appended to the autopsy report as contained in the investigation file\u201d. While this is true, it is not the case that the investigation was devoid of photographic evidence. As noted in the Chamber\u2019s judgment (paragraphs 255-80), a total of twenty-nine photographs were taken at the scene of the incident, including four photographs of the body of Moravia Ramsahai. Moreover, a detailed description of the bullet wound sustained by him was contained both in the provisional conclusion of the pathologist (see paragraph 252 of the Chamber\u2019s judgment) and in the autopsy report itself (see paragraphs\u00a0222-23 of the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment).
