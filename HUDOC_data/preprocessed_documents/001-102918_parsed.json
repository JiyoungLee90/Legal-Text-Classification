In that judgment the Court had held that a constitutional complaint was not capable of affording effective redress for the excessive length of pending civil proceedings. The Government argued that the applicant could have learned of the partial ineffectiveness of his constitutional complaint \u2013 lodged in 2002 \u2013 within some months after pronouncement of the Court's judgment. He should thus have submitted his complaint about the length of the proceedings 5 F 18/99 to the Court earlier than one year after the S\u00fcrmeli judgment.",

He further complained that his children had not been heard in either set of proceedings, and that he and his former wife had also not been heard. The applicant further complained about the court's failure to determine his contact rights within the scope of the joint judgment granting the divorce and determining the custody rights. With respect to the proceedings 5 F 283/98 and 5 F 18/99 the applicant finally complained under Articles 8 and 17 of the Convention about the possibility of one parent to apply for sole custody according to Article 1671 of the German Civil Code. As regards the proceedings for the regulation of his contact rights (5 F 272/98, 5 F 271/04 and 5 F 33/08) the applicant, relying on Articles 6, 8 and 14 of the Convention further complained about the content of the court settlement of 5 September 2002 and that he had allegedly not been involved in its conclusion. He also complained that his children had not been heard prior to the settlement, that the acting judge had been biased and that the domestic courts had failed to protect his relationship with his children, who had now been alienated from him. Finally, he also complained under Article 6 of the Convention about the length of the proceedings instituted under file no. 5 F 33/08. As regards the proceedings for the regulation of the children's contact rights with their father (5 F 134/01) the applicant complained under Articles 8, 17 and 18 of the Convention that he had been prevented from representing his children in these proceedings. As regards the proceedings for the regulation of the grandparents' contact rights the applicant, relying on Article 8 of the Convention, again complained that he had also been prevented from representing his children and that the domestic courts had given priority to the grandparents' contact rights.",
