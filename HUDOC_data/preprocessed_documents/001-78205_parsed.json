The court considers that the absence of the case-file and the applicant's use of several remedies, which indeed delayed the proceedings, do not, however, justify such length. The Court notes, above all, that the length of the proceedings was in a large part a result of a re-examination of the case. The Court, though not being in a position to analyse the juridical quality of the case-law of the domestic courts, considers that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a deficiency in the judicial system (e.g. De\u017eelak v. , no. 1438/02, \u00a7 25, 6 April 2006).",
