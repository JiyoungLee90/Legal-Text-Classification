As history has demonstrated, responsible journalism can, if pursued effectively, uncover information of great value for the public interest and thus promote and strengthen the fundamental democratic values of accountability and transparency. As the Court has previously held, the concept of responsible journalism, as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of Article 10 of the Convention, is not confined to the content of information which is collected and/or disseminated by journalistic means. That concept also embraces, inter alia, the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist, including his or her public interaction with the authorities when exercising journalistic functions. Importantly, the mere fact that a journalist has breached the law in his or her journalistic activity is a highly relevant, albeit not decisive, consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly.",

This may be a prudent course of action as it can be difficult to determine whether pre-publication activity, as part of investigative journalism, is conduct which in itself triggers the protections of Article 10 of the Convention. However, on the particular facts of this case, I would have been comfortable in finding that Article 10 was indeed applicable and that an interference occurred. Here, I consider, differently from my colleagues (see paragraph 43 of the [French version of the] judgment), that such a finding would have been logically consistent with the recent findings of the Grand Chamber in Pentik\u00e4inen, cited above, \u00a7 83, where the Court considered that the applicant, in the \u201cexercise of his journalistic functions had been adversely affected as he was present at the scene as a newspaper photographer in order to report on the events\u201d when he was apprehended by the police, detained for 18 hours and later charged and found guilty by the domestic courts of the crime of disobeying the police.",

At paragraph 56 the Court then correctly refers to the following Stoll criteria as the framework for the analysis of the facts (see my dissenting opinion in Pentik\u00e4inen, cited above, \u00a7 6): the interests at stake, the review of the measure by the domestic courts, the conduct of the applicant and whether the penalty imposed was proportionate (see Stoll, cited above, \u00a7 112). However, it is in the application of these criteria to the facts of the case that I find the reasoning problematic and overly broad in scope. I would have applied a narrower, more fact-sensitive analysis in the following manner.",

The public-interest inquiry should rather have been directed more intensely at the nature of the confidential information that the journalists were actually seeking to obtain so as to be able to inform the public. Indeed, and very importantly, there are situations where journalists may be justified under Article 10 of the Convention in deciding to pursue aggressive investigatory strategies in their work, even accessing confidential information, if the public interest in disseminating the information in question is strong, for example in the case of efforts to uncover corruption or illegal activities by government officials or elected representatives. Also, the fact that the newspaper is published for the benefit of a local community is irrelevant in my view, also considering that the content of the news portal in question was published online.",

The applicants accessed the police radio channel and used the information so obtained in order to be present at the scene of an everyday law-enforcement operation. The applicants have to bear the burden under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for having resorted to illegal means in obtaining confidential information without their actions being justified by the existence of a strong public interest.",

In other words, the domestic courts did not engage in a balancing of the conflicting interests at stake as is normally required in Article 10 cases of this nature under the second of the Stoll criteria, which concerns the review of the measure by the domestic courts. In my view, the Court should have recognised this problematic nature of the domestic courts\u2019 review, having already rejected the Government\u2019s non-exhaustion of domestic remedies argument that the applicants had not invoked their right to freedom of expression at domestic level (see paragraph 40 of the [French version of the] judgment).",
