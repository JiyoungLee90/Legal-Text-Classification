Turkey, no.\u00a03064/07, \u00a7 78, 8 November 2011, and Teren Aksakal v. Turkey, no.\u00a051967/99, \u00a7 85, 11 September 2007), the appeal proceedings brought before the court are not to be equated with a prosecution. They are intended solely to review a decision by a public prosecutor not to bring a prosecution (see, with regard to a similar remedy available under Netherlands law, Ramsahai, cited above, \u00a7 352).",

On the contrary, just as in the two most recent Romanian cases cited above (Mantog and Stefan), the court initially upheld the applicants\u2019 appeal by ordering additional investigations in order to test the credibility of the accident hypothesis accepted by the prosecution service. It was on the basis of the new investigative measures \u2013 including a reconstruction of the incident \u2013 that the court ultimately dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal.",

In our view, it follows that the complaint based on the investigation\u2019s alleged lack of independence under Article 2 of the Convention is unfounded.",
