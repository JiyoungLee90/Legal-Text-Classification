He had been arrested on 20 or 21 March 2002 by Jamiat-e Islami, then under the leadership of General Fahim. The applicant had been tortured several times during his incarceration. Mr\u00a0S. had been present on one of those occasions. The applicant had been told by interrogators that he had been detained because he was a communist or a convert.

This guard had set up a mock execution outside the prison, which had enabled the applicant to escape. This guard had told the applicant that he should leave Afghanistan forever.

The Minister noted, inter alia, that the applicant had worked for a part of the PDPA Government, the Revolutionary Guard, which had collaborated with the KhAD and found that it was justified to conclude that the applicant had known or should have known about the criminal character of the KhAD and that its crimes had formed part of a widespread or targeted attack aimed against the civilian population. Having regard to the official report of 29 February 2000 (see paragraph 15 above), the Minister further found that the cruel character of the KhAD had been commonly known. The Minister further did not believe that the applicant had been ignorant of the criminal character of Hezb-e Wahdat when he had started to work for it as this had been widely known at the material time. Relying on the official report of 23 June 2000 (see paragraph 15 above), the Minister underlined that Hezb-e Wahdat had been considered during the Afghan civil war to be one of the most violent groups, not only because of its militia\u2019s actions on the battle field and merciless liquidation of its political opponents, but in particular because of its militia\u2019s crimes against the civil population of Afghanistan and for having instilled a true climate of terror in the country.

Through the Anti-Soviet jihad and the civil war, Wahdat accumulated significant political capital among Afghanistan\u2019s Hazaras, which could have been spent in the establishment of long-lasting political institutions in Afghanistan. By 2009, however, Wahdat was so fragmented and divided that the political weight it carried in the country bore little resemblance to what it had once been.

However, the mere fact that a person belongs to an ethnic group constituting a minority in a certain area does not automatically trigger concerns related to risks on the ground of ethnicity alone. Other factors including, inter alia, the relative social, political, economic and military power of the person and/or his and her ethnic group in the area where fear is alleged may be relevant. Consideration should also be given to whether the person exhibits other risk factors outlined in these Guidelines, which may exacerbate the risk of persecution. In the ever-evolving context of Afghanistan, the potential for increased levels of ethnic-based violence will need to be borne in mind.\u201d",

As regards the alleged risk from the side of Hezb-e Wahdat, the Government noted that, according to his statements to the Netherlands authorities, the applicant had stopped working for this group in 1994 when, defeated, it had left Kabul for the north (while the applicant had remained in Kabul). The applicant had further stated to the Netherlands authorities that he had had no problems with this group between 1994 and 2001.",

Romania [GC] (dec.), no. 42219/07, \u00a7\u00a7 83-89, 9 July 2015). It further reiterates its above finding under Article 13 taken together with Article\u00a03 that, in cases concerning removal from the Netherlands raising issues under Article\u00a03 of the Convention, a further appeal to the Administrative Jurisdiction Division cannot be regarded as an \u201ceffective remedy\u201d as it does not have automatic suspensive effect (see paragraph 66 above).\u00a0However, the Court also reiterates that by contrast, where expulsions are challenged on the basis of alleged interference with private and family life, it is not imperative, in order for a remedy to be effective, that it should have automatic suspensive effect. Nevertheless, in immigration matters, where there is an arguable claim that expulsion threatens to interfere with the alien\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life, Article 13 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 8 requires that States must make available to the individual concerned the effective possibility of challenging the deportation or refusal-of-residence order and of having the relevant issues examined with sufficient procedural safeguards and thoroughness by an appropriate domestic forum offering adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality (see De Souza Ribeiro, cited above, \u00a7 83; and Al Hanchi v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 48205/09, \u00a7 56, 15 November 2011).",
