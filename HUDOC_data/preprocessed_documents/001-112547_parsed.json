That court knows the case file well and is best placed to get an idea of the interaction between the act and the actor (daad-dadercomplex). It will then be determined from the outset whether it is maximised or not. Moreover, it is desirable both from the perspective of treatment and from that of the legal position of the person subject to the order that it be foreseeable at the time when the TBS order is imposed whether TBS order is maximised or not. The treatment plan can be drawn up accordingly. The person subject to the TBS order will then know, if the order is maximised, what its maximum duration will be.\u201d (page 9)",

It is thus clear from the start whether the TBS order is maximised or not. As a rule, it will be enough for the court to point to the nature of the indictable offence as found proven and qualified.
