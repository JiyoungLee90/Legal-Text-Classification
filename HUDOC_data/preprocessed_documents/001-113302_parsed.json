On 23 April 2004 at around 4 p.m. I was coming home from my aunt\u2019s place when I noticed a car parked next to our house. The car moved and our paths met not far from my house. I saw our [local policeman R.S.] together with one of our district inspectors whom I did not know. They stopped and started talking to me. [R.S.] said that they were coming for me and that the chief (meaning the chief of police) wanted to have a talk with me. I answered that if I came to the police department they would keep me \u201covernight\u201d, taking into account the fact that the same had happened before to my friends. [R.S.] promised me that no such thing would happen and I agreed to go with them. We went together to the police. I and [R.S.] went up to the second floor. After waiting for a moment next to his office, he took me to the Head of the Criminal Investigation Unit [H.M.]. There [H.M.] started talking and said \u201cGrisha, what is this all about the demonstrations you are holding and the government you are changing? You are upsetting the stability of the country\u201d and things like that[. H]e also said that I had taken people to the demonstrations and added that I had taken with me, for instance, [G.A.]. I asked whether [G.A.] could come and prove that I had taken him to the demonstrations and added that he had his own brain to decide what to do. [H.M.] left the office telling me that he would be back soon. A little while later I was invited to go to the office of the deputy chief of police [G.]. When I entered [G.\u2019s] office he asked me why I was talking loudly in the hallway and why I was organising a demonstration in the building [of the police station]. I answered that I had not been in the hallway and had not organised any demonstration. [G.] said that I was using foul language to him there and then and ordered that a case be prepared on account of my committing an administrative offence. I and [R.S.] came back to his office where he, in the presence of [another police officer, A.M.], said that he would not prepare materials against me and left the room. A little while later [A.M.] was called[. H]e went away, then returned and started preparing some documents. He inquired about my personal details but I refused to say anything and only said that I had higher education. A little while later [H.M.] came. [A.M.] told him that I refused to provide any information about myself. He ordered [A.M.] to go and bring form no. 1. [A.M.] left and came back with a piece of paper on which I could see my photo. [A.M.] filled in some documents and asked me to sign them[. I] answered that I would not sign any documents. At that moment a girl came to [A.M.\u2019s office]. He told the girl to type a court document. [A.M.], apparently having finished filling in the documents, was about to go, probably to fetch the court document. I understood by now that I was going to be taken to a court and sentenced to an \u201covernight\u201d. Besides, [A.M.] also said that they were about to take me to a court and left the office. At that moment [H.M.] entered the office. I was sitting in front of one of the desks. Upon entering the office he immediately started swearing at me, also saying that it was their country and that they could do anything they wanted to and that what we were trying to do, meaning the change of the government, was all in vain. I answered: \u201cYou do what you think is right and we will do what we consider to be right\u201d[. A]t that moment [H.M.] kicked me. The blow fell on the left side of my chest. He kicked me with the sharp tip of his shoe. I felt sharp pain in the area of my ribs. He immediately punched me twice in the face with his left fist. At that moment I lost my temper and to defend myself picked up the mobile phone charger from the desk and hit him with it. The cable stayed in my hand while the charger broke off and hit [H.M.\u2019s] face. I saw him holding his eye and screaming. At that moment [A.M.] entered the office and, seeing the chaotic situation, took me to the nearby office. [H.M. and another police officer, A.A.,] followed me there and started beating me. I fell down but they went on beating me. They were kicking and punching me. Then other officers came and took [H.M. and A.A.] out. I would like to indicate that at the very beginning both [H.M. and A.A.] kicked me on my testicles. Some while after [H.M. and A.A.] had been taken away from the office, [another police officer A.K.] came to the office [(I learned his name and position from other officers after the incident)] and started swearing at me, trying to humiliate me, twice spat on me and punched my testicles[. Then] he kicked my feet several times and left. Before leaving he hit me again on my testicles with his keys. [A.K.], before beating me in the office, ordered everybody to leave, saying that he was going to abuse me. After he left [A.A.] entered the office and started beating me again, demanding that I stand upright. He was hitting and saying \u201cHit back! Why don\u2019t you hit back now?\u201d Some time later an ambulance doctor came to check whether I was drunk. I told her that I was not drunk. They contacted the chief of traffic inspection and asked for an \u201campoule\u201d. [Another police officer, A.H.,] brought the ampoule. The doctor broke the edge of the ampoule and I blew in it. At that time I was asserting again that I was not drunk. [A.H.] hit me on my forehead. He hit me twice on my forehead. It seemed like he wanted to show deliberately that he was defending the honour of the uniform. I was in a terrible condition[. I] asked [another police officer, M.B.,] and he gave me some water, then poured it on my head, back and face for me to regain consciousness. [Another police officer, R.H.,] also helped me; he removed my handcuffs, realising of course that I was in a bad condition...\u201d",

The testimonies of police officers A.A., R.S., H.M. and A.K. were false and lacked any probative value, since these persons were the perpetrators of his brutal beating. Furthermore, the police officers of the Artashat Police Department had been persecuting him since March 2004 and the anonymous phone call of 23 April 2004 was a mere set-up. Because of a slow and biased investigation the above-mentioned persons had managed to avoid criminal responsibility. In particular, the investigating authority had failed to arrange immediate confrontations and did so only in July 2004, thereby allowing the police officers to coordinate their testimonies, while the conclusions of the forensic medical expert were not impartial. No criminal proceedings had been instituted, while the perpetrators were questioned only two months after the incident, which suggested that the case was of a political nature and enjoyed a high-ranking patronage. The fact of his systematic ill-treatment on the night of 23 April 2004 was confirmed by the relevant hospital papers and there were sufficient grounds to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers as required by Articles 175 and 176 of the CCP (see paragraph 105 and 106 below). The applicant insisted that such proceedings be instituted since the offence committed against him had absolutely not been investigated.

However, there was still no progress, and Virabyan was still the only one being charged. By that time his indictment was ready to be sent to court. The Prosecutor General ordered that the charges be dropped only after the Defender intervened.\u201d",

However, in March and April 2004, the Armenian government not only began a fresh campaign of detentions, but added to the intimidation with security force violence. ...",

More precisely, the applicant was entitled under Article 290 of the CCP (see paragraph 114 above) to contest the decisions of the investigating authority before the domestic courts. The applicant successfully exercised this right by instituting two sets of proceedings: the first one contesting the investigator\u2019s decision of 7 June 2004 rejecting his allegations of ill-treatment and the second one contesting the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 30 August 2004 terminating the criminal proceedings against him. The six months period must be calculated from the date of the final decision in the first set of proceedings, which was taken by the Court of Cassation on 24 September 2004. The application, which had been lodged with the Court only on 10\u00a0November 2005, was therefore out of time. The Government argued that the applicant\u2019s submission that the six months period must be calculated from the date of the final decision in the second set of proceedings, namely 13 May 2005, was ill-founded, since those proceedings concerned a different issue, namely the termination of the criminal proceedings, and none of the court decisions taken in those proceedings concerned the applicant\u2019s request to institute criminal proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of ill-treatment or contained any ruling on the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment.",

He admitted that he had instituted two sets of proceedings resulting in two final decisions being taken by the Court of Cassation on 24 September 2004 and 13\u00a0May\u00a02005 respectively. However, his complaint lodged with the Erebuni and Nubarashen District Prosecutor on 2 June 2004 and consequently the first set of proceedings instituted by him against the prosecutor\u2019s decision taken on that complaint, which terminated with the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision of 24 September 2004, were not an effective remedy. More precisely, the prosecutor dismissed his complaint just five days later, namely on 7\u00a0June 2004, without carrying out any official and independent investigation into his allegations of ill-treatment and basing his findings solely on the results of the preliminary investigation carried out in the context of the criminal case against him. His appeals lodged with the courts against the decision of 7 June 2004 were also ineffective because the courts refused to examine them in substance on the ground that the impugned decision was a procedural decision and they lacked jurisdiction to do so. In such circumstances, both the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 7 June 2004 and the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision of 24 September 2004 could not be considered as a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1.",

Since he had never denied that he had struck the police officer with a mobile phone charger, the only issue at trial would have been whether or not he had acted in self-defence, as he had always maintained. Had he succeeded in this appeal, he would have been afforded an effective remedy, such as an official recognition of the fact that he had struck the police officer in self-defence which would necessarily have implied a finding that he had been ill-treated in detention.

Even the Court of Cassation, in refusing to examine the merits of the applicant\u2019s appeal against that decision, stated that there was no need to institute a separate set of proceedings because the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment were closely linked to the subject matter of the criminal case against him and were to be examined in its context (see paragraph 84 above).

In his appeal to the courts the applicant complained inter alia about his alleged ill-treatment and the inadequacy of the investigation and requested that criminal proceedings be instituted (see paragraph 86 above). Even if the courts were primarily called upon to determine the question of whether the termination of the criminal proceedings against the applicant on the grounds provided in the prosecutor\u2019s decision was lawful, nevertheless, in reviewing that decision, they were required under Article 17 \u00a7 4 of the CCP to examine any complaints alleging a violation of lawfulness in the course of the proceedings, including the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment. Furthermore, even if the courts were not vested with power to institute criminal proceedings, they were entitled to apply with such a request to a prosecutor under Articles 41 \u00a7 2(4) and 184 \u00a7 1 of the CCP.

In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which came into force on 26 June 1987, which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see Salman, cited above, \u00a7 114).",

These injuries had lasting consequences for his health, as his left testicle was so badly smashed that it had to be removed. He was further beaten up with his hands handcuffed behind his back and received blows to his chest and ribs. Strong inferences can be drawn from the circumstances of the case that the ill-treatment was inflicted on the applicant intentionally in order either to punish or to intimidate him or both. Having regard to the nature, degree and purpose of the ill-treatment, the Court finds that it may be characterised as acts of torture (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 96-105, and Salman, cited above, \u00a7 115).",

As a result, the new forensic medical examination was not initiated until almost three months after the incident. The Court is convinced that such a delayed examination was not capable of providing an accurate record of the applicant\u2019s injuries and consequently leading to credible findings. It therefore seriously doubts that this measure was able to rectify the shortcomings of the first forensic medical examination. This is also confirmed by the fact that the report produced as a result of the new examination contained findings practically identical to those in the first report (see paragraph 77 above).",

It appears that no account was taken of this obviously important evidence at any stage of the investigation. Despite the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s injuries, the investigating authorities did not examine the hospital records or question the relevant doctors until almost two and a half months after the incident (see paragraphs 71 and 73 above) and, even then, it appears that no importance was given to this evidence and no conclusions were drawn. No attempts were made to resolve the discrepancy between this evidence and the findings of the forensic expert, including by questioning the latter, and no answer was given to the question of whether the applicant\u2019s injuries in their entirety could have been caused in the circumstances alleged by the police officers.",

In this respect, the Court notes that the very first police reports on the incident did not mention anything about the applicant falling face-down on a chair (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above), an explanation which was later relied on to justify his injuries. Such explanation, nevertheless, started to appear consistently in almost all the statements taken by the investigator during the subsequent interviews with the police officers (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a023, 24 and 35 above). Furthermore, having regard to the manner in which those interviews were conducted, the Court observes that on several such occasions the police officers were simply asked to provide their account of events and no questions whatsoever were put to them (see paragraphs 25, 35 and 39 above). Even on those few occasions when the investigator did ask questions, there were never more than one or two questions and in most cases the questions asked were of a standard nature and lacked specificity (see paragraphs 23, 24, 44, 47 and 50 above). The interviews in question therefore appear to have been a pure formality and the Court cannot regard them as a serious and timely attempt to establish the circumstances in which the applicant suffered his injuries.",

In particular, it is not clear why the hospital records indicated that the doctor\u2019s first visit to the police station, whose purpose was to determine the applicant\u2019s level of intoxication, was made at around 3.05 p.m. on 23 April 2004 (see paragraph 66 above), while according to the police records the applicant was arrested not before 5.40 p.m. On the other hand, the record of the applicant\u2019s intoxication examination indicates that the first visit took place at around 7\u00a0p.m. (see paragraph 18 above), which suggests that there may have been a mistake in the hospital records. However, even assuming that this was the case, it is highly surprising that the applicant, who had already suffered \u2013 allegedly at 6.30 p.m. (see paragraphs 27 and 48 above) \u2013 injuries to his chest and a very serious injury to his testicle, did not report any of this to the doctor examining him for alcohol intoxication. Moreover, assuming that the applicant had been in such an emergency condition since 6.30 p.m., it is not clear why an ambulance was called to provide first aid only at 11.20 p.m. (see paragraph 29 above). As already indicated above, no efforts were made to clarify these important circumstances when taking statements from the police officers. Nor were any relevant questions put to doctor A.G. who had made both visits to the police station on the day of the incident (see paragraph 71 above).",

Secondly, confrontations between the applicant and the police officers were held with delays of about one and a half up to three and a half months (see paragraphs\u00a063, 64, 67 and 78 above), thereby significantly minimising the effectiveness of these measures, while no confrontation was held between the applicant and deputy chief of police G. Thirdly, it is not clear on what grounds the prosecutor\u2019s decision terminating the criminal proceedings stated that police officer H.M. in self-defence had kicked the applicant\u2019s testicles (see paragraph 82 above) when none of the evidence in the case appears to have contained such an allegation.
