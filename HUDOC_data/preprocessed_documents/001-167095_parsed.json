By a final decision of 25 June 2007 the Town Court found that the index-linking method used by the Ministry was in accordance with the law, and could be applied from 1 January 2003 onwards. That decision was upheld on appeal on 11 October 2007. In reaching that conclusion, the courts analysed in detail the applicable domestic law, as well as the effect of the change in statutory provisions on the way that allowances were adjusted. The Court finds no indication that the proceedings which led to the decision of 25\u00a0June 2007 were arbitrary, nor did the interpretation of the award by the domestic courts amount to a \u201cflagrant inconsistency\u201d (see Gerasimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 173). It reiterates its subsidiary role in the matters disputed by the parties, and finds that, in view of the domestic court\u2019s decision clarifying the initial judgment, starting from 11\u00a0October 2007 the applicant cannot be said to have an enforceable claim for the amount to be indexlinked in accordance with the statutory minimum monthly salary.",
