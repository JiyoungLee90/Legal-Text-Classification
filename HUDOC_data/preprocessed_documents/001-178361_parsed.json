Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v. France, judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 273\u2011B, \u00a7 28, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 12 December 1991, Series A no. 224, \u00a7 84). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee, and Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no.50272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR 2003\u2011IV).",

Even if the initial delay of thirty-five days caused by the agency during the first set of appeal proceedings could have been attributed to certain unavoidable circumstances, the second delay of seventy days caused by the same agency processing essentially a similar translation request demonstrates that the domestic courts failed to ensure the diligent and \u201cspeedy\u201d conduct of the appeal proceedings.",
