Relying on Chapter 6, Article 7 of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen) it stated that she was entitled to redress for the delay, which could be awarded either by choosing a more lenient type of punishment or by reducing the sentence. The court went on to state that the applicant had been found guilty of fairly small-scale unorganised procuring. It also took into account the short period of time over which the offence had been committed and the small amount of proceeds obtained. For those reasons, and due to the length of the proceedings, the court concluded that the applicant should be sentenced to a fine. The court also took into account the delay in the proceedings in the amount of the unit fines, without specifying the reduction in the sentence.",

The Court observes that the provision enabling the hearing of a witness by such means came into force on 1 October 2003. Yet the State did not provide the Tampere District Court with video-conferencing equipment until autumn 2008 thus, in practice, hindering the application of the above-mentioned provision. The Government have not claimed that there was any other impediment to the hearing of the witnesses via video link, such as lack of co-operation by the Estonian authorities or suitable video-conferencing equipment in that country. On the contrary, it appears that the Estonian authorities acceded to the District Court's request for international legal assistance once it was made, without delay.
