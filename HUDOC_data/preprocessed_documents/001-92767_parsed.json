Lord Justice Sedley gave the judgment of the court. It was noted that there was no dispute that the reading of prisoners\u2019 correspondence was governed by law, and that it was directed to the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The issue to be decided was whether, in the language of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the reading of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was proportionate. While the prison governor\u2019s initial decision to allow confidentiality to the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence with his external medical specialist strongly suggested that its exemption from Chapter 36.21 of PSO 1000 would be a perfectly reasonable course, the onus still remained on the applicant to establish that anything more invasive would constitute a disproportionate interference with his Article 8 rights.",

It considered that although it was of course possible to verify the existence, address and qualifications of the applicant\u2019s external medical specialist (whose bona fides was not in question), there was no way of ensuring that the latter would not be intimidated or tricked into transmitting illicit messages. While the same was true of, for example, the secretarial staff of members of parliament (MPs), the importance of unimpeded correspondence with MPs outweighed the risk. By contrast, as regards correspondence with doctors, the prisoner\u2019s health was the concern and the immediate responsibility of the Prison Medical Service. Though it may well be the case that allowing the prison medical officer to read the prisoner\u2019s correspondence with an outside medical practitioner might lead the former to \u201cencounter criticism of his own performance\u201d, it was inherently unlikely that this would carry the same degree of risk that might attend the reading by a discipline officer of a letter of complaint to the Prisons Ombudsman. Moreover, if it related to the prisoner\u2019s well-being it was probable that the prison medical officer ought in any event to know about it.",

The Court of Appeal based its conclusion on the following factors. Firstly, the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence answered legitimate and pressing policy objectives which were clearly stated in Chapter 36.1 of PSO 1000 (see paragraph 28 below). Secondly, short of withdrawing all scrutiny, it considered that there was no less invasive measure available to the prison service. Thirdly, the reading of the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence which was limited to the prison medical officer was not in its view excessive. Fourthly, the process by which the measure had been decided upon was not found to be arbitrary. In particular, it had not been the result of the rigid application of a policy. The withdrawal of monitoring had not only been considered but had been implemented until, upon reconsideration, monitoring had been resumed. The interference in question had not denied the essence of the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights as it related to one correspondent only (the external medical specialist) and it confined the interference to a medically qualified reader (the prison medical officer). It was recognised that there was an inescapable risk of abuse, for example, if the applicant\u2019s prison life or treatment was made more difficult because of what he was observed to be writing. However, the risk, having been minimised by virtue of confining surveillance to the prison medical officer, was outweighed by the above-mentioned factors.",

It further notes that the Court of Appeal was careful not to exclude the possibility that in another case it might be disproportionate to refuse confidentiality to a prisoner\u2019s medical correspondence (see paragraph 19 above) and its acceptance that allowing the prison medical officer to read such correspondence might lead him to encounter criticism of his own performance, which in turn could create difficulties in respect of the applicant\u2019s prison life and treatment. It should not be overlooked that although he was a registered medical practitioner, the prison medical officer was, until the coming into force of section 25(1) of the Offender Management Act 2007, a prison officer.

In the present case, the applicant only wished to correspond confidentially with one named medical specialist and the Court of Appeal accepted that her address and qualifications were easily verifiable. Moreover, the medical specialist in question appeared to have been willing and able to mark all correspondence with the applicant with a distinctive stamp, and had demonstrably done so prior to the prison governor\u2019s revision of his decision on 28 November 2002. The Court does not share the Court of Appeal\u2019s view that the risk that the applicant\u2019s medical specialist, whose bona fides was never challenged, might be \u201cintimidated or tricked\u201d into transmitting illicit messages was sufficient to justify the interference with the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights in the exceptional circumstances of the present case. This is particularly so since the Court of Appeal further acknowledged that although the same risk was inherent in the case of secretarial staff of MPs (see paragraph 18 above), the importance of unimpeded correspondence with MPs outweighed that risk.",

In so finding, the Court refers to the Court of Appeal\u2019s concession that it might, in some cases, be disproportionate to refuse confidentiality to a prisoner\u2019s medical correspondence and the changes that have since been enacted to the relevant domestic law. The Court also has regard to the submissions of the applicant on this point, namely that the Government have failed to provide sufficient reasons why the risk of abuse involved in correspondence with named doctors whose exact address, qualifications and bona fides are not in question should be perceived as greater than the risk involved in correspondence with lawyers.",
