However the number of targeted assassinations and executions of civilians has also increased in other parts of the country previously considered more secure. In the south-eastern and central regions, the number of assassinations and executions allegedly committed by armed anti-Government groups in 2010 has increased in comparison to 2009. Such targeted attacks rose dramatically in parts of the southern region, particularly in Kandahar, where the Taliban have been conducting a systematic and targeted assassination campaign since the beginning of 2010. An average of 21 assassinations per week (compared to seven per week during the same period in 2009) was recorded from June to mid-September 2010, mostly in the southern and south-eastern regions.",

The reasons for return are several, and include: (i) the perception that the security situation in some provinces has improved; (ii) economic factors and (iii) the increased insecurity and natural disasters in the former settlement areas in Pakistan. While thousands of Afghans returned to their home areas, nearly one third currently reside in informal IDP settlements or urban areas in Afghanistan. Some of these settlements are located in the provinces of Nagarhar, Laghman and Kunar, which are experiencing fluctuating but still significant levels of civilian casualties and security incidents. It should be noted that many returns are occurring in the context of deteriorating conditions for Afghans outside the country rather than significant improvements in the security and human rights conditions in Afghanistan.\u201d",

In all thirty-three cases monitored in 2010 where foreigners had been returned to Ukraine, the foreigners had stated that they had orally expressed their intention to seek asylum in Slovakia to the Slovakian authorities. That was not corroborated by examination of the Slovakian files and in some cases the files contained explicit statements from the foreigners to the effect that they did not wish to seek asylum. However, in several cases checked, there had been procedural errors which may have led to individuals being interviewed without proper interpretation. In such cases, the reliability of records was evidently open to doubt.

He stated that he had not intended to ask for asylum in Slovakia. In that respect, the Slovakian authorities\u2019 records are consistent with the applicant\u2019s subsequent statements to the Ukrainian authorities and in the application form lodged with this Court, to the effect that he and his brother-in-law had intended to travel to western Europe, which the brother-in-law in fact did just days after the applicant had reached Slovakia (see paragraphs 7 and 25 above). The Slovakian authorities\u2019 records are also consistent with the applicant\u2019s conduct at the border: it is uncontested that he had attempted to pass through Slovakia in a clandestine manner, rather than present himself openly at the border post to ask for asylum (contrast M.A. and Others\u00a0v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a059793/17, \u00a7\u00a0107, 11 December 2018).",

He failed to specify, however, the substance of his request and to whom exactly it had been addressed, precisely when and in what context. He did not identify the fellow Afghan who had supposedly attempted to translate for him, or provide a statement from that interpreter.

By virtue of Article\u00a01 of the Convention, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the guaranteed rights and freedoms is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Articles 13 and 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court must be satisfied, however, that the assessment made by the authorities of the Contracting State was adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources such as, for instance, other Contracting or third States, agencies of the United Nations and reputable non-governmental organisations (ibid., \u00a7 117).",

In order to determine whether there is a risk of ill-treatment, the Court must examine the foreseeable consequences of sending the applicant to the destination country, bearing in mind the general situation there and his personal circumstances. Where the sources available describe a general situation, an applicant\u2019s specific allegations in a particular case require corroboration by other evidence. In cases where an applicant alleges that he or she is a member of a group systematically exposed to a practice of ill-treatment, the Court considers that the protection of Article 3 of the Convention enters into play when the applicant establishes, where necessary on the basis of the above-mentioned sources, that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice in question and in his or her membership of the group concerned (ibid., \u00a7 120).",
