As a rule, compensation must be awarded simultaneously with the issuing of the penal order (section 55(1)).

The impounding and forfeiture of the alcohol in issue were clearly measures for the enforcement of those provisions. Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the forfeiture can be examined as both a constituent element of the procedure for the control of the use of excise goods (see, mutatis mutandis, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 108, and Bowler International Unit v. France, no. 1946/06, \u00a7 41, 23 July 2009) and as a measure securing the payment of taxes or penalties (see, mutatis mutandis, Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH, cited above, \u00a7 59). It\u00a0follows that it is the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 which is applicable in the present case.",

Although the Court can and should exercise a certain power of review in this matter, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention, and it cannot question the way in which the domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law except in cases of flagrant nonobservance or arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Weber and Saravia v. Germany (dec.), no. 54934/00, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2006-XI, and Goranova-Karaeneva v. Bulgaria, no. 12739/05, \u00a7 46, 8 March 2011). The legislation in issue in the instant case clearly provided that excise goods sold by a sole trader without a licence were subject to forfeiture, and made no provision for third parties asserting rights to such goods to take part in administrativepenal proceedings against the offender (see paragraphs 2325 above). The domestic courts\u2019 rulings appear in accordance with that legislation, and there is nothing to indicate that they went beyond the reasonable limits of interpretation. Nor can it be said that their rulings came as a surprise to the applicant company (see Saccoccia v. Austria, no.\u00a069917/01, \u00a7 87, 18 December 2008, and, mutatis mutandis, J.A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd and J.A. Pye (Oxford) Land Ltd v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44302/02, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2007-III). As for the question whether the applicable domestic legislation meets the relevant Convention requirements, the Court will examine it below in the context of the question whether the interference was necessary for the achievement of the legitimate aim pursued (see, for a similar approach and mutatis mutandis, Yordanova and\u00a0Others v. Bulgaria, no. 25446/06, \u00a7 108, 24 April 2012).",

In ascertaining whether this condition has been satisfied, the Court must take a comprehensive view of the applicable procedures (see AGOSI, cited above, \u00a7 55; Bowler International Unit, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45; Jokela v.

The Court observes, however, that the authorities did not notify the company of the impounding of its goods or of the ensuing penal order (see paragraphs 13 and 18 above). The failure to comply with the timelimit cannot therefore be imputed to the company (see, mutatis mutandis, Platakou v. Greece, no.\u00a038460/97, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2001-I, and Neshev v.

In the Court\u2019s view, the lack of any judicial review of the contested measure was undoubtedly a result of deficient domestic legislation, because the relevant law did not provide for such a review, which put the applicant company in a situation of having no safeguards capable to protect it against unjustified interference (contrast Air Canada v. the United Kingdom, 5 May 1995, \u00a7 46, Series\u00a0A no. 316A).",

In particular, domestic law does not provide for a procedure for the return of goods confiscated in a situation such as that of the present case. As for the Government\u2019s assertion that the applicants could have brought a claim for damages under section 1 of the 1988 Act, that argument appears to be baseless, as until 2006 legal persons could not bring claims under that Act (see paragraph 27 above, Zl\u00ednsat, spol. s r.o. v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 57785/00, \u00a7 54, 15 June 2006, and First Sofia Commodities\u00a0EOOD and Paragh v.

It therefore rejects this claim.

Among these, account should be taken of the company\u2019s reputation, uncertainty in planning and decision making, disruption in the management of the company and lastly, albeit to a lesser degree, anxiety and inconvenience caused to the members of the management team (see, among other authorities, Comingersoll S.A. v.\u00a0Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, \u00a7\u00a7 32-36, ECHR 2000-IV, and Shesti Mai Engineering OOD and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 17854/04, \u00a7 115, 20\u00a0September 2011). However, in the present case there is no indication that the events in issue negatively affected in any significant way the reputation, the planning, the decision making or the management of the applicant company, or caused significant anxiety and inconvenience to members of its management team. The Court therefore rejects this claim.",
