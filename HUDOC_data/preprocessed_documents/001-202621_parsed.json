The State\u2019s obligation in this regard extends beyond its primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions. Article 2 of the Convention may also imply, in certain well-defined circumstances, a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see R.R. and Others v. Hungary, no. 19400/11, \u00a7 28, 4 December 2012, and Maiorano and Others v. Italy, no. 28634/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0103-104, 15\u00a0December 2009, with further references).",

Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. In the opinion of the Court, where there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obligation to protect the right to life in the context of their above-mentioned duty to prevent and suppress offences against the person, it must be established to its satisfaction that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. For the Court, and having regard to the nature of the right protected by Article 2, a right fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, it is sufficient for an applicant to show that the authorities did not do all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge. This is a question which can only be answered in the light of all the circumstances of any particular case (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 115-16, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII).",

Noting the Government\u2019s failure to show in a persuasive manner that the risk in question had ceased to exist and the inadequacy of the measures taken to protect the applicants\u2019 lives subsequent to their removal from the witness protection scheme, the Court concluded that the Hungarian authorities\u2019 actions had fallen short of the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention (see also Selahattin Demirta\u015f v.
