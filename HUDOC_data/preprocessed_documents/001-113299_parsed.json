In particular, the applicant produced a medical certificate of 26 October 2005, which stated that he had been admitted to hospital on 9 October 2005 and had been diagnosed with closed craniocerebral trauma, concussion and soft-tissue damage to the crown of head. He also produced two photos of himself taken immediately after he had been beaten. The fact that the applicant had been subjected to a beating and had received serious injuries on 9 October 2005 was in itself never placed in doubt by the investigating authorities, in particular in the Sabail District Prosecutor\u2019s Office decision of 9 March 2006 suspending the investigation. As to the applicant\u2019s claim that the injuries had been inflicted by police, it should be noted that he received those injuries during a police operation forcibly dispersing the demonstration of 9 October 2005. He produced statements from two witnesses supporting his version of the events, and a photo confirming A.V.\u2019s presence at the scene of the incident. The evidence produced before the Court is sufficiently strong and consistent to establish at least a presumption that the applicant was beaten with truncheons by police officers during the dispersal of the demonstration. In the Court\u2019s opinion, neither the Government in their submissions, nor the domestic authorities in their decisions, provided a convincing rebuttal of this presumption.",

The Court has repeatedly stressed that the procedural obligation under Articles 2 and 3 requires an investigation to be independent and impartial, both in law and in practice (see paragraph 46 above). The Court notes that the Sabail District Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which was formally an independent investigating authority and which conducted the investigation in the present case, requested the Sabail District Police Department to carry out an inquiry with the aim of identifying those who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant. As such, the investigating authority delegated a major and essential part of the investigation \u2013 identification of the perpetrators of the alleged illtreatment \u2013 to the same authority whose agents had allegedly committed the offence. In this respect, the Court finds it of no real significance that, while the alleged perpetrators were officers of the Riot Police Regiment of the Baku Police Department, it was another police department which was requested to carry out the investigation. What is important is that the investigation of alleged misconduct potentially engaging the responsibility of a public authority and its officers was carried out by those agents\u2019 colleagues, employed by the same public authority. In the Court\u2019s view, in such circumstances an investigation by the police force of an allegation of misconduct by its own officers could not be independent in the present case (compare, mutatis mutandis, Ramsahai and Others v. the  [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 295-96, ECHR 2007II; Akta\u015f v.

In the Court\u2019s view, the investigating authority (the Sabail District Prosecutor\u2019s Office) was fully competent to take, and should have been entirely capable of taking, independent, tangible and effective investigative measures aimed at identifying the culprits, such as obtaining a list of the members of the Riot Police Regiment engaged in the dispersal operation, questioning all the police officers involved, identifying and questioning other witnesses (those on the demonstration, bystanders, and so on), holding face-to-face confrontations of witnesses where necessary, attempting to reconstruct the chronology of the events, and so on.

It is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest. Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. This undoubtedly includes, like in the present case, reporting on opposition gatherings and demonstrations which is essential for the development of any democratic society. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \"public watchdog\" (see, among other authorities, Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26\u00a0November\u00a01991, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 216, and The Sunday Times v. the  (no. 2), 26 November 1991, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 217).",

Although the applicant was not wearing a special vest, he was wearing a journalist\u2019s badge on his chest and also specifically told the police officers that he was a journalist. Thus, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that police officers had been unable to determine that the applicant was a journalist.",

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that it cannot be disputed that the physical ill-treatment by State agents of journalists while the latter are performing their professional duties seriously hampers their exercise of the right to receive and impart information. In this regard the Court notes the Government\u2019s argument that there was no actual intention to interfere with the applicant\u2019s journalistic activity as such. However, irrespective of whether there was such intention in the present case, what matters is that the journalist was subjected to the unnecessary and excessive use of force, amounting to ill-treatment under Article 3 of the Convention, despite having made clear efforts to identify himself as a journalist who was simply doing his work and observing the event. Accordingly, the Court considers that there has been an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 10 of the Convention.",
