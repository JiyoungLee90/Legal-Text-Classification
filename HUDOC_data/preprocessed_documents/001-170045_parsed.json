Denmark, 24 May 1989, \u00a7\u00a047, Series\u00a0A\u00a0no.\u00a0154, and Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2005XIII). As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or illwill or has arranged to have a case assigned to himself for personal reasons (see De\u00a0Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, \u00a7 25, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a086). The principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long-established in the case\u2011law of the Court (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v.\u00a0Belgium, 23 June 1981, \u00a7\u00a058, Series A no. 43, and Morice v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR\u00a02015).",

Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2009). In other words, the Court has recognised the difficulty of establishing a breach of Article 6 on account of subjective partiality and for this reason has, in the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues, focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between the two notions, since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (the objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (the subjective test).",

In this respect, even appearances may be of some importance (see Castillo Algar v.\u00a0Spain, 28\u00a0October 1998, \u00a7\u00a045, Reports 1998\u2011VIII, and Morel v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a034130/96, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2000VI). When it is being decided whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular body lacks impartiality, the standpoint of those claiming that it is not impartial is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether the fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.\u00a0Italy, 7\u00a0August 1996, \u00a7\u00a058, Reports 1996\u2011III, Wettstein v.

If certain procedural developments may be regarded as a mere continuation of previous steps so that all of them can be considered as belonging to the same procedural stage, then the questions under consideration do not arise. This may be the case if a party lodges an opposition to a judgment delivered in absentia. The subsequent procedure may be regarded as a second part of the same procedural stage (compare, for instance, the judgment of 10 June 1996 in the case of Thomann v.\u00a0Switzerland, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III).",
