The family had been living on their meagre savings, of which very little was left at that stage.

Moreover, the applicant\u2019s wife had sold off the family shoe business in 2010 \u201cimplying the inflow of a substantial amount of money within the family.\u201d In the light of previous decisions, and the fact that the accused had no ties with Malta, the court considered that a bail deposit of EUR 15,000 was commensurate with the charges preferred against him.",

She had also emphasized that the financial means at their disposal were limited since the applicant had not been working for the past two years and she was precluded from working due to her illness, meaning that their savings had been used to meet the daily needs of the family and to pay the mortgage. Moreover, although the house seemed to be of a certain value, this had to be seen in the context of the British property market and the fact that putting the house up for sale was not envisaged.

The law provides that inquiries should be concluded within one month \u2012 and that period must not be extended beyond three months \u2012 and that where an inquiry is restarted, it should be concluded with a maximum of five working days; however, in the applicant\u2019s case the inquiry had spanned over fifty-four months. Indeed, in his co-accused\u2019s case (Mikalauskas v. Malta, cited above, \u00a7 123) the Court had already concluded that the authorities had failed to conduct the proceedings with the requisite diligence. The same conclusions should clearly apply to the present case relating to the same proceedings, especially as more months had elapsed. The applicant pointed out the multiple adjournments, the substantial gaps between hearings, a lengthy cessation of the inquiry pending the letters rogatory which had to be sent and re-sent by the Attorney General, and a piecemeal approach to calling witnesses, with limited progress being made in the gathering of evidence on the days when the evidence was called. Moreover, there had been no substantiation of the suggestion that the case was complex, which in fact it was not. Nor had it been shown that any steps had been taken to speed up the proceedings. The applicant further noted that, contrary to the Government\u2019s allegation that for the purposes of an assessment of Article 5 \u00a7 3 special attention needed to be paid to the applicant\u2019s conduct, according to the Court\u2019s case law it was the authorities\u2019 role to speed up proceedings. In any event the applicant could not be blamed for attempting to secure crucial evidence which was eventually lost as a result of Government\u2019s shortcomings. Moreover, special attention had to be given to the occurrences at the time of the applicant\u2019s post-bail detention, which \u2012 as shown from the facts \u2012 support the applicant\u2019s case.",

They noted that the case was complex as it dealt with two co-accused involved in conspiracy in large-scale drug trafficking. It was therefore necessary to gather a considerable amount of evidence as well as testimony from the police, experts and witnesses regarding both accused. Although the accused was always present at the hearings, he had not positively contributed to the progress of proceedings and in the Government\u2019s view he was, to date, still employing tactics to protract them. In particular, ten months after his arrest he had filed a vague request for telephonic data from the United Kingdom. He had engaged in numerous conflicts with the Office of the Attorney General because, according to the Government, he had persistently refused to adhere to the correct procedure laid down in the law. He consequently filed incorrect letters of request on two occasions, and by the time they were filed, the twelve-month preservation period for telephonic data had expired. The handling of the hearings by the authorities had also been expeditious, hearings being held at regular intervals of a few days or sometimes four or six weeks. The prosecution regularly produced evidence and summonsed the requested witnesses \u2013 indeed it had submitted all its evidence in twenty-six hearings over twelve months. It had been prompt in abiding by court decrees, as the Office of the Attorney General had likewise been in remitting the documents relating to the case to the Court of Magistrates and providing the assistance required with letters rogatory, amongst other things, and they could not be blamed for any delays on the part of the foreign authorities. The Government stated that the re-arraignment of the applicant had been done purely as a technicality in order to be comply with Criminal Code requirements. However, the evidence had not been disregarded: as shown by the documents submitted to the Court, the parties had agreed to rely on all the evidence already produced (see paragraph 43 above). To conclude, the Government submitted their interpretation of the time-limits laid down in Maltese law, and argued in particular that by using the term \u201cconclude\u201d, Article 401 did not mean that the full process of the inquiry had to be exhausted, but merely that the court had to decide whether there were sufficient grounds for indicting or discharging the accused by issuing a prima facie decree. Following that decree, both the Attorney General \u2012 before proceeding to the indictment \u2012 and the accused, may ask the Court of Magistrates to examine or re-examine relevant witnesses, in relation to which the terms of Articles 405 and 432 were applicable. Furthermore, the terms of Article 402 could be held in abeyance in specific circumstances, for example when the court authorises the issuance of letters rogatory. They considered that in the present case the proceedings had abided by the terms and time-frames laid down by law.",

[GC], no. 12050/04, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2010). The amount of bail must therefore be set by reference to the detainees\u2019 assets, and with due regard to the extent to which the prospect of its loss will be a sufficient deterrent to dispel any wish on their part to abscond (see Neumeister v. Austria, 27 June 1968, \u00a7 14, Series A no. 8). Since the issue at stake is the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 5, the authorities must take as much care in fixing appropriate bail as in deciding whether or not continued detention is indispensable. Furthermore, the amount set for bail must be duly justified in the decision fixing bail and must take into account the accused\u2019s means (see Mangouras v. Spain, cited above, \u00a7 79). The domestic courts\u2019 failure to assess the applicant\u2019s capacity to pay the sum required may lead the Court to find a violation. However, the accused whom the judicial authorities declare themselves prepared to release on bail must in good faith submit sufficient information, that can be verified if necessary, about the amount of bail to be fixed (see Toshev v.

In point of fact, those decisions seem to have been taken on the basis that \u2012 according to the information available \u2012 the applicant owned property worth a substantial amount. Further, the Court observes that it appears likely that by July 2011 (see paragraph 17 above) the applicant\u2019s financial position had become sufficiently clear. On 22 July 2011 the Court of Magistrates nevertheless refused to reduce the amount of bail, despite the fact that the applicant had already been in detention for six months after having been first granted bail. In any event, by 21 September 2011 the applicant\u2019s real financial position had surely become sufficiently clear and thereinafter none of the domestic courts doubted the applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony or the apparent conclusions about the applicant\u2019s financial position. In fact, the applicant\u2019s deposit was subsequently reduced to EUR 7,000 on 14 March 2012 and again to EUR\u00a05,000, on 23 April 2012, a sum he was finally able to pay. However, the Court notes that up until that final reduction which allowed him to be released on bail, the applicant had spent at least seven months more in detention after his financial position had been clarified. It has not been explained why the Court of Magistrates took nearly nine months (from 26\u00a0July 2011 until 14 March 2012, and then until 23 April 2012) to come to a decision on the applicant\u2019s request for a review of bail. It is possible that it chose to wait for the Constitutional Court judgment, but those proceedings did not prevent the Court of Magistrates from carrying out its own examination of the bail conditions (including the amount of the bail bond) in the interim (as occurred during the first set of proceedings). Neither did the decision of 14 March 2012 explain why the amounts thereby established were adequate in the circumstances as apparent to the court at that stage. In consequence the Court finds no justification for the applicant\u2019s seven-month detention following clarification of his financial situation (from, at the latest, September 2011 until April 2012), and after it had been decided more than a year earlier that there were no longer any grounds to continue his detention provided he complied with the bail conditions (compare Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland, no. , \u00a7 66, 15 November 2001 and Bojilov v. Bulgaria, no. , \u00a7 60, 22 December 2004, concerning post-bail detention periods of four months).",

As to the dental fees, they noted that the applicant had himself chosen a private dentist whose fees he then failed to pay, and this could not be attributed to his detention. They further submitted that the idea that the applicant\u2019s online business would have continued running if he had not been in detention was speculative, and that in any event his calculation had not been explained or substantiated by documentation. Although the applicant\u2019s claim concerning his home had been substantiated, the Government noted that this was dependent on his business, which they reiterated had no guarantee of being successful. As to the other expenses, the Government pointed out that they had not been substantiated, with the exception of the payment for the first month\u2019s rent, namely EUR 350. Similarly, the claim for non-pecuniary damage was not backed up by justifiable evidence \u2012 in the Government\u2019s view such an award should not exceed EUR 2,000.",

They do not provide substantiation for any established or regular income, and neither did the applicant submit tax forms showing what income he had in fact made in the period immediately prior to his arrest. This being so, the claims connected to the loss of income from his online shoe business are hypothetical and unsubstantiated and must be rejected, as must his claim concerning the loss of the house, which was dependent on the alleged income. The Court further rejects the applicant\u2019s claim concerning the rented apartment, in so far as the six-month contract submitted to the Court is dated 17 January 2011 and therefore refers to a period prior to the applicant\u2019s detention pursuant to the violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 found by this Court, which occurred just after that period. Furthermore, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the claims for pecuniary damage referring to the applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s travel expenses and phone calls, nor his dental treatment, and it therefore rejects those claims. On the other hand, it awards the applicant EUR 1,200 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

It follows that such sums are not due. As to the second set of constitutional proceedings and the Government\u2019s comment in that respect, the Court notes that such costs \u2012 if still unpaid \u2012 remain due to the Government. As to the lawyers\u2019 fees, the Court notes that from the documentation it has not been specified whether any sums paid were in connection with the criminal proceedings or with the actual bail requests with which this case is concerned.
