She is also reported as saying that, approximately ten days after the incident, she received a telephone call from someone she believed was called Kevin, who invited her to come to the Diyarbak\u0131r branch of the Human Rights Association. The report further states that Mr Sel\u00e7uk showed the applicant a petition signed by Selma Tan on 27 September 1993. The applicant denied having given anybody that document; her name was not Selma Tan and the signature on the document was forged. However, she confirmed that she had made an application to the Commission and that she herself had signed that.",

The Commission was of the opinion that the evidence available did not allow for inferences to be drawn capable of supporting such a finding. This was so even if account was taken of the background against which the applicant submitted that the incident should be seen: her husband\u2019s arrest five months previously on suspicion of harbouring a PKK terrorist; the refusal of his leave; the fact that his name was rumoured to feature on a hit list; and the large number of civil servants being killed in Silvan by unknown assailants at the time.",

In those cases the Commission found that in or about 1993 the legal structures in the south-east of Turkey operated in a manner incompatible with the rule of law. It also found that in the particular circumstances Hasan\u00a0Kaya and Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 fell into a category of people who were at risk from unlawful violence as a result of targeting by State officials or those acting on their behalf or with their connivance or acquiescence. In respect of that risk, the Commission concluded that Hasan Kaya and Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 had not enjoyed the guarantees of protection required by the rule of law. In the applicant\u2019s submission, application of the Commission\u2019s analysis to the present case should lead to the conclusion that the preventive and protective framework in place at the relevant time was unable to protect the life of a prominent local Kurd such as Dr Tanr\u0131kulu.",

This course of action would suggest that according to Mr D\u00fczg\u00fcn at least, the killing of Dr\u00a0Tanr\u0131kulu constituted a terrorist offence (see paragraph 54 above). The Court is struck by the fact that this conclusion was drawn on the basis of, as Mr D\u00fczg\u00fcn put it in his decision, \u201cthe nature of the offence, the way it had been carried out and the existing evidence\u201d (see paragraph 37 above). The Court would observe that the evidence available to the public prosecutor at that time contained few indications of the manner in which the offence had been committed, and certainly did not appear sufficiently ample to allow the conclusion to be drawn that terrorists must have been responsible. In the opinion of the Court, the foregoing provides a graphic illustration of the necessity for a Contracting State to cooperate with the fact-finding task of the Commission pursuant to former Article 28 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention. Had Mr D\u00fczg\u00fcn and Mr Haney, the prosecutor at the National Security Court who was subsequently in charge of the investigation (see paragraph 39 above), appeared before the Commission\u2019s delegates, light might have been shed on a decision which, in view of the available information, can at best be described as having very little basis in concrete evidence.",

Neither is there any evidence of any investigative activity following that decision apart from the taking of the applicant\u2019s statement on 18 November 1994, that is more than one year after the incident occurred and just over a month after the present application was brought to the attention of the Government (see paragraph 6 of the Commission\u2019s report). This is in fact the last investigative action that the Court is aware of. It does not appear that the authorities, on being informed of the applicant\u2019s complaints, were prompted, for instance, to take statements from those members of the security forces who had been standing guard outside the security directorate.

First, the purpose of the meeting was to question the applicant about her complaint to the Commission. Second, the statement drawn up by Mr Sel\u00e7uk did not appear to be an accurate record of what had been said. Third, the power of attorney which the applicant was shown, with a signature which she was asked to confirm was hers, was not the document sent by the Commission to the Government. In spite of that, as counsel pointed out at the hearing, the Government, in their observations following the communication of the application, informed the Commission that the applicant had stated that she had not signed the document authorising her representation in the proceedings before the Commission.",

Mr\u00a0Sel\u00e7uk\u2019s purpose in meeting the applicant had been twofold: firstly, he had wanted to question her on her recollection of her husband\u2019s killing; and, secondly, he had wished to verify the authenticity of the power of attorney (see paragraph 28 above). As Mr Sel\u00e7uk had explained to the Commission\u2019s delegates, this latter step had been necessitated by the fact that in various other cases brought before the Convention institutions statements from applicants and witnesses had proved to be forged. In any event, it was apparent from the text of the statement made by the applicant to Mr Sel\u00e7uk that the latter was satisfied that the applicant did indeed intend to pursue her application to the Commission.",

The power of attorney submitted to the Commission, a copy of which had been transmitted to the Government at the time they were notified of the fact that an application had been lodged, was in the name of Selma Tanr\u0131kulu.

In previous cases the Court has had regard to the vulnerable position of applicant villagers and the reality that in south-east Turkey complaints against the authorities might well give rise to a legitimate fear of reprisals, and it has found that the questioning of applicants about their applications to the Commission amounts to a form of illicit and unacceptable pressure, which hinders the exercise of the right of individual petition in breach of former Article 25 of the Convention (ibid.).",

The Court would emphasise that it is not appropriate for the authorities of a respondent State to enter into direct contact with an applicant on the pretext that \u201cforged documents have been submitted in other cases\u201d. Even if a Government has reason to believe that in a particular case the right of individual petition is being abused, the Court, like the Commission, considers that the appropriate course of action is for that Government to alert the Commission or the Court, depending on which of the two is dealing with the case, and to inform it of its misgivings. To proceed as the Government did in the present case could very well have been interpreted by the applicant as an attempt to intimidate her. Indeed, the applicant described her interview with Mr Sel\u00e7uk as a frightening experience (see paragraph 21 above).",

The Court is unable to ascertain the accuracy of the written statement, but it is nevertheless a fact that the Government subsequently informed the Commission that the applicant had denied signing the power of attorney (see paragraph 279 of the Commission\u2019s report).

In that connection, I refer to my dissenting opinion in the Kaya v. Turkey case (judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I) and the opinion expressed by a large majority of the Commission on the question (see Aytekin v. Turkey, application no.\u00a022880/93, 18 September 1997; Ergi v. Turkey, application no.\u00a023818/94, 20 May 1997; Ya\u015fa v. Turkey, application no.\u00a022495/93, 8\u00a0April 1997).",

That interview was useful and necessary, firstly to ascertain exactly what the applicant alleged and secondly to check the validity of her application to the Commission. As the Government said, \u201cit was vital that the applicant should be asked about the authenticity of her application in view of the fact that forged statements had been submitted to the Commission in various other cases\u201d. The applicant stated that she wished to pursue her application, as is apparent from the official record of the interview. It is true that when a complainant is summoned to appear before the relevant national authority to discuss an application to the Commission he may feel some disquiet. But to interpret that psychological state as pressure likely to prevent the person concerned from pursuing the proceedings before the Strasbourg institutions smacks in my opinion of bad faith or of a political ploy aimed at discrediting the respondent State.",
