It found that the prosecution of a part of the offences of which the applicant was suspected was time-barred. As to the suspicion that the applicant was guilty of a breach of fiduciary duty, the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office found that mismanagement of the funds concerned had not been proved, as the funds disposed of assets of a considerable value. \nThere prevailed a suspicion of fraud in respect of part of the funds, as apartments had been bought for the funds at prices far above their market value. The proceedings should, however, be discontinued pursuant to Article 153 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in this respect. The said apartments constituted only a small part of the assets of the fund, so the damage caused had to be considered minor. Moreover, the commission of the offences dated back a long time.",

Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2004XI). It notes that the applicant was summoned in February 1987 to be questioned on charges of fraud in relation with his business activities for the DETAG corporation and thus in relation to that corporation\u2019s sale of apartments to private investors. In the proceedings at issue here, the applicant was suspected of being involved in further acts of fraud committed by taking up apartments, which had subsequently been rendered by the said private investors to the applicant\u2019s corporation, into the real estate funds of another company, the \nIHV Company. Even though the different charges of fraud against the applicant were thus not entirely disconnected from each other, the Court does not find it established on the material before it that the applicant, when summoned in February 1987, had already been notified of the additional charges in relation to the funds of the IHV Company. Therefore, the investigation proceedings started on 6 December 1990, when the applicant\u2019s home was searched on suspicion of fraud in relation to the IHV Company. They ended when the applicant was notified by letter dated 3 February 2003 of the prosecution\u2019s decision to discontinue the proceedings. \nThe investigation proceedings thus lasted for approximately twelve years and two months.",

The applicant, whose business activities continued to be adversely affected by the continuing proceedings, can be said to have caused some delay in that he failed to keep his commitment made in December 1999 to submit certain documents by the end of that year. However, this delay must be considered minor compared to the delays attributable to the investigation authorities. Since January 1992, the proceedings as a whole, the total duration of which calls for particular grounds justifying it, cannot be considered as having been furthered with the necessary diligence. They were not furthered at all between \nJanuary 1992 and 10 November 1993. Moreover, between that date and \n13 December 1994, between 10 January 1995 and 23 October 1995, between 31 July 1998 and 8 October 1999, between 4 July 2000 and \n5 February 2001 and between 31 October 2001 and 18 December 2002 there were either apparently no investigations at all or long delays in the evaluation of documents seized.",

In any event, the loss of an applicant\u2019s victim status further requires that he is afforded adequate redress for the breach of his Convention right at national level. In this respect, the Court refers to its finding that the discontinuance of criminal proceedings on account of their excessive length may be capable, depending on the duration in question, of adequately redressing a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see paragraph 57 above; as well as Eckle, cited above, p. 39, \u00a7 94; and Sprotte, cited above).",

The Court accepts that in length-of-proceedings cases the protracted examination of a case beyond a \u201creasonable time\u201d may involve an increase in the applicant\u2019s costs (see Bouilly v.  (no. 1), no.\u00a038952/97, \u00a7 33, 7 December 1999, and S\u00fcrmeli, cited above, \u00a7 148). \nIt notes, however, that the applicant, who was represented by counsel in the investigation proceedings, not only failed to substantiate the exact amount of costs and expenses caused only by the protracted length of the investigation proceedings here at issue; other than in application no.\u00a010597/03, it is not clear from the material before the Court that he in fact incurred additional costs as a result of the duration of the present proceedings. The Court therefore cannot make an award for costs and expenses incurred in the domestic proceedings. As the applicant failed to submit a claim for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before this Court, the Court does not make an award under this head either.",
