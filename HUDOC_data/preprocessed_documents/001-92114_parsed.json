The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of an individual within their control is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (see, among other authorities, Orhan v.

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7 88, ECHR 1999III). In particular, there is an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa v. , 2\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7 102-04, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI, and Mahmut Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 22535/93, \u00a7\u00a7 106-07, ECHR 2000-III). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, no. 37715/97, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, 4 May 2001).",

In this connection the Court notes the applicant\u2019s argument which remained uncontested by the Government that whilst the investigation had commenced in April 2003, the investigators had not inspected the scene of the incident until January 2008. It is clear that this investigative measure, if it were to produce any meaningful result, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. It also does not appear that any fair attempts were made to find any other witnesses, and, in particular, to identify and question servicemen who had been on duty at the federal checkpoints on the night of the incident, or to perform other investigative actions, as indicated by the applicant (see paragraph 68 above).",

The applicant\u2019s distress during this period is attested by her numerous efforts to prompt the authorities to act, as well as by her own attempts to search for her son. The Court further refers to its above findings regarding the shortcomings in the investigation. In particular, it considers that the authorities\u2019 refusal to allow her access to the case file and the lack of information about the investigation throughout the proceedings are elements that contributed to her suffering. It follows that the applicant\u2019s uncertainty about her son\u2019s fate was aggravated by the fact that she was denied the opportunity to monitor the progress of the investigation.",

In that context, it has repeatedly stressed that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. To minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104).",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7 371).",
