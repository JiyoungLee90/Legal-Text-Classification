On three occasions he had been placed in a punishment ward, where he had spent thirty-seven days in all. On 28 November 2008 a decision was taken to place the applicant in a solitary confinement cell for ten months. When transferred to the medical colony, the applicant had continued his unruly behaviour, and was reprimanded almost on a daily basis. The Government submitted that a conflict between the administration of the colony and the applicant had come to a head on 4 July 2009, when the applicant had attempted to cut junior inspector S. with a piece of glass, part of which was wrapped in a white cloth for use as a handle. The warder had grabbed the applicant by the hands and handcuffed him behind his back. The applicant had then been taken to a punishment ward, where he broke a glass in the window and cut his forearms with a piece of broken glass. The Government stressed that a prison doctor had examined the applicant twice on 4 July 2009: after the use of physical force and handcuffs on him and after the act of self-mutilation. No injuries, save for two small cuts on the forearms, were reported on the applicant\u2019s body.",

According to them, there had been no eye-witnesses to the applicant\u2019s beating among the inmates, but the detainees had provided a very coherent and similar version of the events of 4\u00a0July 2009. The applicant had told them that on 4 July 2009 approximately twelve warders had burst into his cell and beaten him with rubber truncheons and kicked him repeatedly in the head and other parts of his body. He had fallen to the floor covered in blood and had then been dragged to the punishment cell. There, he had tried to commit suicide by slashing his wrists with a piece of a tile he had taken from a wall. The human rights activists stressed that at their meeting on 8\u00a0September 2009 the applicant\u2019s face had been swollen, he had twitched his head from time to time and he had had an old scratch on the face, an abrasion on his shin and some kind of bump on the chest which he said was a broken rib. The applicant had also stammered, complained of pain in the ribs and kidneys and had desperately pleaded for help. The representatives also noted, however, that the applicant had had no \u201cpronounced\u201d bruises on him.

However, keeping in mind the State\u2019s responsibility to ensure treatment for prisoners in its charge and given the fact that a lack of adequate medical assistance for serious health problems, such as tuberculosis, may amount to a violation of Article 3 (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 et seq., and Vasyukov v. , no. 2974/05, \u00a7 66, 5 April 2011), the Court has to assess the quality of medical services the applicant was provided with after his arrest in 2007 and to determine whether he was deprived of adequate medical assistance as he claims, and if so whether this amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see Sarban cited above, \u00a7 78).",

In particular, the evidence put before the Court shows that the Russian authorities used all existing means (sputum smear bacterioscopy, culture testing and X-rays) for the correct diagnosis of the applicant\u2019s condition, thoroughly considered the possibility of a recurrence of the illness, and took the necessary steps to prevent a new onset of the tuberculosis by, inter alia, prescribing appropriate prophylactic treatment and admitting the applicant to medical institutions for in-depth examinations. This conclusion is not altered by the applicant\u2019s argument that the tuberculosis specialists\u2019 recommendations as to the frequency of Xray testing and prophylactic TB treatment were disregarded by the medical personnel of the facilities where he was detained at the time. In this regard, the Court attributes particular weight to the fact that it is not asked to assess the quality of the medical services rendered in response to an active form of the disease and aiming at curing the illness, or at least maintaining it under control, when any failure on the part of domestic authorities to keep up with a schedule of necessary medical procedures may have a crucial effect on a patient\u2019s health (see, for example, Vasyukov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06876). The Court\u2019s task in the present case is limited to the examination of the level of medical care meant to prevent a patient\u2019s relapse, that is a therapeutic strategy not comprising measures of such an urgent and vital character. While noting that the domestic authorities did occasionally fail to comply with the schedule of X-ray examinations and prophylactic treatment in the applicant\u2019s case, the Court does not find that that failure was such as to endanger his health and well-being (see paragraphs 16 and 33 above). Furthermore, the Court does not exclude that in the absence of any signs of deterioration of the applicant\u2019s health and in the circumstances of his close clinical monitoring by the medical personnel, the authorities\u2019 decision to dispense with another X-ray test or seasonal prophylactic chemotherapy regimen, that is, with generally aggressive/invasive medical procedures, was reasonable (see paragraph 16 above).",

The applicant was subjected to regular and systematic clinical assessment and bacteriological monitoring, which formed part of the comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at preventing a relapse. The detention authorities also effectively implemented the doctors\u2019 recommendations about a special dietary ration necessary to improve the applicant\u2019s health (contrast Gorodnichev v. , no.\u00a052058/99, \u00a7 91, 24 May 2007).",

The Court notes that the intake of medicines by the applicant was supervised and directly observed by the facility medical personnel as required by the DOTS strategy. In addition, in a situation where the authorities met with occasional refusal to cooperate and resistance to the treatment on the applicant\u2019s part, they offered him psychological support and attention, providing clear and complete explanations about medical procedures, the desired outcome of the treatment and the negative side-effects of interrupting the treatment, irregular medication or fasting (contrast Gorodnichev, cited above, \u00a7 91; and see Testa v. Croatia, no. 20877/04, \u00a7 52, 12\u00a0July 2007, and Tarariyeva v. Russia, no. 4353/03, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2006XV (extracts)) (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). It also does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that when unsuccessful in their attempts to persuade the applicant to continue with the prophylactic treatment, the authorities intensified the clinical monitoring of his condition, invited independent medical specialists to examine him and even transferred him to the prison hospital for additional testing. The authorities\u2019 actions ensured the applicant\u2019s adherence to the treatment and compliance with the prescribed regimen.",

The Court also notes that the authorities efficiently addressed any other health grievances that the applicant might have had (see paragraph 35 above). The applicant\u2019s antituberculosis treatment was adjusted accordingly, to take account of his concomitant health problems as well as his personal preferences as to medical procedures to follow and medicines to take. In this respect, the Court would like to stress that patients like the applicant have a responsibility to communicate and cooperate with health authorities, to follow treatment and to contribute to community health. The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant\u2019s refusals to undergo treatment or medical examinations were occasionally linked to his requests for those procedures to be performed in a particular medical establishment (see paragraph 30 above). In this regard, the Court would like to reiterate its constant jurisprudence according to which a State has a sufficient margin of discretion in defining the manner in which it fulfils its obligation to provide detainees with the requisite medical assistance, inter alia, by choosing an appropriate medical facility, taking into account \u201cthe practical demands of imprisonment\u201d, as long as the standard of chosen care is \u201ccompatible with the human dignity\u201d of a detainee (see Aleksanyan, cited above, \u00a7 140, and most recently, Vasyukov, cited above, \u00a7 79).

In this regard, the Court cannot overlook the inconsistencies that abounded in the various accounts of the events which the applicant and Mr Yu. gave in their complaints to human rights activists and domestic authorities and which the applicant laid down in his submissions to the Court. For instance, during the meeting with the representatives of human rights NGOs the applicant affirmed that there had been no eye-witnesses to his beating (see paragraph\u00a071 above). It further appears that Mr Yu., who was also heard by the visitors, did not claim to be an eye-witness to the incident involving the applicant. However, when questioned by the investigator, both the applicant and Mr Yu. amended their version of events, asserting that the warders had been beating Mr Yu. in the corridor at the same time as the applicant and that Mr Yu. had, therefore, witnessed the applicant\u2019s beating (see paragraph 64 above). Nevertheless, in his testimony during the applicant\u2019s trial Mr Yu. partly retracted his statement to the investigator, noting that his having been beaten at the same time as the applicant precluded him from giving a detailed description of the course of the events of 4 July 2009 (see paragraph 72 above). The Court also finds it peculiar that the applicant\u2019s description of the events of 4 July 2009 changed with time, depending on who was the recipient of his complaint. In particular, while complaining to the human rights activists that he had been beaten by up to twelve warders and that he had then tried to take his life by slashing his wrists with a piece of broken tile, in his application to the Court the applicant claimed that two warders had participated in the beating and that he had cut his forearms with a razor blade allegedly thrown at him by the deputy head of the medical colony.",

While noting that the story of the wasp bite may seem odd and reiterating that the applicant\u2019s face was still swollen more than two weeks after the alleged bite (see paragraph 58 above), the Court cannot ignore the applicant\u2019s medical records and findings by the prison doctors reporting that the applicant\u2019s facial oedema was a manifestation of an allergic reaction to the wasp bite. The doctors\u2019 conclusion was based on the fact that the applicant\u2019s medical condition responded to the antiallergenics with which he was treated and that the development of the illness was successfully arrested (see paragraphs\u00a025-27 above).

Although disappointed with the timing of the expert examinations, the impact of which on the quality of the investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment will be discussed below, the Court cannot disregard the experts\u2019 opinion (see paragraphs 62 and 68 above).",

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation.

Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of illtreatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions.

France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7\u00a7 78 and 79, ECHR 1999V). In the present case, inquiries into both the incident of 4 July 2009 and that of 17\u00a0August 2009 were opened by the administration of the medical colony immediately after the events. As to the very fact of the internal investigation by the management of the detention facility, the Court acknowledges the need for internal investigation with a view to possible disciplinary action in cases of abuse by warders. However, it finds it striking that in the present case the initial investigative steps, which usually prove to be crucial for establishing the truth in cases of brutality committed by State officials, were conducted by the same State authority whose employees were allegedly implicated in the events being investigated (see, for similar reasoning, Vladimir Fedorov v.\u00a0, no. 19223/04, \u00a7 69, 30 July 2009, and Maksimov v. , no.\u00a043233/02, \u00a7 87, 18 March 2010). In this connection the Court reiterates its finding, made on a number of occasions, that the investigation should be carried out by competent, qualified and impartial experts who are independent of the suspected perpetrators and the agency they serve (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a052391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR\u00a02007-II, and O\u011fur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, ECHR\u00a01999-III). Furthermore, the Court is struck by the fact that, merely days after the closing of the internal inquiries, the prosecution investigators issued decisions of similar content (see paragraphs 47 and 53 above). Despite relying on the warders\u2019 and inmates\u2019 statements, the investigator did not hear evidence from them in person and merely recounted the witnesses\u2019 statements made during the internal inquiry. The Court, however, is mindful of the important role which investigative interviews play in obtaining accurate and reliable information from suspects, witnesses and victims and, in the end, in discovering the truth of the matter under investigation. Observing the suspects\u2019, witnesses\u2019 and victims\u2019 demeanour during questioning and assessing the probative value of their testimony forms a substantial part of the investigative process (see Premininy v.\u00a0, no. 44973/04, \u00a7 109, 10\u00a0February 2011).",

In reinitiating the investigation, the supervising prosecutor pointed to the investigator\u2019s failure to summon expert evidence to determine the origin of the applicant\u2019s injuries. The Court reiterates in this connection that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and have a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. , nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a055 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X). An expeditious expert medical examination of the applicant was particularly crucial in the circumstances of the present case in the absence of conclusive medical evidence of the physical violence alleged by him. Although the forensic expert examination was finally performed in October 2009, that is three months after the first instance of alleged beating on 4 July 2009 and almost two months after the second instance, the Court cannot but suspect that the initial delay in authorising the expert examination resulted in a loss of precious time and made it impossible to secure evidence of the alleged ill-treatment. The Court notes with concern that the lack of objective evidence \u2013 such as timely expert examination might have provided \u2013 was subsequently relied on as a ground for refusing to institute criminal proceedings against the warders.",

The Court firstly observes that the main purpose of the criminal proceedings against the applicant was to establish whether the latter had committed an act of violence against an officer on duty and not whether he himself had been a victim of brutality. This conclusion is corroborated by the fact that in responding to the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment by the warders, the domestic courts refused to go into the matter, relying heavily on the results of the separate investigation and, in particular, the investigator\u2019s decision of 19\u00a0October 2009. The Court further notes that, according to the domestic courts, the pre-trial investigation into the applicant\u2019s alleged attack on the warder was itself marred by the same defects as those which the Court can identify in the investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment by the warders. The Court fully agrees with the domestic courts\u2019 description of the pre-trial investigation as being of \u201ca poor standard\u201d given its protracted nature, the failure to perform important investigative steps, such examining the crime scene and questioning important witnesses, and the lack of supervision over the investigator\u2019s actions (see paragraph 74 above).",

Although excerpts from the testimonies of the applicant and two other inmates were included in the decision of 19 October 2009 refusing to institute criminal proceedings, the investigator did not consider those testimonies to be credible. However, the investigator unquestioningly accepted the warders\u2019 testimonies as credible, even though they might simply have been defence tactics aimed at damaging the applicant\u2019s credibility. In the Court\u2019s view, the prosecution inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies, as those given by the applicant and his fellow inmates were deemed to be subjective but not those given by the colony officials. The credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation was supposed to establish whether the warders were guilty of disciplinary or criminal offences (see Ognyanova and Choban v. , no.\u00a046317/99, \u00a7\u00a099, 23\u00a0February 2006).",
