Moreover, the person serving the document had to return proof of delivery to the court and domestic law explicitly required that this proof be added to the domestic case file (see paragraphs 15 and 21 above).

There was no formal decision or regulation authorising this alternative form of service (compare Strizhak v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 72269/01, \u00a7\u00a039, 8 November 2005). Moreover, the documents in some of the applicants\u2019 domestic case files clearly indicate that it was registered mail, and not ordinary untraceable mail, that was intended for dispatch of the documents addressed to the applicants (see\u00a0paragraph 13 (ii) above).",

Russia, nos. 2430/06 et al, \u00a7 36, 31 May 2016). However, there is no suggestion, or appropriate records, that any other form of notification than delivery by mail was used or intended in the applicants\u2019 cases.
