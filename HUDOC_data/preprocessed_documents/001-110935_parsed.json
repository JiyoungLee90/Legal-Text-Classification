Croatia [GC], no. 59532/00, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2006-III). However, it is clear from the Court\u2019s case-law concerning Article 2 that the procedural obligation to investigate has evolved into a separate and autonomous duty, capable of binding the State even when the death took place before ratification (see \u0160ilih v.  [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7 159, 9\u00a0April\u00a02009). Given the principle of legal certainty, the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction in this regard is nevertheless not open-ended (ibid, \u00a7\u00a0161).\u00a0Where the death occurred before ratification, only procedural acts or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction (ibid, \u00a7 162).\u00a0Furthermore, there must be a genuine connection between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of that State for the procedural obligation to come into effect. In practice, this means that a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision have been, or should have been, carried out after ratification. The Court has also held that circumstances may emerge which cast doubt on the effectiveness of the original investigation and an obligation may arise for further investigations to be pursued (see Hackett v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34698/04, 10 May 2005).",

Croatia, no. 46598/06, \u00a7 62, 15 January 2009). This investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7 88, ECHR 1999III). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must therefore have taken all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines this ability may risk falling foul of the said standard (see, among other authorities, Bazorkina v. Russia, no. 69481/01, \u00a7 118, 27 July 2006). Also, there is an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102-04, and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-07, ECHR 2000III). Whilst there may be genuine difficulties which prevent progress in a particular investigation, a prompt response by the authorities in situations involving the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Julari\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 20106/06, \u00a7 43, 20 January 2011). Finally, even if a prosecution is brought and suspects stand trial, the Court will examine whether this is a \u201cmeaningful\u201d or serious exercise with any realistic prospects of bringing the perpetrator to account (see, mutatis mutandis, Akkum and Others v. Turkey, no. 21894/93, \u00a7\u00a7 231, 250 and 251, ECHR 2005II (extracts). Violations have also been found where the trial had continued unduly (see Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, \u00a7 151, ECHR 2009, a case where the criminal proceedings at issue had lasted for more than six years and were still pending) or had ended by prescription allowing the accused perpetrators to escape accountability (see, mutatis mutandis, Teren Aksakal v. Turkey, no. 51967/99, \u00a7 88, 11 September 2007).",

On 20 April 2004, following the respondent State\u2019s ratification of the Convention, the Supreme Court quashed the District Court\u2019s judgment, noting that its reasoning had almost exclusively taken into account the evidence in favour of B and had ignored or misrepresented the rest.
