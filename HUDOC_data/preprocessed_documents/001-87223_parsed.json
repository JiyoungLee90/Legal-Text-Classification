He had not asked the applicant to sell him drugs on that occasion. The applicant had not required persuasion and no threats or pressure had been brought to bear on him.

In particular, they contested the suggestion that V had offered to buy drugs from the applicant at a much higher price than their market value which was between 15 to 21 LTL per gram (see paragraph 8 above).
