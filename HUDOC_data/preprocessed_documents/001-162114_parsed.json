Furthermore, a decision given in a case has an effect on any third party which has joined the proceedings. In the present case, the applicant, who had joined preceding proceedings as a third party, continued to intervene in the reopened proceedings as a third party. Their outcome was such as to directly affect and prejudice the property rights the applicant claimed to have acquired and which he allegedly continued to enjoy at the material time. In these circumstances, it would be formalistic not only to deny the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to the applicant\u2019s asserted property rights \u2013 given that his intervention as a third party to defend his alleged property rights formed an integral part of the reopened proceedings seen as a whole \u2013 but also to decline to acknowledge his \u201cvictim\u201d status in this regard. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s intervention as a third party must be taken to attract the application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in its \u201ccivil\u201d limb (see, mutatis mutandis, Perez v.

It further observes that the Constitutional Court, other than making a declaratory finding of a breach of an appellant\u2019s right on account of the length of proceedings (see paragraphs 58-59 above), is unable to offer any means of redress to remedy the situation.

In this respect, the right to have one\u2019s claim examined within a reasonable time would be devoid of all sense if domestic courts examined a case numerous times, by shifting it from one court to another, even if at the end the length of proceedings at each instance did not appear particularly excessive.
