Referring to the Court\u2019s case law in M\u00fcller-Hartburg v. Austria (no. 47195/06, 19 February 2013) it stated that disciplinary proceedings would give rise to a \u201cdispute over civil rights\u201d but not involve the determination of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. However, this provision would not be applicable for proceedings for an interim measure. The aim of the preliminary proceedings was not to impose sanctions upon the person concerned but to avoid serious damage especially in regard to the interests of the public and the reputation of the profession. An order for an interim measure did not deal with the alleged offences in themselves but exclusively with the question of whether in view of the nature and seriousness of the alleged disciplinary offence an interim measure was needed to avoid serious damage to the public interest or the reputation of the legal profession and those who need representation before the courts and other authorities. The Disciplinary Council only examined such a measure if the preconditions set out in section 19(1) of the Disciplinary Act had been fulfilled. At this stage, it was not the task of the Disciplinary Council to examine the evidence of the criminal proceedings.",

Since then, the applicability of Article 6 in injunction proceedings that determine civil rights or obligations depends on whether certain conditions are fulfilled. Firstly, the right at stake in both the main and the injunction proceedings should be \u201ccivil\u201d within the autonomous meaning of the notion under Article 6 of the Convention. Secondly, the nature of the interim measure, its object and purpose as well as its effects on the right in question should be scrutinised. Whenever an interim measure can be considered effectively to determine the civil right or obligation at stake, notwithstanding the length of time it is in force, Article 6 will be applicable. However, the Court accepts that in exceptional cases  where, for example, the effectiveness of the measure sought depends upon a rapid decision-making process \u2013 it may not be possible immediately to comply with all of the requirements of Article 6. Thus, in such specific cases, while the independence and impartiality of the tribunal or the judge concerned is an indispensable and inalienable safeguard in proceedings, other procedural safeguards may apply only to the extent compatible with the nature and purpose of the interim proceedings at issue. It will fall to the Government to establish that, in view of the purpose of the proceedings at issue in a given case, one or more specific procedural safeguards could not be applied without unduly prejudicing the attainment of the objectives sought by the interim measure (see Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7\u00a7 84-86, ECHR 2009).",

In the main proceedings, the disciplinary authorities may take measures ranging from a written reprimand to striking off the register (which means a ban on practising as a lawyer for a minimum of three years). The Court considers that in both the main and the injunction proceedings civil rights within the meaning of Article 6 were at stake. Therefore, the first criterion is met.",

The Court further accepts the Government\u2019s argument that the measure aimed to protect public interests and the reputation of the legal profession and therefore the administration of justice itself. In this respect, regard being had to the key role of lawyers in this field, it is legitimate to expect lawyers to contribute to the proper administration of justice, and thus to maintain public confidence therein. However, for members of the public to have confidence in the administration of justice they must have confidence in the ability of the legal profession to provide effective representation (see Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7\u00a7 132, 133, 23 April 2015; Nikula v. Finland, no.\u00a031611/96, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002 II; and Steur v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a039657/98, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2003 XI). Therefore, the Court acknowledges that situations can arise in which it can be justified to take interim measures to protect public interests and the reputation of a legal profession. For instance, when a practising lawyer is accused in criminal proceedings a need for an interim measure can exist to ensure that this lawyer does not represent clients before courts or authorities or at least before the same courts or authorities which deal with the lawyer\u2019s criminal case itself.",

Croatia, no. 58222/09, \u00a7 87, 26 July 2011, and Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7 73053/01, ECHR 2006 XIV). There may be proceedings in which an oral hearing may not be required: for example where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate a hearing and the courts may fairly and reasonably decide the case on the basis of the parties\u2019 submissions and other written materials (see, amongst many other authorities, D\u00f6ry v. Sweden, no. 28394/95, \u00a7 37, 12 November 2002; Pursiheimo v. Finland (dec.), no. 57795/00, 25 November 2003; and \u015eahin Karako\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 19462/04, \u00a7 36, 29 April 2008). The Court has further accepted that a hearing need not be held in exceptional circumstances, such as in cases where proceedings concerned exclusively legal or highly technical questions (see Jurisic and Collegium Mehrerau v.\u00a0Austria, no. 62539/00, \u00a7 65, 27 July 2006; Schuler-Zgraggen v.\u00a0Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 263; and Mehmet Emin \u015eim\u015fek v. Turkey, no. 5488/05, \u00a7 29-31, 28 February 2012). Moreover, the fact that the proceedings are of considerable personal significance to an applicant is not decisive for the necessity of a hearing. Nevertheless, refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, nos. 18640/10, 18647/10, 18663/10, 18668/10 and 18698/10, \u00a7 121, 4 March 2014). The Court concludes that this case-law under Article 6 \u00a7 1, established in cases dealing with main proceedings, should, in principle, also be applied to proceedings concerning an interim measure.",

Nonetheless, in order to take the decision on the interim measure, the Disciplinary Council had not only to examine the nature and seriousness of the disciplinary charges but also if there had been a risk of serious damage to, in particular, the interests of the public or the standing of the profession which made it necessary to issue an interim measure. Moreover, the Disciplinary Council had to decide which one of the interim measures mentioned in section 19(3) of the Disciplinary Act would constitute a fair balance to the interests involved. In choosing interim measures from the catalogue outlined in section 19(3), and in particular in considering the question of whether representation before which authorities should be restricted, discretion was granted to the Disciplinary Council. Therefore, the Court considers that not only legal or highly technical questions had to be taken into consideration when deciding upon the interim measure.",

There, the applicant gave evidence, but interim measures as well as their necessity had not been an issue. Only on 25\u00a0September 2007, based on the results of the hearing, did the Disciplinary Prosecutor apply for the interim measure. The applicant was invited to submit comments, which the latter did on 4 and 30 October 2007; the Disciplinary Council took the decision on 17 December 2007. From this conduct of the authorities, no urgency can be established. The Government has neither shown reasons why there was no need for interim measures before 25 September 2007 nor that the circumstances changed afterwards making an interim measure so urgent that the Disciplinary Council had to refrain from holding an oral hearing. Consequently, it has not been shown that the effectiveness of the interim measure imposed on the applicant depended on a rapid decision-making process.",

The Court reiterates that it falls first to the national authorities to redress any violation of the Convention. However, a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not, in principle, sufficient to deprive him of his status as a victim, unless the national authorities have acknowledged in a sufficiently clear way and then afforded redress for the breach of the Convention (see Eckle v.\u00a0Germany, 15 July 1982, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 51; Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 179-180, ECHR 2006V; and Mitterbauer v. Austria (dec.), no. 2027/06, 12 February 2009). Whether such redress is appropriate and sufficient to remedy a breach of a Convention right at national level depends on all the circumstances of the case, having regard in particular to the nature of the Convention issue at stake (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2010). Furthermore, as regards the duration of criminal proceedings, a possible form of redress can be the reduction of a sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0186).",
