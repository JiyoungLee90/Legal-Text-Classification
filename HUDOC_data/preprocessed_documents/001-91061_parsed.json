Turkey, no.\u00a037451/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03643, ECHR 2005X). It further notes the absence of sample domestic judgments where compensation has been awarded in similar situations. Accordingly the Court holds that the application is admissible, there being no grounds upon which to decide otherwise. As to the merits the Court finds no reason to depart from the conclusions of the cases cited above. Accordingly, it finds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",
