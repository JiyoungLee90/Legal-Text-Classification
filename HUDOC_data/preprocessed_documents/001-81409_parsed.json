In that case the Court had ordered the restoration of the initial judgment in the applicant's favour and the payment of the pension in the amount established by that judgment. However, in the Government's view, such an approach created confusion. If the sum awarded by a court was a pensioner's \u201cpossession\u201d, it should not be affected by any subsequent increase in pension rates. Therefore, in Pravednaya the applicant would have had to return the money \u201cexcessively\u201d paid to her by virtue of the later changes in the legislation on State pensions. They concluded that in order to avoid such situations the Court should not regard the pension amounts awarded by the domestic courts as the claimants' \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania, judgment of 28 October 1999, Reports 1999VII, \u00a7 61). This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Review by higher courts should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v.\u00a0Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003-IX).",

The Court's task is to determine whether, on the facts of the present case, the quashing of the judgment was exercised in a manner compatible with Article 6. To do so it will examine the reasons adduced by the Kirovskiy District Court for the quashing of the judgment (see paragraph 14 above).",
