The breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) found by the Court relates essentially to a period of time when Mrs. Deumeland was still alive and had entrusted the defence of her case to her son (see paragraph 90 above). The latter, although he was living under the same roof as his mother (see paragraph 35 above), did not at that stage have the status of an \"injured party\" for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50). He did, however, acquire that status on 8 December 1976 on the death of his mother, whose sole heir he is (see paragraph 35 above).",

The relevant \"features of private law\" identified by the majority are, firstly, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right; secondly, the connection with the contract of employment; and, thirdly, the affinities with insurance under the ordinary law. In our view, the weakness in this reasoning is that the majority is taking as determining factors matters which may vary as between different social security systems and even from one category of benefit to another under the same system.

VII, p. 12, para. 6).

Indeed, as noted above (see paragraph 10), no common ground can be identified in the legal systems of the Contracting States as to the \"civil\" or other character of such entitlement. In sum, there is no uniform European approach in this regard such as to run counter to the interpretation we have reached on the basis of the other foregoing considerations. On the contrary, the diversity of approach existing even today tends to show that whether judicial protection of the kind guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) should be afforded to claims, such as Mrs. Deumeland\u2019s, for industrial-accident allowances is a policy decision for the Contracting States to take in the light of the various merits and disadvantages involved, but it is not as such required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) itself.",

An evolutive interpretation allows variable and changing concepts already contained in the Convention to be construed in the light of modern-day conditions (see, for example, the Tyrer judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, pp. 15-16, para. 31; the above-mentioned Marckx judgment, Series A no. 31, pp. 19-20, para. 41; the Dudgeon judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, pp. 23-24, para. 60), but it does not allow entirely new concepts or spheres of application to be introduced into the Convention: that is a legislative function that belongs to the member States of the Council of Europe. The desirability of affording proper safeguards for the adjudication of claims in the ever-increasing field of social security is evident. There are, however, limits to evolutive interpretation and the facts of the present case go beyond those limits as far as Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is concerned.",

In our view, the guarantees of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) attaching to \"contestations\" (disputes) over \"civil rights and obligations\" do not apply to disputes within such areas unless, as stated in the Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 7 above), the outcome of the dispute is directly decisive for private rights.",
