Since law-enforcement officers had had, prior to this judgment, no reason to suppose that the rules relating to legal assistance would be reinforced, and given that it could not be expected that they would immediately become acquainted with the judgment and its practical consequences, the Supreme Court expressed as its expectation that the right of a suspect in custody to the assistance of a lawyer during police questioning would be applied as of 1 March 2016.",

The Court does not discern from the material in the case file that there were any compelling reasons for the restriction of the applicant\u2019s rights. Rather, it would appear that the only reason not to allow the applicant\u2019s lawyer to be present at the interview was the fact that at the relevant time there was no right in the Netherlands providing for legal assistance during police questioning to adult suspects (see paragraphs 17-18 above). The Court has previously held that such a general and mandatory restriction on the right to be assisted by a lawyer during the pre-trial phase of criminal proceedings does not constitute a compelling reason (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 56, and Beuze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 138 and 142).",

The burden of proof falls on the Government, which must demonstrate convincingly why, exceptionally and in the specific circumstances of the case, the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings was not irretrievably prejudiced by the restriction on access to a lawyer (see Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7 265, and Beuze, cited above, \u00a7 165).",

Croatia [GC], no.\u00a025703/11, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2015, and Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0315). Moreover, the Court notes that, under Article 457 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicant may seek to have the proceedings against him reopened (see paragraph 22 above). It would reiterate in this connection that while this may be regarded as an important aspect of the execution of its judgments, the reopening of proceedings is not the only way to execute a judgment of the Court. The use of this possibility in the present case will be a matter for assessment, if appropriate, by the Supreme Court, having regard to domestic law and to the particular circumstances of the case (see Beuze, cited above, \u00a7 200). It is for the national authorities and not the Court to settle this question.",
