The Court finds that the present case is similar to those cases. In particular, it notes that the applicant cannot be criticised for having made an unreasonable or exorbitant claim because there does not appear to have been developed or accessible case-law on awards of non-pecuniary damages in similar cases (ibid., \u00a7 61). On the other hand, the inflexible system of court fees left no room for judicial discretion in their determination. As a result, almost one third of the compensation the State was ordered to pay to the applicant was taken back by the treasury. This situation, which was likely to dissuade victims from bringing proceedings against the State or from requesting enforcement of judgments in their favour, could hardly be seen as a reasonable restriction of the applicant\u2019s right to access to court. The fact that unlike Stankov, the applicant in this case did not lose the entire compensation, was due to a chance and therefore cannot lead the Court to a different conclusion. The Court notes that since Stankov, the court fees system in question has been abandoned in  and replaced, in cases concerning claims for damages against State or municipal bodies, by a simple fee not dependent on the value of the claim (see paragraph 16 above).",
