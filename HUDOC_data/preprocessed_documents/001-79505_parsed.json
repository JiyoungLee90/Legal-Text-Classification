The Government submitted that although the case was adjourned seven times in order to obtain witness statements from abroad and expert opinions from the National Authority for Medicolegal Affairs, the adjournments were ordered by the court only when there was a special reason for doing so. In the applicant\u2019s view, the hearings had not been handled properly nor within a reasonable time; he had asked the District Court to expedite the proceedings and on 19 April 1996 he was ready to have a decision taken on the case. The Court finds that the time elapsed before the court of first instance appears to have been exceptionally lengthy. However, the Court notes that on 19 November 1992 that court decided, upon the applicant\u2019s request, to hear four witnesses in the  by way of international legal assistance. The witnesses\u2019 statements were obtained on 30 November 1993. Furthermore, on 25 February 1994 it decided to re-hear the witnesses in the . The witnesses\u2019 statements were received on 26 January 1996. During those periods the proceedings were stayed, which prolonged them by one year and almost two years, respectively. The Court finds that these delays of some three years were not solely the Finnish authorities\u2019 responsibility.",

It is to be noted that it took some fourteen months before the appellate court requested an expert opinion from the National Authority for Medicolegal Affairs. It further took some nineteen months for the National Authority for Medicolegal Affairs to issue its opinion. The Government argued that the case was not urgent within the meaning of the Court of Appeal\u2019s rules of procedure. They also explained the delay by the fact that the first expert doctor could not issue the requested opinion within the set time-limit and observed that the court\u2019s officials asked the National Authority for Medicolegal Affairs six times to issue its opinion. The applicant, for his part, reiterated that he also asked the appellate court several times to speed up the proceedings and that he did not consider that it was necessary for the National Authority for Medicolegal Affairs to consult so many doctors in his case.",
