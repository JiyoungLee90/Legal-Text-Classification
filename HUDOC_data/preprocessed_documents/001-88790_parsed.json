It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. The Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Edificaciones March Gallego S.A. v. Spain, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p.\u00a0290, \u00a7 33). This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature such as time-limits governing the filing of documents or lodging of appeals (see, among other authorities, P\u00e9rez de Rada Cavanilles v. Spain, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, \u00a7 43).",

The Court has held on numerous occasions that such a requirement pursued a legitimate aim of proper administration of justice and of compliance, in particular, with the principle of legal certainty (see, for example, P\u00e9rez de Rada Cavanilles, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Miragall Escolano and Others v. Spain, no.\u00a038366/97, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2000-I). The Court considers that there is no reason to find otherwise in the present case. However, the manner in which the time-limits were applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances of the case is a relevant factor in determining whether or not he enjoyed an effective access to a court.",

The Court observes that on 9 October 2001 the applicant lodged a formal request for the reinstatement of time-limits in accordance with Article 105 of the Code of Civil Procedure in force at the material time (see \u201cRelevant Domestic Law and Practice\u201d). In that request he expressly acknowledged that he had missed the statutory time-limit for lodging his action. He signed the request and submitted it together with his statement of claim. Under Article 105 the domestic courts had to examine such a request at the hearing, as they did in the present case. It follows that the applicant raised the issue of time-limits on his own initiative and that the domestic courts acted in accordance with law.",

The Court observes that the domestic courts had carefully examined the reasons referred to by the applicant at two levels of jurisdiction and found that they had not been such as to justify his failure to lodge his action in due time. In doing so they relied on the relevant provisions of the domestic law and practice. Having regard to the judgment of 16 October 2001 and the appeal decision of 26\u00a0February 2002, the Court considers that those decisions do not appear arbitrary or unreasonable. The Court notes that the domestic courts took into account the fact that no courts were functioning in  until December 2000 and calculated the three-month time-limits from that date. Furthermore, the fact that in the case of M. (see \u00a7 16 in the Facts) the Town Court allowed the request for the reinstatement of time-limits is not relevant to the present case, as there is no evidence that the applicant was in a similar situation to M. Finally, the applicant argued that he could not be obliged to lodge his action in a court situated in a different district. It is true that between December 2000 and July 2001 the only possibility for the applicant to lodge his claim was to apply to the  situated in Gudermes. The Court considers that Russian authorities could have experienced some difficulties in putting a judicial system in place in the  at the time of events. However, there had been a court to which the applicant could have applied. The Court considers that the fact that the applicant had to apply to a court situated in a different district did not put an excessive burden on him and did not affect his right of access to a court.",
