In the Government\u2019s view this remedy had proven its effectiveness in practice.

The Court held in these cases that the payment without undue delay of such compensation together with the acknowledgement of the violations by the authorities had deprived the applicants of their victim status (Derkach and Nemakhina, cited above). However, these decisions do not establish a general principle that mere compensation for inflation losses is sufficient to afford redress required by the Convention for late enforcement of a judgment. In all aforementioned cases the Court reached its conclusions in the specific circumstances where the applicants\u2019 claims for compensation were limited to pecuniary losses resulting from the inflation or the applicants\u2019 position in the domestic proceedings was considered as an implicit waiver to claim compensation for further pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage. In the absence of such circumstances in the present case, the Court considers that mere upgrading of the judgment debt would not suffice to satisfy the Convention requirement of effectiveness as it would only compensate for possible inflation losses and not for further damages, either pecuniary or non-pecuniary. Finally, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the main reason for non-enforcement in the present case was the lack of funds. In these circumstances, an action for upgrading of the judgment debt would only have produced repetitive results, namely a writ of execution which would not be enforceable because of insufficient funding (see Pogulyayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 34150/04, \u00a7 13, 3 April 2008). Such remedy cannot be said to be effective.",

Neither party suggested that it was any inefficiency of the bailiff service which prevented the enforcement of the judgment at issue; it was apparently the lack of funds. The Court therefore finds that an action against the bailiff office would not have enhanced the applicant\u2019s prospects of receiving her award. The Court considers that in the present case such complaint cannot be said to have constituted an effective remedy against non-enforcement (see Plotnikovy v. Russia, no. 43883/02, \u00a7 17, 24 February 2005, Kazmina v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a072374/01, \u00a7\u00a023, 15 June 2006).",

However, the award remained without execution for a significant period of time.
