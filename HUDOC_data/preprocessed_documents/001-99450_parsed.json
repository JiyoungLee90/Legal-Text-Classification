Ukraine, she argued that \u201cthe mere fact of being detained as a criminal suspect in [Turkmenistan] provides sufficient grounds for fear that [the applicant] will be at serious risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see Soldatenko v. Ukraine, no. 2440/07, \u00a7 72, 23 October 2008). The first applicant argued that as a non-Turkmen she would be particularly vulnerable in the face of violations of human rights.

The first applicant finally considered that by sending a letter directly to the Turkmen authorities with a reference to her allegations of ill-treatment and lack of guarantees of a fair trial, the Moscow City Court had put her at an even greater risk of persecution, since she could now be perceived as a dissident and someone who had slandered the image of Turkmenistan abroad.",

In this connection, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d. It is therefore immaterial, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law (see \u010conka v. , no. 51564/99, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2002-I, and Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 112, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V).",

Since under Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 41, Reports 1996-III).",

On 24 August 2007 the Dorogomilovskiy District Court of Moscow authorised her detention pending extradition procedure. However, the Court notes, first, that no time-limit was fixed by that decision and, second, that upon the expiry of the maximum initial detention period of two months, no extension was granted by the court. According to the provisions governing the general terms of detention (Article 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), the time-limit for detention pending investigation is fixed at two months. A judge may extend that period up to six months. Further extensions may only be granted by a judge if the person is charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences. Thus, assuming that the decision of the Dorogomilovskiy District Court had served as a lawful basis for the first applicant's initial detention, it ceased to be lawful after the lapse of the two-month period, that is on 19 October 2007.",
