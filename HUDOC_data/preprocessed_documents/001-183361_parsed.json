A formal extradition request in respect of such persons was submitted by the Kazakhstan embassy in Ankara to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 31 December 2011. According to the document prepared by the embassy, the applicant and four other persons were members of the \u201cIslamic Jihad Union\u201d, a terrorist organisation which carried out terrorist attacks in the western region of Kazakhstan. They had been detained by the Turkish authorities upon receipt of a Red Notice via Interpol by Kazakhstan. The embassy pointed out that subsequent to their asylum claims, four of those persons, including the applicant, had been released from detention in Turkey. The Kazakhstan authorities considered that these five persons had been in the process of preparing a new terrorist attack in their country and that following their release four of them had organised a terrorist attack in the Atyrau province of Kazakhstan, in co-operation with another terrorist organisation, Jund al-Khilafa (\u201cSoldiers of the Caliphate\u201d). The embassy accordingly requested the Turkish authorities not to grant asylum to them and to extradite them to Kazakhstan.",

However, expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see Saadi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7 124-125, ECHR 2008; F.G. v.\u00a0Sweden [GC], no.\u00a043611/11, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2016; and J.K. and Others v.

He provided the domestic authorities with information about his personal situation and the reasons for his fear of ill-treatment and death. Besides, the document containing the Kazakhstan authorities\u2019 extradition request demonstrated that the applicant was of interest to the Kazakhstan authorities as a suspected terrorist, although he never admitted to any affiliation with any terrorist organisation. The Court further observes that as can be seen from the information and material publicly available to the administrative authorities at the relevant time, various parties had independently made allegations of ill-treatment by the law-enforcement officials in Kazakhstan; the instances of ill-treatment had not occurred in \u201cisolated or infrequent instances\u201d; and law-enforcement officials \u201ctargeted members of Islamic groups in their efforts to combat terrorism\u201d in that country (see paragraphs 31-39 above).\u00a0\u00a0Hence, the Court finds that the domestic authorities were aware or ought to have been aware of facts indicating that the applicant could be exposed to a risk of ill-treatment upon his returning to Kazakhstan. Therefore, they were under an obligation to address the applicant\u2019s arguments and to carefully assess the risk of ill-treatment if the applicant were to be removed to Kazakhstan, in order to dispel any doubts about possible illtreatment (see F.G., cited above, \u00a7\u00a0127, and Babajanov, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

In this regard, the Court emphasises that, in view of the importance attached to Article 3 of the Convention, the absolute character of the right guaranteed by Article 3 and the irreversible nature of the potential harm if the risk of ill-treatment materialised, it is for the national authorities to be as rigorous as possible and to carry out a careful examination of allegations under Article 3, in the absence of which the domestic remedies cannot be considered to be effective (see Babajanov, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

The Court notes that it paid special attention in the aforementioned cases to the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d), members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, and the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants regarding the problem of overcrowding and the lack of outdoor exercise at the centre following visits there in June 2009, May 2012 and June 2012, respectively (see Yarashonen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a025, 28 and 30).

The Court is therefore led to conclude that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention at the Kumkap\u0131 Foreigners\u2019 Removal Centre \u2013 coupled with the possible anxiety caused by uncertainty as to when the detention would end \u2013 are sufficient to conclude that the conditions of his detention caused the applicant distress that exceeded the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and attained the threshold of degrading treatment proscribed by Article\u00a03 (ibid., \u00a7 80).",
