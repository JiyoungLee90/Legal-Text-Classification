However, a right of use of accommodation originated from the moment of state registration of that right, in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, and not from the moment of obtaining registration at a flat. In addition, the only body competent to terminate that right was a court. This was in fact mentioned by the Court of Cassation in its decision of 23 July 2004, in which it informed the applicant about a possibility to restore her property right by instituting separate court proceedings. Hence, the applicant did not avail herself of the only effective remedy under the domestic law to terminate the children\u2019s alleged right of use of accommodation in respect of her flat. Moreover, it was still open for the applicant to apply to a court and to restore her rights through the court proceedings as suggested by the Court of Cassation.",

As to the right of use of accommodation, such right originated only from the moment of its state registration in a manner prescribed by law.

Furthermore, the children\u2019s continued registration at the applicant\u2019s flat did not amount de jure to a control of use of property since Armenian legislation did not impose any restrictions in this respect on the applicant\u2019s ownership rights. It must be noted that the applicant had failed to submit any proof in support of her allegation that she had been unable to rent out her flat. On the other hand, the children\u2019s continued registration at the applicant\u2019s flat against her will can be considered as causing considerable annoyance to the applicant as the owner of the flat and therefore, by itself, requiring protection under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1. Moreover, the children\u2019s continued registration can be considered as de facto depriving the applicant of a realistic opportunity to sell her flat to another person. In such circumstances, the Court finds that the alleged interference with the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions must be considered as falling under the first sentence of the first paragraph of this Article, namely the peaceful enjoyment of possessions.",

However, the existence of a legal basis is not in itself sufficient to satisfy the principle of lawfulness, which also presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application. That principle also requires the Court to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied by the domestic courts produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention (see, for example, Apostolidi and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a045628/99, \u00a7 70, 27 March 2007).",

The Court observes that Armenian legislation did not \u2013 and does not \u2013 link one\u2019s registration at a domicile with the establishment of a right of use of accommodation in respect of that domicile by such person. This was in fact maintained by the Government in their observations. In particular, in accordance with Article 225 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, a right of use of accommodation could originate only through conclusion of a written agreement with the owner (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above). There was no such agreement between the applicant and the children in the present case. Moreover, before the entry into force of the Civil Code in 1999, the right of use of accommodation was conferred by virtue of being accommodated at a given flat, as provided for by Article 55 of the Housing Code. However, as it was established in the present case, the children had never resided in the applicant\u2019s flat. Hence, it cannot be assumed that the children enjoyed the right of use of accommodation by virtue of the Housing Code either.",
