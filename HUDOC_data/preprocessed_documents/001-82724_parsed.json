However, the Court would reiterate that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of detention on remand (see, for instance, Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).

Poland, no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4\u00a0October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see, Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high. The Court notes that certain delays during the trial were caused by the defendants' obstructiveness (see paragraphs 14, 19 and\u00a022 above).",

Even before the trial had commenced, the case file numbered 114 volumes, and the number reached 204 volumes by April 2006.",

The defendants' obstructiveness was referred to expressly on a few occasions by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 14, 19 and 22 above). While the applicant's conduct must have generated delays at the trial and cast doubt on his intention to have the proceedings concluded speedily, the Court cannot subscribe to the view that this factor could justify the entire length of the proceedings.",

The Court notes that otherwise hearings were held regularly and when they were adjourned it was normally for reasons not attributable to the court.
