In this connection the Court recalls that the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as an extended delay in enforcement (see Reynbakh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035, with further references). The Court accepts the applicant company\u2019s claim in respect of interest accrued on the judgment debt. It notes however that the applicant company\u2019s calculations contained an arithmetical mistake in that they employed 28 February 2000 instead of 28 February 2001 as the starting date. Having regard to the materials in its possession, it awards the applicant company RUB 8,798,560, which was equivalent to 253,560 euros (EUR) at the date on which the applicant company lodged its claims, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.
