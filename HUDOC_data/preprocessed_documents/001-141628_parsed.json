Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention.

The Court has previously examined the situation of the applicants who had been transferred from the remand prison to the correctional colony to serve their sentence and who had later returned to the same prison in connection with proceedings in a different criminal case. Their departure to the colony being definitive at the material time and their subsequent return to the same prison being a mere happenstance, the Court reached the conclusion that their transfer marked the end of the situation complained about and that the six-month period should run from the day they left the prison (see Mitrokhin, cited above, \u00a7 36, and Yartsev v. Russia (dec.), no. , \u00a7 30, 26 March 2013). By contrast, the applicant\u2019s transfer to a medical facility was obviously of a temporary nature. Upon completion of the treatment, he was to return to the prison in which he was remanded in custody. The Court accordingly finds that the short period of his absence from the prison had no incidence on the continuous nature of his detention (see Sorokin v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 27).",
