In this respect it reiterates that the six-month rule, in reflecting the wish of the Contracting Parties to prevent past decisions being called into question after an indefinite lapse of time, serves the interests not only of the respondent Government but also of legal certainty as a value in itself. It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible. It is therefore not open to the Court to set aside the application of the six-month rule solely because a Government have not made a preliminary objection based on it (see Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a034979/97, ECHR 2000I).",

The payment was made at her request, so that the latest date by which she would have been aware that her pension was to be terminated under section 92 of the Pensions Act would have been the date of that payment. The Court reiterates its findings in the Sheidl case (cited above), that the Ukrainian legal system does not provide an individual with a judicial remedy against statutory provisions that allegedly violate the Convention. The Court considers that, in these circumstances, the six-month time-limit ran from December 1997, when the applicant learned of the termination of her pension rights. Given that this application was lodged more than three years later, on 9 March 2003, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 14 of the Convention, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 were introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention (see Dudnik and Others v.

The amounts referred to in Law no. 537/96 represent the indexed value of the deposits. The Court notes that their availability depends on the amounts which the State allocates to the Treasury subject to certain conditions. The proceedings issued by the applicant in the domestic courts did not, therefore, concern \u201cexisting possessions\u201d that belonged to the applicant. In that connection, the Court reiterates that the right to the indexation of savings as such is not guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01, (see the Rudzi\u0144ska decisions cited above, and Trajkovski v. Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 53320/99, ECHR 2002-...), which provision is therefore inapplicable in the instant case.
