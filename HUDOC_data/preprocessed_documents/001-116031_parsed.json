In that connection the Court reiterates that Article 10 encompasses the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas in any language that allows persons to participate in the public exchange of all varieties of cultural, political and social information and ideas (see E\u011fitim ve Bilim Emek\u00e7ileri sendikas\u0131 v.\u00a0, no. 20641/05, \u00a7 71, 25 September 2012); in such contexts, language as a medium of expression undoubtedly deserves protection under Article 10.",

In that connection the Court observes that section 58 of Law no. 298 at the material time contained a blanket prohibition on the use of any language other than Turkish (the official language) in election campaigning. Breaches of this provision entailed criminal sanctions ranging from six months to one year and payment of a fine under section 151 of the same Law.",

However, a regulatory framework consisting of a total prohibition on the use of unofficial languages coupled with criminal sanctions cannot be held to be compatible with the essential values of a democratic society, which include freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. In that connection the Court stresses that the language used by the applicants in the instant case, namely Kurdish, constituted their own mother tongue as well as the mother tongue of the population which they were addressing. Some of the applicants, in their submissions to the domestic courts, referred to the fact that many people in the crowd, notably the elderly and women, did not understand Turkish, the official language of the State. These facts are not disputed by the Government. Having regard to the specific context of elections and to the fact that free elections are inconceivable without the free circulation of political opinions and information (see, for example, Communist Party of Russia and Others v. , no. 29400/05, \u00a7 79, 19\u00a0June 2012), the Court considers that the right to impart one\u2019s political views and ideas and the right of others to receive them would be meaningless if the possibility of using a language that could properly convey those views and ideas were diminished owing to the threat of criminal sanctions. In that connection the Court notes that, according to the material available to it, Turkey stood apart from all of the twenty-two Contracting States surveyed (see paragraph 36 above) in making the use of minority languages by candidates speaking during public election meetings subject to criminal penalties at the relevant time. It welcomes in that regard the fact that the impugned legislation has now been amended (see paragraph 28 above).",

If a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case, the Court has to consider the issue under Article 14 as well.
