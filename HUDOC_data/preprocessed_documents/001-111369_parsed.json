Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28; Jamil, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 142).

(cited above), whose preventive detention was, moreover, executed in that same prison. The applicant was detained in Schwalmstadt Prison in a separate building for persons in preventive detention. Minor alterations to the detention regime compared with that of an ordinary prisoner serving his sentence (see paragraphs 24-25 above), cannot, in the Court\u2019s view, mask the fact that there has been no substantial difference between the execution of the prison sentence and that of the preventive detention order against the applicant. The Court refers in this connection also to the findings of the  in its leading judgment of 4 May 2011 on preventive detention. In that judgment, the  equally found that the provisions of the German Criminal Code on preventive detention at issue did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment (see paragraph\u00a046 above).",

Germany (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 128-129). There is nothing to indicate that the applicant had been offered a higher level of care, including an individualised and intensified offer of therapy, than that generally offered to persons in preventive detention at that time. That offer had equally been considered as insufficient by the  in order to distinguish that measure from a prison sentence (see paragraph 48 above).",

The Court notes at the outset, however, that the sentencing Frankfurt am Main Regional Court, in its final judgment of 1992, had expressly declined to order the applicant\u2019s preventive detention (under Article 66 of the Criminal Code) in addition to his placement in a psychiatric hospital (see paragraph 7 above).
