For instance, in the case of Yeti\u015fen and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a021099/06, 10 July 2012, the applicants waited for four years after the disappearance before lodging an official complaint with the competent investigating authorities and for eleven and a half years before bringing their application to Strasbourg; in the case of Findik and Omer v. Turkey (decs.), nos. 33898/11 and 35798/11, 9 October 2012, the applicants brought their applications to Strasbourg more than fifteen years after the events and in the case of Ta\u015f\u00e7i and Duman v. Turkey (dec.), no. 40787/10, 9\u00a0October 2012, the applicants applied to Strasbourg twenty-three years after the disapperance. In these cases, like in the case of A\u00e7\u0131\u015f v.

The prima facie threshold has been reached primarily on the basis of witness statements, including the applicants\u2019 submissions to the Court and to the domestic authorities, and other evidence attesting to the presence of military or security personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time. The Court has relied on references to military vehicles and equipment; the unhindered passage of the abductors through military roadblocks, in particular during curfew hours; conduct typical of security operations, such as the cordoning off of areas, checking of identity documents, searches of premises, questioning of residents and communication within a chain of command; and other relevant information about special operations, such as media and NGO reports. Given the presence of those elements, it has concluded that the areas in question had been within the exclusive control of the State authorities in view of military or security operations being conducted there and the presence of servicemen (see, for example, Ibragimov and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a082, 29\u00a0May 2008; Abdulkadyrova and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a0120, 8\u00a0January 2009; and Kosumova and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a067, 7\u00a0June 2011). If the Government failed to rebut that presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. However, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Shaipova and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a010796/04, \u00a7 87, 6 November 2008; Tovsultanova v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17\u00a0June 2010; and Movsayevy v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011).",

The Court notes that the only witness capable of shedding light on the circumstance of the incident, Ms R.M., had not eye-witnessed the events, but had allegedly heard some noise coming from Mr Andarbek Bugayev\u2019s house and that she did not provide this information to the domestic authorities (see paragraphs 9 and 30 above).

In the case at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigation has been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants\u2019 missing brother. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings have been plagued by a combination of defects similar to those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012325). The criminal case at hand was the subject of several decisions to suspend the investigation, followed by periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of solving the crime. No meaningful steps have been taken to question local servicemen or law enforcement officers who could have had information on special operations conducted in the area on the night of the alleged abduction (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 27 above) and no registration logs of the passage through checkpoints have been examined (see paragraph 7 above).",
