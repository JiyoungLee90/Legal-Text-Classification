It took the trial court nearly four years to decide the applicant's case following the appeal court's decision of 14 December 1998. During this period, the Court notes several periods of complete inactivity, also relied upon by the applicant: it took over a year for the trial court to fix a hearing after it had received the case-file from the Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 14-16 above); nearly eight months lapsed between the hearings scheduled in October 1999 and June 2000 (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above); and the court communicated the expert report to the parties nearly nine months after it had received it (see paragraph 25). In addition, the Court notes that nearly nine months elapsed between the hearings of February and November 2002 (see paragraphs 29-32 above), a period during which the only procedural activity undertaken by the court was to make a query about the company's solvency.",
