Finland, no.\u00a040847/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 15 June 2004). Although \u201cArticle 6 does not go as far as requiring that the defence be given the same rights as the prosecution in taking evidence\u201d (see Mirilashvili v.\u00a0Russia, no. 6293/04, \u00a7\u00a0225, 11 December 2008), the accused should be entitled to seek and produce evidence \u201cunder the same conditions\u201d as the prosecution (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos.\u00a011082/06 and\u00a013772/05, \u00a7\u00a0728, 25\u00a0July 2013). Clearly, those \u201cconditions\u201d cannot be exactly the same in all respects; thus, for example, the defence cannot have the same search and seizure powers as the prosecution. However, as follows from the text of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d), the defence must have an opportunity to conduct an active defence \u2013 for example, by calling witnesses on its behalf or adducing other evidence (ibid.).",

It observes that the applicant sought to challenge the forensic reports presented by the prosecution. They constituted an integral part of the evidence on which the applicant\u2019s conviction was based. Admittedly, it was open to the defence to ask the court to commission a fresh expert examination on the pertinent issues. However, as established in Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, to obtain such a fresh examination it was incumbent on the defence to convince the court that the reports presented by the prosecution were incomplete or deficient (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0730). The Court notes that the presiding judge refused to call the relevant forensic experts for questioning. As a result, the applicant was unable to confront them in order to cast doubt as to their credibility.",
