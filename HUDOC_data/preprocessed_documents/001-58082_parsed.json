On this construction, stress must be laid on the imminence of such contact and the probability of such detrimental effects. The expression `serious danger\u2019 therefore indicates an unacceptably increased risk rather than an acute threat ... [Part II of the Guidelines] mentions three aspects which fall to be considered, namely the nature and concentration of the pollutants, the local pollution situation and the use made of the soil. The nature and concentration of the pollutants give an impression of the extent of the pollution and its possible effects. The local pollution situation gives an idea of the extent to which spreading or contact may occur. The use of the soil determines the likelihood of exposure to the pollutants and the resulting risks. A consideration of these three aspects taken together [integrale afweging] must lead to an answer to the question whether cleaning is at all necessary or required as a matter of urgency ...\" (paragraph 1.6 of Part I of the Soil Cleaning Guidelines)",

There are detailed, substantive provisions for rating that quality.

In particular, the text does not refer to the report of the experts who have conducted \"the further inspection\". Thus, the district courts in question were free to establish that \"the further inspection\" had indicated the required degree of pollution by deeming the opinion of the competent authorities to be decisive in this respect.",

Consequently, for the purposes of applying point 4 of Schedule IV the fact that the competent authorities have authorised the next stage may very well be taken as establishing that \"the further inspection under the Soil Cleaning (Temporary Provisions) Act has [indeed] indicated pollution of the soil under or in the immediate vicinity of the accommodation such as to cause serious danger to public health or the environment\".",

It avoids, moreover, difficult technical debates which would become unavoidable if the rent boards and the district courts had to decide themselves whether or not the report of the experts who conducted \"the further inspection\" sufficiently indicated the required degree of soil pollution: such debates are not consonant with the character of the proceedings in question as set out in paragraph 5 above.",

Under that interpretation the landlords cannot contest that decision in the rent proceedings. It is, however, far from certain that landlords have the possibility of bringing administrative proceedings against the competent authorities under the SCTP in order to challenge their decision. It might, therefore, be argued that the relevant rule of substantive national law lays a disproportionate burden on landlords and, consequently, is incompatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).
