It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see B\u00f6hmer v. , no.\u00a037568/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 56, 3 October 2002, and Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v. , no.\u00a065559/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 and 89, 27\u00a0February 2007).",

The next court session was held on 9 July 2003. The Court doubts that the district court judge could have clearly recalled the applicant's oral submissions made more than two years before the hearing of 9 July 2003. In such circumstances the Court considers that, although the applicant appeared before the district court on 13 June 2001, the lapse between the two court sessions negated any impact that the applicant's presence in the courtroom on that date may have had on the proceedings.",
