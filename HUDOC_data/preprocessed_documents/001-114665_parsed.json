The Court reiterates that under Rule 60 of the Rules of Court any claim for just satisfaction must be itemised and submitted in writing, together with the relevant supporting documents and within the time-limit fixed for the submission of the applicant\u2019s observations on the merits, \u201cfailing which the Chamber may reject the claim in whole or in part\u201d.
