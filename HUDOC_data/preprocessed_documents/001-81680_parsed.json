However, the use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him or her either when the statements were made or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Sa\u00efdi v.

A conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on statements which the defence has not been able to challenge (see, mutatis mutandis, Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II, p. 472, \u00a7 76). Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see, among other authorities, Bricmont v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, \u00a7 89).",

In the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the alleged victim. Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see Baegen v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1995, Series A no. 327-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 44, \u00a7 77).

Not a single interview between the psychologist and the girl had been recorded on audio or video tape. It is surprising that the prosecution never made arrangements to have a fresh interview recorded so as to allow the court to observe the manner in which D reacted to the questions put to her or interacted generally with the psychologist during the interview. The psychologist repeated before the court what D had said to her under observation (see paragraph 16 above). The psychologist's statement was highly incriminating. As to the fact that the applicant father had admitted the alleged abuse, the Court observes that the admission, which was unspecific in nature, had been made four years before the criminal investigation had been opened into the case and in connection with public care proceedings. It was later retracted and during the pre-trial investigation and the criminal proceedings he had explained the circumstances in which it had been made (see paragraph 9 above). The witnesses heard by the courts had made no observations on the alleged acts (see paragraph 16 above). In contrast to the case of S.N. v. Sweden (no.\u00a034209/96, ECHR\u00a02002V) in the present case neither the applicant father nor his counsel had at any stage been afforded an opportunity to have questions put to the child. An examination of the case file does not disclose any particular circumstances which would have prevented this. It is to be observed in this connection that at the time of the pre-trial investigation D had been 11 years old and at the time of the District Court hearing 14 years old.",
