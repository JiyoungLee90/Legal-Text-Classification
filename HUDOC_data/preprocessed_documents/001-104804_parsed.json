This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful police ill-treatment to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough in the prosecution and punishment of those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity and the general legal prohibitions of killing and torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite their fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Nikolova and Velichkova v.

What is more, in this particular case the nature of the injuries sustained by the applicants did not play a decisive role. It is not clear from the facts of the case, as recognised by the Chamber, how these injuries were caused (see paragraph 39 of the judgment). Furthermore, the medical reports lacked details such as the extent of the injuries. According to the facts of the case (see paragraph 7 of the judgment), the police were obliged to use force against aggressive demonstrators who were clearly resisting the police, in order to ensure traffic safety and disperse the demonstrators. In the present case there are differing versions of the facts submitted by the applicants and the police. According to the police, the applicants\u2019 injuries were caused when they resisted the police officers\u2019 attempts to arrest them (see paragraph 38). According to the first and fourth applicants, the force used by the police was disproportionate and the injuries caused were serious enough to amount to ill-treatment under Article 3. The differing versions of the facts in the circumstances of this case, which were not proved, are a decisive factor in prompting us not to find a substantive violation of Article 3. The Court cannot speculate on the facts of the case and find a substantive violation of the Convention relying on disputable elements or unverified circumstances.",
