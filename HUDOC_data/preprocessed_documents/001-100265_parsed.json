It is inherent in proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where an individual applicant accuses State agents of violating his rights under the Convention, that in certain instances solely the respondent Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the wellfoundedness of the applicants' allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066 and 70, ECHR 2000-VI).

What is apparently clear is that on 30 August 1996 there was a violent confrontation between Mr Bekirski and several duty officers during which the former severely injured one or two of them, possibly by stabbing them with a makeshift weapon. A fight then ensued at the end of which Mr\u00a0Bekirski was subdued and handcuffed, but suffered at least twenty-nine injuries to his head, chest, stomach, arms and legs (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).

This resulted in up to four duty officers sustaining injuries to their eyes and limbs, one of which left a duty officer partially blind. Given the conduct of Mr Bekirski, the Court finds it reasonable that the duty officers might have feared for both their safety and for that of the persons in their charge. In addition, if indeed Mr Bekirski had been attempting to escape from the detention facility, it might have been reasonable to suppose that he represented a danger to society and that the duty officers were obligated to thwart his attempt. As to the numerous injuries sustained by Mr\u00a0Bekirski during the incident, the Court notes that the confrontation lasted up to ten minutes, involved several duty officers attempting to overpower and subdue Mr Bekirski and included the latter being pinned to the wall, falling down the stairs and to the ground before handcuffs were finally placed on him. The Court notes in this respect that the duty officers used only physical force and non-lethal means to subdue Mr Bekirski and did not resort to fire arms.",

As such, he was in a particularly vulnerable state, both as a result of the restriction to his liberty and, in particular, his state of health after the events of 30 August 1996 as detailed in the first medical report (see paragraph 20 above). Thus, the domestic authorities had an obligation under the Convention not only to safeguard his life but also to take all precautions necessary in order to avoid the infliction of any ill-treatment or punishment on that individual. Considering the medical evidence in the case, the corroborating witness statements and especially the Government's lack of assistance in providing all the information at its disposal, the Court finds that the domestic authorities do not appear to have done that in the present case. Accordingly, the Court finds it sufficiently proven that between 30 August and 6\u00a0September 1996 Mr Bekirski was subjected to ill-treatment or punishment at the hands of unidentified individuals for which the State bears responsibility.",

However, apart from the actions indicated, the Court is unable to establish what other investigative measures and evidence was collected and analysed because the Government did not provide it with a copy of the complete investigation file into Mr Bekirski's death and did not give any explanation as to why it could not, from which inferences are drawn as to the well-foundedness of the applicants' allegations (see paragraphs 111-12 and 115 above). Such lack of assistance by the respondent State in providing evidence which is vital for the proper assessment of the current complaint suffices for the Court to conclude that the authorities have failed to show that they complied with their obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to conduct an effective and impartial investigation into Mr Bekirski's death.",
