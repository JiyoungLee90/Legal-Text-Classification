That is because, as the Third Chamber itself openly recognised in its decision of 1 July 1994, which was produced by the applicant, it is impossible to establish the date when a judgment will be delivered before it has been drawn up and signed. That means that in every case, even people who were parties to the proceedings in question (which the applicant was not) will only learn the content and date of the judgment when it is served on them. Thus, taking as the starting-point the date of delivery of a judgment (which in practice is a fiction) and not the date of its service results in a material reduction in the time allowed for lodging the relevant claim for compensation, a reduction which, depending on how long service is delayed (which, admittedly, was for a very limited period in the present case), restricts and may even deny the effectiveness of the right to make a claim. Consequently, the decision of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court entails a violation of the right to effective protection by the courts.\u201d",

In our view, that situation amounts to a violation of the right to effective protection by the courts, since the requirement that the courts must examine a case cannot be satisfied by a mere decision containing formal reasoning, but requires a decision satisfying the criteria of legal and substantive debate or which, in accordance with Article 24 \u00a7 1, protects 'legitimate rights and interests'.",

That is not the case here. Under section 40(3) of the Law on the Legal Regime governing the Administration of the State (as worded at the material time) \u201cthe right to make a claim shall lapse one year after the event giving rise to the claim for compensation\u201d. Article 1971 of the Civil Code refers to the \u201cdate the judgment or decision becomes final\u201d. Although the provision relied on by the dissenting judges in the Constitutional Court \u2013 Article 1969 of the Civil Code \u2013 could support the minority's position, I do not consider the other interpretation as being so unreasonable as could be termed from the outset arbitrary and contrary to Article 6.",

The fact that the minority of the 's interpretation is the one \u201cbest suited to facilitate the right of access to a trial\u201d, to adopt the expression used by State Counsel (see paragraph 19 of the judgment), is nonetheless not decisive. For a finding of a violation of Article 6 to be made out, the verdict of the Supreme Court, accepted by the majority of the Constitutional Court, must instead have impaired the \u201cvery essence\u201d of the right of access (see the Brualla G\u00f3mez de la Torre v.

(judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, pp. 3256-57, \u00a7 49), it was the particularly strict application by the domestic courts of a \u201cprocedural rule\u201d that deprived the applicants of the \u201cright of access to a court\u201d. It will be recalled that in that case the applicant had three days to make an application in circumstances in which it was virtually impossible for her to comply. The Court rightly held that there had been a violation of Article 6.",

I note that even from 5 November 1987 the applicants had approximately eight months in which to lodge their claims within a year from the judgment of 4 July 1987. The applicants' claims were dated before 4 July 1988, but reached the authorities afterwards. The claims \u2013 dated between 27 April and 27 June 1988 \u2013 referred to the judgment adopted on 4 July 1987 without any reference to any other date such as the date of publication of the ministerial order in the Official Gazette (5 November 1987). Although those circumstances do not prove that the applicants foresaw how the authorities and the Supreme Court would interpret the rules, I consider it not unreasonable (having regard also to the wording of section 40(3) cited above, which the applicants rely on in their complaints) to assume that they could have foreseen the possibility of their being interpreted in that way. In any event, the interpretation of the national courts did not prevent the vast majority of the chemists concerned from lodging their claims within one year from 4 July 1987, judging from the information provided by the Government (and not contested by the applicants) that almost 16,000 chemists did so within the period. Although I do not know why thousands of other chemists lodged their claims before the applicants, that information nevertheless tends to confirm that there was no violation of the very substance of the right guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 \u2013 as interpreted by the Court in its case-law \u2013 of all chemists concerned, including the applicants. Consequently, I conclude that there has been no violation of that Article.",
