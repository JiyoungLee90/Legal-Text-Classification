However, each parent had their own conflicting opinions, which only served to worsen the strained relations between them. The court noted that both parents had the right to raise their children and have contact with them, and there was no information to suggest that E.B.\u2019s communication with his daughters would cause them harm. Nor was there any information that the applicant was failing in her duties as a mother. Accordingly, pursuant to Article 376 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which required the courts to aim to protect the interests and rights of minors (see paragraph 61 below), and taking into account the earlier court rulings that the girls should temporarily reside with the applicant (see paragraph 11 above), the court ordered E.B. to return his daughters to their mother. Should he fail to do so, the applicant could contact a bailiff, who would then take the girls and their documents and hand them over to the applicant. Until the end of the divorce and custody proceedings, the applicant\u2019s husband was granted contact with his daughters every other weekend from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, when he could collect them from the applicant\u2019s place of residence and spend time with them.

In September 2010, on the recommendation of the Marijampol\u0117 service, one of its psychologists saw the girls twice. She observed that they were attached to their father and had a good emotional connection with him. They also stated that they wished to stay with their father. The psychologist could not assess the emotional connection they had with their mother, because she could not be contacted. On 13 September 2010 the Kaunas service informed the court in writing that because the girls did not live in Kaunas, it did not know all the relevant circumstances of the case to assist the court in answering the question whether there were grounds for limiting E.B.\u2019s paternal rights, in accordance with Article 3.180 of the Civil Code.",

The girls themselves had expressed the wish to stay with him. The first-instance court thus held that although the father could have had some influence over the girls\u2019 choice as to who they preferred to live with, it was not decisive. The girls had thus already stated on 11 June 2010 that they preferred living with their father (see paragraph 15 above).

A fact on which the applicant had relied, that E.B. had prior convictions in Germany for sexual and drug-related offences committed in 1996 and 1998 did not have much significance for the case, because the convictions had expired in 2003. The applicant, for her part, had a criminal conviction in Lithuania for forgery of document and a criminal investigation against her for fraud had been terminated. What mattered was that she had left Lithuania for Germany; she had three addresses \u2013 in Kaunas, Marijampol\u0117 and in Germany, which she had indicated as places where she lived, which suggested that she in fact had no habitual place of residence. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s contact with the girls was merely episodic, whereas the girls\u2019 father took proper care of them and actively participated in raising them. The girls lived with their father, attended school and had suitable living conditions. The evidence as a whole allowed for the conclusion that there was a close connection between the girls and their father. There was no evidence in the case file to the effect that E.B. abused his parental rights, and it was for the applicant to prove the opposite, which she had not done. Moreover, under Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a child had the right to be heard in all matters affecting him, which had been done in the present case. The appellate court also observed that in accordance with Article 2 of the aforementioned Convention and Article 3.156 of the Civil Code, both parents had equal rights and obligations towards their children. Accordingly, and contrary to the applicant\u2019s suggestion that she was closer to the girls because of their gender, the gender of a parent could not be a factor which determined who a child should reside with.",

The Ombudsperson established that even though the contact order between the mother and the girls had been set in place as early as 8 November 2011 by the Marijampol\u0117 District Court, she had not yet tried to make use of it. Furthermore, the Marijampol\u0117 service had asked the applicant\u2019s lawyers to meet at its premises, offered to inform E.B. of that meeting and asked the applicant\u2019s lawyers for that purpose to choose a suitable date, but the applicant had not responded. For its part, the Kaunas service had also invited the applicant for a conversation so that she could express her wishes and preferences as to her contact with the girls, and so that the service could assist her. It was only when the applicant had not shown up that the Kaunas child care specialists had suggested to her lawyers that she communicate with the girls by letters via the Marijampol\u0117 child care specialists. It had also been indicated to the applicant that she had the opportunity to directly communicate with her daughters in the presence of a psychologist, and that could be discussed with the Marijampol\u0117 service. The girls\u2019 school in Marijampol\u0117 had also informed the Ombudsperson that the applicant had started communicating with the girls by letters since December 2011; between December 2011 and April 2012 three letters from her had been received, though the girls had refused to accept the last one. The school had thus suggested that the applicant choose another means of communicating with her daughters and asked the child care specialists to provide facilities for that purpose. Given the child care authorities and the school\u2019s suggestions for the applicant to communicate with her daughters directly (tiesiogiai), which the applicant had disregarded, it was not clear to the Ombudsperson why the applicant preferred to communicate with her daughters by letters. On this point the Ombudsperson pointed out that under Article 3.170 of the Civil Code parents who lived separately had the right and an obligation to communicate with their children and be involved in their upbringing; children, for their part, had a right to regular and direct contact with both parents, irrespective of their place of residence.",

The cassation court also relied on the Court\u2019s judgment in Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland ([GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 139, ECHR 2010), which said that an in-depth examination of the entire family situation was necessary to achieve the best result for the child. For the Supreme Court, such a result had been achieved in the present case. The lower courts had analysed the level of attachment to each parent and established that the girls, who lived with the father, were fond of him. Those courts had also noted psychologists\u2019 reports that the girls could entirely independently form their own opinion about which parent to live with, and had held that the children\u2019s opinion was one of the criteria when evaluating the entirety of evidence, and the girls had expressed such a wish during the court hearing. Even though the fact that the girls lived with their father could influence their formation of a negative opinion about their mother, it had not been established that the mother was barred from communicating with them; to be interested in their lives and visit them at school could thus form a positive opinion about her and make their emotional bond stronger. The first-instance court had also issued a contact order and thus the applicant\u2019s contact rights with her daughters had not been restricted. Even though the applicant had stated that she lived in Lithuania, the evidence showed that she had declared place of residence as Germany, where she had taken part in court proceedings so that the name of her third\u00a0child could be registered. As to E.B.\u2019s convictions in Germany, those offences had been committed in 1996 and 1998 and his convictions had expired a long time ago. There was no proof that he could have a negative impact on the girls. On the contrary, the girls studied well at school and took part in extracurricular activities. It followed that the courts had been correct in not giving particular weight to those convictions. Overall, it was thus in the best interests of the girls to stay with their father.",

The child care authorities supported this argument.

The bailiff\u2019s letter specified that her findings could be appealed against to the Marijampol\u0117 District Court.

In particular, the courts had not given sufficient weight to the forensic reports as to the girls\u2019 psychological state, and had overlooked the continuous damage caused to their minds because of them living with E.B. during the court proceedings.

Even if one cannot exclude that within that short period the girls\u2019 views could have evolved, the Court cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that on as early as 10\u00a0June 2010, that is six days after E.B. did not return his daughters to the applicant, police assistance was offered to the applicant so that she could go to E.B.\u2019s home and take the girls. Even so, the applicant did not avail herself of this opportunity to have the girls returned, but chose to place that burden on the bailiff\u2019s shoulders (see paragraph 13 above). This only confirms the Lithuanian authorities\u2019 argument that the applicant placed the task on the State and municipal institutions, instead of being proactive herself (see paragraphs 16 and 43 above).",

The first attempt to hand over the girls failed because of their illness, a fact confirmed by the domestic court (see paragraph 47 above). The second attempt to hand over the girls did not produce results due to reasons attributable only to the applicant (see paragraph 48 above). Most importantly, the last and third attempt did not come to fruition because the applicant\u2019s daughters had clearly refused to leave their father\u2019s home, notwithstanding that the applicant was given an opportunity to talk to them alone, the authorities clearly having given her an opportunity to convince them to leave with her (see paragraph 49 above). The bailiff\u2019s subsequent conclusion that physical force was not a measure to be used in such situations and that another method of enforcement was necessary to preserve the children\u2019s interests is tantamount to the Court\u2019s position that any obligation to apply coercion to facilitate the reunion of a parent and children must be limited (see Hokkanen v. Finland, 23 September 1994, \u00a7\u00a058, Series A no. 299A; Z.J. v. Lithuania, cited above, \u00a7\u00a098, with further references).

The psychologists from the Marijampol\u0117 service saw the girls twice (see paragraph 18 above). Child care services also assisted the courts as well as the applicant by making inquiries into the girls\u2019 living conditions at their father\u2019s home, answered the applicant\u2019s queries, made suggestions about how to enforce the court orders deciding the girls\u2019 place of residence was with their mother (see paragraphs 8, 12, 15, 16, 18, 41, 43, 46 and 49 above; contrast Ignaccolo-Zenide v.

It also has regard to the Kaunas service\u2019s statement that because the girls lived in Marijampol\u0117, the service did not know all the relevant circumstances about their lives (see paragraph\u00a018 in fine above).",

The fact that the national courts relied on the conclusions and testimony of many different specialists (social services, psychologists and the school principal) is also of the utmost importance. Although the applicant challenged her former husband\u2019s moral values, the Lithuanian courts answered her queries (see paragraphs 39 and 45 above), and the Court sees no reason to call those findings into question. It further observes that although at the beginning of the custody proceedings the applicant lived in Lithuania, she later left for Germany (see paragraph 26 above). It shares the Lithuanian court\u2019s view that the applicant\u2019s place of residence, be it in Lithuania or in Germany, as such was not a decisive factor (see paragraph\u00a033 above). What mattered was the uncertainty, which stemmed from the applicant\u2019s and her lawyer\u2019s untenable statements to the Lithuanian courts, as well as to this Court (see paragraphs 30, 31, 33, 45, 39 and 76 above), as to where the applicant planned to live, that uncertainty evidently not being in the two girls\u2019 interests to have a stable place of residence (see paragraph 21 above). Indeed, it appears that the applicant had never returned to Lithuania in spite of her promise to the contrary (see paragraph\u00a030\u00a0above). In this connection, the Court takes note of the applicant\u2019s statement that in October 2013 E.B. and the girls moved to Germany. However, this matter is not decisive for the Court, because that took place even after the custody proceedings in Lithuania had finished (see paragraphs 45 and 77 above). Furthermore, even if that information is accurate, the applicant\u2019s daughters are now even closer to her, because according to the information on the application form, the applicant also lives in Germany.",

Italy, no.\u00a029569/95, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999-VI; and Elsholz, cited above, \u00a7 52). In the instant case, the Court notes that the applicant, in person or through her lawyer, was present at a number of hearings where the protective measures and the merits of her civil claim were discussed by the Marijampol\u0117 District Court (see paragraphs 17, 20, 23, 28 and 30 above). With the benefit of assistance of the State-appointed lawyer, she had the opportunity to submit requests and evidence, present her arguments and comment on the other participants\u2019 submissions before the courts, both in writing and orally, and she also had the right to appeal. Eventually, at the end of the first-instance court proceedings the applicant herself acknowledged that all the evidence had been gathered and examined, asking the court to finish its examination of the evidence (see paragraph 27 above). Notwithstanding this, the first-instance court still deemed the applicant\u2019s participation indispensable to better establish the circumstances of the case, thus retaining its active role in the child care proceedings (see paragraphs 28 and 61 above). That being the case, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant was thus placed in a position enabling her to put forward all arguments in favour of her being granted custody of the girls and she also had access to all relevant information relied on by the courts. In addition, the children themselves were heard by the court, the need to respect the views of the child having been underlined by the United Nations Children Rights\u2019 Committee (see paragraphs 20, 31, 39, 64 and 65 above; compare and contrast Kutzner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).

Germany [GC], no. 31871/96, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2003VIII (extracts)), the Court is satisfied that the procedural requirements implicit in Article 8 of the Convention were complied with and that the applicant was involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide her with requisite protection of her interests.",

In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court cannot confine itself to considering the impugned decisions in isolation, but must look at them in the light of the case as a whole; it must determine whether the reasons adduced by the domestic courts were relevant and sufficient (see Olsson v.

A follow-up study\u201d (2001, pp.\u00a061106) as referred to by the partly dissenting judges in Sommerfeld v. Germany (ibid.). This is a matter that is receiving an increasing amount of attention and the consideration of Gardner\u2019s parental alienation syndrome in the domestic proceedings has been considered as relevant and important by this Court in at least a dozen cases. Courts should address the question whether the parental alienation syndrome is present and what specific consequences such a syndrome could have on the child\u2019s development. The authorities have a positive obligation to prevent the development of that syndrome and they should not have tolerated the conditions which in the circumstances of the present case led to the development of that syndrome.",
