The question was how the pension pot in the GPS should be transferred: at actuarial value or at a Year for Year value or a mixture of the two. The fact that the terms of service before 1st July 1997, and the pension arrangements, were fit for the previous assumption, as Purja held, obviously creates a problem for those whose years of service spanned that date. The first option would undervalue the years of service after 1st July 1997 by reference to the actual pay received with the [universal addition], and by comparison with the value earned in their pension pots by the rest of the British Army to whom, after that date, the same retirement assumptions now could be applied. The second, although not itself irrational, would give to the transferring Gurkha an enhancement to his pension not just by reference to its value but also by reference to assumptions inapplicable before 1st July 1997 when the pension or deferred pay was earned. The third, which was adopted, reflected the differences in the assumptions which underlay the pay and pension arrangements before and after 1st July 1997.",

The longer the service after 1997, the greater the personal connection with the UK and the corresponding loosening of the ties with Nepal, the greater the number of years transferred on a Year for Year basis. The converse is also the case: the greater the number of years served before 1997, the greater the ties with Nepal. Although in fact the percentage of retired Gurkhas coming to the UK after retirement between 1997 and 2004 is very high indeed, that does not mean that the pension transfer provision is irrational in not making it financially easier for them to do so. The system is a rough reflection of the degree of the ties with either country in which retirement could be enjoyed. The Year for Year transfer of all pension rights of those retiring after 1st July 1997 would create a sharp distinction between those Gurkhas who retired before and after that date in respect of years of service before that date.",

Denmark, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 56, Series A no. 23). Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no.\u00a057325/00, \u00a7 175, ECHR 2007-IV, and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2008). Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see Burden, cited above, \u00a7 60). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subjectmatter and the background. As a general rule, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before the Court could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of nationality as compatible with the Convention (see Gaygusuz v. Austria, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV, and Andrejeva v. Latvia [GC], no.\u00a055707/00, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2009). However, a wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature\u2019s policy choice unless it is \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a042184/05, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2010 and Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2006-VI).",

Likewise, they contended that the fact that Gurkhas historically retired to Nepal was not logically connected to the pension that they should receive for the service they rendered.

This was because pension payments under the GPS were payable immediately upon retirement, whereas an immediate pension under the AFPS was only payable after twenty-two years\u2019 service and most (non-Gurkha) army personnel did not serve that long. Consequently, most of the applicants would receive pension payments for over twenty-five years before many non-Gurkha soldiers of the same rank and length of service would qualify for any payments under the AFPS.

As in Stec, the Government was trying to put right an inequality and its policy choice in doing so was not \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d. This was especially so given that, for the reasons already identified, that policy choice was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. Furthermore, in allowing pension rights accrued in respect of years of service after 1 July 1997 to be transferred to the AFPS on a year-for-year basis, the Government effectively created an exception to its general policy of non-retrospectivity when it came to the enhancement of pension schemes. However, the cost of equalising all years of service prior to July 1997 for members of the Brigade in service on that date would have cost an additional GBP 320 million, while extending the GOTT to all Gurkhas, including those who retired before 1 July 1997, and valuing their service on a year-for-year basis would have cost in the region of GBP 1.5 billion over twenty years. Moreover, such an approach, if adopted, might have led beneficiaries of other public sector schemes to complain about the non-retrospectivity of any enhancements in their own schemes.",

In addition, for those eligible for transfer to the AFPS, only accrued rights to a pension for years of service after 1 July 1997 were transferred on a year-for-year basis, while accrued rights in respect of years of service prior to that date were transferred at actuarial value (approximately twenty-three to thirty-six percent of the value of a year\u2019s service of a non-Gurkha soldier of equivalent rank \u2013 see paragraph 27 above). However, the notion of discrimination implies that the group in question was not only treated differently, but also less favourably (see, for example, Elsholz v. Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61, ECHR\u00a02000VIII), and in the present case the Government contend that this criterion was not met as the vast majority of Gurkhas (both those who retired before 1 July 1997 and those who retired on or after that date) would not have been in a significantly better financial position if they had been treated as if they had always been in the AFPS.",

Whether or not the applicants\u2019 objections in this respect are justified, the Court notes that the GAD report expressly accepts that Gurkha soldiers of officer rank or above (roughly four per cent of the total) would have been in a significantly better financial position had they been able to transfer all years of service to the AFPS on a year-for-year basis. Furthermore, in the 2004 review conducted by the Secretary of State for Defence it was conceded that Gurkhas generally were \u201cclearly\u201d wronged under the GPS in the changed context of a likely second career in the United Kingdom, in that the GPS paid \u201csums too small to be useful at a time when [the Gurkha] does not need them and an inadequate pension at retirement age\u201d (see paragraph\u00a023 above). Therefore, even if the total sum of pension payments received by a Gurkha who was not of officer rank would not have been less than the total sum received by his non-Gurkha counterpart, the authorities have acknowledged that what the 2004 review called the different \u201cpension benefit profiles\u201d of Gurkha soldiers were less advantageous. The Court is therefore satisfied that Gurkha soldiers can be regarded as having been treated less favourably in respect of their pension entitlement than other soldiers in the British Army.",

Most importantly, on 1 July 1997 their home base moved to the United Kingdom (see paragraph 8 above); in 2004 the Immigration Rules were amended to allow Gurkhas with at least four years\u2019 service retiring on or after 1 July 1997 to apply for settlement in the United Kingdom after discharge (see paragraph 13 above); in 2006 the policy on Married Accompanied Service was changed, allowing the wives and children of Gurkha soldiers to also form ties to the United Kingdom (see paragraph 9 above); and finally, in 2009 the Immigration Rules were again amended to permit all Gurkha soldiers with at least four years\u2019 service to apply for settlement in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 14 above).",

However, in considering whether such \u201cvery weighty reasons\u201d exist, the Court must be mindful of the wide margin usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. That is particularly so where an alleged difference in treatment resulted from a transitional measure forming part of a scheme for the enhancement of a benefit which was carried out in good faith in order to correct an inequality. For example, in Neill and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 56721/00 of 29 January 2002, the Court recognised that, in making provision for the future payment of service pensions to servicemen and to their widows, national authorities were in principle permitted to restrict entitlement to such pensions to those who were still in service at the time of introduction of the new provisions, and to fix the level of entitlement by reference to the period of service completed following introduction of the relevant provisions.",

As a consequence, the 2007 GOTT was formulated in order to bring Gurkhas\u2019 pensions into line with those of other soldiers in the British Army. However, having decided to allow the Gurkhas to transfer to the AFPS, the authorities were faced with a decision: whether to allow the transfer to the AFPS of pension rights accrued in respect of all years of service on a year-for-year basis; whether to allow only the transfer of pension rights accrued in respect of all years of service on an actuarial basis; or to find a middle ground.",

The second option was also rejected, because it would have undervalued those years of service acquired at a time when the historical assumption that the Gurkhas would retire to Nepal no longer held good.

Those who retired before that date had no ties to the United Kingdom and, at the date of the GOTT (2007), had no right to settle there. Although this changed following the 2009 amendment to the Immigration Rules, the applicants agreed before the domestic courts that this development \u2013 which post-dated both the GOTT and the commencement of the domestic proceedings in the present case \u2013 was irrelevant (see paragraph 34 above). Consequently, the Court finds no cause to doubt the conclusion of the 2004 review that the GPS continued to be the best scheme to meet the needs of these Gurkhas, since the payments under that scheme, which were available immediately upon retirement, were more than adequate to provide for their retirement in Nepal (see paragraph 23 above).",

It is true that the majority of Gurkhas falling into this category did subsequently settle in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 13 above). Nevertheless, in considering the impact of the GOTT on their financial situation, it must be borne in mind that the purpose of an armed forces pension scheme (either under the AFPS or GPS) was not to enable the soldier to live without other sources of income following retirement from the Army. Given that most Gurkhas retired after fifteen years, and the majority of other soldiers in the British Army retired before they had served for twenty-two years, it was fully expected that they would continue to be economically active and have other sources of income once they left the armed forces. In fact, the evidence submitted by the Government indicates that many of those Gurkhas who retired after 1 July 1997 and who remained in the United Kingdom have gone on to find other gainful employment there (see paragraph 74 above).",
