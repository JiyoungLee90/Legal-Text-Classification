However, having regard to the preparatory work to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and the interpretation of the provision in the context of the Convention as a whole, the Court has established that this provision also implies individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v.\u00a0Belgium, 2 March 1987, \u00a7\u00a7 46-51, Series A no. 113).",

Nor is the Court in a position to assume a fact-finding role by attempting to determine whether the alleged irregularities took place and whether they were capable of influencing the outcome of the elections.

In this connection, the Court observes that by applying to the Ardahan District Electoral Council, the applicant was merely making an enquiry before the national authorities to determine whether playing a song in Kurdish would constitute a crime. It also observes that the applicant explicitly referred to the decision of the Court of Cassation (cited above in paragraph\u00a018), which had concluded that playing or singing a Kurdish song did not constitute a crime under domestic law. In reply, the District Electoral Council concluded that this matter did not fall within its jurisdiction but fell within the jurisdiction of the public prosecutors and the criminal courts. The Court considers that as the applicant is a lawyer he should have known that the Electoral Council had no authority to give an approval to his request. His complaints before the Court as well as the domestic authorities were therefore purely abstract. Even if, at the material time, Section 58 of Law No. 298 stipulated that the election campaign could only be done in the Turkish language and that this provision applied to all political parties and candidates without any exception, it appears that playing a song in Kurdish would not have constituted a criminal offence. This is supported by the decision of the Court of Cassation, referred to above, of which the applicant was fully aware. In any event, the Court notes that no criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant (see, a\u00a0contrario, \u015e\u00fckran Ayd\u0131n and Others v. Turkey, nos. 49197/06 and 4\u00a0others, 22 January 2013).

This fact, correctly noted in the \u201cFacts\u201d section, is distorted in paragraph 34, inter alia, by underlining that domestic law carried no risk of the applicant\u2019s criminal prosecution, owing to the decision of the Court of Cassation of 27 April 2005. This is a substitution: playing a song in Kurdish might not have been contrary to criminal law, but still against the law and entailing another form of liability. To everyone\u2019s great relief, criminal law is not all law.",

He certainly had a law degree, but what does the Court know about the field of his legal practice or, for that matter, whether he practised law at all? Does it flow from being a lawyer that one is knowledgeable in all fields of law, including electoral law? To claim that whoever has a law degree \u201cshould know\u201d all law would amount to holding that if one is a sportsman, he or she should be skilled in track and field, weight-lifting, swimming, horseracing, football, aerobics and so on. In a similar vein, the applicant might well have been a family lawyer, or an insurance lawyer, or a real estate lawyer, or a tax lawyer, or an international lawyer, etc., he might have been specialising in legal sociology or comparative legal history, you name it \u2013 but of that the Court knows nothing. Why should it know? And since when have lawyers been deprived of the right to address authorities with requests?",

These convictions were dealt with by the Court in \u015e\u00fckran Ayd\u0131n and Others (cited above) and found to be contrary to Article 10. It is the Chamber that chose to ignore that practice. Had there not been this other line of judicial practice, there would have been less (if any) need to request that the authorities clarify the law. This merely demonstrates that the applicant\u2019s request was not inconsequential.",

As mentioned in paragraph 8 above, the judgment does not deal at all with the powers of electoral councils. The legal basis for the presumed absence of authority to give a requested instruction (not to \u201capprove a request\u201d) has not been demonstrated to the Court. Wherefrom does the Chamber know that the dismissal of the applicant\u2019s request was not arbitrary, if it has not analysed the legislation on the powers of the electoral councils?",

In this regard Mr Y\u0131lmaz was effectively prevented by the domestic authorities from doing what he legitimately sought to do.
