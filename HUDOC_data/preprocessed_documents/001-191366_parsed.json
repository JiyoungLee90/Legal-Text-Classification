The Court further notes that, the criminal charges against the applicant, as described in the domestic proceedings, were based on the fact that he had filmed a group of individuals performing a \u201cHarlem Shake\u201d dance and that subsequently he uploaded the video recording to YouTube. However, it does not consider that such an action could have given rise to a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the criminal offence of hooliganism as defined under national law. It is not at all clear from the decisions of the prosecuting authorities and the domestic courts how the video recording of a dance and its subsequent uploading to YouTube could be considered as a grave breach of public order which constitutes one of the elements of the criminal offence of hooliganism under domestic law. In particular, the Court draws attention to the text of Article 221 of the Criminal Code, as worded at the time in question, which clearly defined the criminal offence of hooliganism as intentional actions gravely breaching public order and expressing a manifest disrespect towards society, accompanied by the use of, or the threat to use, violence against citizens, as well as by the destruction or damage of others\u2019 property (see paragraph 32 above).",

This interpretation of the domestic law was also confirmed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 36 above). However, it was argued neither in the domestic proceedings nor before the Court that the applicant\u2019s actions had been accompanied by the use of, or the threat to use, violence against citizens or the destruction or damaging of others\u2019 property. Therefore, the Court cannot but conclude that a constituent element of the criminal offence of hooliganism, as defined in the Criminal Code and interpreted by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court, did not exist in the applicant\u2019s case (compare Kandzhov, cited above, \u00a7 60).",

In any event, all previous decisions ordering and extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention had been based solely on the original charges under Articles 221.2.1 and 221.2.2 of the Criminal Code, and the new charges were therefore of no significance as regards assessing the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the applicant\u2019s detention during the period falling within the scope of the present case, and the Government have not expressly argued otherwise (compare Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7 131, and Rashad Hasanov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 106).",
