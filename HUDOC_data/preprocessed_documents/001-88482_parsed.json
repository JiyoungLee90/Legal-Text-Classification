On 15 February 2006 the second applicant was transferred to ward no. 4. According to the Government, the second applicant was discharged from the prison hospital on 29 March 2006.

It notes that the second applicant\u2019s detention in wards nos. 2 and 4 ended on 14 February and 29 March 2006 respectively.

In the Court\u2019s view, where several persons are brought to trial, the defence rights of each of them must be equally respected as interests of the co-accused may be in conflict and a testimony in favour of one of them could have adverse implications for another. Accordingly, the Court does not find that there was a clear and unequivocal waiver of the applicants\u2019 right to cross-examine Mr\u00a0K.",

Further, it emphasises that Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) of the Convention does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a particular witness (see Laukkanen and Manninen v. , no.\u00a050230/99, \u00a7\u00a035, 3 February 2004). Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused\u2019s behalf: its essential aim, as indicated by the words \u201cunder the same conditions\u201d, is a full \u201cequality of arms\u201d in the matter (see Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0158, \u00a7\u00a089 and Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22\u00a0April 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0235B, \u00a7\u00a033). The Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms implies that the applicant must be \u201cafforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent\u201d (see Bulut v. Austria, judgment of 22 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, \u00a7\u00a047). The concept of \u201cequality of arms\u201d does not, however, exhaust the content of paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6, nor that of paragraph 1, of which this phrase represents one application among many others. The task of the Court is to ascertain whether the proceedings at issue, considered as a whole, were fair as required by paragraph 1 (see, among other authorities, Delta v. France, judgment of 19 December 1990, Series A no. 191, p. 15, \u00a0\u00a7\u00a035, and Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, \u00a7\u00a033).",

Having failed to do so, the trial court did not comply with its duty to ensure the presence of witnesses on the second applicant\u2019s behalf on the same conditions as that of the prosecution witnesses and thus breached the \u201cequality of arms\u201d principle.",
