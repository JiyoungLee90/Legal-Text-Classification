According to the Court of Justice, that failure could not be justified by such circumstances as the opposition of the local population to waste disposal sites, the presence of criminal activity in the region or the non-performance of contractual obligations by the undertakings entrusted with the construction of certain waste disposal infrastructures. It explained that this last factor could not be considered force majeure, because \u201cthe notion of force majeure require[d] the non-performance of the act in question to be attributable to circumstances, beyond the control of the party claiming force majeure, which [were] abnormal and unforeseeable and the consequences of which could not have been avoided despite the exercise of all due diligence\u201d, and that a diligent authority should have taken the necessary precautions either to guard against the contractual non-performance in question or to ensure that, despite those shortcomings, actual construction of the infrastructures necessary for waste disposal would be completed on time. The Court of Justice also noted that \u201cthe Italian Republic [did] not dispute that the waste littering the public roads totalled 55,000 tonnes, adding to the 110,000 tonnes to 120,000 tonnes of waste awaiting treatment at municipal storage sites\u201d. Concerning the environmental hazard, the Court of Justice reiterated that the accumulation of waste, regard being had in particular to the limited capacity of each region or locality for waste reception, constituted a danger to the environment. It concluded that the accumulation of such large quantities of waste along public roads and in temporary storage areas had given rise to a \u201crisk to water, air or soil, and to plants or animals\u201d within the meaning of Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 2006/12, had caused \u201ca nuisance through noise or odours\u201d within the meaning of Article 4(1)(b), and was likely to affect \u201cadversely ... the countryside or places of special interest\u201d within the meaning of Article 4(1)(c) of that Directive. As to the danger to human health, the Court of Justice noted that \u201cthat the worrying situation of accumulation of waste along the public roads [had] exposed the health of the local inhabitants to certain danger, in breach of Article 4(1) of Directive 2006/12\u201d.",

It notes that a state of emergency was declared in Campania from 11\u00a0February 1994 to 31\u00a0December 2009 and that the applicants were forced to live in an environment polluted by refuse left in the streets at least from the end of 2007 until May 2008. The Court considers that this situation may have led to a deterioration of the applicants\u2019 quality of life and, in particular, adversely affected their right to respect for their homes and their family life. Article 8 therefore applies in the present case. The Court further notes that the applicants have not alleged that they were affected by any pathologies linked to exposure to waste, and that the scientific studies submitted by the parties reach opposite conclusions as to the existence of a causal link between exposure to the waste and an increased risk of developing pathologies such as cancer or congenital malformations. In these conditions, although the Court of Justice of the European Union, when examining the waste disposal situation in Campania, considered that the accumulation of large quantities of refuse along public roads and in temporary storage areas exposed the health of the local inhabitants to certain danger (see judgment C-297/08, cited in paragraphs 55 and 56 above), the Court cannot conclude that the applicants\u2019 lives or health were threatened. That said, however, Article 8 may be relied on even in the absence of any evidence of a serious danger to people\u2019s health (see L\u00f3pez Ostra, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051).",
