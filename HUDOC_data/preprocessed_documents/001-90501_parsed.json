Secondly, he can request the court to instruct the court which examines the merits of the case to take certain measures within a fixed time-limit and thus to accelerate the impugned proceedings (see Michalak v. , no.\u00a024549/03, \u00a7\u00a016, 1\u00a0March 2005). In the present case, in its decision of 29 January 2007 the Court of Appeal found that the lower court had failed to conduct the proceedings speedily, but dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for compensation. However, it made use of its competence to instruct the court before which the proceedings were pending at that time and ordered it to give a judgment on the merits of the applicant\u2019s case before July 2007.",
