He had regularly attended church services and after about six or seven months had been baptised in that church. For him, being a Christian meant believing in Jesus Christ and spreading his message. He stated that he continued to study the Bible and recited parts of it. The principle of honesty enshrined in Christianity was particularly important to him. Even if he were unable to manifest his belief in the future, he would always retain the truthfulness of his faith, which nobody could take away from him.

A Christian convert faced a much greater risk of ill-treatment than those born into the Christian religion. His conversion to Christianity was genuine and lasting.

It considered that a person could only face a real risk of ill-treatment upon return to Iran if that person\u2019s Christian faith had been manifested in Switzerland in such a way as to make it visible to the outside and if it could be assumed that his or her family and acquaintances in Iran would learn about that active manifestation of faith, even if it was short of proselytising. If close family members were \u201cfanatic\u201d Muslims, they might denounce the conversion to the secret service. In addition, conversion to Christianity might be seen as treason. Where a conversion had taken place abroad, there had to be both an assessment of whether it was genuine and the extent to which it had become publicly known. Even assuming that the applicant\u2019s conversion had been genuine and was lasting, the court considered that he did not manifest his Christian faith in the manner described.

The personality of the individuals concerned, the form of their appearances in public and the content of their public statements were relevant parameters in that regard.

The Court had acknowledged, in respect of sur place activities, that it was generally very difficult to assess whether the person was genuinely interested in the activity in question or whether he or she had only become involved in it in order to create post-flight grounds and that a rigorous and in-depth examination of the circumstances and genuineness of sur place conversions was necessary (see F.G. v. Sweden [GC], no. 43611/11, \u00a7 123, ECHR 2016). The Government observed that the applicant\u2019s first application for asylum had been rejected in February 2013, based on credibility concerns, after he had twice been heard in person by the Swiss asylum authorities, and that that decision had become final. Noting that he had converted to Christianity less than six months later, which raised doubts as to whether the conversion was genuine and lasting, they emphasised that the Swiss asylum authorities had again examined him in person in relation to his new claim, which had been scrutinised in substance at two levels of jurisdiction in the second and third sets of proceedings. A nuanced approach was called for as regards the situation of Christian converts in Iran. Relevant reports indicated that converts who, like the applicant, had not come to the attention of the authorities, including for reasons other than their conversion, and who practised their faith discreetly, did not face a real risk of ill-treatment upon their return.",

In that regard, the Court observes that the circumstances of the present case differ from those of the Bundesrepublik Deutschland v. Y (C71/11) and Z (C-99/11), decided by the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union on 5 September 2012. In that case, the finding was that the domestic authorities had established, inter alia, that the persons concerned were deeply committed to their faith and considered that the public practice of it was essential for them to preserve their religious identity. In the present case, the domestic authorities, who questioned the applicant in person, did not reach similar conclusions, and the applicant has not submitted any evidence or arguments to the Court which would call for a different assessment of the applicant\u2019s faith, notably as regards the public practice of his faith.",

It also has regard to the reasoning advanced by the domestic authorities for their conclusions and the reports on the situation of Christian converts in Iran (see paragraphs 26-31 above). On the basis of these factors, and in the absence of any fresh evidence or argument before the Court, it sees no grounds to consider that the assessment made by the domestic authorities was inadequate (see F.G. v.\u00a0Sweden, cited above, \u00a7 117).",
