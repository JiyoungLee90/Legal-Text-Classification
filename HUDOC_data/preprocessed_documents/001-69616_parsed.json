A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

He also challenged the conclusion of the posthumous psychological/psychiatric examination as being inconsistent with the assessment given by the prison psychiatrist throughout the routine supervision. He saw a contradiction in that the latter showed that Viktor Trubnikov was emotional, demonstrative and irresponsible, but stable at the same time, while the posthumous report unambiguously stated that he had not been suffering from any psychiatric disorder and had generally been well. The applicant contended that, since no clear conclusion could be reached about the condition of Viktor Trubnikov on the basis of his medical file, the conclusion should have been reached that his behaviour had varied over time. In such circumstances, even if the real and immediate risk was not always present, it was incumbent on the authorities to monitor his condition carefully in case of any sudden deterioration. In any event, the applicant had difficulties accepting the allegation that Viktor Trubnikov\u2019s condition had been normal and stable, since the authorities had not offered any other explanation for his suicide, thus reinforcing doubts as to whether it had indeed been a suicide.

In the context of prisoners, the Court has had previous occasion to emphasise that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and that the authorities are under a duty to protect them. It is incumbent on the State to account for any injuries suffered in custody, which obligation is particularly stringent when an individual dies (see, for example, Salman v.

Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise regarding a prisoner with suicidal tendencies, it must be established that the authorities knew, or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual and, if so, that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 92, ECHR 2001III).",
