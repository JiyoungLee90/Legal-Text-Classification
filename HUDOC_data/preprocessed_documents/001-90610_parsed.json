Criminals in the  could have possessed camouflage uniforms and firearms stolen from the federal arsenals in the 1990s. Groups of Ukrainian, Belorussian and ethnic Russian mercenaries had committed crimes in the territory of the Chechen Republic and, therefore, the fact that the perpetrators had Slavic features and spoke Russian did not prove their attachment to the Russian military. The fact that some items had been stolen from the Abdurzakovs\u2019 house also proved that the armed men were criminals,  agents.

They had never informed the investigation of blood traces allegedly found near their house. Statements by other witnesses had also been inconsistent. The Government emphasised that the applicants and other witnesses had been obliged to give truthful testimony under domestic law but there was no legal obligation as regards their submissions to the Court and inferred that the testimonies given in the course of the investigation were more reliable and correct than the information sent to Strasbourg.",

Furthermore, the Government mentioned that the applicants had the opportunity to apply for judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes that the applicants did, in fact, make use of that remedy (see paragraphs 61-66 above). On one occasion it even led to the resumption of the investigation (see paragraph 62 above). However, the authorities still failed to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations properly. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor\u2019s office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the criminal-law remedies relied on by the Government were ineffective in the circumstances of the case and rejects their objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust these domestic remedies.",
