The court decided, however, that those statements were either untruthful, because the witnesses were the applicant\u2019s friends and wanted to help him avoid criminal liability, or unrelated to the precise time when the robbery had been committed. Ms\u00a0M. was questioned during the trial and retracted her earlier statements incriminating the applicant as given under duress. However, the court chose to rely on those earlier statements as more plausible and concordant with the other facts. It noted, in particular, that she had not requested a medical examination until two days after her questioning by the police and that there was no evidence that the injuries discovered had been inflicted on her in police custody. While Ms M. contended that she had been hiding in fear that the police might seek revenge, the court considered it more probable that she had in fact been afraid that the applicant\u2019s accomplices who had not been detained might seek revenge.",

The Golosiyivskyy District Court of Kyiv is currently examining a case against the Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department [T.] and [Z.], in which I am a victim. I\u00a0retract the statements which I gave in the prosecutor\u2019s office under pressure from the investigator and in court, namely that it was precisely [T. and Z.] who had beaten and humiliated me. The investigator [N.] demanded that I identify [T. and Z.]. In exchange, he promised I would be acquitted and that criminal department officials would be held liable. I remembered [T.] because he had been the Chief, and [Z.] because he had been wearing glasses. I could recognise only those two, as I could not, and do not now, remember any other officers. I was beaten up at , no. 3, as they really needed my confession to the robbery. But I did not remember any officers from Shutov [street], and I was advised to incriminate those I remembered. When the investigator [N.] came to see me, I was at a loss and did not know what to tell him. But he reassured me and told me that I did not have to worry and that I was to testify against those I remembered. As to what exactly I had to tell and to show, he told that he would help me. At the same time, he promised that if I followed his advice I would be at liberty shortly. It is very difficult for me now to testify before the court, for I have got confused in my statements because it was the investigator [N.] who gave them to me. I therefore request you not to disturb me any longer regarding the case of [T. and Z.] and not to bring me to the court\u201d.",

Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see, as a classic authority, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25).

France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999V). Moreover, when the national authorities failed to conduct a medical examination before placing the applicant in detention, as in the present case, the Government cannot rely on that failure in their defence and claim that the injuries in question pre-dated the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody (see T\u00fcrkan v. Turkey, no. 33086/04, \u00a7 43, 18\u00a0September\u00a02008). In this respect the Court recalls that a medical examination, together with the right of access to a lawyer and the right to inform a third party of the detention, constitute fundamental safeguards against the ill-treatment of detained persons which should apply as from the very outset of deprivation of liberty. This would not only ensure the applicant\u2019s rights but would also enable the respondent Government to discharge their burden of providing a plausible explanation for the injuries (see Korobov v.

France [GC], cited above, \u00a7 97, and Akko\u00e7 v. , nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a0115, ECHR 2000X).

In the light of this approach, the Court held that certain acts which were classified in the past as \u201cinhuman and degrading treatment\u201d as opposed to \u201ctorture\u201d could be classified differently in future (ibid.).",

Moreover, the near halt of the proceedings by the , solely because of the absence of witnesses, appears unjustified, given that the passage of about four years \u2013 as of September 2007 and even more thereafter \u2013 must inevitably have taken a toll on the witnesses\u2019 capacity to recall events in detail and with accuracy.",

Furthermore, relying on Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (b), (c) and (d), he complained that his trial had been unfair and that his conviction lacked a solid evidential basis. He submitted in that regard that the courts had wrongly relied on the statements of Ms\u00a0M. given during the pre-trial investigation, had arbitrarily disregarded the statements of several witnesses confirming his alibi, and had failed to summon some other witnesses for the defence. Lastly, the applicant complained, relying on Article 13, that there had been no investigation into the lawfulness of the institution of the criminal proceedings against him on the charge of robbery of Ms Z.",
