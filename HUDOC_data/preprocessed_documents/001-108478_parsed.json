The detention facilities were not equipped with glucose meters, while ordinary laboratory blood tests, which were carried out once every four months, were manifestly inadequate and irregular. Owing to inadequate medical treatment and monitoring, the applicant experienced dramatic changes in blood glucose levels. Moreover, the dentures provided in 2005 had become unfit for purpose on account of loss of teeth. The applicant argued that the dentists in the detention facilities in which he was being detained had no equipment which would allow for implants to be fixed in his mouth. The absence of the appropriate denture and diet could lead to various problems for his digestive system. He also had progressive hearing and sight loss. He was not provided with orthopaedic footwear, which was necessary on account of the injuries to his feet. In the absence of such footwear, he suffered pain in his feet and could hardly keep his balance, for instance during long routine line-ups organised by the prison staff or when cleaning cells; his standard footwear did not fit him properly and wore out quickly. He could not obtain any documentary proof concerning the need for such footwear.",

The Court has found no reason to disagree with these assessments. Therefore, as regards the grievances mentioned under (i)-(iii) in paragraph 61 above, the Court concludes that the applicant, who was represented before this Court by a lawyer, did not provide sufficient and convincing arguments disclosing that any allegedly serious failings on the part of the national authorities in complying with medical recommendations and prescriptions were such as to violate the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention.",

The Ukhta colony management (in the same region) made a different statement, considering that orthopaedic footwear was not readily available to the applicant (ibid).

Switzerland, judgment of 24\u00a0June\u00a01993, \u00a7 58, Series A no.\u00a0263, with further references). Although the earlier cases emphasised that a hearing must be held before a court of first and only instance unless there were exceptional circumstances that justified dispensing with one (see, for instance, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v.\u00a0Sweden, cited above, \u00a7 64; Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 23\u00a0February 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 22, Series A no. 283-A; and Allan\u00a0Jacobsson v.\u00a0Sweden\u00a0(no. 2) judgment of 19 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a046, Reports\u00a01998-I), the Court has clarified that the character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the national court, not to the frequency of such situations. It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Miller v. Sweden, no.\u00a055853/00, \u00a7\u00a029, 8\u00a0February 2005). The overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article 6 is the key consideration.",

For instance, the Court has found a violation of Article 6 in a case where a Russian court refused leave to appear to a detainee who had wished to make oral submissions on his claim that he had been ill-treated by the police. Despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim was largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been an important part of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the case (see Kovalev v. , no. 78145/01, \u00a7\u00a037, 10\u00a0May\u00a02007).",
