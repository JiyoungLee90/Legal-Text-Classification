The Court observes that it has already examined similar grievances in the past and has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on the ground, inter alia, that the legal aid system in Turkey fails to offer individuals substantial guarantees to protect them from arbitrariness (see, in particular, Bakan v.

In this respect, the Court would once again recall that pursuant to Article 469 of the CCP, decisions regarding legal aid are binding and are delivered on the basis of the case file, without hearing the applicants (Bakan, cited above, \u00a7 76). The Court further observes that the refusal of the applicants' legal aid request deprived them of the possibility of submitting their case before a tribunal. Finally, it also notes that, for the reasons explained above (see paragraph 22) the compensation case lodged following the death of Mr\u00a0Kaba, was significant for the applicants' personal situation and welfare.",
