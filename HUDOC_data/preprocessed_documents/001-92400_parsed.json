In the present case the applicant was held in the same detention facility uninterruptedly and his descriptions of the conditions of his detention, including extreme overcrowding, did not substantially vary from cell to cell. Adopting the same line of reasoning as in the above-mentioned cases, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s detention from 15 June 1998 to 25 April 2005 should be examined as a whole without dividing it into separate periods, and that the Government\u2019s objection should, therefore, be dismissed.",

It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim\u2019s behaviour (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). However, to fall under Article 3 of the Convention, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Vala\u0161inas v. Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, ECHR 2001-VIII). When a person is held in detention, the State must ensure that he is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7 102 and Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 94). When assessing conditions of detention, one must consider their cumulative effects as well as the applicant\u2019s specific allegations (see Dougoz v. , 6 March 2001, \u00a7 46, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 2001-II). The duration of detention is also a relevant factor.",

In particular, it has held that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time is incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0134; Nakhmanovich v.

Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 142).",

The appeals against the extension orders of 31\u00a0December 2002 and 31 March, 26 June, 25 September and 15 December 2003 were examined within the time-limits established in the domestic law. As regards the examination of the appeals filed against the decisions of 17\u00a0February, 21 June and 25 December 2003 and 2 February and 5 February 2004 refusing the applicant\u2019s release, as well as the appeal against the extension order of 19 February 2004, the Government submitted that their belated examination by the Supreme Court on 10 March 2005 did not entail any serious consequences for the applicant: the applications for release were submitted right after the examination of the appeals against the extension orders and contained no new arguments. The Government concluded that although there had been a breach of the formal requirements of the domestic law as regards the time-limits for the examination of the applicant\u2019s appeals, this had not amounted to a violation of his rights under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v. France, judgment of 23 November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 273-B, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12 December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series A no. 224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee. In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v. Poland, no. 27504/95, \u00a7 76, 4\u00a0October 2001).",

The applicant\u2019s four co-defendants had also filed numerous applications each, and the domestic court had to give them due consideration. In the course of the proceedings the applicant systematically complained about his health and asked for emergency assistance which resulted in the suspension and adjournment of the hearings. Following the medical check-ups the applicant was on each occasion found fit to participate in the hearings. On many occasions the examination was adjourned due to the absence of the applicant\u2019s representative. Besides, the applicant sought replacement of his representatives on five occasions, and the proceedings did not resume until the applicant\u2019s approval of the newly appointed representative. The Government concluded, therefore, that the length of the proceedings in the present case was mostly attributable to the conduct of the applicant and his co-defendants, and did not breach the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement set out in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

However, in the Court\u2019s view, the complexity of the case does not suffice, in itself, to account for the length of the proceedings. Moreover, the fact that the applicant was held in custody required particular diligence on the part of the courts dealing with the case to administer justice expeditiously (see Panchenko, cited above, \u00a7 133, and Kalashnikov, cited above, \u00a7 132).",

It further notes that on many occasions the hearings were adjourned because the applicant sought replacement of the legal-aid counsel assigned to him by the domestic authorities. In this connection, the Court observes that Article 6 does not require a person charged with a criminal offence to co-operate actively with the judicial authorities. In particular, applicants cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by national law in their defence (see Rokhlina, cited above, \u00a7 88, and Kalashnikov, cited above, \u00a7 129). As to the Government\u2019s argument about the failure of the applicant\u2019s representatives to appear before the trial court, the Court notes that throughout the trial the applicant was represented by legal-aid counsel appointed by the State. He therefore had little influence upon them and could not be held responsible for their absences. The Court accepts that the applicant was accountable for a certain delay resulting from his requests for adjournments in view of his allegedly poor health. However, this delay was negligible in view of the overall length of the proceedings.",
