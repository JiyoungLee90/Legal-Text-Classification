They explained that it had been decided at the Cabinet of Ministers\u2019 meeting of 2\u00a0February 2005 not to offer the applicant a friendly settlement within the meaning of Article 39 of the Convention, but to remedy her complaint directly by offering her a permanent residence permit.

It is true that, in its judgment in Pisano v.\u00a0Italy ([GC] (striking out), no. 36732/97, 24 October 2002), the Court examined this question separately from the question of the application of Article 37 \u00a7 1 (b), ruling that the applicant could continue to claim the status of \u201cvictim\u201d, while going on to decide that the matter had been resolved (loc. cit., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03839). However, the present application concerns the removal of a foreign national and her illegal residence within the national territory; in cases of this type, where the applicant\u2019s stay was regularised during the course of the Court\u2019s examination of the application, the Court has generally considered whether it should continue its examination under Article 34 of the Convention by reference precisely to the notion of \u201cvictim\u201d (see, for example, Maaouia v.\u00a0France (dec.), no. 39652/98, ECHR 1999II; Pan\u010denko v. Latvia (dec.), no. 40772/98, 28 October 1999; Mikheyeva v.\u00a0Latvia (dec.), no. 50029/99, 12 September 2002; Aristimu\u00f1o Mendizabal v.\u00a0France, (dec.), no. 51431/99, 21 June 2005; and Yildiz v.  (dec.), no. 40932/02, 13 October 2005). The Court considers that in the instant case the Government\u2019s objection should be examined under both provisions taken together, as a finding that the applicant has lost her \u201cvictim\u201d status within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention would prompt the Court to conclude that the matter has been resolved within the meaning of Article\u00a037 \u00a7 1 (b).",

As her daughter is an adult, and in the absence of specific elements of dependency going beyond the normal affective ties, the applicant can no longer rely on the existence of \u201cfamily life\u201d in relation to her daughter (see, in particular, the Kolosovskiy decision, cited above). The Court will therefore examine the applicant\u2019s complaint under the heading of her \u201cprivate\u201d life.",

Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, p. 16, \u00a7 33, and Soering v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 34, \u00a7\u00a087). Furthermore, while the chief object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life (see, for example, G\u00fcl v. Switzerland, judgment of 19 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, pp. 174175, \u00a7 38; Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no.\u00a031679/96, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2000I; and Mehemi (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 45). In other words, it is not enough for the host State to refrain from deporting the person concerned; it must also, by means of positive measures if necessary, afford him or her the opportunity to exercise the rights in question without interference.",

Granted, she is not of Latvian origin and has spent a significant proportion of her life in . However, the Court does not consider that circumstance to be decisive in the present case. Firstly, there is nothing to indicate that the applicant is entitled to obtain Russian or Georgian nationality; moreover, the Directorate itself appeared to acknowledge this in its letter, by inviting the applicant to provide documents certifying that she was not a citizen of either of these two countries and was not guaranteed the right to such citizenship (see paragraph 30 above). Secondly, it is not disputed that, in the period since 1984, the applicant has developed personal and social ties such that she can now be said to be sufficiently well integrated into Latvian society even if, as the Government contend, her level of Latvian is unsatisfactory (see the Slivenko judgment, cited above, \u00a7 124). The Court also notes that, until 1990, the applicant\u2019s officially registered residence was in ; however, she does not appear to have had genuine and stable ties to that country since then. In any event, it seems clear that the applicant has not established personal and social ties in any other country similar to those she has in Latvia (ibid., \u00a7 125).",

In that connection the Court reiterates that most of the similar cases it has examined under Article 8 of the Convention have related to situations in which the applicants had been deported after being convicted of serious criminal offences. By contrast, in the present case, no penalty, however slight, was imposed on the applicant; on the contrary, the prosecutor dealing with the case decided on 17 January 1994 not to institute criminal proceedings against her (see paragraph 16 above).",
