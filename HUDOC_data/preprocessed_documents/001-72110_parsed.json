He pointed out that the Government had not provided any examples from domestic practice showing how the applicant could have obtained redress either by way of prevention or compensation. The case of Yiallouros was a civil action where damages had been sought for the violation of constitutional rights between individuals and not between individuals and the State as in the instant case. With regard to the statement of claim relied on by the Government, the applicant stated that this was a pending case which has not been decided and thus could not be considered as case-law proving the existence of an effective remedy. The applicant also noted the absence of an operative legal framework or specific rule of civil procedure creating a particular mechanism for the lodging of actions for damages in respect of violations due to excessive length of proceedings.",

Italy, judgment of 25\u00a0June 1987, Series A no.\u00a0119, p. 15, \u00a7 37). In the present case, although the expenses claimed relate to the delay of the first instance court to deliver its judgment, the applicant was awarded legal expenses in respect of the domestic proceedings as part of the settlement reached with the defendants (see paragraph 14 above). It therefore rejects this part of the applicant\u2019s claims. As regards the costs and expenses incurred before the Court, regard being had to the information in its possession, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a01,500 covering costs for the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
