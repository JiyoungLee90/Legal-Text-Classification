The decisions taken in that meeting were thus unlawful.

For such interim orders the restriction that interim injunctions should not anticipate the outcome of the main proceedings did not apply. In the present case, it was necessary to maintain the status quo in the commercial register in order to prevent F.H. from suffering irreversible damage. F.H. could suffer such damage if the changes in question were made in the real property and commercial register as dispositions could then be taken for the stock corporation without his participation.",

Firstly, the right at stake in both the main and the injunction proceedings should be \u201ccivil\u201d within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 of the Convention (see, inter alia, K\u00f6nig v.\u00a0Germany, 28 June 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, Series A no. 27; Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v.

Secondly, the nature of the interim measure, its object and purpose as well as its effects on the right in question should be scrutinised. Whenever an interim measure can be considered effectively to determine the civil right or obligation at stake, notwithstanding the length of time it is in force, Article 6 will be applicable (Micallef, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08385; see also Udorovic v. Italy, no. 38532/02, \u00a7 36, 18 May 2010; Imobilije Marketing d.o.o. and Ivan Debeli\u0107 v.

The said decisions notably concerned the rights of F.H. and of the applicant to manage and represent the stock corporation. The Court considers that the dispute at issue between two individuals about the right to take decisions, as a majority shareholder, for a private-law stock corporation and to act as a representative for the latter, and thus to use the property in the corporation\u2019s shares, is \u201ccivil\u201d within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 of the Convention.",

What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (see De Cubber v. Belgium, 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 26, Series A no. 86; Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 98; and Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, \u00a7 106). The question of a lack of impartiality under the objective test may notably arise on functional grounds, where the judge\u2019s personal conduct is not at all impugned, but where, for instance, the exercise of different functions within the judicial process by the same person (see Piersack v. Belgium, 1 October 1982, \u00a7\u00a030\u00a0(b), Series A no. 53), or hierarchical or other links with another actor in the proceedings objectively justify misgivings as to the impartiality of the tribunal (see Kyprianou v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 121, ECHR\u00a02005XIII; and Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 97). Moreover, in order that the courts may inspire in the public the confidence which is indispensable, account must also be taken of questions of internal organisation (see Piersack, cited above, \u00a7 30 (d)). The existence of national procedures for ensuring impartiality, namely rules regulating the withdrawal of judges, is a relevant factor. Such rules manifest the national legislature\u2019s concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned (see Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 99).",
