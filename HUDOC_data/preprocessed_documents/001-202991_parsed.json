The arrears due to the applicant recovered from the centre by the Town Court had therefore constituted a debt to be paid from the State budget and not by the centre, which had not received the relevant funds from the budget. As regards the regional department of the State Treasury, the court found that it was not a proper defendant, suggesting that its authority did not extend to that of making the above-mentioned payments. Lastly, the court dismissed the part of the applicant\u2019s claim relating to the index-linking of the arrears and the compensation for non-pecuniary damage, stating that such payments were not provided by the 2004 Act.",

Furthermore, she submitted that the Government had not specified the date on which the amount of unpaid allowances had been equivalent to EUR 204. However, in 2002 (the end of the period during which the amount was not paid) UAH 2,244.30 had amounted to EUR\u00a0450.

Russia (dec.), no. 25551/05, ECHR 2010). The Court does not find any indication in the case file that the amount that the applicant sought to recover, which represented 30% of her monthly salary, was insignificant for her. Nor did the Government claim otherwise. Moreover, as noted by the applicant, the equivalent of the above amount in euros would have been much higher in 2002, had she received the allowance arrears on time (see paragraph 13 above). Indeed, the Court considers that the applicant cannot be blamed for the fact that after a lengthy period, during which the authorities failed to pay her the arrears that they owed, the exchange rate between the euro and the Ukrainian hryvnia has significantly changed and the relevant equivalent in euros has become much lower.

On the contrary, the Court of Appeal acknowledged the State\u2019s debt towards the applicant, in the amount claimed by her. Moreover, it stated that under domestic law the centre had the dual status of both a healthcare and an educational institution (see paragraph 7 above). That meant that the applicant was to be considered as an employee of an educational institution entitled to the seniority and recreation allowances. Lastly, the Court notes that it was never alleged by any of the domestic authorities that the applicant did not satisfy any of the stipulated conditions for receiving the allowances in question, that her status did not entitle her to those allowances, or that any legal conditions had changed in such a way that she failed to satisfy any of those conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Fedulov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 53068/08, \u00a7 71, 8 October 2019).

When speaking of \u201claw\u201d, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 requires the measure complained of to be based on adequately accessible and sufficiently precise domestic legal provisions. Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. Thus, the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements regarding the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary (see, for instance, Fedulov, cited above, \u00a7 75; and the authorities cited therein).",

At the same time, it did not rely on any legal provision that would have made the award of the allowances in question conditional on any budgetary transfers and that provided for any discretion on the part of the authorities to refuse that allowance in the event that the budgetary transfers were not made, or on any similar provision that could have formed a legal basis for such a decision (see, mutatis mutandis, Fedulov, cited above, \u00a7 76). Nor did it indicate any other legal avenue through which the applicant could recover the allowances to which she was entitled and which was acknowledged as being owed to her by the State. It is also noteworthy that in other decisions that it delivered, the Court of Appeal agreed with the Town Court to allow similar claims lodged by other employees against the centre and to order that it was for the latter to pay them the allowance arrears in question (see paragraph\u00a010 above).",

It further reiterates that neither the complexity of the State budgetary system, nor a lack of funds or other resources can relieve the State of its relevant obligations under the Convention. It is for the Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that the relevant authorities can meet their obligations in this regard (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2009).",

This conclusion makes it unnecessary for it to ascertain whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community on the one hand, and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights on the other (see, among other authorities, Grudi\u0107 v.

Thus, in its judgment of 29 April 2011 the Court of Appeal acknowledged the arrears in the amount of UAH 2,244.30 (see paragraph 7 above), which was the equivalent of EUR\u00a0188 at the time of adoption of that judgment. The Court therefore accepts that there is a causal link between this amount and the violation found and awards it to the applicant. As to the claimed inflation losses, the Court notes that the calculation submitted by the applicant includes the period starting from 2002, even though the debt owed to the applicant was acknowledged \u2013 albeit not awarded \u2013 only on 29\u00a0April 2011. Nevertheless, it is clear that the applicant must have incurred some inflation losses in the period between 2011 and 2018.
