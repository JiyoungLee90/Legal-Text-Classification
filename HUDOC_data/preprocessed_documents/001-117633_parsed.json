The applicant was subsequently interrogated by the police the following day, namely on 17 January 2004. During his questioning, he confessed to having been involved in the murder of \u0130.G. He also participated in the reconstruction of events during which he made a number of self-incriminating statements. On the same day at 5.30 p.m. he was once again examined by a doctor, who did not report any signs of ill-treatment. At this point the Court notes once again that at no stage of the domestic proceedings or during the  proceedings has the applicant challenged the veracity of these reports or alleged that the doctors who issued them failed to examine his injuries (see paragraph 33 above). Although the medical report drawn up two days after his detention in police custody indicated several injuries on the applicant\u2019s back, it was noted that the bruises had been caused 24 to 48 hours prior to the examination. The Court has found above that owing to the procedural shortcomings in the domestic investigation, the exact timing of these injuries remains undetermined. Nevertheless, based on the information in the case file it cannot be concluded that the applicant\u2019s police statement was extracted under duress (see paragraph 34 above).",
