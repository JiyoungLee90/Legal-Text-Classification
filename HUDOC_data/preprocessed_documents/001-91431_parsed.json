No information had been obtained by the investigation about special operations in Gekhi on that day. They also referred to some other criminal investigations where gangs in  had been equipped with camouflage uniforms, weapons and forged documents belonging to members of the security forces. Finally, in their submissions of May 2008 the Government questioned the credibility and accuracy of the applicants\u2019 statements submitted to the Court and to the investigation. They drew attention to the fact that the fourth applicant had submitted to the Court that the men who had entered their room had pushed her against the wall, while she did not give this information to the investigation.

Russia, no. 69481/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0103-109, 27 July 2006). The Court also notes that the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Ireland v. the , cited above, pp. 64-65, \u00a7 161). In view of this and bearing in mind the principles referred to above, the Court finds that it can draw inferences from the Government\u2019s conduct in respect of the well-foundedness of the applicants\u2019 allegations. The Court will thus proceed to examine crucial elements in the present case that should be taken into account when deciding whether the applicants\u2019 relative can be presumed dead and whether his death can be attributed to the authorities.",

Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor\u2019s office and the other law-enforcement authorities after the news of his detention had been communicated to them by the applicants contributed significantly to the likelihood of the disappearance, as no necessary steps were taken in the crucial first days and weeks after the arrest.
