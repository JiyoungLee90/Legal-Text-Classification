The case originated in two applications (nos. 47939/11 and 56192/11) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Serbian nationals, Mr Branko Rakić (“the first applicant”) and Mr Dragan Sarvan (“the second applicant”), on 10 May 2011 and 27 April 2011 respectively.

The debtor, which operated as a socially-owned company, was privatised on 27 December 2002.
On 17 July 2007 the privatisation was annulled because the buyer in question had failed to fulfil his contractual obligations.
Following the annulment of the debtor’s privatisation the State owned 58.18% of shares in the company.
On 11 December 2008 the State sold its shares to a private company.
On 12 July 2010 the Užice Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. As a result, all of the ongoing enforcement proceedings against the debtor were stayed.
The applicants duly reported their respective claims based on the above-mentioned judgments to the insolvency administration.
On 8 June 2011 the Commercial Court recognized a part of the applicants’ claims.
In March 2014 and July 2014 some of the judgments at issue had been partially enforced in the insolvency proceedings.
The insolvency proceedings are still ongoing.
