Openings between the metal bars, measuring 20 square centimetres between the external lattices and 16 square centimetres between the internal lattices, brought natural light in the cells. According to the applicant, the lighting was clearly insufficient, as the metal bars blocked access to natural light and fresh air. The applicant claimed that insufficient lighting had impaired his eyesight. His condition was further exacerbated by the fact that he suffered from myopathy and increased intraocular pressure possibly coupled with glaucoma. He experienced severe headaches and became extremely tired if he attempted to work or read. The Government submitted that the size, location and number of windows allowed inmates to read and work in natural lighting. The cells were constantly lit with electric incandescent lighting: 100-watt bulbs during the daytime and 40-watt bulbs at night.

Prison doctors who had examined the applicant on two occasions recommended that the applicant should be provided with a special board which could be placed under the mattress to provide support for his back. The recommendation was not fulfilled. As a result the applicant suffered from severe back pain.

It reiterates that for a remedy to be considered effective it should be capable of providing redress for the complaint. That means that the powers and procedural guarantees possessed by an authority, which have been relied on by the Government as a remedy, are relevant in determining whether the remedy is effective. It was undisputed by the parties that an ombudsman lacked the power to render a legally binding decision.

The remedy can be either preventive or compensatory in nature (see, among other authorities, Koval v. , no.\u00a065550/01, \u00a7\u00a094, 19 October 2006). The Court notes that the Government did not explain how a \u201crepresentation\u201d by a prosecutor could have offered the aforementioned preventive or compensatory redress or both for allegations of the conditions of detention which had been contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Ostrovar v.

Croatia, no. 51585/99, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR 2001-VIII, and Gibas v.\u00a0Poland, no. 24559/94, Commission decision of 6 September 1995, Decisions and Reports 82, pp.\u00a076 and 82). The same logic is applicable in the present case. It was undisputed by the parties that under Russian law a prosecutor is not required to hear the complainant and the ensuing proceedings are entirely a matter between the supervising prosecutor and the supervised body. The complainant is not a party to any proceedings and is entitled only to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body has dealt with his complaint. It follows that a complaint to a prosecutor does not give the person employing it a personal right to the exercise by the State of its supervisory powers, and that such a complaint does not therefore constitute an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention.",

The Government did not make any reference to any legal norm on the possibility of lodging an action seeking damages for treatment already suffered as a result of the conditions of detention, or on the possibility of such an action being preventive of further sufferings. At the same time, without providing copies of respective court judgments, the Government supplied three examples from domestic practice showing that by using the means in question it was possible for the applicant to obtain compensation for damage. In this connection, the Court observes that in the absence of documents supporting the Government\u2019s assertion, it is unable to identify the relevance of the impugned judgments to the issue of the effectiveness of an action for damages as a remedy in the circumstances of the present case. Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s view, the three cases cited by the Government do not suffice to show the existence of settled domestic practice that would prove the effectiveness of the remedy (see, for a similar approach, Horvat, cited above, \u00a7 44).",

As it follows from the Government\u2019s submissions, the domestic court annulled the facility administration\u2019s refusal on the ground that it did not comply with the legal norms. At the same time in the two other cases in which the applicant attempted to challenge the facility administration\u2019s actions, the courts, in dismissing the applicant\u2019s complaints, explicitly relied on the fact that the impugned limitations on the applicant\u2019s rights were established legally (see paragraph 72 above). The approach adopted by the Russian courts seems unduly formalistic. It allows a large number of cases, such as the applicant\u2019s, where the conditions of detention result from legal regulations, to be dismissed. Thus, as a result of that stance of the courts, an action to a court offers no prospect of success and could be considered theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective in the sense of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

In those cases applicants usually disposed of less than three sq. m of personal space (see, for example, Kantyrev v. , no.\u00a037213/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-51, 21\u00a0June 2007; Andrey Frolov v. , no. 205/02, \u00a7\u00a7 47-49, 29\u00a0March 2007; Mayzit v. , no.\u00a063378/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 20 January 2005; and Labzov v.\u00a0, no.\u00a062208/00, \u00a7\u00a044, 16 June 2005). By contrast, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court noted other aspects of physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the opportunity to use the toilet in private, availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue \u2013 measuring in the range of three to four square metres per inmate \u2013 the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, \u00a7 84, 12 June 2008; Babushkin v.\u00a0, no.\u00a067253/01, \u00a7\u00a044, 18\u00a0October 2007; Trepashkin v. , no.\u00a036898/03, \u00a7\u00a094, 19\u00a0July 2007; and Peers v. , no.\u00a028524/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-72, ECHR 2001III).",

Although there was no allegation of overcrowding beyond the design capacity or of a shortage of sleeping places (see, by contrast, Grishin v. , no.\u00a030983/02, \u00a7\u00a089, 15\u00a0November 2007, and Kalashnikov v. , no.\u00a047095/99, \u00a7\u00a097, ECHR 2002VI), the conditions in the detention facility were nevertheless extremely cramped. Although the Court does not lose sight of the fact that for the first two weeks of the detention the applicant was held alone in a 9.5-sq.-m cell and that for the remaining period he was detained together with one or two detainees in cells measuring 9.2 or 11.5 sq. m., thus having 4.1 to 3.8 sq. m. of the living area, the Court is particularly mindful of the fact that since 27\u00a0September 2007 he has been afforded less than four square metres of living space. Furthermore, part of the cell surface was occupied by one or two metal two-tier bunks serving as beds for the occupants. The rest of the space was taken up by a wooden desk and bench (in a smaller cell), a tap and a cubicle in which a lavatory pan was situated. As it appears from the black and white photos of the cells submitted by the Government, that arrangement left inmates with literally no free space in which they could move.",

In this connection, the Court does not overlook the fact that the applicant was prescribed physical exercise by a prison doctor to reduce his back pain.",

The Court is not convinced that the opening of a little casement could bring in fresh air. It appears that the cells were ventilated through a ventilation shaft. However, as it appears from the documents submitted by the Government, the applicant did not have a portable fan. It therefore appears that for more than two years the applicant had to spend a considerable part of each day practically confined to his bed in a cell with poor ventilation and no window in the proper sense of the word (compare Peers, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075).",

The Court considers that those factors also had a debilitating effect on the applicant (see Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, \u00a7\u00a0107, 28 March 2006). In addition, the Court observes that the applicant was diagnosed with several serious diseases while in detention. Although this fact in itself does not imply a violation of Article 3, given, in particular, the fact that the applicant did not argue that the diseases had been acquired during the detention and the fact that he received adequate treatment and that his condition was considered to be stable or even satisfactory, the Court finds that these aspects are relevant in addition to other factors of the conditions of detention, to show that the aggravating impact which these conditions had on the applicant went beyond the threshold tolerated by Article 3 of the Convention (see Alver v. Estonia, no. 64812/01, \u00a7 54, 8\u00a0November 2005, with further references; Novoselov v. Russia, no. 66460/01, \u00a7 44, 2 June 2005; and, mutatis mutandis, Ostrovar v.

It thus appears that the domestic authorities had sufficient time to take statements from witnesses in a manner which could have excluded any doubt as to their veracity and would have eliminated the necessity to continue the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty on that ground (see, for similar reasoning, Solovyev v. Russia, no. 2708/02, \u00a7 115, 24 May 2007). The Court therefore considers that, having failed to act diligently, the national authorities were not entitled to regard the circumstances of the case as justification for using the risk of collusion as a further ground for the applicant\u2019s detention.",

Furthermore, the Court does not share the national authorities\u2019 opinion that in a situation when all charges against the applicant, save for one, were brought against him in respect of his actions as the mayor of  and he was suspended from that position, there was a real danger of the applicant committing new offences.",

In exceptional circumstances this factor may therefore be taken into account for the purposes of the Convention, in any event in so far as domestic law recognises the notion of disturbance to public order caused by an offence. However, this ground can be regarded as relevant and sufficient only provided that it is based on facts capable of showing that the accused\u2019s release would actually disturb public order. In addition detention will continue to be legitimate only if public order remains actually threatened; its continuation cannot be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 51).",

Apart from the fact that Russian law does not list the notion of disturbance to public order among permissible grounds for detention of accused persons, the Court notes that the Government relied on the alleged danger to public order from a purely abstract point of view, relying solely on the gravity of the offences allegedly committed by the applicant. They did not provide any evidence or indicate any instance which could show that the applicant\u2019s release could have posed an actual danger to public order.",

Estonia, no. 55939/00, \u00a7 64, 15\u00a0February 2005, and Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 83, 21\u00a0December 2000). During the entire period under consideration the authorities did not consider the possibility of ensuring the applicant\u2019s attendance by the use of other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d \u2013 such as a written undertaking or bail \u2013 which are expressly provided for by Russian law to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings. In this connection, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant offered a guarantee by the Archbishop of Tomsk Region to ensure his release. However, that guarantee was rejected without due consideration (see paragraph 33 above). Furthermore, the Court finds it particularly striking that the applicant was kept in custody for nine months, from September 2007 to June 2008, for the sole purpose of studying the case file. However, at no point did either the Regional Court or the Supreme Court, which examined the issue of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention during that period, consider having recourse to such alternative measures or, at the very minimum, seek to explain in their decisions why such alternatives would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course.",

When such reasons do prevail, the amount of the bail must be \u201cassessed principally in relation to the person concerned, his assets... in other words to the degree of confidence that is possible that the prospect of loss of security in the event of his non-appearance at a trial will act as a sufficient deterrent to dispel any wish on his part to abscond\u201d (see Neumeister v.
