Certain other rights and interests constituting assets, for instance debts, can also be regarded as \u201cproperty rights\u201d, and thus \u201cpossessions\u201d for the purposes of this provision. The issue that needs to be examined is whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, conferred on the applicant an entitlement to a substantive interest protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Broniowski v. Poland (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a031443/96, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2002X).",

However, once a legal provision is in force which provides for the payment of certain benefits and any conditions stipulated have been met, the authorities cannot deliberately refuse their payment while the legal provision remains in force (see Kechko v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 23).",

The subsistence payment in question was payable with reference to a single, objective condition \u2013 employment as an active soldier or police officer. As the applicant had fulfilled this condition, he can be said to have had a reasonable expectation, if not a right, to receive the payment in question. It is not the Court's task to replace the domestic authorities in the interpretation of domestic law. However, in the instant case the domestic courts relied in their decisions on the fact that the Budget Act 2000 had not foreseen expenditure for the payments payable under the applicable Presidential Decree, and therefore held that the applicant had no entitlement to such payments during the impugned period under the Budgetary System Act. It therefore appears that the domestic courts ignored the provisions of Section 28 of the Budgetary System Act, which prohibited the annual State Budget Acts from introducing changes to other legislation without the latter having been changed first (see respectively paragraphs 9 and 12 above). Furthermore, the Court does not accept the Government's budgetary argument, as it is not open to a State authority to cite a lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring its obligations (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 35). Therefore, the ultimate denial by the domestic authorities of the applicant's entitlement to this benefit for the period in question appears to be arbitrary and not based on the law.",
