On 15 June 2001 a new Article 239-1 entered into force which established that the period of detention during the trial could not generally exceed six months from the date on which the court received the file. However, if there was evidence to show that the defendant's release might impede the thorough, complete and objective examination of the case, a court could \u2013 of its own motion or following a request by a prosecutor \u2013 extend the detention by no longer than three months. These provisions did not apply to defendants charged with particularly serious criminal offences. The new CCrP provides that the term of detention during the trial is calculated from the date on which the court received the file up to the date on which the judgment is given. The period of detention during the trial may not normally exceed six months, but if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences, the trial court may approve one or more extensions of no longer than three months each (Article 255 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and\u00a03).",

In the Government's view, most of the injuries had been inflicted by Ts., that is before the applicant had been taken into police custody. As regards the incident at the police station, the Government noted that altercations between inmates were very common in all member States of the Council of Europe and could not be ruled out completely despite the effectiveness of the control and security measures employed. Nevertheless, the authorities had taken the measures necessary to protect the applicant's life and health given that the fight between him and the other detainees had been promptly stopped by the police officer on duty. They further reasoned that the injuries the applicant had sustained had not been sufficiently serious to attain \u201ca minimum level of severity\u201d. Nor could they have amounted to \u201cinhuman and degrading\u201d treatment.

In particular, her alleged kicks and punches could not have left scratches on his body, for the simple reason that he had had several layers of winter clothes on him. As regards the alleged fight between him and other persons detained at the police station, the applicant noted that the Russian authorities had failed to identify the participants in the fight and those allegations had been made only by two police officers. None of the persons detained at the police station had witnessed the fight. Lastly, the applicant submitted that the authorities had failed to carry out an effective investigation into his complaint about the ill-treatment. At the early stages of the proceedings, the investigator had ignored his complaint. When the criminal case had been opened, the authorities had done nothing to examine his injuries and to determine their origin. The forensic medical examination had taken place approximately ten months after the events in question. The witnesses had not been questioned promptly either. The investigation had not been thorough. The case had been closed and reopened on numerous occasions.

In particular, it has held that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time is incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no.\u00a06847/02, \u00a7\u00a0134, 8\u00a0November 2005; Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 2\u00a0March 2006; and Sta\u0161aitis v. Lithuania, no. 47679/99, \u00a7 67, 21 March 2002). Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 142).",

Germany, 27\u00a0June 1968, \u00a7\u00a09, Series A no. 7, and Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0145 and\u00a0147). In view of the essential link between Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and paragraph 1 (c) of that Article, a person convicted at first instance cannot be regarded as being detained \u201cfor the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence\u201d, but is in the position provided for by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), which authorises deprivation of liberty \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d (see Panchenko v. Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7\u00a7 91 and 93, 8 February 2005, with further references). It follows that the applicant's detention from 26\u00a0August 2002, the date of his original first-instance conviction, to 29\u00a0October 2002, the date on which that conviction was quashed on appeal and his case was remitted for a new trial, cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3.

In this connection the Court reiterates that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Panchenko, cited above \u00a7 102; Ilijkov v. , no. 33977/96, \u00a7 81, 26 July 2001; and Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207). This is particularly true in the Russian legal system, where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0180). In the instant case, beyond two references to the possibility that the applicant might abscond or reoffend in the two initial detention orders (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above), the domestic authorities did not mention any concrete facts corroborating the detention orders.",

It follows from the court orders authorising the applicant's pre-trial detention that the gravity of the charges carried such a preponderant weight that no other circumstances could have secured his release. The Court reiterates that any system of mandatory detention pending trial is incompatible per se with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it being incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish and demonstrate the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005, with further references). In the instant case the domestic authorities did not mention any concrete facts corroborating the detention orders.",

In that context, the Court would emphasise that under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 the authorities are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring an accused's appearance at trial when deciding whether he or she should be released or detained. Indeed, the provision proclaims not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\u201d but also lays down that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 183, and Dolgova v. Russia, no.\u00a011886/05, \u00a7\u00a047, 2 March 2006). In the Court's view, the authorities should either have considered having recourse to such alternative measures or should at the very least have explained in their decisions why such alternatives would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course. This failure is made all the more inexplicable by the fact that since 1 July 2002 the Code of Criminal Procedure has expressly required the domestic courts to consider less restrictive \u201cpreventive measures\u201d as an alternative to custody (see paragraph 61 above).",

The trial court scheduled and held hearings at regular intervals without undue delay and cannot be said to have remained inactive. However, most of the court hearings had to be adjourned because of the witnesses' failure to appear. During the second trial, which lasted approximately a year and a half, the court had to adjourn eight out of nineteen hearings scheduled. During the third trial, which lasted approximately a year and eight months, thirteen out of twenty-seven hearings were adjourned for the same reason. The Court discerns no indication in the case file that the trial court availed itself of the measures existing under national law to discipline the absent witnesses and obtain their attendance, in order to ensure that the case was heard within a reasonable time (see Zementova v. Russia, no.\u00a0942/02, \u00a7\u00a070, 27\u00a0September 2007; Sidorenko v.

The Court therefore finds that the delay occasioned by the witnesses' failure to attend hearings and the trial court's failure to ensure their attendance is attributable to the State.",
