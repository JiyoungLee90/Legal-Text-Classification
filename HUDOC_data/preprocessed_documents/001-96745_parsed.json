As to the second set of proceedings, concerning the question of whether the applicant could bring a fresh claim for compensation against the Norwegian insurance company, the Court notes that the domestic courts were called upon to examine a procedural dispute over the legal forum where the applicant could present his civil claim, that is, a claim for compensation for his injuries. The dispute was genuine and serious and the result of the proceedings was directly decisive for the exercise of the applicant\u2019s pecuniary right at issue.

Italy, 26\u00a0September\u00a01996, \u00a7 22-24, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV; and Bhandari v. the , no. 42341/04, \u00a7 17, 2 October 2007). The Court does not subscribe to the applicant\u2019s view that, in this case, the two sets of proceedings should be considered in toto, as his claims were directed at two separate defendants, whose alleged liability arose from different foundations. Moreover, the second set of proceedings clearly concerned a procedural question of whether the two sets of proceedings could be joined for the purpose of seeking compensation from two rather than just one defendant.

The Court reiterates that when determining the period to be taken into account, it has regard to its case-law according to which in civil proceedings, the \u201creasonable time\u201d begins at the moment the action was instituted before the tribunal (for example, Erkner and Hofauer v. Austria, 23 April 1987, \u00a7 64, Series A no. 117). While it is conceivable that in certain circumstances the period might begin earlier (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 18), this is exceptional and has been accepted where, for example, certain preliminary steps were a necessary preamble to the proceedings (see K. v. , no. 38805/97, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2004VIII; and Blake v. the United Kingdom, no. 68890/01, \u00a7 40, 26 September 2006). The proceedings before an administrative body are to be included when calculating the length of the civil proceedings for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 if, under the national law, an applicant has to exhaust a preliminary administrative procedure before having recourse to a court (see, for example, K\u00f6nig v. , 28 June 1978, \u00a7 98, Series A no. 27).",

[GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2007IV; K\u00f6nig v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 98; Erkner and Hofauer v.
