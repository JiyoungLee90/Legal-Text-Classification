Another police officer who had also been on duty on 14\u00a0June 2011, L.P., was interviewed on 9 February 2013. He confirmed that the applicant had been arrested sometime between 10 and 11 p.m. on 14\u00a0June 2011. He claimed to have seen the applicant being brought to the department and beaten between 11.30 p.m. and midnight. Although he identified the police officers involved by name, he said that he could not watch the applicant being ill-treated and had left the department to go on patrol. The same police officers were named by a third police officer, L.G., in his statement of 5 February 2013. Although he confirmed the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s being escorted to the police department, he claimed that he had not looked at his face and thus did not know whether he had had any injuries.",

In the proceedings before the Court, they referred to the note made in the report on the applicant\u2019s arrest and personal search, as well as his initial incriminatory statement in which he claimed to have sustained those injuries prior to his arrest. Leaving aside the fact that the above two documents were compiled in the absence of a lawyer and, as alleged by the applicant, while he was under serious physical and psychological pressure, the Court considers that they are not sufficient to explain the multiple injuries (including the armpit burns) that were observed on the applicant\u2019s head, face and body, and his head injury (see paragraphs 3, 4 5, 8, 11, and 13 above). In their submissions, the Government also noted that the applicant had a tendency to self-harm. In the absence of any evidence, the Court is not prepared to accept this argument either.

There are also other relevant factors corroborating his story. In addition to the significant amount of medical evidence (see paragraphs 3, 4 5, 8, 11, and 13 above), the Court notes the statements of the three police officers which partly supported the applicant\u2019s version of events (see paragraph 25 above). Evidence given by the applicant\u2019s neighbour and a friend is also of relevance, at least as far the timing of the applicant\u2019s de facto arrest is concerned (see paragraphs 9 and 22 above). In the Court\u2019s view, such evidence also excludes possible speculation that the applicant sustained those injuries prior to his arrest (ibid.). In such circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s account is sufficiently persuasive, and that his allegations under this Article have been established beyond \u201creasonable doubt\u201d. The Government, as already concluded above, failed to provide the Court with their own convincing version of the events (see paragraph 45 above). It remains to be ascertained whether the treatment to which he was subjected infringed his rights under Article 3 of the Convention.",

These injuries were described in the medical records which were available to the investigating authorities. As the Court has already found above, the Government failed to provide a plausible explanation of how these injuries had been caused. Taken cumulatively with the evidence in the case file and the applicant\u2019s detailed and consistent description of the ill-treatment he complained of, the Court finds that those injuries were the result of illtreatment to which the applicant was subjected while he was under police control. The Court thus concludes that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention under its substantive limb as well.",
