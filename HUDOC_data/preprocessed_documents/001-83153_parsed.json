In this connection the Court notes that the applicant now has an opportunity to request the reopening of the proceedings in accordance with section 428(a) of the Civil Procedure Act, which would allow for a fresh examination of her claim. In these circumstances the Court considers that these complaints are premature and should be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",
