The Ministry further stressed that the applicant had been invited several times to provide a valid travel document and he had promised to contact the embassy of Kosovo in this connection but had failed to do so. Accordingly, in the Ministry\u2019s view, his arguments that he had not been a typical alien and that the relevant authorities had formalistically applied the relevant law had been misplaced. Moreover, there was a possibility for him to obtain a temporary travel document in order to travel to his country of origin so as to obtain a valid travel document.",

He contended that he had been a national of the SFRY and that he had had a registered residence in Novska since he had arrived there in 1979, which had been erased at a later stage. He also relied on his available birth certificate showing that he did not have any citizenship (see paragraph 58 below). He also reiterated his complaints of an unjustified infringement of his Article 8 rights by a decision of the administrative authorities and a breach of Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12. On 21 April 2017 the Zagreb Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s administrative action endorsing the reasoning of the Ministry\u2019s decision. The applicant challenged these findings before the High Administrative Court (Visoki upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) and the proceedings are still pending.",

By these extensions of the temporary residence status on humanitarian grounds the applicant was also required to provide a valid travel document in order to regularise his further stay (see paragraphs 55-56 above).

The UNHCR submitted that following the disintegration of the SFRY, all successor States had used the principle of continuity of their internal (within each republic) citizenship in the creation of their new nationality laws. As a result, citizenship of a republic had become the central mechanism for the emerging States to grant nationality. The SFRY successor States, including Croatia, had chosen to grant nationality based upon the list of names in the nationality registers of those republics, which had had a number of consequences. In particular, although in principle statelessness should have been avoided for all former SFRY citizens because they had been presumed to be in possession of citizenship of at least one of the former republics of the SFRY, this approach had had serious repercussions for thousands of people. First of all, it had been incorrect to assume that all former SFRY citizens had possessed and could have proved citizenship of the republic in which they resided. One of the reasons for this is that some of them had not been registered as citizens in one of the republics of the SFRY to which they (or their parents) had moved. The UNHCR\u2019s experience in the region had showed that owing to variations in the registration of citizenship of each republic across the six republics since 1945, it had not always been possible to obtain confirmation of citizenship of a particular republic. Those people who had been unable to prove their citizenship of a republic were left stateless because they had not been able to acquire citizenship of any of the successor States of the SFRY.",

The second group comprised those who had been habitually residing in the former Socialist Republic of Croatia but whose residence had never been registered. The residence of the latter group of persons had not been registered notably owing to the lack of civil registration or identity documents that had been necessary to do so. Procedures to regularise residence and subsequently citizenship status for non-ethnic Croats had been introduced in 1991 but had proven ineffective owing to a lack of adequate public information and legal advice about the administrative procedures. This had disproportionately affected vulnerable groups, particularly minority groups from other republics. Owing to the fact that they had been unable to meet onerous administrative burdens such as documentary requirements relating to proof of past residence, and had been unable to pay high application fees, many of these minorities had not been able to regularise their residence status in Croatia. Thus, many had been excluded from acquiring Croatian citizenship or that of another successor State of the SFRY and remained stateless.",

During the existence of the former SFRY, which consisted of several republics including at the time Croatia, the applicant\u2019s residence status in Novska was regularised through the recognition of the effects of his domicile in Kosovo and the refugee status granted to his parents by the local authorities there.

In such cases, the Court is not empowered to rule on whether the individual concerned should be granted one particular legal status rather than another, that choice being a matter for the domestic authorities alone (see Ramadan v.

Moreover, although nominally available to him, the applicant\u2019s prospect of finding employment is de facto hampered without a regularisation of his residence status. He is therefore unemployed and survives by helping out on the farms in the Novska area (see paragraphs 43 and 48 above), which undoubtedly adversely affects the prospect of him securing normal health insurance or pension rights (see paragraph 99 above).

It first and foremost takes into consideration the aboveobserved fact that the applicant\u2019s position cannot simply be considered to be on a par with that of other potential immigrants seeking to regularise their residence status in Croatia (see paragraph 116 above). The applicant was born in 1962 in the former SFRY as the child of an Albanian refugee couple that lawfully resided in that country. As Croatia was at the time part of the SFRY, the applicant came to live in Novska in 1979 where he settled and lived under the temporary residence regime provided by the authorities in Kosovo related to his status of an Albanian refugee which was recognised throughout the former SFRY. At the same time, according to a birth certificate issued in 1987, the applicant did not have any nationality (see paragraph 24 above). Although the applicant never changed his place of residence or any other feature of his personal status his already complex residence status was made even more convoluted by the break-up of the former SFRY, complex and disturbed succession process and the ensuing war. It was in these circumstances that the applicant, despite having lived in Croatia for almost forty years, found himself in the above-noted uncertainty of his residence status (see paragraph 126 above). In this sense, although the applicant was not subject to a process of erasure of his residence status (see paragraph 114 above), the applicant\u2019s case has some resemblance to the cases of applicants in Kuri\u0107 and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 357-59) who, following the succession of the republics of the former SFRY, found themselves in a situation in which they were unable to regularise their residence status.",

He has no other family or relatives in another country with whom he maintains contact nor was it ever established during the domestic proceedings that the applicant had any link with Albania or any other country. In fact, the applicant only in 1992 mentioned a brother who lived in Albania, but he did not even know where that brother lived (see paragraph 21 above). Thereafter the applicant never mentioned that brother and the information obtained by the police during the domestic proceedings did not establish that the applicant had maintained any links with his brother or anybody else in another country.",

In particular, following the dissolution of the SFRY and the ensuing war, the applicant was recruited to perform a mandatory civil service in Novska. His residence status was afterwards regularised only in the period between 1993 and 1997 (see paragraph 27 above) and in the period between 2011 and 2014 (see paragraph 45 above) and then again since September 2015 until present (see paragraphs 55-56 above). At the same time, almost twenty-seven years have passed since Croatia declared independence and the applicant has been living in the same place of residence ever since. Moreover, although he was prosecuted for minor offences related to the status of aliens (see paragraph\u00a048 above), the domestic authorities never instituted any proceedings related to the removal of unlawful aliens as provided under the relevant domestic law.",

The only observation in that connection was made in the Novska police report of 1995 suggesting that the applicant had been socialising with individuals of similar characteristics with a tendency to get involved in trading of grey-market goods (see paragraph 29 above). However, the Court observes that this observation is unsubstantiated in any respect and that the report at issue contains a number of contradictions. For instance, it indicates that the applicant never tried to regularise his residence status in Croatia, which is not true in view of the fact that for a while in 1988 he had a regularised residence in Croatia (see paragraph 10 above). It also suggests that the applicant disappeared from his place of residence during the war in Croatia, which contradicts evidence showing that the applicant was engaged in mandatory civilian service in that period (see paragraph 17 above). It is also not clear what was meant by the suggestion that the applicant had an Albanian passport issued in Kosovo as obviously the local authorities in Kosovo could not have issued him with an Albanian passport and in any event the birth certificates issued by those authorities in 1987 and 2009 do not indicate that the applicant had Albanian nationality, which would have been a precondition for him obtaining an Albanian passport. Lastly and most importantly, the Court notes that the contents of the 1995 report were never mentioned or supported by any of the police or intelligence agency\u2019s reports on the applicant\u2019s personal situation.",

In making that assessment, the Court finds it important to note that it cannot subscribe to the Government\u2019s arguments which rely on the proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s applications for Croatian citizenship. As explained in the Kuri\u0107 and Others case (cited above, \u00a7 357), an alien lawfully residing in a country may wish to continue living in that country without necessarily acquiring its citizenship. Indeed, the applicant\u2019s complaint does not concern the impossibility for him to obtain Croatian citizenship but the general impossibility to regularise his residence status in Croatia. The Court is therefore not called upon to examine whether the applicant should be granted Croatian citizenship but rather whether, if he had chosen not to become Croatian citizen or had failed to do so, he would have an effective possibility to regularise his residence status allowing him to normally lead his private life in Croatia (compare Kuri\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 357-59).",

This period of employment was interrupted only for a period of some fifteen days (between 15 July and 1\u00a0August 1987). Although it was not explicitly mentioned in the decisions of the domestic authorities, the Court considers that if this interruption of the applicant\u2019s employment had led to the consideration that he did not have an uninterrupted employment in Croatia for three years, such a position, although formally correct, in view of all the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances, appears to have been overly formalistic and not reflective of the reality of the situation. Moreover, it is noted that the applicant provided assurance that he would be employed by the same employer if he managed to regularise his residence status (see paragraph 43 above).",

It has already been noted above that in order to prolong the stay on humanitarian grounds, the applicant needs either a valid travel document or the Ministry, upon its discretion, can give consent for the extension of the stay on humanitarian grounds even in the absence of a valid travel document (see paragraphs 81-82 above).",

However, as the applicant\u2019s case shows, in practice this is of a limited relevance as in order to be able to apply for permanent residence, a stateless person would need to have a five-year uninterrupted temporary residence in Croatia for which a valid travel document is needed. Thus, in reality, contrary to the principles flowing from the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons (see paragraph 65 above), stateless individuals, such as the applicant, are required to fulfil requirements which by the virtue of their status they are unable to fulfil.",

As there was no suggestion that the applicant had ever had Kosovo nationality, it is difficult to understand the Croatian authorities\u2019 insistence on the fact that the applicant should obtain a travel document from the authorities in Kosovo (see paragraph 53 above). It is also noted in this connection that despite the applicant\u2019s statelessness, which was apparent from the relevant documents available to the Croatian authorities, they never considered taking the relevant measures, such as providing administrative assistance to facilitate the applicant\u2019s contact with the authorities of another country, to resolve the applicant\u2019s situation, as provided in the international documents to which Croatia is a party (see paragraph 65 above; see also paragraph 63 above).",

Indeed, without providing any reasons, the Ministry refused to allow the extension of the applicant\u2019s temporary residence in July 2014 (see paragraph 49 above) whereas, also without providing any reasons, the Ministry gave its consent for the extension of the applicant\u2019s temporary stay in September 2015 and October 2016 (see paragraphs 55-56 above). The situation was thus created in which the period of the applicant\u2019s regularised stay between July 2011 and August 2014 was interrupted. This therefore delays his prospect of applying for permanent residence permit for a future period in which he would need to have five years of uninterrupted residence on humanitarian grounds subject to the Ministry\u2019s discretion, which has not been exercised consistently and which appears to takes no account of the special features of the applicant\u2019s case and his private-life situation.",

It thereby made no assessment of the applicant\u2019s specific private life situation and the circumstances of his stay in Croatia from the perspective of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 54 above). In any case, although the applicant has challenged that ruling before the High Administrative Court, it should be noted that, even in the event of a positive ruling, it is uncertain, in view of the above considerations related to the manner in which the Ministry exercised its discretion in the applicant\u2019s case, whether it would have any real effect on the applicant\u2019s prospect of effectively regularising his residence status in Croatia.",
