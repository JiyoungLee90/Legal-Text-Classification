NGOs were told that prisoners had to pay the prison administration to see a medical doctor or to get medical treatment, or to send letters or make phone calls to their families, that they were often locked up in punishment cells for extended periods of time for either complaining about cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or for disobeying orders by prison officers.

The December 2003 transfer of supervision of pre-trial detention facilities from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Justice was completed in May; as a result of this transfer, conditions improved, although they remained harsh. The head of the prison system and two deputies resigned in February following reports of brutal beatings of inmates in certain prisons. Violent crime among prisoners was common. During the year, the number of prisoners continued to decline significantly. Much of the decrease was associated with the 2002 Humanization of Criminal Justice Law, which prescribes punishments other than imprisonment, such as probation, for minor first offences.",

Rather, it was either because he had been found drunk in a public place at 9.20 on 23 August and was to be brought to the sobering up facility (as would appear to be the case from the records of the sobering up facility, and as the applicant also contends), or it was to pursuant to the commission of an unspecified criminal offence or to establish his identity, for which he was to be brought to the police station (as can be implied from point 4 of the detention record, see paragraph 17 above).",

In particular, the Government have not indicated how Articles 106, 165-2 and 382 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as well as the Resolution of the Plenary Supreme Court of 8\u00a0October 2004 could provide the review required by Article 5 \u00a7 4. In this respect, the Court also refers to its findings under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention concerning the lack of legal provisions in Ukrainian law governing the procedure for detention pending extradition (see paragraph 131 above). It considers that these findings are equally pertinent in the context of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. In particular, the Government have not demonstrated that the applicant had at his disposal any effective and accessible procedure by which he could challenge the lawfulness of his detention pending extradition.",

However, the Court considers that the fact that, rather than forwarding the applicant's letter as it stood, the Governor of the SIZO sent it as an attachment to a covering letter, making comments on its contents, is not compatible with the safeguards of Article\u00a034 of the Convention, regardless of whether it had any bearing on the applicant's communication with the Court.
