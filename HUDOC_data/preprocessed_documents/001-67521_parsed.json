It however considers the amounts claimed to be excessive. In this respect, the Court observes that at the admissibility stage some of the applicant\u2019s complaints were declared inadmissible. It is therefore appropriate to reimburse the costs and expenses alleged by the applicant only in the part related to his attempts to secure the enforcement of the judgment after 15 February 2001. Having regard to the elements at its disposal, the Court awards the applicant 300 EUR for the costs incurred before the Russian authorities and 300 EUR for the costs related to the European proceedings, and therefore the global sum of 600 EUR, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",
