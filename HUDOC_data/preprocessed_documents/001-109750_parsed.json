Concerning the Government\u2019s failure to submit to the Court an unedited copy of the video footage, the Court stresses that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted under Article 34 that States should furnish all necessary facilities to make possible a proper and effective examination of applications (see Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7 70, ECHR 1999-IV). It is inherent in proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where an individual applicant accuses State agents of violating his rights under the Convention, that in certain instances the respondent State has access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information as is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 of the Convention, but may also give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the allegations (see Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2000VI; see also Rule 44A and C of Rules of Court). In the present case, and having particular regard to the fact that the Government already bear the burden of providing a plausible explanation for the four applicants\u2019 injuries (see paragraph 59 above), the Court does not deem it necessary to examine whether the Government fell short of their obligation under Article 38 of the Convention.",
