Having regard to those two grounds, they considered that the applicant\u2019s detention had been the only measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a05, 6, 14 and 23 above). Furthermore, the domestic courts relied on the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or obstructing the proceedings by other means and the need to obtain expert evidence (see paragraphs 5, 6, 19 and 23 above).",

It must then establish whether the other grounds advanced by the judicial authorities were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d to continue to justify the deprivation of his liberty.",

In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that, in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant, the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81, 26\u00a0July 2001). In the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the severity of the anticipated penalty alone, or in conjunction with the other grounds relied on by the authorities, cannot constitute a \u201crelevant and sufficient ground\u201d for holding the applicant in detention for a relatively long period of over 2 years and 10 months.",

Firstly, it notes that the S\u0142upsk District Court, when originally remanding the applicant in custody, held that the risk of pressure on witnesses was justified by the fact that the applicant had not confessed (see paragraph 5 above). In the Court\u2019s view such reasoning of the District Court showed a manifest disregard for the principle of the presumption of innocence and cannot, in any circumstances, be relied on as a legitimate ground for deprivation of liberty. Secondly, the Court notes that other relevant decisions of the judicial authorities did not put forward any argument indicating that the risk of the applicant\u2019s obstructing the proceedings had been substantiated. In the absence of any other factor capable of showing that the risk relied on actually existed, the Court cannot accept that ground as a justification for holding the applicant in custody for the entire relevant period.",

Nor did they mention any factor indicating that there was a real risk of his absconding or obstructing the proceedings. In that regard the Court would also point out that, although such a potential danger may exist where an accused is charged with a serious offence and where the sentence faced is a long term of imprisonment, the degree of that risk cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the offence and anticipated sentence (see Muller v.\u00a0France, judgment of 17 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and\u00a0Decisions 1997-II, p.\u00a0388,, \u00a7 43).",
