The Court notes that the complaints before it concern the allegation that the delay in those proceedings breached the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 and that there was no effective remedy for it as required by Article 13 of the Convention. The Court does not consider that these two applicants can claim to be victims of violations of those provisions when neither of them were a party to those proceedings (see O\u2019Reilly and Others v.

In this connection, the Court observes, and it was not disputed by the parties, that the first applicant had been notified of the District Court\u2019s decision of 14\u00a0November 2002 sometime in October 2003. However, it was not until 23 January 2004 that, in response to his requests, he was served with a written copy of that decision. The Court reiterates that where an applicant is entitled to be served ex officio with a written copy of the final domestic decision, the object and purpose of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention are best served by counting the six-month period as running from the date of service of the written judgment (see Ja\u0142owiecki v.

The Court notes that the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure provided for ex officio service of decisions on the discontinuation of proceedings (see paragraph 30 above). The first applicant lodged his application with the Court on 14 April 2004, that is, within less than six months from the date of the service of the decision. It could therefore not be said that the application was introduced out of time. The Government\u2019s objection should be dismissed.",

In particular, in respect of the first applicant\u2019s alleged absence from the hearings in 1998, it observes that the Government did not refer to any source of information on the basis of which their assertion could be verified. It was open to the Government to submit copies of any decisions or records of court hearings in which the District Court gave reasons for the adjournments. No such documents were presented. At the same time, the first applicant provided the Court with a copy of the letter of the deputy president of the Nevskiy District Court, showing that in 1998 only one hearing had been adjourned due to the first applicant\u2019s absence. The remaining postponements were attributable to the domestic courts (see paragraph 12 above).

At the same time, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that on 25 April 2001 the first applicant repeated his request to the District Court for an examination of the case in his absence (see paragraph 16 above).
