The case originated in an application (no. 72954/11) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Lina Alekseyevna Filozofenko (“the applicant”), on 18 November 2011.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 about the State’s failure to pay a supplement to her pension.
On 11 July 2018 notice of the above complaint was given to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in the Odessa Region.
The applicant has a special status of a “child of war” (a person who on 2 September 1945 was no more than 18 years of age) under the Children of War Social Protection Act in force as of 1 January 2006 (“the 2006 Act”). Section 6 of the above Act entitled her to a special supplement to her pension in the amount of 30% of the minimum pension.
On 11 December 2008 she lodged a claim against the State Pension Fund with the domestic courts, asking them to recalculate her pension in accordance with section 6 of the above Act for 2006-2008 and to pay her the outstanding debt.
On 10 June 2009 the Odessa Circuit Administrative Court partly allowed the claim. It held that in 2006 section 6 of the 2006 Act had been suspended by the State Budget Act 2006. In return amendments to the latter Act, which had entered into force on 1 April 2006, had empowered the Cabinet of Ministers to set up a mechanism for a pension increase. However, in 2006 no such mechanism had been set up and the applicant’s claims relating to 2006 had to be rejected. As to her claims relating to 2007 and 2008, the court noted that in 2007 and 2008 section 6 of the 2006 Act had been suspended and modified respectively by the 2007 and 2008 State Budget Acts. However, on 9 July 2007 and 22 May 2008 the Constitutional Court had found that suspension and modification unconstitutional. The court consequently held that the State Pension Fund should recalculate the applicant’s pension, but only for the periods from 9 July to 31 December 2007, and from 22 May to 31 December 2008.
On 1 November 2010 the Odessa Regional Administrative Court of Appeal partly amended the above judgment. It upheld the lower court’s findings as regards the applicant’s claims for 2006. As to her claims for 2007 and 2008, it also upheld her right to a pension increase for the period from 9 July to 31 December 2007 and from 22 May to 31 December 2008, but held that since she had missed a one-year statutory period for lodging a claim, the claim for 2007 had to be allowed only for the period from 11 to 31 December 2007.
On 18 May 2011 the Higher Administrative Court upheld the latter judgment.
The provisions of the relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the case of Sukhanov and Ilchenko v. Ukraine (nos. 68385/10 and 71378/10, §§ 17-25, 26 June 2014).
