Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation (see Megyeri v. Germany, 12 May 1992, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 237A), it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Nikolova\u00a0v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 40896/98, \u00a7 58, 30 September 2004; Sanchez-Reisse v. Switzerland, 21 October 1986, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 107; and Kampanis v.

Consequently, the procedural requirements inherent in this provision do not oblige the authorities to hold a hearing every time such an objection is lodged, unless there are special circumstances requiring a hearing (see \u00c7atal v. Turkey, no. 26808/08, \u00a7 40, 17 April 2012). The right to be heard by the judge on the applications against detention must be exercised at reasonable intervals (see Ceviz v.

In particular, the period of some four months cannot be regarded as a reasonable interval (see Eri\u015fen and Others v. Turkey, no. 7067/06, \u00a7 51, 3 April 2012). In reaching this finding, the Court also takes into consideration the fact that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was initially ordered without a public defender being present (see paragraph 6 above) \u2013 and this in the face of the seriousness of the charges \u2013 and, moreover, that the domestic courts paid no heed to the applicant\u2019s arguments submitted to support his release (see paragraph 8 above). Furthermore, it is of relevance that the applicant\u2019s lawyer was not informed in due time of a prolongation motion (see paragraph 9 above) and that, on another occasion, the court did not await the defence\u2019s observations on prolongation (see paragraph 11 above).",
