The applicant Mr\u00a0Kuzmenko was held in Lugansk SIZO and the applicant Mr Kiselev was serving his sentence in Berdychiv Prison no. 70. Thus, the Court considers, in relation to the witnesses who were in custody, that the Government had an opportunity to duly summon them to appear before the Delegates.

In the circumstances, it will approach with caution the content of these statements. It will also confront this evidence with other evidence produced before the Delegates, taking it into account to the extent it is consistent with or contradict other evidence (see, \u0130pek, cited above, \u00a7 120). Thus, as it ensues from the preliminary written witness statements given by Mr Pylypenko and Mr Mazepa, they denied that the training at Zamkova Prison involved the participation of prisoners, that force was used against them and that they were ill-treated in the course of these tactical trainings. In contrast to these statements, Mr Kostenko maintained that he stayed in Zamkova Prison from 2001 to 2003 and knew one of the applicants (Mr Davydov), who was incarcerated in the cell opposite to his cell. Mr Kostenko further stated that in the course of the training on 30 May 2001 he was beaten by officers in masks, had to stay kneeled down and then on \u201croztyazhka\u201d in the corridor. As a result of the training his left knee and ribs were broken. He also mentioned that one of the officers stated that he had been sentenced to death and shot at him from the automatic gun. He requested medical assistance and received painkillers. His injuries were not registered and complaints not accepted. During the second training he was beaten again and had injuries of internal organs, including liver. After these beatings he attempted to commit suicide by cutting his veins with the edge of a safety razor.",

His statements were consistent with those given by the applicants and other witnesses who were prisoners of Zamkova Prison, who were placed at different observation points and observed it at different times, so they could witness different aspects of the training. These statements corroborated a number of similar key points in their evidence which related to the presence of special forces during both training exercises, their uniforms, the noise, explosions and shots that were heard, the time and manner of the searches, the complaints raised by the applicants, the investigation into these complaints, injuries sustained and the lack of medical treatment and assistance provided to the injured.",

Thus, his statements could not be examined in detail in context of other evidence obtained and could not be contrasted to that evidence. The Court points out in this connection that the witness did not remember particular important details about the training exercise which related to the applicants' allegations of ill-treatment. Furthermore, with regard to the participation of special forces from outside the penitentiary, he stated that only the personnel of Zamkova Prison participated in the search, with staff from the guard company.

His statements also revealed that there was no adequate system for receiving and registering medical complaints and that no reliable system for keeping medical records and files existed in Zamkova Prison. The Court further notes certain inconsistencies in his statements with regard to the presence of the special units at the residential zone and where exactly he was during the searches (see Annex, paragraphs\u00a051-54). In respect of the applicants' complaints that they were not given adequate medical attention, the Court considers that it cannot draw any conclusions from the evidence given by this witness with regard to the medical treatment provided to the applicants, as this witness's responses were given to prove that he acted in compliance with the law and in defence against the applicants' accusations of his inadequate work. However, the Court would still take into account the evidence given by that witness as to how the medical unit operated and that its operation generally corresponded to the regulations at issue. Also, he was unable to respond credibly and clearly to the questions concerning the registration of medical complaints, and in particular how he learned about medical complaints from prisoners and the procedure for responding to such complaints. It further notes that there were only two employees in the medical unit, including Mr\u00a0Bondar. Thus, this witness could not be present everywhere in the course of the searches in cells and training exercises, could not have witnessed all of the training, even though he mentioned that the cells were searched one-by-one. For the Court this inconsistency means that Mr\u00a0Bondar witnessed only a part of the search and training, but not the whole training and search exercise in its entirety. Also, Mr Bondar initially stated that he did not know which group or unit trained at Zamkova Prison, but eventually confirmed that there were some \u201cadditional forces\u201d from the outside. In this respect, the Court takes into account this witness's dependency, from a hierarchical perspective, on the Governor of the Prison and the Prison Department and considers that inconsistency in some of his statements was a result of this dependency.",

This especially concerned confusing witness statements given by Mr Volkov, who failed to give consistent description of the events. In particular, Mr\u00a0Volkov answered the questions posed by the Delegates without providing direct answers and without giving exact factual details. In his statements he repeated on a number of occasions that the search and training in May 2001 had been conducted in accordance with the law and he vigorously denied any possible violation of internal prison regulations, regulations as to the conduct of training exercises or searches. His statements were general in that he gave no details or explanations as to what exactly had occurred. The Court notes, with regard to the statements given by Mr Bukher, that although he was willing to help the Delegates, he had no direct information about the trainings and searches as he did not witness them and only supervised investigation into the events of the case.

His statements in relation to the conduct of the trainings on both occasions were unreliable as they were not consistent throughout the questioning. In particular, firstly, he mentioned that he was new to his job and the training exercises at issue were exceptional events, and that he therefore tried to understand, remember and see as much as possible. Nevertheless, although he was new to the job and was fascinated by its importance, especially from the point of view of necessity to ensure that the law was complied with and properly enforced, he was not able to recall many significant details related to the trainings and searches. In particular, he was unable to give clear and direct answers to a number of factual questions. For instance, he stated that the applicants and other prisoners were informed about the training and search by radio well in advance and that it was a normal way of informing them. However, notwithstanding some unclear answers to the other questions raised, this witness was firm in his view that the rapid reaction unit was present in Zamkova Prison on 30 May 2001 and was, most possibly, in the \u201cresidential zone\u201d (see Annex, paragraph 65). For the Court his testimony also confirmed the manner in which the investigation into the complaints had been organised. Furthermore, it was apparent from his statements that prisoners were prevented from complaining to the prosecution or other State authorities directly and had to try to use \u201cillegal\u201d channels for lodging their complaints.

In accordance with these witness statements, which the Court accepts as credible, notwithstanding the failure of the Government to provide any records relating to the conduct of investigation (see paragraph 168 above), the investigators of the State Prison Department (Mr Irshko) questioned and received written explanations from one hundred persons in a single day, without reviewing the medical evidence and looked at the complainants' personal files, noting that the complainants were regarded as \u201cmalicious violators of the law\u201d (see Annex, paragraph 102 above). These details, for the Court, are useful elements in examining the manner and nature of the investigation conducted by the domestic authorities into the applicants' complaints. The Court also notes that Mr\u00a0Iltiay gave important factual details about the purpose of and grounds for the use of the special forces and the equipment they carried and used during the training exercises. In particular, he stated that the officers of the special and rapid reaction units acting within the Prison Department had been required to know the premises of the penitentiaries, including the residential area, in case of unforeseen circumstances such as the taking of hostages or mass riots. Thus, these statements lend further support to the evidence that the searches were conducted with presence of the special forces, who had to be trained within the residential area of Zamkova Prison they were obliged to be acquainted with.",

The Court finds sufficient evidence ensuing from oral statements given by the applicants and witnesses to establish that injuries were inflicted on the first and the second applicants (see Annex, paragraphs 5 and 16). Furthermore, in the Court's view, the lack of material evidence, such as medical records or medical examination certificates, substantiating specific injuries sustained by the applicants does not prevent the Court from making findings as to whether excessive force was applied as a result of which the applicants were injured. In this respect the Court finds that the system for recording injuries enabled penitentiary officials not to record injuries and not to react to medical complaints, as the Court considers happened in the case. The Court notes that, in view of lack of medical records in the instant case, there is no reliable written source of evidence for determining whether a particular applicant prisoner was or was not subjected to ill-treatment. Also, it is not for the Court to establish the kind or degree of injury if it is satisfied that the treatment attained the level at which Article 3 applies. The Court also refers in support of these findings to others witness statements, which it found convincing. In particular, it considers that the statements given by the second applicant (see Annex, paragraph 11), who watched the search in the corridor through a chink in the door, and the results of it seen by Mr\u00a0Getmansky, who saw injured prisoners pass by to the medical unit (see Annex, paragraphs 43-44), under guard or with help of the other prisoners, were reliable and trustworthy. The Court further notes that the conduct of the training largely corresponded to the training plans (see paragraphs 52-64 above) and the internal domestic regulations (see paragraphs 66-80 and 134 above), a position which was on a number of occasions underlined by the witness statements given by the officials of Zamkova Prison, local and special prosecutors and the officials of the Prison Department. However, some of these regulations like the Order no. 75 of 27 April 2000 on the conduct and operation of the special units (see paragraphs 77-80 above) were not publicly accessible and were provided by the Government only upon request of the Court (see paragraphs\u00a0142 above). Thus, the Court considers that there were no grounds provided by law, within the meaning of the Convention, for operation of the aforementioned special unit.",

No medical treatment and assistance was provided for the injuries which both the first and the second applicant sustained. Given the inadequacy of the recording of medical complaints (see paragraph 218 above), the mere absence of records is not sufficient to counterbalance the evidence before the Court.

One of the aims of the training was to train Zamkova Prison's personnel and the rapid reaction units in conducting searches of the premises occupied by prisoners and searching the prisoners themselves. In particular, the search of prisoners and of the residential area was mentioned as one of the main training aims. The stated aim of the search was to find prohibited items and to identify preparations for escape, preparatory actions for the commission of criminal offences. The search also had the aim of prevention of possible breaches of prison regulations as it mainly concerned \u201cmalicious violators of the regime\u201d and focused on inspection of disciplinary cells and those cells where the operational circumstances had been troublesome.

The conduct and manner of this investigation was such as described by the relevant witness statements, even though it was not supported by any records of this investigation. The Court also notes that this report was not provided to it for review as the time-period for its retention expired and it was destroyed (see paragraph 168 above). Thus, it was not possible to ascertain the factual details established by this review of the complaints, or even exact date on which questioning of witnesses took place. Finally, the Court notes that a report was also prepared by Mr Skokov, on the basis of the report from officer Danyshevsky who had investigated the matter from 3 to 4 October 2001, and on the basis of instructions given by the State Prison Department (see paragraph 98 above).

In particular, the status of such a prosecutor under domestic law, his proximity to the prison officials with whom a prosecutor supervises on respective prisons on a daily basis and integration into that prison system, do not offer adequate safeguards to ensure conduct of an independent and impartial review of the ill-treatment complaints that are aimed at prison officials (see Melnik v. Ukraine, no.\u00a072286/01, \u00a7\u00a069, 28\u00a0March 2006). His discretion to decide in cases involving allegations of ill-treatment is limited to reviewing the evidence that the complainant provides to substantiate the allegations. In particular, when deciding on whether it is necessary to institute criminal proceedings the investigator or prosecutor considers whether there are procedural and substantive grounds for instituting criminal proceedings, that is, whether the complainant has provided sufficient proof that an act at issue was socially dangerous and prohibited by criminal law (see Article 94 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, see also paragraphs 112 and 113 above). To institute criminal proceedings, the investigator or prosecutor has to have sufficient proof to be able conclude that evidence of a crime has been discovered. Further judicial review of a resolution to refuse institution of criminal proceedings is limited to formal supervision of the lawfulness of such a decision in the light of the procedural requirements of Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 112-113 above).",

After a further direction from the Deputy Prosecutor General, on 6 August 2002 the Acting Regional Prosecutor informed the Deputy Prosecutor General that the complaints were unsubstantiated, and that the file had been transferred to the General Prosecutor's Office for examination (see paragraph 97 above). The applicants' complaints also gave rise to an investigation by the prison authorities which concluded on 15 October 2001 that the complaints about the first training exercise were ungrounded as the training had been based on a lawful decision and had been supervised by prosecutor Volkov (see paragraph 98 above).",

Moreover, a court review would only have considered compliance with the substantive and procedural grounds for instituting proceedings, and in the absence of medical evidence (i.e. substantive grounds) the applicants would have had to claim that the prosecutor had not complied with Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 112 above).

Lack of such information as to the training, from the Court's point of view, underlines proof ensuring from various reports confirming the domestic practice of treating prisoners as objects of the training and search exercises (see paragraphs 104-106 and 143 above), who are not asked for their consent and are not informed about searches or trainings. This seemed to be a normal and unquestionable practice for the witnesses that appeared on the part of the Government (see paragraphs 195-197 above), partly corresponding to the domestic regulations that allow requests for use of the special units to be used in problematic prisons upon requests of prison governors (see paragraphs\u00a07780 above). Such an attitude on the part of the authorities sugests to the Court that the treatment to which the applicants were subjected was degrading and incompatible with their human dignity. Additionally, it finds that at least part of the aim of the training was to frighten and humiliate prisoners, and to coerce those who frequently violated the regime (\u201cmalicious violators of the regime of detention\u201d) to comply with the prison rules and regulations (see, for definitions of the malicious violators of the regime, paragraphs 119, 202 and 214-216 above). An example of such threatening, intimidating and uninformed use of special equipment was the use of the automatic guns at the moment of entering the cells, without any prior notification or explanation (see Annex, paragraphs 4 and 6). Also, the use of special units was a normal practice in the State Prison Department, aimed at dealing with prisons containing dangerous prisoners, as it ensued from various domestic and international human rights reports (see paragraphs 104-108 and 143 above).",

It also is of the opinion that the manner in which these trainings were organised unavoidably led to the injury and humiliation of the prisoners. This resulted not only from the excessive use of force by the officers, who aimed to comply with short time-limits for inspections inside the cells, but also from draging the prisoners out of the cells, their \u201cspeeding up\u201d when they left their cells and enforcement of unjustified and humiliating orders by the officers participating in the training. Humiliating orders included those to completely undress and to swear in front of others that the applicants would comply with the prison administration's demands and that they would not break the regime of detention. Injuries were inflicted on the applicants if they resisted, refused to comply or were not sufficiently fast, from the officers' point of view, in complying with their orders or in reacting to a sudden inspection of the cell (see paragraphs 212-214 and 226-227 above).",

The Court bears in mind the difficulties in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the need to train and keep staff prepared for possible unexpected conduct of prisoners, including conduct related to mass riots or taking of hostages, for which the special forces were being trained. It also notes that the applicants were convicted criminals, who were serving their sentences for serious crimes. However, even in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism, organised crime or dangerous criminals, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols\u00a0Nos. 1 and 4, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 \u00a7 2 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see Dikme v. Turkey, no.\u00a020869/92, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR 2000VIII). Furthermore, Article 3 of the Convention establishes, like Article 2 of the Convention, a positive obligation on the State to train its law enforcement officials in such a manner as to ensure their high level of competence in their professional conduct so that no-one is subjected to torture or treatment that runs contrary to that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Abdullah Yilmaz v. Turkey, no.\u00a021899/02, \u00a7\u00a057, 17 June 2008).

They also were ill-treated due to being subjected to full body searches in the Monastyr's corridor in front of their cells, in the absence of any grounds for such full body searches or any reasonable necessity to perform them in the manner they were performed (see paragraphs 213-215 and 226 above). Moreover, the Court underlines that the manner in which the searches and the full body searches were conducted surpassed the usual degree of indignity that is inherent in the so-called \u201cordinary searches\u201d (see paragraphs 67-76 above) that were conducted at Zamkova Prison.",

The Court further considers that such treatment was intentionally meted out to the applicants by agents of the State in the performance of their duties, with the aim of breaking the applicants' will as they were difficult to deal with, and to ensure that they cooperated with Zamkova Prison authorities. Nevertheless, it considers that the applicants' ill-treatment, physical and mental violence against them, considered as a whole, did not reach such a level of \u201cseverity\u201d to be characterised as torture, within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. Thus, in view of the specific circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects, sex, age and state of health of the victims, the Court considers that the violence inflicted on the applicants was both inhuman and degrading (compare and contrast, Selmouni v.

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. Article 3 thus includes a procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation into alleged breaches of the substantive limb of its requirements (see \u0160ilih v.

Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injury or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard. Moreover, for an investigation into torture or ill-treatment by agents of the State to be regarded as effective, the general rule is that the persons responsible for the inquiries and those conducting the investigation should be independent hierarchically and institutionally of anyone implicated in the events, i.e. the investigators should be independent in practice (see, Bat\u0131 and Others, \u00a7\u00a0135, cited above).",

While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, it may generally be regarded as essential for the authorities to launch an investigation promptly (see, mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2002-II). For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory, which may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the complainant must be afforded effective access to the investigatory procedure (see Aksoy v. , 18 December 1996, \u00a7 98, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI).",

Such a failure to provide records of the investigation deprived the Court of a full opportunity to review steps taken by the authorities to investigate the applicants' allegations of ill-treatment. In this respect, the Court considers that existence of detailed investigation records until final examination of the case could have served as an important indicator of the authorities' willingness to demonstrate steps taken by them to investigate allegations of ill-treatment and to prove that action was undertaken on the basis of these allegations. However, the authorities never regarded these allegations as arguable and had never intended to undertake serious investigation into the applicants' allegations, seeing no practical need or necessity in recording steps taken in the course of obviously routine review of unsubstantiated complaints (see paragraphs 231-234 above).

This conclusion can be reached on the basis of the report produced by Lieutenant Danovsky concluded upon instructions received from the State Prison Department (see paragraph 98 above). It can also be seen from the investigation conducted by the Colonel Irshko who according to Mr\u00a0Iltiay, established that the investigators questioned one hundred persons in a single day (see Annex, paragraphs 103-104), although the written investigation report from Mr\u00a0Danovsky stated that he inspected Zamkova Prison for two days from 3 to 4 October 2001 (see paragraph 98 above). Moreover, it is not clear for the Court whether these were two separate inspections or a single one as the report produced by Mr\u00a0Skokov never mentioned Mr Iltiay or Colonel Irshko. Furthermore, the Government failed to provide any documentary records as to the investigation conducted by Colonel Irshko, purportedly due to the fact that these records were destroyed due to the expiry of the time-limit for their storage (see paragraph\u00a0168 above).

In particular, a formal investigation by the prosecutor's office was initiated only after the second training exercise, more than six months after the first training exercise, which cannot be regarded as complying with the requirement of promptness. The individuals involved in the investigation on the part of the regional prosecutor's office were those who had approved the training plan or participated in the training itself (see paragraphs 232-233 above) or came from Zamkova Prison. In this respect the Court notes that Mr\u00a0Bukher deemed it unnecessary to appoint different prosecutors to investigate the applicants' complaints, from those prosecutors who had participated in and approved the training exercises, even though some of the complaints were made against these very prosecutors. Thus, the regional prosecutor's office could not act as hierarchically and institutionally independent from prison authorities' external investigating authority in the instant case, as maintained by the Government, insofar as the investigators participating in questioning witnesses and gathering evidence for Mr\u00a0Bukher had a strong interest in a particular outcome of the investigation.

Also, the possibility of independent or alternative medical expert opinion was not even looked into by the relevant investigators of the regional prosecutor's office (similarly to the inquiries conducted by Prison Department and special prosecutor Volkov). Lack of medical evidence from the prison doctor and medical unit has not aroused his suspicion and he has never tried to verify credibility of statements as to the absence of injuries and medical complaints.",

Furthermore, the manner and speed with which the investigators gathered evidence rebutting the applicants' allegations raised no suspicion in him. The Court concludes that the investigation at issue was conducted contrary to the spirit of efficient and independent investigation, which could establish factual details relevant to the case. Both investigations focused on complying with the formal requirements necessary for the completion of the investigation file, including gathering written statements on the basis of unknown criteria, and giving a formal response that no violations of the law occurred. The majority of statements in the file confirmed that the applicants had not been subjected to any sort of ill-treatment, and the prisoners stated that they had no complaints about Zamkova Prison officers. The applicants' statements were disregarded and not taken into account (see paragraph 93 above).",

Nevertheless, these allegations were never verified and there were no reports about questioning the officers involved in the searches and trainings. As it ensues from the materials in the Court's possession, the authorities have never made any serious attempts to verify the applicants' allegations and to identify the alleged perpetrators. No attempt was ever made to identify and question officers who allegedly inflicted injuries on the applicants or who commanded these units or who were identified by the applicants as those who possibly participated in the searches and trainings. In this respect, the Court again underlines that it was not able to review the investigation files or relevant investigation records (see paragraphs 168 and 200 above) and therefore was not able to evaluate the reasons for which the authorities discontinued investigation into the applicants' allegations. It reiterates that there were no contemporaneous records which could demonstrate, step by step, the nature of the investigations carried out by the prosecutor's office and the State Prison Department.",

The Court underlines that by such measures the authorities have shown that they had initial lack of trust in the submissions made by the prisoners, favoured Zamkova Prison authorities in their explanations as to the events, putting more emphasis on the complainants' identity than on establishing facts and investigating their allegations of ill-treatment.",

Moreover, they belonged to the same prosecutor's office as Mr Volkov, who signed the training plans and supervised the training and who also was supposed to conduct an investigation into the prisoners' complaints against prison authorities (see paragraphs 232-233 above). Also, the internal investigation organised by the Prison Department, led by Colonel Irshko and supervised by Mr Iltiay, and the inquiry conducted by Lieutenant Danyshevksy, concerned senior officers of the Prison Department, including Prison Governor Mr\u00a0Snegir and the Deputy Head of the Regional Prison Department Mr\u00a0Leventsov, who planned the training, participated in it and supervised its conduct (see paragraphs 98 and 197 above).",

The Court reiterates that due to numerous shortcomings mentioned above these investigations did not reflect any serious attempt to discover neither what had really occurred on 30\u00a0May\u00a02001 and 29\u00a0January 2002, nor who had ill-treated the applicants or given instructions to ill-treat them. It concludes, therefore, that the applicants' arguable claim that they were ill-treated in the course of the training exercises of the special units on 30 May 2001 and 29 January 2002 was not subject to a prompt, independent and effective investigation by the domestic authorities that could lead to any tangible results, as required by the procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention.",

In particular, in a situation where, exceptionally, impermissible conduct under Article 3 of the Convention had taken place and a prisoner had been ill-treated, which resulted in injuries, it is the duty of the State to ensure provision of timely and relevant treatment to the applicant's specific state of health and the injuries the prisoner suffers from. This positive obligation requires inter alia registration of medical complaints, timely identification and diagnosis of injuries, development of comprehensive medical strategy for injuries' treatment, documenting progress in medical treatment, assessing the state of health of the person after medical treatment and the possible need for post-injury treatment, which might include assessment of the psychological state of health (see, among many other authorities and in so far as relevant to the circumstances of the present case, Hummatov\u00a0v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos.\u00a09852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7\u00a0114, 29\u00a0November 2007; Mathew v. the , no.\u00a024919/03, \u00a7\u00a0193, ECHR 2005IX; Melnik v.

Poland, no. 5410/03, \u00a7 134, ECHR 2007IV). However, the Court observes that the applicants' complaint about the State's failure to put in place an adequate legal framework for complaints about undue interference with correspondence. This complaint essentially overlaps with the Court's ruling that the interference with the applicants' correspondence was not based on law and thus in breach of Article 8 of the Convention. It holds, therefore, that no separate issue arises under Article 13 of the Convention.",

The opening of letters to the Convention organs undoubtedly gives rise to the possibility that they will be read and may also conceivably, on occasions, create the risk of reprisals by the prison staff against the prisoner concerned (see Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, \u00a7\u00a062, Series A no.\u00a0233).",

In this respect any form of pressure from the authorities on applicants or potential applicants to withdraw or modify their complaints which results in a situation where they are unable to communicate freely with the Convention organs is a grave interference with the very essence of the exercise of the right of individual petition enshrined in Article 34 of the Convention. Moreover, the expression \u201cany form of pressure\u201d must be taken to cover not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation but also improper indirect acts or contact designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a Convention remedy (see Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7 160, Reports 1998-III). Furthermore, the question whether contact between the authorities and an applicant constitutes an unacceptable practice from the standpoint of Article\u00a034 must be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of the case.

Applicants such as Mr\u00a0Druzenko, Mr Kulyk, Mr Myronov and Mr Kuzmenko, some of whom are or were serving their sentences in Zamkova Prison when the complaints were lodged, subsequently chose not to pursue their applications, as according to submissions given in the course of the hearing, they foresaw complications arising from attempts to pursue their complaints or these applicants were persuaded by whatever reasons not to pursue them.

He was lifted from the floor by two soldiers who threw him into a very narrow passageway between the cells, where he saw Mr Volkov, Mr Stasiuk and someone else standing at a distance of 5-6 metres. He also saw that other cells had been opened. One of the inmates, Mr Kostenko, cut his wrists with a razor hidden on his person. The officers asked the inmates to swear that they would comply with the administration's instructions. He refused to swear and they started beating him in the kidneys and ribs.

The medical doctor of the Prison did not want to help, as he was fully controlled by the Prison.

While beating the person suffering from epilepsy, the soldiers did not believe that he had this illness and continued to beat him, thinking that he was pretending to suffer from epilepsy. The inmates again made a number of complaints to different institutions (he also mentioned the CPT and a member of the CPT staff). In December 2002 Mr Volkov replied to him, stating that no violations of the law had been found.

They also had explosives; they used weapons, firecrackers and ammunition rounds. All of this equipment had to be returned to the special equipment storage room after its use in the search. During the search, a \u201creinforced supervision\u201d group (\u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0443) was created, made up of those individuals who had special equipment. This \u201creinforced supervision group\u201d was not normally involved in searches, but was used for blocking the entrances and exits to Prison departments. The rapid reaction unit did not remain with the rest of the staff, as they trained only in the industrial zone. After the training exercise, which lasted one and a half to two hours, the rapid reaction unit left the territory of the Zamkova Prison and the search continued.",

No weapons, such as firecrackers, automatic guns and ammunition, were given to the staff. Staff had only the special equipment, which included rubber truncheons, shields and helmets.",
