In her submissions to the final-instance court she had referred to all the contracts she had allegedly concluded in the absence of the signatory parties. Therefore, she could have foreseen that she could have been convicted of any of the acts which formed the continuous nature of the offence she had been charged with and which had amounted on their own to an offence.

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, 21 January 1999, Kashlev v.\u00a0Estonia, no.\u00a022574/08, \u00a7 40, 26 April 2016, and Lazu v. the Republic of Moldova, no.\u00a046182/08, \u00a7 34, 5\u00a0July 2016). It is not the function of the Court to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a domestic court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. In the determination of whether the proceedings were fair the Court does not act as a court of fourth instance deciding on whether the evidence had been obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law, its admissibility or on the guilt of an applicant. These matters, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, are the province of the domestic courts. It is not appropriate for the Court to rule on whether the available evidence was sufficient for an applicant\u2019s conviction and thus to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts. The Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly and that in a given case they were compatible with the Convention, while also taking into account the specific circumstances, the nature and the complexity of the case (Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a036658/05, \u00a7 149, 18 December 2018).",

As to the latter, no reference was made to the right to hear witnesses under Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) of the Convention. The Government also centred their arguments on Article 6 \u00a7 1. The Court for its part sees no need to examine any part of the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) of its own motion, as the application does not concern the right to hear witnesses \u201con the same conditions\u201d as the prosecution, but rather the scope of the general right to a \u201cfair\u00a0hearing\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1. Thus, the Court considers that the complaint may suitably be dealt with under that provision (see Sigur\u00fe\u00f3r Arnarsson v.\u00a0Iceland, no.\u00a044671/98, \u00a7\u00a029, 15 July 2003).",

It may also be that the accused unequivocally has waived his right to take part in the appeal hearing (see, inter alia, Kashlev v. Estonia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051). However, the Court has held that where an appellate court is called upon to examine a case as to the facts and the law and to make a full assessment of the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence, it cannot, as a matter of fair trial, properly determine those issues without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused \u2013 who claims that he has not committed the act alleged to constitute a criminal offence (see Constantinescu v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a028871/95, 27 June 2000, with reference to Ekbatani v.

To this end, there is a close link to the Court\u2019s established case-law to the effect that in the determination of a criminal charge, the defendant should, as a general rule, be heard by the tribunal convicting him (see, inter alia, S\u00e1ndor Lajos Kiss v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 26958/05, \u00a7\u00a022, 29\u00a0September 2009).",

Taking into account what is at stake for the accused, the overall question would be whether the appeal court could, \u201cas a matter of fair trial, properly examine the issues to be determined without a direct assessment of the evidence\u201d given by the accused or the witness in person (see Botten v.

For example, in the case of Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, \u00a7\u00a036, 10 March 2008, the Court considered that the appeal court had not simply given a different legal interpretation or another application of the law to facts already established at first instance, but had carried out a fresh evaluation of facts beyond purely legal considerations (see also Sp\u00eenu v.

Spain, no.\u00a017122/07, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 21\u00a0September 2010, the Court held that the appeal court had expressed itself on a question of fact, namely the credibility of a witness, thus modifying the facts established at first instance and taking a fresh position on facts which were decisive for the determination of the applicant\u2019s guilt (see also Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez v.

Spain, no. 30643/04, 16 December 2008, the Court found that there had not been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on the ground that the aspects which the appeal court had been called on to analyse in order to convict the applicant had had a predominantly legal character, and its judgment had expressly stated that it was not for it to carry out a fresh evaluation of the evidence; rather, it had only made a different legal interpretation from that of the lower court (contrast Sigur\u00fe\u00f3r Arnarsson v.

A similar conclusion was reached in Keskinen and Veljekset Keskinen Oy v. Finland, no.\u00a034721/09, 5\u00a0June 2012. However, as explained by the Court in Suurip\u00e4\u00e4 v. Finland, no. 43151/02, \u00a7 44, 12\u00a0January 2010, one must at this point take into account that \u201cthe facts and the legal interpretation can be intertwined to an extent that it is difficult to separate the two from each other.\u201d",

However, even if the applicant used an inappropriate legal remedy in order to have the error corrected, the fact remains that this application, although it was the wrong procedural tool to rectify what was considered a material error, nevertheless brought to the attention of the competent court the residual flaw which, at any rate, it was under a duty to correct of its own motion. Despite the case-law cited in paragraph 27 of the judgment, it then appears to us as overly formalistic to require the applicant to introduce an application in order to have material errors corrected as provided for in Article 195 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, in a situation where the court had previously engaged in an exercise of correcting errors without correcting an error which, by definition, was obvious and which, moreover, was extremely serious, namely an illegal sentence. How could the applicant realistically have expected that the court would perform a second correction of a flaw, especially one of such magnitude, when it had previously engaged in the exercise without correcting the most obvious error? Moreover and more importantly, once informed of the error, albeit through the wrong channel, the Court of Cassation was at any rate under an obligation to correct it of its own motion.",

As to the Government\u2019s objection that the probation period did not constitute a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 and consequently that the complaint was inadmissible ratione materiae, we would argue that the probation period forms an integral part of the punishment and the penalty imposed. Therefore, Article 7 is applicable to the present case. Because there was no legal basis under the applicable domestic law for imposing a probation period of three years, the applicant\u2019s punishment was in violation of Article\u00a07.",

It has held, inter alia, that where an appellate court is called upon to examine a case as to the facts and the law and to make a full assessment of the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence, it cannot, as a matter of fair trial, properly determine those issues without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused (see J\u00fal\u00edus \u00de\u00f3r Sigur\u00fe\u00f3rsson v.\u00a0Iceland, no. 38797/17, \u00a7 33, 16 July 2019, with references). However, this principle is not limited to evidence given by the defendant himself, but also applies to evidence given by witnesses (see Ovidiu Cristian Stoica v.\u00a0Romania, no. 55116/12, \u00a7 41, 24 April 2018, with references). The main question to answer in this context is whether the higher-instance court proceeded to a fresh evaluation of the facts beyond purely legal considerations, that is, whether that court expressed itself on a question of fact, such as the credibility or the reliability of a witness statement, thus modifying the facts established at first instance and taking a fresh position on factual elements which were decisive for the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt (see J\u00fal\u00edus \u00de\u00f3r Sigur\u00fe\u00f3rsson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 42, with further references).",

E.C.\u2019s statement, which contradicted the applicant\u2019s version of events, could have constituted such \u201cconfirming\u201d evidence, but the court seemed to have doubts as to the witness\u2019s credibility and did not take into account her statement.",

In other words, in contrast to the first-instance court, the higher-instance court found that the witness statement, together with the forensic report, rebutted the applicant\u2019s version.

That was decisive for the determination of the applicant\u2019s guilt. He was found guilty by the higher-instance court on the basis, inter alia, of a witness statement which the first-instance court had assessed as being insufficient to convict him. Therefore, witness E.C., whose statement the higher-instance court explicitly referred to as a relevant piece of evidence, should have been heard by that court itself.
