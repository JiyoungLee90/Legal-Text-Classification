To hold that such a remedy did not need to be pursued simply because, at the time, the Constitutional Court\u2019s practice suggested that the decision being contested was not open to constitutional review, would not only disregard the fact that such practice might evolve (see Pavlovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 36). More importantly, it would remove any incentive for such evolution, as applicants would systematically address their complaints to the Court without giving the Constitutional Court a chance to change its practice. That would be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity (see Vrtar v. Croatia, no. 39380/13, \u00a7 76, 7 January 2016).",

Where the individual\u2019s access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the Court will examine whether the limitation imposed impaired the essence of the right and, in particular, whether it pursued a legitimate aim and whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0May 1985, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 93; Zwi\u0105zek Nauczycielstwa Polskiego v.\u00a0Poland, no. 42049/98, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2004IX; and Szwagrun-Baurycza v.\u00a0Poland, no. 41187/02, \u00a7 49, 24\u00a0October 2006).

The Administrative Court failed to take a decision on the appeal against the demolition decision, and instead took a decision on a non-existent appeal against the enforcement decision. When the applicant then filed a constitutional complaint, the Constitutional Court characterised the judgment of the Administrative Court as one relating to the enforcement of a decision \u2013 and thus not as a judgment on the merits of a dispute \u2013 with the result that the complaint was declared inadmissible as being directed against a decision that was not amenable to constitutional review.",

The fact that, according to the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law, complaints directed against judgments that do not concern the merits of a dispute are inadmissible (see paragraphs 36 to 37 of the judgment) is, in my opinion, not a relevant issue. Even though the Constitutional Court applied that same case-law in the applicant\u2019s case, the fact remains that the latter\u2019s constitutional complaint concerned a decision taken on an appeal directed against a demolition decision, not against its enforcement. Our judgment should not have entered into a discussion with respect to the Constitutional Court\u2019s practice concerning decisions rejecting appeals effectively directed against enforcement decisions or other decisions not related to the merits.",

I find this suggestion debatable. Where it can effectively be assumed, in the light of the existing case-law, that a given remedy would be bound to fail (compare Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v.\u00a0Belgium, 20 November 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 332), an applicant is absolved from the obligation to exhaust that remedy (see, generally, Aksoy v.

Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2006II), without having to wonder whether or not he or she would be able to convince the relevant court to change its case-law. Our judgment could be interpreted as meaning that an applicant cannot always rely on the existence of negative caselaw. Be that as it may, in our case, as stated above, there is in my opinion no question of the existence of clear case-law closing the door of the Constitutional Court to the applicant, since she could very well argue that her complaint did not fall within the scope of the existing case-law concerning decisions unrelated to the merits of a dispute.
