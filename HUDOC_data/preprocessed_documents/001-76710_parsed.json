The courts did not order any expert examination in the case and based their decisions largely on the written evidence submitted by the parties. Although the case might have been somewhat complicated by the counter-claim lodged by the defendant, the Court observes that the counter-claim was lodged shortly after the original claim and concerned the same subject matter.
