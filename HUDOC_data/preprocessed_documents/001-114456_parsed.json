At the same time, custody registers often contained incorrect data, and on occasion, misleading information.

The report did not specify who had identified the applicant, or say whether that person was really an eyewitness. If the investigator had meant to imply that D.K. had identified the applicant, as the Government contend, the investigator should have explained why he had considered him as an eyewitness, when in fact D.K. had been a suspect. However, the Court will not speculate in this regard: it is sufficient to note that the arrest report contained formulaic phrases without any indication as to why Articles 106 and 115 of the CCP could be applied in the applicant\u2019s case. The report did not refer to any factual circumstances that would persuade an independent observer that there had been a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a crime.",

He also complained under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention that he could not obtain appropriate judicial review of the lawfulness of his pre-trial detention. Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the applicant alleged that (a) the courts had wrongly interpreted the oral evidence given by him and others during the trial; (b) the courts had failed to give reasons for refusing his contention that he should have been regarded as having voluntarily refused to commit the crime, and that some of the evidence had been inadmissible; and (c) the Supreme Court had reconsidered the issue of whether the murder was planned to be committed by a group of individuals even though this particular issue had been resolved by the first-instance court.",
