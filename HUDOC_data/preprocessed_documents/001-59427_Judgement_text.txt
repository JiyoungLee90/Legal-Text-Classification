The case originated in an application (no. 40457/98) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr F.C. (“the applicant”), on 4 December 1997.
The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained, in particular, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 14 October 1997 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant was born in 1939 and is currently residing in Rome.
On 12 December the applicant’s house was searched by some police officers in relation to a criminal charge of extortion. The applicant was subsequently taken to the police station.
On 13 December 1991 the Public Prosecutor attached to the Rome District Court validated the search.
On 16 December 1991 the Public Prosecutor requested that the applicant be remanded in custody. On the same day the investigating judge issued an arrest warrant.
The applicant was detained from 7 January 1992 until 31 March 1992.
On the latter date the investigating judge committed the applicant and a certain Mr C. for trial before the Rome District Court.
The first hearing, initially scheduled for 19 June 1992, was postponed to 10 October 1992 because of a lawyers’ strike.
The following hearing, set for 12 January 1993, was adjourned ex officio to 9 February 1993, date on which some witnesses were examined.
On 11 May 1993 the proceedings were adjourned to 7 October 1993 by the District Court of its own motion. On the latter date, the applicant’s counsel requested an adjournment of the proceedings, which were postponed to 18 November 1993.
On 11 January 1994 the proceedings were postponed, with the applicant’s agreement, to 23 June 1994, then adjourned to 22 September 1994 because of a lawyers’ strike.
On the latter date the counsel of Mr C. requested an adjournment of the proceedings, which was granted by the Court.
The hearing of 14 October 1994 did not take place by reason of a general strike.
On 12 December 1994 and 18 April 1995 some witnesses were examined.
On 3 July 1995 the counsel of Mr C. requested an adjournment of the proceedings, which were postponed to 9 January 1996. On the latter date and on 5 March 1996, some witnesses were examined.
On 26 April 1996 the hearing was postponed ex officio. On 23 May 1996 and on 18 June 1996, the last witnesses were examined and the parties presented their final submissions.
In a judgment of 18 June 1996, filed with the registry on 18 October 1996, the Rome District Court held that the facts of which the applicant was accused had to be qualified as fraud. As no criminal complaint (querela) had been lodged against the applicant, the District Court ruled that proceedings be discontinued.
On 23 December 1996 the applicant lodged an appeal.
In a judgment of 24 March 1998, filed with the registry on 25 May 1998, the Rome Court of Appeal acquitted the applicant because the relevant facts had not been established (“il fatto non sussiste”). On 29 July 1998 this decision became final.
In the meantime, on 4 November 1992, the applicant had signed before the Rome Labour Magistrate an agreement with his employer, a syndicate for the maintenance and other services of a residential area. It was stipulated that his contract was suspended until 31 October 1993 and would have automatically been terminated at that date unless the applicant had in the meantime definitively been acquitted in the criminal proceedings against him. As the proceedings were on 31 October 1993 still pending, on that date the applicant lost his job.
