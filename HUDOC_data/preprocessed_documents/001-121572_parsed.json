In December 2006 he had again been contacted by the groups mentioned, which demanded more money. They had threatened to kill his children and to blow up his workshop, if he failed to pay. He and his family had therefore left their house and stayed with various friends. Two months later, he had been told that his workshop had been plundered and blown up.

Referring to recent country information, the court went on to state that there was no reason to deviate from the Board\u2019s assessment that, being a Christian from , the applicant was in need of protection. In regard to the possibility of internal relocation, it held, however, that recent country information showed that there were no restrictions against entering the Kurdistan Region and that there were no systematic discrimination of any religious groups in that area.

In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

As concluded by the UK Border Agency (M.Y.H. and Others, \u00a7 31) and the UK Upper Tribunal in the recent country guidance case of HM and others (M.Y.H. and Others, \u00a7 34), it is possible for an individual to obtain identity documents from a central register in Baghdad, which retains identity records on microfiche, whether he or she is applying from abroad or within Iraq.

It has not been substantiated that the perpetrators of these crimes would have a continued interest in the applicant several years after the events or that they would search for him in the Kurdistan Region.

It notes, however, that the applicant has expressed the intention of living with his wife and children. More importantly, the Court has regard to the fact that, in the domestic proceedings, the applicant did not make this claim until he appealed against the Migration Board\u2019s negative decision on his asylum application, more than one year after his arrival in . Moreover, no mention of the relationship in question was made in the present proceedings before he replied to the Government\u2019s observations, almost a year and a half after lodging the application to the Court. In this connection, it is noteworthy that, in that application, he stated that there were threats against him emanating from Al-Tawahid and Al-Jihad, but did not even mention the Mujahedin. The Court agrees with the  that the applicant did not give a reasonable explanation for the delay in making this claim in the domestic proceedings. Having regard to all the circumstances, including the similar delay in the present proceedings, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s claim concerning the homosexual relationship is not credible.",
