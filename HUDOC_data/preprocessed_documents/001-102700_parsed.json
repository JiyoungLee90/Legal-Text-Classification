The Court notes that had the District Court, or the higher courts on appeal, as requested by the applicant, reduced his sentence in a manner which provided express and quantifiable redress for the alleged breach of the reasonable time requirement, an issue might arise as to the applicant\u2019s victim status (see, for example Beck v. Norway, no.\u00a026390/95, \u00a7\u00a7 27-29, 26\u00a0June 2001 and Uoti v. Finland (just satisfaction), no. 61222/00, \u00a7 14, 13\u00a0January 2009). However, this was not the case. Furthermore, under Finnish law in force at the time, a defendant was at no stage of the proceedings able to request a domestic court to expedite the conduct of the proceedings or to file a claim for compensation either during their course or following their termination (see, for example, Scordino v.
