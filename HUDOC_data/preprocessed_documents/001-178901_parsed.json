The applicant was also examined by a neurologist, who prescribed treatment for vegetative-vascular dystonia; as a result, the applicant\u2019s condition improved.

It appears that the prison authorities did not consider themselves bound to make the necessary adjustments to comply with the prescription, either by providing the applicant with appropriate nutrition or by allowing him to receive it from his family in the right quantities. However, the Court does not consider that this omission caused the applicant sufferings of a duration and severity passing the threshold of Article\u00a03 of the Convention, primarily owing to his release. On 2 August 2013 the Presidium of the Moscow City Court quashed the applicant\u2019s detention orders and changed the preventive measure to house arrest, having specifically noted the applicant\u2019s health issues. It is of particular relevance that the Presidium\u2019s decision came two and a half months after the conclusions of the complete medical examination, rapidly enough to allow the applicant\u2019s treatment before his condition deteriorated further. The fact that the applicant\u2019s state of health improved after his release from detention is consistent with this assessment.",

The Court reiterates that while Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for detention within criminal proceedings, Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention deals with the possible justification for such detention. Moreover, according to the Court\u2019s established case-law under the latter provision, the persistence of a reasonable suspicion is a sine qua non for the validity of the continued detention (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2016 (extracts)). The Court therefore deems it more appropriate to deal with this complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Kovyazin and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 13008/13 and 2 others, \u00a7 71, 17\u00a0September 2015; Taranenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 19554/05, \u00a7 46, 15 May 2014; and Khodorkovskiy v.

However, with the passage of time the nature and the seriousness of the offence as the ground for the applicant\u2019s continued detention inevitably became less and less relevant (see Kovyazin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085, and Artemov v.
