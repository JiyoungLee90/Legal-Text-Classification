The case originated in an application (no. 10319/04) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by 25 Ukrainian nationals (“the applicants”), on 20 February 2004.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Yuriy Zaytsev.
On 16 December 2008 the application was communicated to the Government.
In the period from January to March 2001 (the exact dates are listed in the appended table) the Kyivskyy District Court of Simferopol delivered decisions according to which the State authorities were obliged to pay the applicants various pecuniary bonuses, to which the applicants were entitled as teachers under the law “On Education”. The decisions became final and enforceable. However, the applicants were unable to obtain the enforcement of the decisions in due time.
In their observations to the Court the Government, without providing the exact dates, stated that all the relevant decisions in applicants’ favour were fully enforced from 2005 to 2009.
The applicants confirmed the enforcement, however noted that the enforcement of the judgments started in December 2005 (more than four years from the date when the decisions became final and enforceable).
