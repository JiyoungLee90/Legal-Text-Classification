At the same hearing, the court announced that it had in the meantime examined the surveillance authorisations. According to the record of the hearing, the judge briefly summarised prosecutor\u2019s authorisation L\u00c4RP\u00a016/273 of 9 June 2005 and the authorisation given on 10 June 2005 by the President of the Tallinn City Court. The hearing was adjourned so that the applicant and his lawyer could examine the materials gathered by the surveillance measures.",

The applicant raised the issue of confusion \u2013 not only in respect of the numbers of the surveillance authorisations but also as concerned the dates when they had been issued. He asked that the court order the prosecutor to present the authorisations at the hearing. The prosecutor contended that surveillance authorisations were not normally included in the judicial case file but in the circumstances she considered it appropriate to admit the authorisations to the file. After a short break, the prosecutor procured and presented at the hearing prosecutor\u2019s authorisation L\u00c4RP 16/273 (issued on 3 June 2005) and authorisation L\u00c4RP 16/287 issued by the President of the Tallinn City Court (issued on 10 June 2005). These authorisations were admitted to the case file. The prosecutor and the court confirmed that the authorisation of 9 June 2005 had been presented to the court but no surveillance activities had been carried out on the basis of it. The applicant\u2019s request for submission and inclusion in the case file of the latter authorisation was dismissed.",

The court additionally relied on a bank statement, according to which the money in question had been withdrawn shortly after the applicant\u2019s company had received an advance payment from the municipality. Shortly after the withdrawal, L. had given the money to the applicant. The court also examined two audio recordings seized from L.

It held that all parties to court proceedings had to be able to verify whether Article 111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been complied with. Thus, upon the receipt of a request of a party for the assessment of the legality of a surveillance activity, the court was obliged to verify the existence of an authorisation by a court or the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and identify whether the information used as evidence had indeed been obtained in the course of the authorised activity and during the authorised period. The Supreme Court noted that when determining the legality of surveillance, the court had to ensure the protection of the State secret which served as the reason for the prohibition of disclosure of the materials of the surveillance file at a court hearing. However, the court could disclose its opinion on the lawfulness of the surveillance. The disclosure of the court\u2019s opinion in this regard to the parties had to be recorded in the record of the hearing and, if necessary, in the judgment.",

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest.

The Court considers that the procedure followed by the judicial authorities in the present case failed to adequately counterbalance the difficulties caused to the defence by its restricted access to the surveillance materials. The defence were not informed in an adequate manner of the County Court\u2019s position on why it had been strictly necessary to restrict their rights and they had no possibility of presenting their counterarguments to any such considerations. The Court also takes note, in this regard, of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent case-law, according to which a trial court, even if it was prevented from disclosing materials in a surveillance file, may disclose its opinion on the lawfulness of the surveillance, which opinion must be recorded in the record of the hearing and, if necessary, in a judgment.",
