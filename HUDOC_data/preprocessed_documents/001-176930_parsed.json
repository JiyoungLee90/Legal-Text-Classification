On 1 May this year military police officers came to the military outpost and took me [and two other soldiers] to the [military police] department. They took statements from us there and started to beat us. At night [R.H.] and I were kept in the reception area, sitting on the floor with our hands handcuffed to the walls. I was there until 3\u00a0May, during which time I witnessed only beatings and cries from different rooms where the soldiers were being beaten. On 3 [May], we, 11 soldiers, were brought to the Military Police Department and I was taken to the room of [a senior officer, A.M.] where they started continuously to beat me, now with more brutal methods. They took off my shoes and with a thin branch started to beat the soles of my feet. They were forcing me to give false incriminatory statements. Late at night they would take me to the disciplinary isolation cell. [Several other co-servicemen] were also kept there, while the rest stayed in a common room. About 10 days later, when I was being questioned as a witness, the investigator took off my shoes. I should mention that I was kept in the isolation cell unlawfully, upon an order from the superior. I was held for 10 days for violation of the internal disciplinary code. Every day they would take me to a room and try, by beatings and threats, to force me to give evidence in the way they wanted. At 1 a.m. on 17 or 18 May the investigator came and told me that my girlfriend was in the next room and that if I refused to testify in the way he wanted, bad things would happen to her. They further threatened me that bad things would also happen to my 17-year-old sister. The head of the [operational intelligence] department [M.Gh.] and his deputy [A.Mar.] would also beat me. When I was not able to eat because my teeth were aching from many punches and slaps, they threatened me and used indecent swearwords. One night, as I was being taken back to the isolation cell [the isolation facility officers] noticed the traces of beatings on my body and warned [the military police officers] not to bring me again to the cell in such condition. [The deputy head A.Mar.] started to beat me and curse at me, asking why I had not told [the isolation cell officers] that I had bumped into a door. I could hear the cries and sobbing of other soldiers coming from the rooms. As one police officer was beating me, the other filmed the beatings on his mobile phone and showed the film, in my presence, to his other colleagues and then they would start to humiliate me. They drove me to such a state that I told them I wanted to die. They immediately put a blank sheet of paper in front of me, gave me a pen and said that if I wrote down that I wished to commit suicide they would assist me in doing so. They were proposing that I give false testimony against [R.H.] in the same words as [R.H.] had testified against me ... After my confrontation with [R.H.] ... he started begging me to forgive him and said that he had been unable to withstand the beatings, pain and fear and that he had given false testimony against me as otherwise bad things would have happened to his family. I was kept in [the military police headquarters] and isolation cell not for 10\u00a0days but for 18 days. On 20 May we were taken to the [Arabkir and Kanaker-Zeytun District] court, which ordered our detention. During the court hearing I stated that I had had no involvement in the death of [A.H.] and that I did not plead guilty. On 15 June the investigator, together with my defence lawyer, visited me at the [Nubarashen detention facility] and produced a forensic expert opinion according to which the grains of sand discovered on the soles of my military shoes corresponded to those taken from the site of the crime. I told them that I did not agree with the results of the expert opinion and the investigator threatened to tell the defence lawyer to go out [of the cell] for ten minutes and to [beat me] ... .",

Even though he then learnt of the decision of 23\u00a0September 2006, the applicant did not contest it in separate proceedings but raised his complaint of ill-treatment before the court determining the criminal charge against him (see paragraph 21 above). Therefore, a question arises as to whether the applicant, having found out about the decision on 1\u00a0November 2006, could be expected to initiate separate proceedings to contest it, rather than raising the issue during the upcoming trial, in order for him to be considered to have complied with the requirements of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. The Court considers that a complaint of ill-treatment raised before a trial court could not, as a general rule, be regarded as part of the normal process of exhaustion in respect of complaints of ill-treatment brought before the Court. Nevertheless, there may be exceptional circumstances in which such a procedure may be found to have provided an effective remedy in the particular circumstances of a case (see Akulinin and Babich v. Russia, no.\u00a05742/02, \u00a7\u00a7 25-34, 2 October 2008; Vladimir Fedorov v. Russia, no.\u00a019223/04, \u00a7\u00a7 41-50, 30 July 2009; and Zalyan and Others v. Armenia, nos. 36894/04 and 3521/07, \u00a7\u00a7 235-37, 17 March 2016). In this connection, the Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism, given the context of protecting human rights. This rule is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case (see, among other authorities, Akulinin and Babich, cited above, \u00a7 30; Vladimir Fedorov, cited above, \u00a7 45; and Delijorgji v. Albania, no. 6858/11, \u00a7 54, 28 April 2015).",

The Court has already examined in Zalyan and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 235-37) the question of whether raising allegations of ill-treatment before the courts determining the criminal charge against the applicant could be considered as an effective remedy for a complaint under Article 3, and found that in certain circumstances it could be. In that case, no decision had been taken on the applicants\u2019 allegations of ill-treatment, whereas in the present case, as mentioned above, the applicant did not become aware of the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 23 September 2006 refusing to institute proceedings before 1 November 2006 that is until the close of the investigation. The Court observes, however, that although the decision in question was not made available to the applicant until 1 November 2006, the case was sent to the Syunik Regional Court for examination on the merits as early as 14 November 2006 (see paragraph 21 above). The Syunik Regional Court took cognisance of the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint, stayed the proceedings pending further clarifications from the Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office and ordered a forensic medical examination of the applicant (see paragraphs 22 and 26 above). Furthermore, in addition to his arguments raised before the trial court, the applicant submitted detailed arguments with regard to his alleged ill-treatment in his appeals on points of law (see paragraphs 34, 36 and 40 above). Following the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 22 December 2009, the Court of Cassation eventually examined and dismissed his allegations for lack of evidence, relying on, inter alia, the decision of 23 September 2006 (see paragraph 41 above). It is notable in this respect that the courts examining the applicant\u2019s criminal case had the authority under Articles 41 \u00a7 2 (4) and 184 \u00a7 1 of the CCP to request the prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings and carry out an investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment if there was sufficient evidence to do so and that this procedure has proven to be effective in the past (see Zalyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113, 124, 236 and 237, in which the Court of Cassation quashed the applicants\u2019 convictions on the ground that, inter alia, there was need to investigate their allegations of ill-treatment, after which an investigation was carried out by the prosecutor who eventually refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers).",

In circumstances where the court of highest instance examined and dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment, basing its conclusions on the investigator\u2019s findings reflected in the decision of 23 September 2006, it is not apparent that disputing the same decision via a separate procedure would have been more successful, or would have been decided on the basis of any other issues. Moreover, in the case of Zalyan and Others the courts refused to examine the merits of the applicants\u2019 allegations of ill-treatment on the grounds that they had already been examined and dismissed by the trial court (see Zalyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 236 and 237).

The Court observes that in Zalyan and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 231-33), referring to the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 7 December 2009 (see paragraph 55 above), it found that at the material time there had been no clear, effective and accessible remedies available to the applicants against the alleged inaction of the investigating authorities in respect of their complaints of ill-treatment.

That complaint was sufficiently detailed, containing precise dates, locations and the names of the alleged perpetrators. In the Court\u2019s opinion, it can therefore be considered as an \u201carguable claim\u201d. It is true that the applicant\u2019s complaint was lodged with a month\u2019s delay after the alleged illtreatment. However, the Court does not consider the delay to be of such duration as to deprive the complaint ipso facto of any substance or prospects of success. Furthermore, the absence of medical certificates does not affect this finding. The authorities thus had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations.",

Moreover, his complaint was referred to A.K., the investigator in charge of the investigation of the same criminal case, who eventually decided not to prosecute the military police officers in question. The Court observes that from the point of view of organisational hierarchy, the military police is a distinct body subordinate to the Ministry of Defence and not to the Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which forms part of the prosecution authority. However, considering that investigator A.K. was called upon to investigate the actions of military police officers who had been involved in the preliminary investigation of the criminal case to which he had been assigned, and that the outcome of the inquiry into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment would have necessarily had implications for the admissibility of evidence in that case, the Court cannot consider such an investigation to satisfy the requirement of independence. It is noteworthy that investigator A.K.\u2019s decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings contained generalised conclusions lacking any reasoning. More importantly, no explanation was provided as to why the statements of the military police officers were considered more credible than the applicant\u2019s account of the events (see paragraph 17 above). It therefore appears that the investigating authority, without any justification, gave preference to the evidence provided by the police officers (compare, Nalbandyan v. Armenia, nos.\u00a09935/06 and 23339/06, \u00a7 123, 31 March 2015).",

In particular, according to the relevant records, M.Gh., A.Mar. and A.M. were questioned on 21 September 2006 (see paragraph 16 above). No other measures were undertaken during the three months preceding the interviews or thereafter whereas A.K. made his decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings against the officers in question already on 23\u00a0September 2006, merely relying on their statements and the letter from the head of the disciplinary isolation facility (see paragraph 17 above).

The Court further observes that the applicant was not subjected to a medical examination until one year after the alleged ill-treatment, following the decision of the Syunik Regional Court. Owing to its belated conduct and the absence of any medical documents, the medical examination did not produce any useful conclusions (see paragraph 23 above).",
