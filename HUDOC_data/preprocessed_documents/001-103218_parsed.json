Turkey, no. 25656/94, \u00a7 264, ECHR 2002). Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series\u00a0A no. 25). In the present case, the applicant alleged that she had heard from her son that he had been ill-treated, a statement that is not supported by any other material in the case-file. It is particularly noteworthy that Yevgeniy Geppa never lodged any complaints regarding ill-treatment, even though the alleged beatings predated his death by several months. Moreover, it does not appear that he instructed the applicant to do so on his behalf, although he had clearly had the opportunity to do so during her visits on 5 August 2004 and 17 October 2004, when the beatings were allegedly mentioned. The inquiries into the applicant's allegations of her son's illtreatment took place while he was still alive, and he made no statements to that effect when interviewed by the inspectors. While the Court is mindful of the applicant's argument that he did not wish to complain for fear of reprisals, it cannot establish the fact of ill-treatment if the only reliable information about it had been voluntarily withheld by the alleged victim of violence. It observes that there is nothing in the case file that would point to any other potential sources of relevant information. Accordingly the Court is unable to take any investigative steps beyond those already taken by the domestic inspectors who investigated the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment.",

In the four years preceding the transfer he underwent three periods of in-patient treatment at the hospital of the Penitentiary Department in  for chronic pyelonephritis of his only kidney and a post-traumatic brain lesion. He had also been diagnosed with epileptic syndrome in the past. On account of the above conditions he was registered with the colony medical unit as requiring regular supervision. It appears that before the incident of 5 August 2004, when he fainted during the family visit to the colony, he did not require any examination or treatment except for the routine supervision of those conditions. As regards that episode, the Court considers that it must be viewed against the background of his medical history. It observes that after having fainted during the family visit Yevgeniy Geppa was immediately taken to the medical unit, where he was examined and diagnosed with epileptic syndrome and given an injection of seduxen. It was not unreasonable on the part of the medical personnel to assume that they were dealing with a routine outbreak of a chronic condition. Any doubts they might have had concerning the possible aggravation of his condition were adequately addressed by the follow-up decision to transfer Yevgeniy Geppa to the hospital of the Penitentiary Department in  for further examination and treatment.

The Court has held on numerous occasions that an obligation to investigate \u201cis not an obligation of result, but of means\u201d: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant's account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible.

Following her complaint of 21 December 2004, the prosecutors' office conducted an on-site inquiry during which they questioned the colony officials and inmates about any episodes of ill-treatment they could have been privy to or injuries they may have noticed on him. None of those persons corroborated the allegations of ill-treatment or the use of force. Based on their statements and the medical file the prosecutor's office refused to open a criminal investigation.",

In the first three rounds the courts found the inquiry incomplete and gave instructions to the prosecutor's office as to the further steps to be taken. They required, in particular, that the investigators look into the possible traumatic origin of the tumour of which Yevgeniy Geppa had died and also assess the adequacy of the medical treatment he had received. In the decision of 30 September 2005 the court held, in addition, that it was indispensable to address these issues properly in criminal proceedings. However, in its subsequent decision of 25 April 2006 the same court was satisfied with the content of the investigation file and no longer required a criminal case to be opened in order to address those issues.",

As to its substance, it addressed the two allegations made by the applicant, that is, the allegation of ill-treatment and the allegation of medical negligence. The part of the inquiry concerning the alleged ill-treatment was also preceded by inquiries into the complaints which the applicant had brought while Yevgeniy Geppa was still alive. The Court has found above that the authorities were justified in having found these allegations unsubstantiated, particularly in view of Yevgeniy Geppa's own silence on the matter (see paragraph 75 above). Moreover, as the Court also found above, it sees no obvious omissions on the part of the authorities in their attempts to gather evidence on this issue (loc. cit.).",

The Court considers that the final decision concerning the absence of grounds for opening a criminal investigation was reasonable and sufficiently argued on the basis of the information received in reply. Although it took several rounds of judicial review for the investigation to address this point in a satisfactory manner, the shortcomings had been duly corrected and the final procedural decision was taken within reasonable time.",
