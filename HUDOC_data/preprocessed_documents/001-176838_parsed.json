In that regard, it noted that the applicant and his entire family had lived on social security since 2001, that his command of the German language was insufficient and that he had no prospects of employment. Considering that his wife was also a Turkish national, that his children were of a young age and that his parents owned a holiday home in Turkey, there was a risk that the applicant would abscond to Turkey with his family. This risk could not be adequately remedied by reporting requirements or payment of security.",

He argued that the prison sentence he risked incurring could not provide an incentive for him to leave Germany for Turkey noting, in particular, that he had already spent some time in detention and that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office had, before the District Court, pleaded for a prison sentence of two years and ten months.

Considering that the applicant had debts and lived on social security, it was not realistic to expect him to pay for the costs of the proceedings. Hence, even if he were to appear for trial and, if convicted, for the enforcement of his sentence, the family would not get their money back in this scenario. This would, in fact, make his absconding more likely. If, on the contrary, the family furnished the security directly to the courts, there would be no risk that their claim for repayment of the security would be attached for payment, as the authorities had no claims against the family. This would have given him an incentive not to abscond. The position taken by the family merely reflected their unwillingness to pay for the costs of the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The applicant argued that the motivation behind the Court of Appeal\u2019s request that he furnish the security himself was, hence, to ensure that the authorities\u2019 claim against him concerning the costs of the proceedings could be enforced.

In so far as the authorities could, at a later point in time, attach the applicant\u2019s future repayment claim for payment against their claim to cover the costs of the proceedings, this would only become relevant under two conditions: First, the applicant\u2019s conviction had to become final, which was not clear at the time the Court of Appeal took its decision, given that both the applicant and the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office had appealed against the District Court\u2019s judgment and that the Regional Court had not yet rendered a decision on the appeal. Second, the applicant would have had to fail to pay for the costs of the proceedings.

The assessment of whether the risk of absconding can be avoided by bail must principally be made with reference to the accused, his assets and his relationship with the persons who are to provide the security, in other words to the degree of confidence in the likelihood that the prospect of loss of security or of action against the guarantors in case of his non-appearance at the trial will act as a sufficient deterrent to dispel any wish on his part to abscond (Mangouras, cited above, \u00a7 78; Neumeister, cited above, \u00a7 14).",

As to whether the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding could be avoided by way of requesting security, the Court of Appeal insisted that the security be furnished by him, rather than by his family, and argued that the unwillingness of the applicant\u2019s family to put the necessary means at his disposal indicated that they lacked confidence in him and concluded that the applicant\u2019s ties to his family appeared not to be sufficiently strong to prevent him from risking the forfeiture of the security by absconding (see paragraph 20 above).",

The reasons given are relevant and sufficient. Even if the security payment might be forfeited at a later point in time if specific conditions are fulfilled, the authorities\u2019 assessment concerning the relationship between the applicant and his family, based on the information before them, cannot be considered as arbitrary. This is all the more so as the applicant had already been convicted at the first instance level. The Court considers that no different conclusions can be drawn from the subsequent stay of the execution of the detention order, as that decision was based on different factual circumstances. In particular, the applicant\u2019s conviction had become final and he no longer risked incurring a more severe sentence.",

The Court reiterates that not every flaw discovered in a detention order renders the underlying detention as such unlawful for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (Mooren, cited above, \u00a7 74). Rather, a detention order should only be considered as ex facie invalid, which would in turn render the applicant\u2019s detention based on that order unlawful for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, if the flaw in the order amounted to a \u201cgross and obvious irregularity\u201d in the exceptional sense indicated by the Court\u2019s case-law (ibid., \u00a7 75).

Noting that the case-law of the domestic courts provided that a detention order that was flawed in such a way as the one at hand was defective in law, but not void, and remained a valid basis for detention (see paragraph 25 above), the Court considers that the flaw at issue did not amount to a \u201cgross and obvious irregularity\u201d.",
