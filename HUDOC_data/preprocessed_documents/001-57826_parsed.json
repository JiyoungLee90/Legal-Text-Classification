The police officers claimed to have detected a strong smell of alcohol on her breath when they checked her driving licence. She agreed to be breathalysed. Despite having been shown what to do, she proved unable to provide a specimen of breath satisfactorily and was therefore told that she would have to accompany the police officers to the local hospital in order to have a blood test.",

First, the police officers could not know whether the plaintiff would have allowed them access to her flat at all. Secondly, the plaintiff would have had an opportunity of consuming more alcohol or at least claiming that she had done so, thereby making ascertainment of her blood alcohol level impossible or significantly more difficult to obtain.",

This case has arisen from an encounter between the first applicant Hildegard Klaas, then accompanied by her eight year-old daughter Monika, on 28 January 1986, with two male police officers. At the time of the encounter the applicant Hildegard Klaas was 48 years old and the police officers were respectively 26 years old and 33 years old. On that date the applicant had apparently driven her motor car, in which her daughter was a passenger, through a red traffic light. That incident did not result in any damage to person or property, but had apparently been observed by the two police officers who followed her to the back entrance to the block of flats where she lived to which she had driven her motor car. Because the police detected a smell of alcohol on her breath she was requested to take a breathalyser test. The applicant apparently failed to do this satisfactorily in the sense that there appeared to be some breathing difficulty on her part and when requested she agreed to undergo a blood test. As that test would involve her going to the police station she was formally arrested by one of the police officers who physically restrained her. There is no doubt that, as from that moment, she was in the custody of the police. All the subsequent injuries sustained by the applicant accordingly took place during that period of custody. I cannot therefore accept as a valid distinction the fact that in the case of Tomasi v.  (see the judgment of 27 August 1992, Series A no. 241-A), the applicant had been in custody for many hours. Whether one is in the custody of the police for but a few minutes or for a few days makes no difference to the principle involved. When the police take a person into custody they have automatically assumed the duty and obligation to save such person from harm whether from members of the police or from any other party. Once a person\u2019s liberty has been restrained by the police, she or he is in police custody, whether or not formal words of arrest have been pronounced. Once it has been established that physical injury has been sustained by such person while in police custody, the burden falls upon the police or their State to show that such injuries were not caused or brought about by the actions of the police or their want of care.",

The findings of the first doctor were subsequently confirmed by other doctors and photographs were taken on 29 January which showed what her then condition was. The distinguished Delegate of the Commission, Professor Frowein, was justified in urging upon the Court that the present case was of considerable importance for laying down the standard to be applied under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention by police officers when dealing with a normal, non-dangerous citizen in the performance of their duties. He submitted that the use of force by police officers resulting in important injuries must be seen as inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention if it cannot be shown that the force used was necessary to accomplish the lawful duties of the police officers. I think he was correct in this submission. It is already well established in the jurisprudence of both the Commission and the Court that people who are clearly injured while in police custody must be presumed to have been treated in violation of Article 3 (art. 3) when no explanation to the contrary is given by the State which, as Professor Frowein submitted, is the only institution which can submit a proof to the contrary.",

The parties had gone to that point so that the applicant could hand the care of her eight year-old daughter over to a neighbour. The police appeared to form the opinion then that she intended to seek refuge in the neighbour\u2019s house and thereupon proceeded to handcuff her and the injuries were incurred during that episode. In subsequent investigation and court hearings the police could offer no greater explanation than that the applicant had caused the injuries herself and that they, the police, did not do anything which could have caused them. The  which dealt with the civil proceedings felt that it could not rely upon the direct evidence of either the applicant or her daughter or of the two policemen on the grounds that each had an interest in telling a particular story. In effect the court then appears to have speculated on how the matter had arisen and ultimately it came to the conclusion that the applicant, on whom was the burden of proof in those proceedings, had not established her case.",

While the Court would not lightly discard the Commission\u2019s findings of primary facts it is free to draw its own inferences from the facts and is ultimately free to make its own appreciation of the whole case in the light of the materials before it. In the present case the Commission unanimously held that the police, and therefore the State, was answerable for the injuries suffered by the applicant. A minority of the Commission found that they were not sufficiently substantial to amount to a breach of Article 3 (art. 3) but the majority of the Commission held that there had been a breach of Article 3 (art. 3). All the Commission were unanimous on the point that there had been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) so far as the first applicant was concerned. Unlike the German courts in the civil proceedings, the Commission took the view that the burden of proof fell upon the police and upon the State. This clearly had not been discharged.

In view of the unanimous findings on the fact by the Commission and the absence of a positive finding by the German court on the primary facts, there does not appear to me to be any reasonable justification for taking a completely opposing view of the facts. It is not in dispute that a considerable amount of violence had occurred, which included twisting the applicant\u2019s arm behind her back and handcuffing both her arms behind her back and physically pulling her along with them. This had been sought to be justified by the police on the grounds that she was resisting arrest, but she had already been arrested after having failed the breathalyser test (see paragraph 1 above). The police could not, however, offer any explanation as to how the injuries which were evidenced by the photographs came about, nor as to whether she was caused pain by jerking upon her handcuffed arms. It was admitted by the police that she did not have the head injury when they first met her. The explanation was that \"she might have got this injury\" during the altercation which was alleged to have ensued when she was placed in handcuffs. In view of the fact that this lady had no police record of any description and no reputation of violence or association with any persons who might be thought to indulge in violent activities, the police approach to her was one which could be fairly described as being heavy-handed. There was no question of her being drunk though the police approach to her on this subject is revealing. The analysis of her blood shows that her blood alcohol exceeded 0.8 per ml by 0.02 per ml, notwithstanding which the police charged her with the criminal offence of driving while under the influence of alcohol (drunken driving), a charge which was subsequently dropped by the public prosecutor\u2019s office on the ground that there was no evidence upon which such an opinion could reasonably be formed. In fact, the applicant was never brought before any criminal court.",
