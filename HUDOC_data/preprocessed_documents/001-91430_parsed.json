In particular, the applicants\u2019 complaints concerned not only the nullification of their title but also the alleged lack of adequate compensation and the legal and practical developments in this respect after 2000. The Court has held that the assessment of the hardship suffered by the applicants and the adequacy of the compensation actually obtained, in one form or another, including the possibilities for the applicants to secure a new home for themselves, is a decisive element in the examination of the complaints of this type (see Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7190).",

The Court considers that, as a result, the applicants forewent the opportunity to obtain at least between 15% and 25% of the value of the property taken away from them (assessed in accordance with the relevant regulations), as that was the rate at which bonds were traded until the end of 2004. The fact that bond prices rose at the end of 2004 or that the applicable law was amended with effect as of 2007 and provided for payment of the bonds at face value cannot lead to the conclusion that the authorities would have secured adequate compensation for the applicants. Indeed, the applicants could not have foreseen bond prices or legislative amendments and the Court cannot speculate whether they would have waited four or more years before cashing their bonds. Furthermore, the legislation on compensation changed frequently and was not foreseeable (Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191 and 226). As the Court ruled in Velikovi and Others, the applicants\u2019 failure to use the bonds compensation scheme must be taken in consideration under Article 41, but cannot affect decisively the outcome of their Article 1 Protocol 1 complaint.",
