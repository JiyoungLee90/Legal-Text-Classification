For a claim to be capable of being considered an \u201casset\u201d falling within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the claimant must establish that it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it.

While the decision obliged the Government and the National Bank of  to determine the sources of financing compensation payments, it did not make the executive's ability to identify such sources a condition of the right to obtain compensation. Therefore, the Government's introduction of additional conditions for the payment of compensation such as the setting aside of money for that purpose in the State budget (see paragraph 9 above), while reasonable per se, had not been contemplated in Parliament's decision and could not affect the applicant's right to obtain compensation. The court judgments in the applicant's case give support to this view: while the Ministry's only defence was the unavailability of money in the State budget earmarked for compensation purposes, the courts found the Ministry liable for failing to pay. In so doing, the courts did not consider it necessary to verify whether the budget for 2002, when the judgments were adopted, provided for the payment of compensation outstanding under the 1994 decision.",

More money was available in 2001 and yet the applicant did not receive anything until 2004, despite a final court judgment ordering the payment in 2002. The Court is aware of the fact that the Bank became a commercial bank in the meantime, but it also notes that the scheme established for paying the relevant compensation continued to be implemented through that bank.

The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see Iatridis v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 1999II).",
