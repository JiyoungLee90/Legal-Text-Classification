Regarding the amended first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act, expanding the retroactive scope of the reform beyond the one adopted was not necessary as the basic principles of legal certainty and legitimate expectations had to be respected. Those principles were also necessarily inherent in the Convention, meaning that even though the inheritance rights of children born outside marriage fell within the scope of the protection of Article\u00a08 of the Convention, a State was dispensed from reopening legal acts or reviewing situations that pre-dated the delivery of a court judgment.

He referred in particular to the Court\u2019s ruling in Brauer (cited above). In his appeal of 16 November 2009 he argued that under Article 6 \u00a7 5 of the Basic Law, according to which children born outside marriage are to be provided by legislation with the same opportunities for physical and mental development and for their position in society as those enjoyed by children born within marriage, there were no reasons why children born outside marriage should be treated differently from those born within marriage. If he was refused the certificate the German State would be liable for compensation claims (see paragraphs\u00a09 and 11 above).",

Nevertheless, he explicitly stated that a refusal of the inheritance certificate on the grounds of his status as a child born outside marriage would discriminate against him. He further claimed a right to his father\u2019s estate and argued that he would have a compensation claim against the German State if he was refused that certificate. Under those circumstances, the Court finds that the first applicant has, at least in substance, raised the complaint before the domestic courts. Furthermore, the Federal Constitutional Court decided in substance on the first applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint (see paragraphs 25-28). As a consequence, the first applicant must be regarded as having complied with the requirements under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for an exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

The retroactive extension of the amendment to the date of the Court\u2019s judgment in Brauer (cited above) had struck a proportionate balance between the interests of descendants affected by that amendment and those of children born outside marriage. The fact that under domestic law an heir acquired the estate upon a decedent\u2019s death without any further legal action necessary precluded a more far-reaching change of that legal provision. Furthermore, it would cause legal and practical problems in inheritance cases where the estate had already been divided between the heirs. Proportionality, therefore, had not required a further expansion of the retroactive effect of the law, particularly with regard to the principle of legal certainty and the underlying principles set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in Marckx (cited above).",

The Court notes in this connection the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s reasoning that, in the light of Brauer (cited above), more farreaching retroactivity would have compromised the principle of legal certainty, which was necessarily inherent in the law of the Convention, as in European Law (see paragraph 27 above).

The Court further considers that it is true, as argued by the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 26 above), that introducing a cut-off date for the applicability of a new regulation correcting past injustices is not discriminatory as such and is an adequate means for achieving clarity and preserving legal certainty.",

The Court considers that this fact is sufficient to prove that the subsequent heirs\u2019 position with regard to their rights to the deceased\u2019s estate was known to be controversial. That also seems to be reflected by the fact that the subsequent heirs did not apply for an inheritance certificate themselves, but were only named as heirs after the first applicant had again applied for an inheritance certificate. Furthermore, it has to be taken into account in the first applicant\u2019s case that he had already been in possession of the inheritance for a certain period of time (compare paragraph 8 above).",

The legitimate heirs should therefore have known that the event of succession, even though the estate had devolved onto them, did not exclude the right of other heirs to a statutory share of the estate or to bring a claim for a compulsory portion and that such an action was capable of calling into question the rights to the estate as such or the extent of the rights of each of the descendants (compare Fabris, cited above, \u00a7 68).
