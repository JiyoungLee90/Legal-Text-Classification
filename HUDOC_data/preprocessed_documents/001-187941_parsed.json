If there is a good reason for the witness\u2019s non-attendance in that sense, it follows that there is a good reason, or justification, for the trial court to admit the untested statements of the absent witness as evidence (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7 119). There are a number of reasons why a witness may not attend trial (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 120-125), including situations where the witness has proved to be untraceable (see Tseber v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 48, 22 November 2012, and Pai\u0107 v.

The trial court did not initiate any further measures to locate H.H. and S.K. on Armenian territory, and nor did it resort, for example, to international legal assistance in order to locate A.S., M.M. and S.G., who were apparently abroad.",

It appears from its judgment that the Regional Court also took into account: the testimony of more than twenty witnesses obtained during the pre-trial and trial stages; the records of confrontations conducted as part of the investigation; a forensic medical examination report; a complex ballistic and fingerprint examination report; a complex ballistic and forensic chemical examination report; the record of an investigatory experiment; the records of an operative-investigative measure; a vehicle inspection report concerning H.H.\u2019s and the second applicant\u2019s cars; a crime scene inspection report; a number plate recognition report concerning the second applicant\u2019s car; transcripts of calls to and from several telephone numbers; and a complex forensic fibre examination report (see paragraph 39 above).",

Even though this evidence may not have constituted the sole evidence in the case, it was at least decisive as far as the applicants\u2019 involvement was concerned. This is all the more so as the other evidence available to the courts appears to have been inconclusive. Moreover, in respect of this evidence, the Regional Court was obliged to provide the applicants with an opportunity to organise their defence in an appropriate way and put forward all their relevant arguments. Instead, the court based its conclusions on witness evidence which had never been examined at the hearing (contrast Kashlev v.\u00a0Estonia, no. , \u00a7 47, 26\u00a0April 2016). In these circumstances, the failure of the Regional Court to hear in person the witnesses H.H., A.S., M.M., S.G. and S.K. \u2013 whose statements were later used against the applicants \u2013 was capable of substantially affecting the applicants\u2019 defence rights.",

In the case of Schatschaschwili, the following elements were identified by the Grand Chamber as being relevant in this context: the trial court\u2019s approach to the untested evidence, the availability and strength of further incriminating evidence, and the procedural measures taken to compensate for the lack of opportunity to directly cross-examine witnesses at the trial (see Schatschaschwili, \u00a7 145, and Pai\u0107, \u00a7 38, both cited above).",

In any event, all evidence should have been tested before the courts. Furthermore, there is nothing in the Regional Court\u2019s judgment to indicate that it approached the untested evidence with any specific caution, and nor did it seem to attach less weight to such statements (compare, for example, Al-Khawaja and Tahery, \u00a7 157, and Pai\u0107, \u00a7 43, both cited above).",
