However, as the Court has held on a number of occasions, courts, when excluding the public from criminal proceedings, must limit secrecy to the extent strictly necessary to preserve a compelling government interest (see Romanova v. Russia, no.\u00a023215/02, \u00a7\u00a0155, 11 October 2011, with further references). Contrary to what the Government have argued in their submissions, even in the absence of requests from the applicant to resume open hearings, it was for the Presiding judge of the trial court to continuously question the necessity to bar the public from the courtroom and to ensure the transparency of the proceedings to the maximum extent possible. The Government, on the other hand, did not argue \u2013 and there is no indication to the contrary in the documents submitted by the parties \u2013 that it was not open to the Regional Court to return to the public trial after a single or, if need be, a number of non-public sessions during which the classified documents or information had been examined (see Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, \u00a7\u00a084, 4 December 2008, and Romanova, cited above, \u00a7 156).

In the present case, due to the peculiarities of a jury trial, the scope of appeal review, by virtue of Article 379 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force at the material time, was strictly limited to questions of law and sentencing (see Sutyagin, cited above).
