Austria, no. 35115/97, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 2000XII). Admittedly, it was incumbent on the domestic judicial authorities to protect the safety and security of the people present in the courtroom. However, in the Court\u2019s view, security measures should be narrowly tailored and comply with the principle of necessity. The judicial authorities should thoroughly consider all possible alternatives to ensure safety and security in the courtroom and give preference to a less strict measure over a stricter one when it can achieve the same purpose. Moreover, if the trial court had indeed taken into account certain information, that information should have been presented to the parties, in particular the applicant, to permit an open discussion of the matter. However, no such effort was made by the trial court in the present case.",
