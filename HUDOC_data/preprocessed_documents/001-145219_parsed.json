However, as regards such companies undergoing insolvency proceedings and/or those which have ceased to exist, the Court concluded that \u201ca constitutional appeal should, in principle, be considered as an effective domestic remedy\u201d in respect of \u201call applications lodged from 22 June 2012 onwards\u201d (Marinkovi\u0107, cited above). The Court explained that in the former context the Constitutional Court had still only been prepared to award the appellants compensation for the non-pecuniary damage sustained, but that in the latter context its case-law had evolved, meaning that appellants were being provided with compensation for both the pecuniary and the non-pecuniary damage suffered (ibid.).",

Serbia (dec.), no. 65713/13, 26 November 2013; see\u00a0also paragraph 69 above). The constitutional appeal was therefore also to be deemed as an effective domestic remedy in respect of that last remaining category of cases starting with 4\u00a0October 2013 (ibid.).",

On the other hand, however, it would be disproportionate to require the applicants to turn to the Constitutional Court for redress more than three and five years, respectively, after they had already lodged their applications with the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Cvetkovi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 17271/04, \u00a7 41, 10 June 2008; and Piki\u0107, cited above). Indeed, should they now be rejected for non-exhaustion, the applicants could no longer file their constitutional appeals due to the deadline set out in Article 84 \u00a7 1 of the Constitutional Court Act, which would have expired thirty days following the enforcement of each judgment rendered in favour of the applicants respectively (see paragraph 52 above; compare and contrast to Nogolica and Brusco, both cited above, where there was no such obstacle).",

Of course, unlike in the present case, this referred to a situation where neither kind of compensation had yet been paid, but there is no obvious implication in this decision, or indeed in Marinkovi\u0107 thereafter, to the effect that the appellants whose judgments had in the meantime been enforced should subsequently turn to the Constitutional Court for compensation of any non-pecuniary harm suffered (Milunovi\u0107 and \u010cekrli\u0107, and Marinkovi\u0107, all cited above). It was only in Ferizovi\u0107, most recently, that the Court unequivocally held that the constitutional appeal should be considered as an effective remedy in respect of all socially/State owned companies as of 4\u00a0October 2013, including companies such as the debtor in the present case (i.e. one undergoing restructuring; see Ferizovi\u0107, cited above).",
