France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V). Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits (see Zarb Adami v. Malta (dec.), no. 17209/02, 24 May 2005). However, the rule\u00a0of exhaustion of domestic remedies requires an applicant to have normal recourse to remedies within the national legal system which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2009...).

The Court notes that lodging a constitutional application involves a referral to the First Hall of the  and the possibility of an appeal to the . The Court has already held that this is a cumbersome procedure, especially since practice shows that appeals to the Constitutional Court are lodged as a matter of course (see Sabeur Ben Ali v. , no. 35892/97, \u00a7 40, 29 June 2000 and Kadem v. , no. 55263/00, \u00a7 53, 9 January 2003, where the Court held that the relevant proceedings are invariably longer than what would qualify as \u201cspeedy\u201d for Article 5 \u00a7 4 purposes). The length of these proceedings is furthermore aggravated by the fact that they may be adjourned sine die pending any proceedings concerning the substantive complaints before this Court.

The Court further observes that the applicants\u2019 statement that they were not aware that Dr M. was the Chief Justice\u2019s judicial assistant, confirms that, in the impugned proceedings, Dr M. had not taken any witness testimony or affidavits, nor received documents produced with any testimony, or held sittings or issued deadlines for the submission of evidence, pleadings or other judicial acts by the parties.

Moreover, the permit was revoked in 1986 and no other permit was issued until ten years later. Indeed it has not been contested that this type of permit was at all times precarious and could be withdrawn at the discretion of the Government. Thus, the applicant made use of the public property in question for approximately twenty years on the sufferance of the authorities and that of his family, who for a period of time were also without a valid permit. In consequence, unlike the majority of the Turkish cases mentioned above, at no point did the applicants have a valid title in respect of the use of the mooring. Moreover, even though the procedure to apply for permits appears to be unclear in law, the Court also gives weight to the fact that the applicant did not take any action to regularise his position once the COL\u2019s powers were abolished in favour of the MMA in 1991. The Court considers that had the first applicant believed he had a legitimate expectation to obtain a permit on the basis of the permit bequeathed to him or on the basis of the unhindered use he had made of the mooring for a number of years, he could have at least been expected to take action to have the alleged proprietary interest recognised and enforced by the MMA as the newly competent authority.",
