Belgium (Article\u00a050), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore the applicant\u2019s title to the flat and to annul the eviction order. Thus, the applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which she would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare with Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).",
