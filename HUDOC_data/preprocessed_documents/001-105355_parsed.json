In a number of cases against  the Court has found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 on that account (see Nakhmanovich v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a055669/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a067-68, 2\u00a0March 2006; Korchuganova v.

As in many previous Russian cases, the applicant\u2019s detention for an indefinite period of time (which was only limited by the maximum duration of such detention, provided for in the CCrP) was ordered by a simple phrase that the measure of restraint (detention) \u201cshould remain unchanged\u201d (compare the case of Ignatov, cited above, \u00a7 78; see also Nakhmanovich, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, and Sta\u0161aitis v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a047679/99, \u00a7\u00a067, 21 March 2002).

The Court concluded that the absence of sufficiently precise rules concerning the legal grounds for detention following the return of the case to the prosecutor, combined with the authorities\u2019 failure to refer to applicable legal norms when extending the detention, seriously affected the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the applicant\u2019s detention.",

That assertion is open to doubt. In the case of Shteyn (cited above, \u00a7 16) the domestic courts regarded detention after the remittal of the case from the trial court to the prosecution as detention \u201cpending investigation\u201d, governed by Article 109 of the CCrP. Indeed, in the case of Shteyn the remittal of the case to the prosecution was upheld by the court of appeal, whereas in the present case it was overturned (see the decision of 13 March 2003).

It must be established whether the grounds given by the judicial authorities could justify the deprivation of liberty. The existence and persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention. However, after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0152-153, ECHR 2000-IV).

When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at trial (see Jablonski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7\u00a083, 21 December 2000).",

Furthermore, the Government claimed that the appellate hearing had been adjourned by the court from 5 March until 13\u00a0March 2003 owing to the failure of the defence lawyers to produce powers of attorney. Those facts are not contested by the applicant, so the Court finds them established. In sum, out of the seventy-eight days that elapsed between the date of the detention order and the date of its confirmation by the court of appeal, only one month and eighteen days are attributable to the authorities. Nevertheless, in the light of its consistent case-law the Court finds that even that delay, in view of the complexity of the case and other relevant factors, is excessive and cannot be considered compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (compare, for example, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, ECHR\u00a02000-XII, where the review proceedings which lasted twenty-three days were not \u201cspeedy\u201d, and Mamedova, cited above, \u00a7 96; where the appeal proceedings lasted thirty-six, twenty-six, thirty-six, and twenty-nine days).

The Government did not contest those figures. The Court observes that it usually calculates delays attributable to the authorities from the date the competent court received the statement of appeal (see the Court\u2019s findings regarding the detention order of 24\u00a0December 2002 above; see also Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 99 et seq.). The materials of the case file show that the appeal against the second decision was received by the District Court on 18\u00a0July 2003. The date of the introduction of the appeals against the first detention order is unknown, whereas the appeal against the third detention order was signed by the applicant\u2019s lawyers on 30 July 2003. In such circumstances, and in absence of the Government\u2019s comments on this point, the Court finds that the appeals against the above three detention orders were introduced on 2\u00a0July 2003 for the first one (that is, the date of the detention order itself), 18\u00a0July 2003 for the second (the actual date of receipt of the appeal by the District Court), and 30 July 2003 for the third detention order (the date indicated on the statement of appeal). It follows that the periods attributable to the authorities amounted to sixty-two days, forty-six days and thirty-five days respectively.",

They appear to have been referring to the duty of the court to give the parties two weeks\u2019 advance notice of the upcoming appeal hearing. However, the fact that the courts had to comply with some domestic formalities does not absolve the State from its obligations under the Convention. Furthermore, the Court observes that the domestic law applied the same two-week notice period to the appeal proceedings on the merits and the appeal proceedings concerning detention. The Court reiterates that detention proceedings should be conducted speedily, sometimes at the expense of certain other procedural guarantees (see the Court\u2019s finding in Jablonski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a093, where it held that there was special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending). This is why detention proceedings should only comply with the most basic, \u201cminimal\u201d guarantees of fairness (if compared with the more rigorous standard of fairness established under Article 6 of the Convention \u2013 see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a076). The Court does not need to take a stand as to whether the two-week notice period for the preparation of an appeal in detention proceedings is sufficient or excessive per se. The Court simply finds that in the circumstances of the case, which was, by all appearances, quite simple, the application of this rule unnecessarily protracted the detention proceedings. The Court does not see why that period could not have been shorter. Lastly, the delays involved in the examination of the appeal in the present case were longer than two weeks, and the Government has not provided any explanation for the remaining time. The Court concludes that the appeals against the detention orders of 2, 9 and 21 July were not examined speedily. There has therefore been a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 on that account.",

Since the Government denied the very existence of the detention order of 7 October 2003, they did not make any comments as to the appeal proceedings. The Court observes that \u201cwhere domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, in particular, as concerns the speediness of the review by the appellate body of a detention order imposed by the lower court\u201d (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7 96). This was said in respect of the requirement for speedy review, but it is a fortiori true in respect of the right of access to the court of appeal. From 7 October 2003 the applicant\u2019s detention was covered by a new detention order, and the applicant had the right to challenge it even though it applied only until 21\u00a0October 2003. After his conviction of 21 October 2003 it was no longer necessary to decide on the applicant\u2019s continued detention, since the applicant, in terms of the Convention, was from that day forward detained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a).

Thus, in the case of Ferrantelli and Santangelo (cited above, \u00a7 59), the Court held that the applicants\u2019 fear as to the lack of impartiality of a judge sitting in their case, after he had already examined the case of a co-accused, was justified. The Court noted that, in the judgment against the co-accused, that judge had made certain findings concerning the applicants\u2019 participation in the imputed criminal offences. In particular, the applicants had been referred to as \u201cco-perpetrators\u201d and their roles in the criminal offences had been described in detail. Moreover, the judgment convicting the applicants cited numerous extracts from the first judgment (see, for similar reasoning, the case of Rojas Morales v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a039676/98, \u00a7\u00a033, 16\u00a0November 2000).",

Germany, no.\u00a075737/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037 et seq., 10 August 2006, and Poppe v. the Netherlands, no. 32271/04, \u00a7 22 et seq., 24 March 2009). The Court stated that the mere fact that a judge had already tried a co-accused was not, in itself, sufficient to cast doubt on that judge\u2019s impartiality in that applicant\u2019s case. The work of the criminal courts, as a matter of practice, frequently involves judges presiding over various trials in which a number of co-accused persons stand charged. The Court considers that the work of criminal courts would be rendered impossible if, by that fact alone, a judge\u2019s impartiality could be called into question. An examination is needed, however, to determine whether the earlier judgments contained findings that actually prejudged the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt. In Schwarzenberger, cited above, the Court emphasised that the assessment of facts in the judgment given against the applicant clearly differed from that in the judgment against the co-accused. The judgment convicting the applicant did not contain any references to the judgment against the co-accused, showing that the judges had given fresh consideration to the applicant\u2019s case. Further, in the judgment against the co-accused, the established facts about the applicant\u2019s involvement in the crimes were essentially based on the co-accused\u2019s submissions, and thus did not constitute the Regional Court\u2019s assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt. In Poppe, cited above, the Court gave a more detailed reasoning on that last point, finding it decisive that the applicant\u2019s name had been mentioned only in passing in the judgments against the co-accused and that the trial judges had not addressed, determined or assessed whether the applicant\u2019s involvement fulfilled all the relevant criteria necessary to constitute a criminal offence and, if so, whether the applicant was guilty of having committed such an offence. On the basis of those elements, the Court distinguished the cases of Schwarzenberger and Poppe from Ferrantelli and Santangelo (cited above) and Rojas Morales (cited above) (see also Thomann\u00a0v.\u00a0Switzerland, 10\u00a0June 1996, \u00a7\u00a035, Reports 1996-III, where the court noted that in the second round of the proceedings the judges had been in no way bound by their first decision and had reconsidered the whole case with all the issues raised by the case remaining open; see also, mutatis mutandis, the Court\u2019s reasoning in the case of Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July, cited above, \u00a7 79).",

However, Judge K. mentioned Mr M.\u2019s judgment not as a source of information, but in passing, when speaking of the proceedings concerning other members of the gang in the opening paragraphs of the judgment. There is no direct evidence that the findings of Mr M.\u2019s judgment were somehow relied on by Judge K. in the proceedings against the applicant. What is more, Article 90 of the CCrP clearly stipulated that those findings could not have the force of res judicata in the applicant\u2019s case. Formally speaking, Judge K. was required to conduct a fresh examination of the charges against the applicant, relying only on the evidence examined at his trial. The judge was not precluded from coming to the conclusion that the applicant had not taken part in the criminal activities of which his brother, Mr M., had earlier been convicted. In this respect the situation in the present case was closer to the case of Schwarzenberger than it was to the case of Ferrantelli and Santangelo, both cited above.",

The court never directly referred to the applicant as a \u201cperpetrator\u201d or \u201cco-offender\u201d, for example (compare Ferrantelli and Santangelo, cited above). As the Court held in Poppe, cited above, \u201cwhether the applicant\u2019s involvement with [other criminals] fulfilled all the relevant criteria necessary to constitute a criminal offence and, if so, whether the applicant was guilty, beyond reasonable doubt, of having committed such an offence was not addressed, determined or assessed by the trial judges\u201d (\u00a7\u00a028).

The second complaint by the applicant under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3\u00a0(d) of the Convention, cited above, concerns his inability to re-examine the victims during the trial. The Court notes that, as can be seen from the materials of the case, the applicant had adequate opportunity to examine them during the trial at least once. However, at a later stage he requested their repeated examination owing to some inconsistencies in their testimony.\u00a0The Court reiterates that the right to call witnesses is not absolute and can be limited in the interests of the proper administration of justice. An applicant claiming a violation of his right to obtain the attendance and examination of a defence witness should show that the examination of that person was necessary for the establishment of the truth and that the refusal to call that witness was prejudicial to his defence rights (see Guilloury v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a062236/00, \u00a7\u00a055, 22 June 2006). Although it is normally for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a person as a witness was incompatible with Article\u00a06 (see\u00a0Destrehem v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a056651/00, \u00a7\u00a041, 18 May 2004, and Bricmont v.\u00a0Belgium, 7\u00a0July 1989, \u00a7\u00a089, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0158). The applicant did not explain with sufficient clarity why the re-examination of the victims had been needed, and why the defence had been unable to put all necessary questions to them during their first examination. In such circumstances the Court considers that the domestic court\u2019s refusal to summon them again was not arbitrary. It follows that there has been no breach of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a03\u00a0(d) of the Convention on that account.",

It is for the domestic courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to examine witnesses (see S.N.\u00a0v.\u00a0Sweden, no.\u00a034209/96, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR\u00a02002-V, with further references to Bricmont v.

It remains for the court to judge whether such a measure would serve any useful purpose (see\u00a0H.\u00a0v.\u00a0, 24\u00a0October 1989, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-61, Series A no.\u00a0162-A). Where the defendant wants a witness to be questioned he must support his request by explaining why it was important for the witnesses concerned to be heard (see Engel and Others v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 8\u00a0June 1976, \u00a7\u00a091, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a022, and Bricmont, cited above).

In those Russian cases where a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention was found on account of the failure of the trial court to call witnesses for the defence, the Court always emphasised the comparative weakness of the prosecution case. Thus, in the concluding paragraphs of the case of Polyakov v. Russia (no. 77018/01, \u00a7 36, 29\u00a0January 2009) the Court stressed that \u201cthe only direct evidence showing that the applicant had sold drugs ... was the putative purchaser\u2019s deposition made during the pre-trial investigation, which she retracted at the trial\u201d. In Popov, cited above, the Court noted that \u201cthe identification evidence before the court thus comprised the conflicting evidence of four schoolchildren who had difficulties in recollecting events after half a year, and the identification parade itself had taken place more than half a year after the fight to which the identification related\u201d (\u00a7 181). In contrast, in Dorokhov v.\u00a0Russia (no. 66802/01, \u00a7 74, 14 February 2008), where no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (d) was found, the Court emphasised that \u201cthe arguments in favour of the applicant\u2019s guilt [had been] quite weighty. Several people [had] testified at the trial that they had bribed him with the car. Therefore, even if [the absent witnesses for the defence] had been called and heard, their testimony would most likely not have led to the applicant\u2019s acquittal\u201d. A similar line of reasoning was employed by the Court in the case of\u00a0Thomas v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.) no.\u00a019345/02, 10\u00a0May 2005, where the Court found that the applicant\u2019s complaint of the failure of the British courts to admit exculpating evidence was manifestly ill-founded. In that case the Court noted, inter alia, that \u201cthe conviction was upheld and the view expressed that there was a strong circumstantial case against the applicant\u201d. The question is to which of these two categories the present case belongs.",

This argument is not without merit: a large part of the trial court\u2019s factual findings concerned the amounts paid by the victims through Mr M., allegedly to the applicant. Furthermore, the trial court itself did not consider the questioning of Mr M. unnecessary ab intio: the trial court rejected the first request of the defence for Mr M. to be examined holding that the court had not yet assessed all the evidence. This formula might be interpreted as postponing the examination of Mr M. to some later stage in the proceedings. However, in the subsequent hearings the trial court did not return to this question. When the defence again requested that Mr\u00a0M. be examined, the trial judge dismissed that request and proceeded to the final submissions, without, however, explaining why Mr M. should not be questioned. Finally, the court of appeal ignored the question of the non-appearance of Mr M. at the trial, despite this point having been clearly formulated by the applicant in his statement of appeal.",
