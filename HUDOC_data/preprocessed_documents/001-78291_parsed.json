However, in the instant case, the applicants were never served with the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision dated 18\u00a0December 1998. The Government did not provide any explanation for this. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the earliest date on which the applicants could have been informed about the content of the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision was on 4 January 1999, the date on which the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision arrived at the registry of the first-instance court. The application was lodged with the Court on 28\u00a0June 1999.

It can accept that the case was complex owing to the number of parties and the nature of the dispute. However, it cannot be said that this in itself justified the entire length of the proceedings. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the length of the proceedings, in the instant case, can only be explained by the failure of the domestic courts to deal with the case diligently. Having examined all the material submitted to it and having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",
