However, there had not been any assessment as to whether inflicting that number of injuries on the applicant could have been strictly necessary and proportionate in order to suppress his resistance. It further notes the absence of signs of physical injuries to the police officers which would indicate violent actions, such as kicking or biting, on the part of the applicant (see Iljina and Sarulien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 32293/05, \u00a7 50, 15 March 2011). The Court also observes that in the present case the applicant was sixteen years old at the time of his arrest, he was alone against eight police officers, and it was not alleged at any stage of the domestic proceedings that he might have been armed.

The investigation did not attempt to determine the exact origin of all of the applicant\u2019s numerous bruises, nor did it assess whether the force used during the applicant\u2019s arrest had been strictly necessary and proportionate (see \u015eakir Ka\u00e7maz v. Turkey, no. 8077/08, \u00a7\u00a090, 10 November 2015). The Court notes that such an assessment was essential to determine whether the police had acted within the confines of the domestic law (see paragraph 43 above), and, indeed, whether they had breached Article 3 of the Convention (see Boris Kostadinov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a061701/11, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62, 21 January 2016).",
