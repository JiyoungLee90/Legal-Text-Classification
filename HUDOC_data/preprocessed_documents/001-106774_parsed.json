The court held that the dismissed persons were entitled to 160 per cent of the basic benefit only when they had been made redundant by the same employer in the context of redundancies exceeding 100 persons; not when the number of dismissed persons exceeded 100 in a given municipality as a whole, as the competent authorities had tended to interpret this provision previously.",

It\u00a0analysed relevant case-law of the administrative courts and noted that the\u00a0manner in which\u00a0the beginning of the time-limit for lodging cassation appeals\u00a0was determined had led to divergent results. It held\u00a0that it was necessary to determine the relevant time in a manner compatible with effective access to the highest administrative court and which ensured equal treatment for\u00a0parties represented by lawyers appointed under the legalaid scheme\u00a0and by privately hired lawyers. The court held that the time-limit for a legally-aided party started to run only on the day when a legal-aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal and not when he or she was informed of having been assigned to the case. The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigorous and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal-aid system illusory. In any event, the cassation appeal had to be lodged within thirty days from the day on which the party was informed of the appointment of the legal-aid lawyer (I\u00a0FZ 569/06 of 8\u00a0December 2006; I FZ 667/06 of 15\u00a0January 2007; I FZ 30/09 of 2\u00a0March 2007; II FZ 177/08 of 25 June 2008; II OZ 513/08 of 27\u00a0May 2008; I\u00a0OZ\u00a0376/08 of 13 June 2008; I FZ 30/09 of 2\u00a0March 2009; II\u00a0OZ\u00a01093/09 of 9\u00a0December 2009; I FZ 30/09 of 2\u00a0March 2009).",
