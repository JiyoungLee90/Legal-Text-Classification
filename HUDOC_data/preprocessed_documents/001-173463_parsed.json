The Court further reiterates that the principle of equality of arms is one feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, which also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Moreover, Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(b) guarantees \u201cadequate time and facilities for the preparation of [...] defence\u201d and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on the accused\u2019s behalf may comprise everything which is \u201cnecessary\u201d to prepare the trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings. The provision is violated only if this is made impossible (see OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, no.\u00a014902/04, \u00a7\u00a0538, 20 September 2011, with further references).",

It is also not clear in the present case, unlike for example in the case of Stanford, whether or not the applicant brought the difficulties in observing the video recording to the attention of the trial court (see, Stanford, cited above, \u00a7 27). In particular, it does not transpire from the trial transcript that the applicant submitted any requests or complaints concerning the quality of the tapes or the manner in which the tape had been shown (see paragraphs 37 and 50 above). However, the applicant submitted to the Court that her objections in this regard had not been reflected in the trial transcript and that she had not been able to challenge the transcript since the trial court had not allowed her lawyers to make an audio recording of the hearing (see paragraph 68 above). The Court also notes that the applicant did not complain in the statement of appeal that either she or her lawyers had not been able to see the videotape. However, they did refer, albeit rather ambiguously, to unspecified \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d which allegedly prevented them from comparing the transcripts with the recordings (see paragraph 48 above).",

Therefore, it appears that the applicant did not have any complaints concerning the admissibility of the videotapes. However, the applicant did consider that the transcripts of her conversations with V. and Ku. recorded in the course of the surveillance operation had been inaccurate. In this regard, it appears from the case material that the applicant requested the court to have the video tape played precisely because she wished to compare the transcripts with the audio and not with the video recordings of these conversations (see paragraphs 37 and 48 above). In the Court\u2019s view, watching the videotapes was not strictly necessary in order to confirm the authenticity of the transcript as, to achieve that, it would have been sufficient for the applicant and her lawyers to listen to the audio recordings and simultaneously to compare them with the text of the transcripts, unless they were obstructed from listening to them in any way or unless the audio recordings were of inadequate quality. In this regard, the Court observes that the applicant did not complain before the domestic courts or before the Court that the quality of the audio recordings had been poor, that she or her lawyers had not been able to hear them or that they had not been authentic. Therefore, it follows that even if the applicant was not able to see the video screen in the courtroom, she could have challenged the contents of the transcripts, if necessary, since she was not prevented from listening to the audio recordings of her conversations with V. and Ku.",

Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, ECHR 2003-V). However, the case of Perna v. Italy should not be directly compared with the case at hand. The former was about an Italian journalist, Mr\u00a0Perna, who wrote a defamatory article against Mr Caselli, at the time Public Prosecutor in Palermo. Mr Perna requested that Mr Caselli be called as a witness. The difference (from the present case) lay in the issue of whether Mr Caselli\u2019s alleged lack of impartiality, independence, and objectivity had not been part of Mr Perna\u2019s defence. On the contrary, his defence was that there was no need to prove the veracity of these critical allegations (ibid., \u00a7 31). In the case at hand the situation is different, in that police officer A. played a central part in the applicant\u2019s defence.",

In the present case, it seems obvious why A.\u2019s testimony would have been important for the outcome of the criminal proceedings. After all, it was upon A.\u2019s intervention that she was released from the custody of the police in December 2003. Subsequently, A. helped the applicant to be reinstated at work. He found her a flat that was equipped with videotaping and audiotaping devices and visited her several times. As the applicant had started to trust A., she immediately telephoned him when she was stopped on the evening of 4 March 2004 by a police patrol. It is fair to ask for elaborated reasons as to why a witness whose relevance in a particular instance does not become clear at first sight should be called to a trial. However, with regard to police officer A., it is clear how he could have played a crucial role. A.\u2019s dubious role must have been evident to everyone during the trial, and the applicant would thus have stated the obvious when arguing in detail why A. had to be treated as a key witness. After all, if the applicant were right in her defence about the explosives having been planted in her bag (which we are not, of course, implying here), then A. would be a central figure. In other words, the applicant implicitly argued that the events had been staged. The applicant\u2019s defence thus implicated A., given that, if the explosives had indeed been planted, A. would have laid the groundwork for a later conviction based on the alleged evidence collected in her videotaped and audiotaped flat. In this case, therefore, the importance of A.\u2019s testimony seems quite obvious, and is so clearly part of the applicant\u2019s defence that the applicant\u2019s scant reasons (\u201cunreasonable\u201d) should be accepted as sufficient.",

Given that the application of this Article seems problematic, the refusal of the request to call A. as a witness can indeed be regarded as \u201cunreasonable\u201d. This finding is further strengthened by the fact that the Government have failed to prove that A. was, at the material time, really on a work mission.",

In the case at hand, however, calling witness A. to testify would not have interfered with the \u201cproper administration of justice\u201d: it would not have led to unreasonably high costs, or to an unreasonable delay. This point is strengthened by the fact that the proceedings dealt with the important issue of alleged terrorism. Instead, it would have been justified to keep the applicant in pre-trial detention for another few days and wait for A.\u2019s return.

While witnesses for the defence were allowed to testify in the court of first instance, their testimonies were used only by the appeal court without additional examination. In the view of the Court, this had reduced Mr\u00a0Destrehem\u2019s defence rights to such an extent that the whole process was deemed unfair (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 43-47). This threshold for finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) was lower than in the current case. Witness A. was questioned only during the pre-trial phase, and then only by the investigator, but not by the applicant, whereas the witnesses in Destrehem v. France had been questioned during the proceedings in the court of first instance. Nevertheless, a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) was found in Destrehem, but not in the instant case. We are thus of the opinion that if the circumstances in Destrehem constituted a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d), a fortiori there has been a violation in the instant case.",

Furthermore, neither did they adequately justify their refusal to call witnesses B. or K., consequently prohibiting consideration at the trial of relevant evidence concerning the alleged entrapment. As in the case of A., no reasons of urgency or celerity of proceedings justified the refusal to allow those witnesses to testify.

However, given the nature of the applicant\u2019s claims concerning the alleged entrapment, that conclusion was definitely premature, as was the Chamber\u2019s opinion (paragraph 98 of the judgment) that \u201cthe attesting witnesses would likely not be able to confirm or refute the applicant\u2019s claim\u201d.
