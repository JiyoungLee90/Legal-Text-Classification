The \u201cdispute\u201d must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise. The outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences being insufficient to bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play (see, for example, Balmer-Schafroth and Others v.

Accordingly, the Court considers that the judgment at issue was essentially of a declaratory nature and did not concern any \u201cdispute\u201d over a civil right. Nor did the judgment determine the scope or manner of exercise of the applicant's right to a loan because he had not raised these issues in the proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court is unable to conclude that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention applied to the proceedings which ended with the judgment of 19 November 1997 or to the ensuing enforcement stage which is regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Kanayev v.

However, the Court observes that two possible solutions to the applicant's problem were provided (see paragraph 6 above), and the transfer of the housing into the applicant's ownership was only one of them.
