It pursues an aim which is in the general interest, namely the protection of health, by exercising under the relevant legislation a form of public control over the practice of medicine. Within the context of this latter function, the Ordre is required in particular to keep the register of medical practitioners. For the performance of the tasks conferred on it by the Belgian State, it is legally invested with administrative as well as rule-making and disciplinary prerogatives out of the orbit of the ordinary law (prerogatives exorbitantes du droit commun) and, in this capacity, employs processes of a public authority (see paragraphs 20-34 above).",

This unsatisfactory situation cannot therefore be validly rectified by means of judicial interpretation, and this is all the more so because such an interpretation threatens to upset the Convention system in one of its most sensitive sectors; rectification can be effected only by the legislature, in other words by the Contracting States, who should take steps to amend the Convention.",

I would also endorse the proposition that it is not enough for the dispute or the proceedings to have a tenuous connection with or remote consequences affecting civil rights or obligations, but such rights and obligations must be the object of the \"contestation\" (dispute) and the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for such a right (cf. paragraph 47 of the judgment).

The proceedings before the Provincial and Appeals Councils and those before the Court of Cassation were therefore concerned with matters of public law. Their object was disciplinary - to ensure the observance of rules of professional conduct - and not the determination of private rights. The fact that their outcome could incidentally affect rights of a private character did not, in my opinion, suffice to bring them within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1).",

For instance, in disciplinary cases it may not always be necessary in the public interest or desirable in the interest of the individual concerned that the decision should be made public, particularly if he has been found not to be guilty of any misconduct. The application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) to disciplinary cases may also give rise to undue difficulties as regards the composition of disciplinary organs of professional bodies and because such organs are not always \"established by law\".",

In view of its finding that the proceedings in question concerned the determination of civil rights and obligations, the Court found it superfluous to decide the issue (paragraph 53 of the judgment). As noted by the Court, the Commission, when deciding on the admissibility of the applications, stated that the disciplinary organs of the Ordre had not been required to determine criminal charges (paragraph 52 of the judgment). I see no reason to disagree with the Commission. In the case of Engel and others, although the proceedings complained of were conducted under disciplinary law, the Court held that the charges against some of the applicants did come within the \"criminal\" sphere since their aim was the imposition of serious punishments involving deprivation of liberty (Series A no. 22, p. 36, \u00a7 85). In the present case, neither the offences charged nor the sanctions applied by the disciplinary organs were of a criminal character. It is true that Dr. Le Compte\u2019s refusal to comply with the measures imposed by the Ordre led to his being charged subsequently with criminal offences and sentenced to terms of imprisonment and fines, but there was no complaint that the proceedings before the Belgian criminal courts failed to comply with the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6).",
