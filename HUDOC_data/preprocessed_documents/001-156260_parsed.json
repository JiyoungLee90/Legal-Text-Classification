His shares in Demirbank became null and void when Demirbank\u2019s legal personality was extinguished and it was struck off the commercial registry following its sale to HSBC. In the Court\u2019s view, there has therefore been an interference with his right of property (S\u00fczer and Eksen Holding A.\u015e. v. Turkey, no.\u00a06334/05, \u00a7\u00a0143, 23 October 2012). The Court further observes that the Board\u2019s decision to take over the bank was adopted as a measure to control the banking sector in the country. It is true that it involved a deprivation of property, but in these circumstances the deprivation formed a constituent element of a scheme for controlling the banking industry. It is therefore the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 which is applicable in the present case (S\u00fczer and Eksen Holding A.\u015e., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0146147).

The Court must therefore determine whether the interference in question was lawful, and \u201cin the public interest\u201d, and whether it struck a fair balance between the owner\u2019s rights and the interests of the community.

In this connection, the Court notes that in the present case, the domestic courts annulled the decision pertaining to the takeover of Demirbank to the Fund and its subsequent sale to HSBC bank. In doing so, the courts respectively held that the administrative acts had been unlawful. By these decisions, the administrative acts in question were declared null and void with retrospective (ex tunc) effect. That being so, the Court considers that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to enjoyment of his possessions cannot be considered as lawful within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 to the Convention (see S\u00fczer and Eksen Holding A.\u015e, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0148)",

The Court notes that the complexity of the domestic enforcement procedure or of the State budgetary system cannot relieve the State of its obligation under the Convention to guarantee to everyone the right to have a binding and enforceable judicial decision enforced within a reasonable time. Nor is it open to a State authority to cite lack of funds or other resources as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt (see Burdov v.\u00a0Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2009, and S\u00fczer and Eksen Holding A.\u015e., cited above, \u00a7 116).

However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Lastly, such limitations will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued (see Gu\u00e9rin v.\u00a0France, 29\u00a0July 1998, \u00a7 37, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-V, and Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, \u00a7\u00a050, Reports 1996 IV).",

The Court\u2019s role is limited to verifying compatibility with the Convention of the effects of such an interpretation. This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature, such as time-limits governing the lodging of appeals (see Tejedor Garc\u00eda v. Spain, 16 December 1997, \u00a7 31, Reports\u00a01997-VIII). The rules governing the time-limits for appeals are intended to ensure a proper administration of justice. That being so, the rules in question, or their application, should not prevent litigants from using an available remedy. Furthermore, the Court must make its assessment in each case in the light of the special features of the proceedings in question and by reference to the object and purpose of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Miragall Escolano and Others v. Spain, nos. 38366/97, 38688/97, 40777/98, 40843/98, 41015/98, 41400/98, 41446/98, 41484/98, 41487/98 and\u00a041509/98, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2000I).",

France, no. 35787/03, \u00a7 29, 26 July 2007). In fact, the right of access to a court is impaired when the rules cease to serve the aims of legal certainty and the proper administration of justice and form a sort of barrier preventing the litigant from having his or her case determined on the merits by the competent court (see Efstathiou and Others v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a036998/02, \u00a7\u00a024, 27 July 2006).",
