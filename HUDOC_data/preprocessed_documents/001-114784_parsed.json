Indeed, the Government, by disclosing all the information necessary for the assessment of the quality of the disputed treatment, have discharged their part of the burden of proof and have properly assisted the Court in its task of determining the facts, whilst the applicant limited himself to wholly unsubstantiated assertions (compare with Goginashvili, \u00a7 72, and contrast with Malenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a018660/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-57, 19 February 2009). It is important that the prison authority has been able to maintain a comprehensive medical record of the applicant\u2019s state of health, monitoring the treatment he underwent from the beginning of his detention until the present day (compare with, for example, Khudobin v. Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the mere fact of a deterioration of the applicant\u2019s state of health, albeit capable of raising, at an initial stage, certain doubts concerning the adequacy of the treatment in prison, cannot suffice of itself for a finding of a violation of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention, if, on the other hand, it can be established that the relevant domestic authorities have in timely fashion resorted to all reasonably possible medical measures in a conscientious effort to hinder development of the disease in question (see Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7 71). In other words, it is mainly through the prism of this \u201cdue diligence\u201d test that the Court must assess the adequacy of the medical care dispensed to the applicant in prison.",

The medical file confirms that numerous different types of medication and other types of treatment were administered to the applicant in the prison hospital, as well as on an outpatient basis during his detention in Tbilisi Prisons Nos. 5 and 7, with the State bearing the cost (contrast with, for example, Pitalev v. Russia, no. 34393/03, \u00a7 57, 30\u00a0July 2009; Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7\u00a0117, 29\u00a0November 2007; and Holomiov v.

It is praiseworthy that the domestic authorities did not hesitate to resort to the services of specialist medical facilities in the civilian sector (see, a\u00a0contrario, Aleksanyan v. , no. 46468/06, \u00a7 155-157, 22\u00a0December 2008, and Akhmetov v. , no. 37463/04, \u00a7 81, 1\u00a0April 2010). The Court further finds it important that the prison authority has started dispensing, under close medical monitoring, appropriate treatment for the applicant\u2019s hepatitis C, using appropriate anti-viral agents (see paragraph 57 above). The Court also attaches significance to the fact that the respondent Government correctly implemented the interim measure indicated by the Court under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court with respect to the applicant\u2019s medical condition, which is yet another manifestation of the fact that the relevant domestic authorities have been genuinely conscientious in their dealings with the applicant\u2019s health (see paragraphs 48-53 above).",
