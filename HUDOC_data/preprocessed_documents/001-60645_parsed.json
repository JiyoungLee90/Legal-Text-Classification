For that reason, tips paid in cash to waiters or to the tronc did not count as remuneration. However, he considered that the same reasoning could not apply to tips which were built into payments made by cheque or credit card to their employer since the amounts became the latter\u2019s property. The employer thereafter paid an equivalent amount to the applicants. In his view, tips paid in this manner should count against the minimum remuneration requirement. Lord Justice Staughton rejected the attempts of the applicants\u2019 counsel to interpret the applicable legislation differently. He further rejected counsel\u2019s argument that the applicants had a right to the cheque and credit card tips as money had and received for their use. In Lord\u00a0Justice Staughton\u2019s opinion, it was decisive that the employer was paying the tips with its own money even if they had been paid by the customers to the employer in the belief that the latter would pass the tips on to the waiters and on the understanding that it would do so.

A wages council was established for workers in licensed residential establishments and licensed restaurants. Minimum remuneration for those workers was laid down in the Wages (Licensed Residential Establishment and Licensed Restaurant) Order 1982. Paragraph 3 of the 1982 Order specified the minimum rate to be paid for forty hours\u2019 work as well as the rates for overtime, night work, etc. Paragraph 12 of the 1982 Order provided that if in any week in which a worker performed some work for his employer the total amount of gratuities from customers received by the worker was less that 8.40 pounds sterling (GBP), the employer had to pay the worker such sum as the amount of gratuities fell short of GBP 8.40.

That provision protects the peaceful enjoyment of existing possessions; it does not confer any right to secure further possessions in the future. Should the Court not accept that reasoning in the instant case and find that there has been an interference with the applicants\u2019 possessions, the Government contended that it was entirely consistent with the objectives of the minimum wage legislation (to curb unduly low pay), and it was not manifestly without reasonable foundation to treat all payments from an employer as counting towards the minimum level of remuneration. Accordingly, any interference with the applicants\u2019 possessions had been reasonable and proportionate, and did not disclose a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

It has not been disputed either that the applicants duly received from their employer their share in the tips in accordance with the proportion agreed by the waiting staff. Accordingly, there was no interference with each applicant\u2019s agreed right to an appropriate share of the tips. They each received, in the form of \u201cadditional pay\u201d, what the tronc system would have intended them to receive, minus tax and national insurance contributions which were payable on the amounts received. It is to be observed that the applicants received the tips in the form of additional pay speedily since, unlike their employer, they did not have to wait until the credit card or cheque payments had been processed. Furthermore, payment of the gratuity was guaranteed even if the credit card or cheque transaction turned out to be fraudulent.

In the first place, that assertion is not borne out by the legislation at issue as interpreted by the domestic courts. The fact that the domestic courts ruled in a dispute between private litigants that the tips at issue represented \u201cremuneration\u201d within the meaning of the applicable legislation cannot of itself be said to engage the liability of the respondent State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It would observe in this connection that the interpretation and application of domestic legislation in a given dispute is essentially a matter for the domestic courts. It notes that after full argument on the competing interpretations canvassed for the notion of \u201cremuneration\u201d, the domestic courts ruled that the employer, and not the customer, paid the tips at issue out of its own funds to the applicants and their colleagues. This conclusion cannot be considered arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, having regard to the scope of the expression \u201cremuneration\u201d and indeed to the applicants\u2019 acceptance that title in the tips at issue passed to the employer. Moreover, the applicants cannot claim that they had a legitimate expectation that the tips at issue would not count towards remuneration. Such a view assumes that the customer intended that this would not be the case. However, this is too imprecise a basis on which to found a legitimate expectation which could give rise to \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 29 November 1991, Series\u00a0A no. 222, p. 23, \u00a7 51; Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, p. 21, \u00a7 31; Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.)

In the opinion of the Court, it was for the applicants to come to a contractual arrangement with their employer as to how the tips at issue were to be dealt with from the point of view of their wage entitlement.

The majority in the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom found that such tips became the employer\u2019s property and therefore could be used by it in order to satisfy the minimum wage to which the applicants were entitled under the law independently of the tips, in other words as part of their \u201cremuneration\u201d.

I find this approach too formalistic and unconnected with the reality of the situation. In this connection, it is important to bear in mind that this Court is not bound by the definitions of the concept of \u201cpossessions\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d given by the national legislation or the national judicial decisions. According to the jurisprudence of the Court, the notion of \u201cpossessions\u201d in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 has an autonomous meaning. In Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH v. the  (judgment of 23 February 1995, Series A no. 306-B, p. 46, \u00a7 53) the Court stated that ",

In such circumstances, the assets become the \u201cpossessions\u201d of that third party. In simple legal terms the tips become the property or \u201cpossessions\u201d of the waiters by virtue of the legal act commonly known in many legal systems as a gift or donation. And a gift or donation does not become less valid in law because it is made through a third party. In the instant case, the legal destination and effect of the tips are not frustrated as result of the fact that they pass through the account of the employer. The latter is still bound to hand over the tips to their beneficiaries. No question of a simple legitimate expectation on the part of the waiters arises in this case. The waiters are entitled eo jure to the gifts given for them \u2013 and only them \u2013 by the customers through the intermediary of the employer. ",

It was for the employer to cover the applicants\u2019 minimum wage out of profits or other resources, to the exclusion of the use of their \u201cpossessions\u201d, namely the tips. This view is further supported by the fact that cash tips continued to be administered under the tronc system and were not counted towards remuneration. Yet the money intended for the applicants\u2019 sole benefit was diverted by the employer in order to offset a portion of the wages which it was statutorily obliged to pay the applicants. Even though in the final analysis the applicants received the tips at issue in the form of \u201cadditional pay\u201d minus the tax and national insurance contributions payable by each of them on the tips, it cannot be overlooked that the employer treated the tips as money which belonged to it by law and which could therefore be used to help make up the minimum wage to which the applicants were entitled independently of the tips.",
