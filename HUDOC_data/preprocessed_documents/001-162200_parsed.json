Being the least challenging in terms of security/safety and entailing no movement or use of loud-speaker devices, a solo static demonstration does not pose any real threat to public safety or State security. Nor does it create any serious danger to health, property or morals. It does not encroach upon one\u2019s freedom of movement. Therefore, it is not subject to a notification requirement, which is related to the fact that the mere presence of a relatively large number of people in the same place, in itself, carries certain risks and thus the organiser of a public event should receive assistance for such an event. The authorities have the statutory aims of ensuring, together with the event\u2019s organiser, public safety and security of people present, and providing urgent medical assistance. The observance of a fifty-metre distance between solo demonstrators excludes, in all cases, a possible lack of balance between the freedom of peaceful assembly and the freedom of movement, even where solo demonstrators have common goals and organisation. Judicial assessment is an important safeguard. However, the current statutory framework does not prevent the arrest of a person who is not a member of an organisation and carries out a solo demonstration that happens to be close to another demonstration that is wholly unrelated to him. The ensuing judicial review can only confirm the absence of any common design and prevent any further violation of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. However, such a review cannot make up for the damage suffered on account of the disruption of a demonstration, arrest and court proceedings. Overall, the statutory provision under review is aimed at impeding solo demonstrations.",

The Commission however recalls the important principle stated by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation in 2012 that administrative responsibility may not arise only out of the non-respect of the rules, but must be dependent on an actual threat to public order and safety. Where sporadic and scattered picketers do not represent any such threat, they should not be sanctioned even though they did not follow the rules. The fact alone that they do not adhere to the norm does not pose a threat in itself. The Venice Commission welcomes the statement by the Constitutional Court (CDL-REF(2013)012, page 22) that the rules concerning single pickets \u201c... are intended to prevent abuses of the right not to notify the public authorities of the holding of a one-person picket, [but] they do not rebut the presumption of lawfulness of the actions of a citizen observing the established procedure for holding a one-person picket, and they intend the sum total of picketing actions carried out by a single participant to be declared as a public event only on the basis of a court decision and only where it is established by the court that these picketing actions were from the outset united by a single concept and overall organisation and do not amount to a coincidental coming together of actions of individual pickets\u201d ...",

It is good practice to require notification only when a substantial number of participants are expected, or not to require prior notification at all for certain types of assembly. Some jurisdictions do not impose a notice requirement for small assemblies ..., or where no significant disruption of others is reasonably anticipated by the organiser (such as might require the redirection of traffic). Furthermore, individual demonstrators should not be required to provide advance notification to the authorities of their intention to demonstrate. Where a lone demonstrator is joined by another or others, then the event should be treated as a spontaneous assembly (see paragraphs 126-131 below). ...",

While the term \u2018spontaneous\u2019 does not preclude the existence of an organiser, spontaneous assemblies may also include gatherings with no identifiable organiser. Such assemblies are coincidental, and occur for instance, when a crowd gathers at a particular location with no prior advertising or invitation. They often result because of commonly held knowledge, or knowledge disseminated via the internet, about a particular event. Numbers may be swelled by passers-by who choose to join the assembly, although it is also possible that once a crowd begins to gather, mobilisation can be achieved by various forms of instantaneous communication (phone, text message, word of mouth, internet etc). Such communication should not, of itself, be interpreted as evidence of prior organisation. Where a lone demonstrator is joined by another or others, the gathering should be treated similarly to a spontaneous assembly.\u201d",

In June 2012 the Public Assemblies Act was amended, introducing a requirement that a certain distance be observed between unrelated solo demonstrators.

The Court reiterates its constant position, albeit in the context of Article 11 of the Convention, that a situation of unlawfulness, such as one arising under Russian law from the staging of a demonstration without prior notification, does not necessarily (that is, by itself) justify an interference with a person\u2019s right to freedom of assembly (see Cisse, cited above, \u00a7 50, and, recently, Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, \u00a7 150, ECHR 2015). In other words, the absence of prior notification and the ensuing \u201cunlawfulness\u201d of the event, which the authorities consider to be an assembly, do not give carte blanche to the authorities; the domestic authorities\u2019 reaction to a public event remains restricted by the proportionality and necessity requirements of Article 11 of the Convention (see Primov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0119).",

When assessing the proportionality of this penalty, it is relevant to note that the failure to notify the event in question did not cause any damage whatsoever. The Government\u2019s argument that the event had started on the road (thus, arguably, obstructing the traffic) has not been substantiated and was not part of the domestic assessment. Importantly, this Court notes that the Russian Constitutional Court found it necessary in 2013 to afford the courts a possibility to impose fines below the statutory minimum amount in order to take proper account of the circumstances of the case. This allowed the courts to impose individualised sentences that were fair and proportionate (see also paragraphs 69, 73 and 86 above).

However, no crime had been committed; nor had the possibility of a crime being committed even been envisaged. The wrongdoing for which the applicants were officially reproached consisted, essentially, in a failure to give prior notice to the administrative authorities that a demonstration was taking place. An administrative offence cannot, in my view, be treated as a \u201ccrime\u201d for the purposes of Articles 10 \u00a7 2 or 11 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. The inclusion of administrative sanctions within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1, in view of the autonomous notion of criminal charge, stems from a completely different logic, based in particular on a concern to improve the protection of fundamental rights.",
