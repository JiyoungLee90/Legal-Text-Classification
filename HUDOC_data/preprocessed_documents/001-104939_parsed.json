The investigation of criminal case no. 59275 was instituted on 15 December 2002, that is twenty-three days after the abduction and five days after the applicants\u2019 official complaint was received by the competent authorities. Such a delay of several days by itself is liable to affect the investigation of an abduction in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken as soon as possible after the event. In the present case, a number of essential steps were not taken at all. For example, it does not appear that the investigators examined the crime scene or that they identified or questioned any of the military servicemen who had been stationed in the area and who could have been involved in the abduction. Neither did they establish the particulars of the APCs and the other military vehicles that had moved around Mesker-Yurt on 21 and 22 November 2002. Further, the investigators failed to question a number of the applicants\u2019 relatives and neighbours who had witnessed the abduction. In addition, they did not check the registration logs at the military checkpoints noting vehicles\u2019 passage on the night of the abduction and they did not identify and question the servicemen who had manned those checkpoints on that night. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004XII).",

The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged the acts or omissions of the investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the suspension or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to suspend were made without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

Relevant elements will include the closeness of the family relationship, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person, and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries. The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities\u2019 reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim to be a direct victim of the authorities\u2019 conduct (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, \u00a7\u00a0358, 18 June 2002).",
