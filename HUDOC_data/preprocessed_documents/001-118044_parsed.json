As to the possibility of examining Dr W.B. as a witness on the subject of his psychiatric assessment, it must be pointed out that such assessments are not a matter for witnesses. Since Dr W.B. has prepared a private expert opinion in the present case, he cannot also be regarded as an expert for the purpose of the proceedings, and any statements he might make as a witness concerning the psychiatric assessment would not constitute valid evidence.",

This may arise in the event of difficulties in observing the patient and making an assessment; this in turn will arise only if the court-appointed expert is unable to reply with certainty, or at all, to the questions put to him, in which case the possibility of the questions being answered by another expert cannot be ruled out. In the instant case Dr R.B. answered the questions put to him with certainty from the outset. During today\u2019s hearing, and especially during questioning by the defence, no important points were left unanswered. It cannot therefore be argued that the expert did not answer the questions conclusively and with certainty.

However, it must be borne in mind that, particularly in the sphere of psychology and psychiatry, psychological violence plays an important role. The accused repeatedly abused young people as a result of his disposition, whether by giving them alcohol, showing them pornographic films, offering them money or using his position in society. The expert and, accordingly, the court therefore concluded that it was likely that the accused, on account of his mental disorder and in particular his paedophile tendencies, would commit further offences of the kind with which he has been charged.",

However, in the present case the domestic court had refused to admit the private expert opinion into the proceedings as evidence. The applicant also observed that the possibility for a private expert to assist a defendant and counsel during the hearing had only been introduced into the amended Code of Criminal Procedure in 2008. Further, the applicant claimed that allowing the private expert opinion would not have led to a repetition of evidence. The applicant alleged that the private expert was more experienced and had submitted a more extensive opinion based on his examination of him. He also asserted that in view of the unfair decision regarding the private expert opinion by the domestic court, the dismissal of the request to admit B.S., J.H. and A.U. as witnesses to testify regarding the applicant\u2019s character had been especially unjust.

Moreover, the court-appointed expert had supplemented his opinion during the oral hearing and had responded in substance to the criticism voiced by the private expert. The domestic court had further thoroughly reasoned its dismissal of the request for a second expert opinion on the grounds of the conclusiveness of the opinion of the court-appointed expert. To allow an applicant in domestic proceedings to call a private expert as a witness would only lead to an unnecessary repetition of evidence with the goal of obtaining a more beneficial outcome for the defendant. Furthermore, the private expert could in any event assist the defendant and his counsel during the proceedings and guide them through the questioning of the court-appointed expert. While it was true that this possibility had only been introduced into the law with the criminal procedural reform in 2008, that particular provision had been the codification of what had already been the practice of the Supreme Court.

The court-appointed expert subsequently responded to the criticism voiced by the private expert and addressed each issue raised in an addendum to the written expert opinion. As a result, the points of criticism and the arguments responding to them found their way into the body of evidence of the proceedings and therefore also into the decision-making process of the domestic courts. Furthermore, the court-appointed expert was made available for questioning by the applicant and his counsel for more than three hours during an oral hearing. The private expert opinion had prepared the applicant and his counsel for this questioning, had provided them with the necessary specific knowledge on the subject matter and had raised their awareness of possible problem areas in the court-appointed expert\u2019s opinion. The applicant and his counsel were therefore adequately prepared to challenge the court-appointed expert\u2019s opinion in court. Finally, the Court notes that the domestic courts explained at length why they found that the court-appointed expert\u2019s opinion \u2013 as submitted in writing and with the additional information obtained in the oral hearing \u2013 was comprehensive and conclusive; that the court-appointed expert had managed to dispel any doubts raised by the private expert regarding the basis on which the court-appointed expert\u2019s opinion had finally been accepted by the courts as it stood and taken as a decisive factor for the Regional Court\u2019s decision as regards the referral of the applicant to an institutional for mentally ill offenders. The material before the Court does not allow it to come to a different conclusion.",

The Court observes that allowing the request would indeed have admitted the private expert opinion into the proceedings by an alternative route and would therefore have circumvented the prior decision not to admit the private expert opinion into the proceedings as evidence. The Court has stated above that it is not its task to organise the domestic system for admitting evidence in a given  but to ensure that there are sufficient safeguards available for the applicant to have access to overall fair proceedings (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above). Considering in particular that the court-appointed expert had addressed the alleged problem areas raised by the private expert in writing and orally, and that the applicant and his counsel had had considerable opportunity to question the court-appointed expert, to refer to the alleged problem areas raised by the private expert and to raise any possible doubts as regards the quality and conclusions of the court-appointed expert\u2019s opinion, the Court is satisfied that the applicant had ample opportunity to challenge the court-appointed expert, to submit any arguments in his defence and to guarantee his right to equality of arms. The \u2013 thoroughly reasoned \u2013 refusal to allow the private expert to testify can therefore not have curtailed the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing.",

In this context, the Court reiterates that, as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which the defendants seek to adduce. More specifically, it is for them to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses. However, in the event that the national courts decide to reject a request for evidence or a witness request on behalf of a defendant, they need to reason their decisions accordingly (see, mutatis mutandis, Vidal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 34). It is not the Court\u2019s function to express an opinion on the relevance of the evidence offered and rejected, but to supervise whether the proceedings were fair overall, for which it must ascertain whether the rejection of the witness request by the national courts was based on sufficient reasons (see, mutatis mutandis, Vidal, cited above, ibid). As regards the present case, the Court notes that the relevant decision was thoroughly reasoned by the Krems a.d.  during the oral hearing (see paragraph 12 above) and in the judgment (see paragraph 16 above). Moreover, the Supreme Court took careful note of the applicant\u2019s complaint in this regard and brought forward sufficient arguments in support of the refusal of the request referring in particular to the vague nature of the request and its lack of substantiation (see paragraph 18 above). Furthermore, even if the Court took it upon itself to assess the quality of the witness request, it would refer to its findings that a witness request must be reasoned, and that a party requesting a witness must also be prepared to explain why the witness is in a position to make a statement concerning a certain question (see for example Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003V). In the present case the Court would find that the request to allow B.S., J.H. and A.U. to testify was not sufficiently reasoned by the applicant.",
