Thus, the transfer of the file to the different authorities dealing with the applicants' cases in different proceedings caused inevitable delays. However, the main problem in the proceedings at issue was that the required data concerning the level of ground water in the region at issue prior to the first regulation works did not exist. Given that this essential information was lacking, it was necessary to obtain several, very time consuming and expensive expert opinions. As to the applicants' conduct the Government asserted that, by making use of all remedies available, they contributed considerably to the length of the proceedings. As regards the conduct of the authorities they submitted that the proceedings before the Administrative Court had been conducted expeditiously. In sum, the Government argued that, even if a duration of more of thirty years appears at a first sight to be too long, a closer look into the complex subject matter of the proceedings shows that the duration of the proceedings seems to be justified.",
