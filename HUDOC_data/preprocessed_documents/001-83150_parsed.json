As to the applicant\u2019s other allegations of ill-treatment, they had been carefully examined by prosecuting authorities and found unsubstantiated. In particular, a dog had never been set on him. All the injuries that had been found by prison doctors had been inflicted by the applicant on himself. During his imprisonment the applicant had been regularly seen by a psychologist, who had diagnosed him as suffering from an emotionally unstable personality disorder. In his psychological profile, prepared by the head of the psychological laboratory of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences, the applicant was described as having an inclination to self-mutilation as a way of avoiding prison regulations and opposing the prison administration. During the night of 26-27 June 2005 it was the applicant who had incited the other inmates of Lgov correctional colony OX-30/3 to commit self-mutilation. He had not been granted the status of a victim in criminal investigation no.\u00a01519, and his complaint concerning the alleged ill-treatment in the colony had been dismissed. The applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment had been properly investigated by the prosecuting authorities, who had examined the relevant medical certificates and other documents and had questioned numerous witnesses, including the applicant\u2019s cellmates, prison officers and medical experts.

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2275-76, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051-52, and Akd\u0131var and Others v.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means in particular that the Court must take realistic account, not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others cited above, \u00a7 69, and Ya\u015fa v.

The Court reiterates that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted by Article\u00a034 that applicants or potential applicants should be able to communicate freely with the Court without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.
