However, he added, a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 did not necessarily result in a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1. He considered this Court\u2019s judgment in James, Wells and Lee, cited above, not to be directly relevant to the applicant\u2019s case since that judgment concerned lack of access to rehabilitation courses and the just satisfaction awards made were for the feelings of distress and frustration resulting from continued detention without access to courses, and not for loss of liberty. Lord Reed noted that the delay in the applicant\u2019s case appeared to have been the result of errors by administrative staff, \u201cof a kind which occur from time to time in any system which is vulnerable to human error\u201d. While it was extremely unfortunate that the errors had occurred and had resulted in the prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention, they were not of such a character, and the delay was not of such a degree, as to warrant the conclusion that there had been a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

He considered that no clear guidance could be derived from the cases since none concerned awards for loss of liberty resulting from a violation of the speedy decision guarantee in Article 5 \u00a7 4. While, he said, an appellate court would not interfere with an award of damages simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance, in the applicant\u2019s appeal the court was being invited to give guidance as to the appropriate level of awards in cases of this character.

The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed, taking account of both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no. 25551/05, ECHR 2010; and Van Velden v. the Netherlands, no. 30666/08, \u00a7 36, 19 July 2011). An alleged violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage without affecting an applicant\u2019s pecuniary interest (Korolev, cited above; and M.N. and Others v.\u00a0San Marino, no. 28005/12, \u00a7 37, 7 July 2015). It may also be that, even in the absence of a \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d, a question of principle raised by an application is of a general character affecting the observance of the Convention, such that, under the terms of the second element in Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a03 (b), \u201crespect for human rights defined in the Convention ... requires an examination of the application on its merits\u201d.",

The Court is not, however, satisfied that the conditions for inadmissibility stated in Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) are satisfied. The nature of the guarantees afforded by Articles 5 \u00a7 1 and 5 \u00a7 4 is significantly different, the latter being concerned exclusively with safeguards subsequent to deprivation of liberty and the former encapsulating the more comprehensive right not to be detained in an arbitrary fashion. The applicant\u2019s submission is that the delay in his case was such as to give rise not merely to a denial of access to a review of the lawfulness of his continuing detention (contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 4) but also to a period of unjustified deprivation of liberty (contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 1). While the applicant received financial compensation of GBP 6,500 as redress for the \u201cdisadvantage\u201d resulting from his delayed release (see paragraphs 17-18 above), the applicant\u2019s complaint as formulated in his application raises a novel issue of principle going to the relationship between paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 5, an issue which warrants consideration by the Court. Consequently, without needing to determine whether the applicant can be said to have suffered a \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d, the Court is in any event led to dismiss the Government\u2019s objections on the basis of the second element in Article 35 \u00a7\u00a03 (b) of the Convention.",

There was a stark difference between people deemed no longer to pose a risk to the public (in respect of whom the causal connection between sentence and detention had been broken) and those deemed to pose a continuing risk to the public. A finding that his Article 5 \u00a7 1 rights had been violated would not imply that persons who continued to pose a risk to the public should be released. The applicant argued that the facts of his case were so radically distinct from those in James, Wells and Lee that it was unnecessary for the Court to consider whether that case was correctly decided.

He argued that they demonstrated the importance of administrative review in the Article 5 framework. It was only by reviewing the substantive merits of the continuing detention that the State could demonstrate compliance with Article 5. Where there had been a failure to comply with procedural safeguards under domestic law, there would be a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (citing Nakach v. the Netherlands, no. 5379/02, 30 June 2005; and Schenkel v.\u00a0the Netherlands, no. 62015/00, 27 October 2005). The Government\u2019s attempt to distinguish the cases was absurd and would lead to a situation in which a prisoner could be lawfully detained indefinitely without any Parole Board review. This could not possibly be correct. The applicant accepted that the mere fact of a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 did not necessarily cause detention to be unlawful as there might be an underlying justification for detention: the prisoner might pose a risk. However, where there was no such justification, unlawful delay was no excuse for a failure to release.",

While the Court in James, Wells and\u00a0Lee had considered that a failure to provide rehabilitative courses gave rise to an issue under Article 5 \u00a7 1, it was significant that the Supreme Court in Kaiyam and Others had preferred to view the duty to provide access to courses as an ancillary duty of a more procedural nature under Article\u00a05 rather than a matter going to lawfulness under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) (see paragraph 20 above). The concerns expressed by the Supreme Court in Kaiyam concerning the application of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in that case applied equally in a case such as this based on delay: absent bad faith, delay on the part of the judicial body responsible for determining whether to release a prisoner did not render detention arbitrary.",

His release was contingent on demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Parole Board that he no longer posed a risk to the public. It was incorrect for him to suggest that his conviction and detention only continued to retain the requisite connection if the Parole Board considered that he posed a sufficient risk to the public: it was for him to demonstrate that his risk had reduced, and his detention would continue pending a decision of the Parole Board as to whether in fact there had been a sufficient reduction in risk.",

He was therefore being assessed during the period as to the risk he posed and was benefiting from rehabilitative opportunities offered to him by the Government. The applicant placed too much weight on the finding of the Court of Appeal that, on a balance of probabilities, he would have been released had the review taken place in March 2008. It was noteworthy that in May 2008 the Parole Board had decided, on the basis of the papers before it, that it needed further papers in order properly to consider the case (see paragraph 10 above).

Such a conclusion would render Article 5 \u00a7 4 redundant. There were plainly sufficient safeguards against arbitrary detention in a case such as the applicant\u2019s. The 1997 Act provided for reviews to take place every two years (see paragraph 19 above) and Article 5 \u00a7 4 offered a protection which could be enforced in the domestic courts by a mandatory order requiring the Parole Board to convene a hearing. The purpose and effect of Article 5 \u00a7 4 was precisely to deal with the types of delay that had occurred in this case.

With the passage of time, the link between the initial conviction and a later deprivation of liberty gradually weakens. The causal link required by subparagraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release or to re-detain was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the decision by the sentencing court or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives (see Weeks, cited above, \u00a7 49; and James, Wells and Lee, cited above, \u00a7 189).",

In James, Wells and Lee, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 192-196, the Court identified four types of conduct on the part of the authorities which might constitute arbitrariness for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1. First, detention will be arbitrary where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities. Second, the condition that there be no arbitrariness demands that both the order to detain and the execution of the detention genuinely conform with the purpose of the restrictions permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 \u00a7 1. Third, there must be some relationship between the ground of permitted deprivation of liberty relied on and the place and conditions of detention. Fourth, the requirement that detention not be arbitrary implies the need for a relationship of proportionality between the ground of detention relied upon and the detention in question. However, the scope of the proportionality test to be applied in a given case varies depending on the type of detention involved.",

This implies not only that the competent courts must reach their decisions speedily but also that, where an automatic review of the lawfulness of detention has been instituted, their decisions must follow at \u201creasonable intervals\u201d (see Oldham v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 36273/97, \u00a7 30, ECHR 2000X). These rights are procedural in nature and are intended to help secure the protection of the substantive right to liberty guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 1. The fact that procedural rights are protected as rights in themselves by Article 5 \u00a7 4 serves to underline their important role in ensuring that unlawful and arbitrary detention does not occur. However, the finding of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04 does not, of itself, result in a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Mooren, cited above, \u00a7 88).",

Instead, he relied on case-law of this Court which he contended showed that procedural delays of the nature and length of that which occurred in his case breached Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 30 above). However, for the Court, the facts of the cases cited differ from the facts of the applicant\u2019s case in an important respect. In the cases relied on by the applicant, the period of detention at issue was not based on any judicial decision, the order authorising detention having expired, and there was a lack of adequate safeguards to ensure that the applicants\u2019 release from detention would not be unreasonably delayed (see Erkalo, \u00a7 57; Sch\u00f6nbrod, \u00a7\u00a7 107-108 and H.W., \u00a7\u00a7 83 and 89). By contrast, in the present case the applicant\u2019s detention remained at all times formally authorised by the sentence of custody for life imposed on him by the Crown Court in 2001 (see paragraph 6 above). He could not be released unless and until there was a decision of the Parole Board that he had shown the required reduction in risk and was safe for release. The Court of Appeal\u2019s finding in December 2010, on a balance of probabilities, that had a Parole Board hearing taken place in March 2008 he would have been released cannot be equated to a formal Parole Board finding in March 2008 that he was safe for release. The existence of a valid court order authorising detention constituted an important safeguard against arbitrariness in the applicant\u2019s case.",

However, the Court does not consider that either case assists the applicant. In both cases, the Court found that a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 had arisen because the detention did not follow a \u201cprocedure prescribed by law\u201d (see Nakach, \u00a7 43; and Schenkel, \u00a7\u00a032). In other words, it was the strict requirement of lawfulness under domestic law (see paragraph 39 above) which had been breached in those cases. In the present case, no breach of domestic law has been established. The applicant emphasises the Court of Appeal\u2019s finding that he ought to have been released in March 2008 to support his argument that procedural safeguards prescribed by domestic law were not followed. However, as noted above, that finding, made with the benefit of hindsight, did not remove the legal basis that existed throughout the impugned period of detention.",

However, in setting a timetable which ensured a further review well before the two-year period envisaged by the legislation, the Secretary of State acted in conformity with the requirement under Article 5 \u00a7 4 for review at \u201creasonable intervals\u201d, the frequency of which must be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case (see paragraph 41 above and Oldham, cited above, \u00a7 31). The failure to ensure a review within \u201creasonable intervals\u201d can, and in the present case did, result in a finding of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention and an award of damages. It was by reference to the Secretary of State\u2019s timetable that the Court of Appeal held that there had been delays which led to its finding of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4. But the applicant has not cited any judgment of this Court where it has found that delay in proceedings to review the legality of detention resulted in a violation not only of Article 5 \u00a7 4 but also of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It is significant that the applicant in Schenkel contended under Article 5 \u00a7 1 that the proceedings concerning the prolongation of his detention order were not conducted with the necessary diligence. However, the Court decided that it was more appropriate to examine that question in the context of its examination of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 27 and 31). The Court does not rule out that there may be circumstances in which, exceptionally, a delay in the review of the legality of post-tariff detention is such as to give rise to concerns that the detention itself has become arbitrary and incompatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1. However, barring such exceptional circumstances, a complaint of delay falls to be considered under Article 5 \u00a7 4 only.",
