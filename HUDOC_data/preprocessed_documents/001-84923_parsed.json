The Court observes, and it is not contested by the parties, that the applicant was awarded compensation for the delay in the enforcement of the judgment of 11 September 2001 (see paragraph 23 above). The Court does not exclude that such a compensation award could constitute redress of the State's previous failure to comply with the judgment within a reasonable time, provided that this award has been paid in full without any delay. The Government argued that the compensation award had not been paid to the applicant because she had not submitted the writ of execution neither to the defendant nor to the bailiffs. However, the Court reiterates that a person who has obtained an enforceable judgment against the State as a result of successful litigation cannot be required to resort to enforcement proceedings in order to have it executed (see Metaxas v. Greece, no. 8415/02, \u00a719, 27\u00a0May 2004, and Reynbakh v. , no. 23405/03, \u00a7 24, 29 September 2005). The State authorities were aware of the applicant's claims, and, as soon as the decision of 15 August 2005 became enforceable, it was incumbent on the State to comply with it. However, the Government did not adduce any evidence showing that this award had been paid to the applicant in full and in good time. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant may still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d in respect of her complaint about the delayed enforcement of the judgment of 11 September 2001.",

The Government further pointed out that the Federal Treasury had received the writ of execution only on 10 December 2004. The outstanding debt was paid to the applicant on 31 December 2004, i.e. in good time. Therefore, the Government considered that they were responsible only for two periods of delay in the enforcement of the judgment of 11 September 2001: from 26\u00a0September 2001 to 17 November 2002, and from 1 January to 16\u00a0October 2004.",

The enforcement proceedings were postponed and subsequently terminated on several occasions on the ground that the debtor had no sufficient funds. However, the Court reiterates that it is not open to a State authority to cite the lack of funds or other resources, as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt (see Plotnikovy v. Russia, no.\u00a043883/02, \u00a7 23, 24 February 2005, and Malinovskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a041302/02, \u00a7 35, 16 June 2005). Admittedly, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances, but the delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under Article 6 \u00a7 1. The applicant should not be prevented from benefiting from the success of the litigation on the ground of alleged financial difficulties experienced by the State (see Burdov v. , no. 59498/00, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2002-III).",
