The servicemen dispersed throughout the applicant's household and searched his house, barn and shed. The servicemen forced the applicant into an APC and took him to the outskirts of Gikalo, where he was transferred to an Avtozak vehicle. In the Avtozak the sixth applicant saw thirteen other men from the village, including his nephew Murad Gelayev. The vehicle took the detainees to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, where the men were forced to stand against the wall and were subjected to beatings by shovels, bludgeons and steel rods. At about 12 p.m. a senior officer arrived at the site and personally kicked each detainee between the legs. After a short break a serviceman with a dog arrived and set the dog on the detainees. Then the detainees were ordered to run to the basement. In the basement they were ordered to take off their clothes; meanwhile Murad Gelayev and Mr Sul.S. were seated at a table and questioned. The applicant heard one of the guards ordering Murad Gelayev to put his hands on the table and hitting Murad's fingers with a truncheon. Next the officer asked the other servicemen if they had a knife. He could not find one in the basement and went outside. Having found a knife, which looked like that of a hunter, he cut off Murad Gelayev's ear, wrapped it in a bandage and put it in his pocket saying: \u201cIt's a souvenir for me\u201d. After that he cut Mr Sul.S.'s ear off and gave it to another officer saying: \u201cAnd here is a souvenir for you\u201d. The latter also put it in his pocket. According to the applicant, after continued beatings he and other detainees were taken to Khankala whereas Murad Gelayev and Mr Sul.S. remained in the Oktyabrskiy VOVD.",

In support of their complaint they referred to the following facts. At the material time Gikalo had been under the total control of federal troops. The armed men who had abducted Murad Gelayev had worn camouflage uniforms; the majority of them had been masked; they had been equipped with portable radios and had arrived as a large group. They had arrived in military vehicles, including APCs, early in the morning, which indicated that they had been able to circulate freely in the area without being afraid that they would be seen by the local law-enforcement agencies. The men acted in a manner similar to that of special forces carrying out identity checks. The men had abducted thirteen other residents of Gikalo along with Murad Gelayev. The local police officers had acknowledged that Murad Gelayev had been abducted by federal servicemen and taken to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD (see paragraph 75 above) and the district prosecutor's office had been aware that the perpetrators had used APCs during the abduction (see paragraphs 37 and 48 above). The applicants pointed out that at the material time only the federal servicemen could have deployed APCs and used them for special operations. All the information disclosed from the criminal investigation file supported their assertion as to the involvement of State agents in the abduction. In particular, the numerous witness statements (see paragraphs 49, 52, 53, 56, 57, 62-70, 73-75 and 78 above) and other documents from the investigation file had confirmed the involvement of State agents in the abduction. Since Murad Gelayev had been missing for more than ten years, he could be presumed dead. That presumption was further supported by the circumstances in which he had been arrested, which should be recognised as life-threatening. Finally, the applicants referred to a number of cases examined by the Court in which it had been established that other Chechen men had disappeared in 2000 after they had been taken by their abductors to the same VOVD (see Magomadov v. , no.\u00a068004/01, \u00a7\u00a7 96-97, 12 July 2007, and Yusupova and Zaurbekov v.\u00a0, no. 22057/02, \u00a7\u00a7 62-63, 9 October 2008).",

They further stressed that the servicemen who had served at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in 2000 had been questioned by the investigators only in 2009, that is nine years after the events, and that even then the questioning had been conducted formally and superficially, without any follow-up questions, with the result that all the witnesses had given short identical replies. The applicants pointed out that the investigators had failed to take such basic investigative steps as questioning a number of villagers who had been detained with Murad Gelayev and had been subsequently released, as well as questioning of the officers in charge of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD at the material time. These steps had not been taken in spite of the fact that the witnesses had provided the investigators with the necessary information pertaining to the officers' current positions and ranks. The investigators had also failed to identify and question the officers who had guarded Murad Gelayev and the other detainees in the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. The applicants also pointed out that the investigation had been suspended and resumed a number of times \u2013 thus delaying the taking of the most basic steps \u2013 and that the relatives had not been properly informed of the most important investigative measures. The fact that the investigation had been pending for such a long period of time without producing any known results was further proof of its ineffectiveness. The applicants also invited the Court to draw conclusions from the Government's unjustified failure to submit a copy of the entire contents of the investigation file to them or to the Court. In particular, they stressed that the Government had failed to furnish the Court with copies of at least nine witness statements given by the applicants and other residents of Gikalo in 2001, 2006 and 2009, as well as copies of the prosecutors' orders criticising the investigators and ordering them to take certain steps.",

From the documents submitted it is clear that in spite of the information obtained during the preliminary inquiry in 2001 to the effect that Murad Gelayev had been abducted (see paragraphs 42 and 45 above), and the fact that the Oktyabrskiy VOVD had opened a search file in respect of him, the very same Oktyabrskiy VOVD had refused to initiate a criminal investigation into the matter (see paragraph 46 above). No steps had been taken by the law-enforcement agencies from 28 August 2001 to 13 July 2005 when, owing to the applicants' consistent complaints, with a delay of almost four years the prosecutor's office decided to open the investigation into the disappearance of Murad Gelayev. From the documents submitted it transpires that subsequently a number of essential steps were either significantly delayed or not taken at all. For example, the crime scene examination had been conducted more than two years after the opening of the investigation (see paragraph 72 above) and a number of important witnesses, such as the police officers serving at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD at the material time, had not been questioned until more than four years after the beginning of the proceedings (see paragraph 77 above). Further, it is clear that the investigators had not taken such basic steps as the identification of the military vehicles, including the APCs, which had been involved in the abduction; the questioning of their drivers; or the identification and questioning of the officers who had been in charge of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in February 2000 or the officers who had guarded Murad Gelayev and other detainees on the premises of the police station following the abduction. Moreover, the investigators had failed to question all those residents of Gikalo who had been abducted with Murad Gelayev and taken with him to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. From the copies of the interrogation transcripts submitted it is clear that the officers from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region who had served at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in 2000 had been questioned in a superficial manner, thus preventing the investigators from obtaining any meaningful information about the events in question. It is obvious that the above investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004XII).",

The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the suspension or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the suspension decisions were taken without the necessary investigative steps, leading to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection that the applicants failed to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities' reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities' conduct (see Orhan v.
