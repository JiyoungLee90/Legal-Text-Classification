The case originated in an application (no. 32836/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by the company SOFTEL spol. s r.o. (“the applicant”), on 4 August 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Vidra, the sole owner and managing director of the company. The Slovak Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Pirošíková.
On 4 March 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant is a private limited liability company with its registered office in Žilina.
On 1 February 1995 eight persons filed an action with the Žilina District Court. They sued the applicant and the Municipality of Žilina for a sum of money on grounds of unjust enrichment.
On 24 January 1996 the Žilina District Court delivered a judgment. On 20 June 1996 the Banská Bystrica Regional Court, upon the applicant’s appeal, quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for further examination to the Žilina District Court.
On 16 December 1998 the case was transferred to the Čadca District Court and on 10 July 2001 to the Martin District Court upon decisions of the Žilina  as to bias on the part of judges.
On 27 February 2006 the Martin District Court delivered a judgment. The parties appealed and the file was transferred to the Žilina  on 12 May 2006.
The plaintiffs’ representative lodged their observations on the applicant’s appeal in August 2006. The case file circulated within the  until 24 January 2008 when a hearing was scheduled for 19 February 2008. The hearing was adjourned upon an objection by the applicant as to bias on the part of judges.
On 31 March 2008 the file was transferred to the Supreme Court for a decision on the objection of bias. On 1 April 2008 the Supreme Court decided not to exclude the challenged judges from hearing and deciding on the case.
On 22 April 2008 the  quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the Martin District Court, also because of the latter’s failure to respect the legal opinion of the appellate court given on 20 June 1996.
On 12 May 2008 the file was transferred to the Martin District Court. In August 2008 the applicant informed the Court that the proceedings were pending.
The applicant complained about the length of the proceedings before the Žilina, Čadca and Martin District Courts to the . On 18 January 2006 the  (First Chamber) rejected the applicant’s complaint about unjustified delays in the proceedings before the District Courts in Žilina and Čadca as being belated (as those courts no longer dealt with the case and the complaints had been lodged outside the statutory two-month time-limit).
On 4 May 2006 the Constitutional Court found that the Martin District Court had violated the applicant’s right under Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution to a hearing without unjustified delay.
The  held that the case was complex from a factual point of view. However, the Martin District Court had only assessed the evidence adduced before the District Courts in Žilina and Čadca and the duration of the proceedings could not be explained by the complexity of the case. The applicant had not contributed to the length of the proceedings. The Martin District Court had failed to proceed in an appropriate manner and it was responsible for delays totalling 43 months.
The  awarded SKK 60,000 (the equivalent of 1,612 euros at that time) to the applicant as just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage. It ordered the Martin District Court to reimburse the applicant’s legal costs but did not order it to avoid further delays in the proceedings, as that court had delivered its decision on the merits in the meantime.
