From 21\u00a0September to 25 November 1992 M. was placed for observation on account of his behavioural disturbances. Both parents visited him regularly.

Heard by the Board on 13 March 1996, the applicant opposed a social welfare official\u2019s proposal that access be further restricted to one weekend visit every other month and one telephone conversation per week and that any access during longer holidays should be decided later. The official considered that a restriction was necessary to prevent damage to M.\u2019s psychological development, regard being had to the fact that although having made progress he still was a psychologically and emotionally disturbed child. In those circumstances it was important that he spend a sufficient amount of time in the substitute family, who provided security. Moreover, according to the substitute parents, M. had clearly objected to visiting the applicant on several occasions. The applicant again requested a neutral examination of M.\u2019s resistance to visiting him and support from the substitute parents. According to a witness, M.K., heard at the applicant\u2019s request, the applicant\u2019s and M.\u2019s relationship had seemed perfectly normal during the latter\u2019s visit around Christmas 1995.

M.\u2019s development had improved while he stayed in the children\u2019s home. However, the progress had not been steady. The proceedings concerning the termination of public care from June to November 1994 had caused increased restlessness, but M. had become calmer once the personnel of the children\u2019s home had explained how the Board\u2019s decision would affect him. M. had been monitored again in connection with his placement in the substitute family. The Government submitted that M. and his mother had wanted him to be placed in a family, while the father had opposed it. M. had become anguished as a result of the father\u2019s phone calls and visits. After M. had been placed in the substitute family, an agreement had been reached between the parents that M. would visit them once a month and that they could call him once a week. Thus, M. had two visits per month, which proved hard for him especially after he had started school. M. had continued to object to meeting his father. For these reasons the Board decided in March 1996 to restrict the visits so that the parents would meet M. in turn every other month. The telephone contacts remained unchanged. During the summer M. would have a week long visit with each parent. During the substitute family placement, M. was visited several times by a social welfare officer, the social welfare director and members of the Board. As M. had grown older, it had been possible to have more discussions with a view to finding out his views and wishes. Discussions had also been held with the substitute parents and the school teacher. M. had weekly therapy sessions in the child psychiatric clinic and less frequent appointments with Dr H.L. together with his substitute parents.",

The applicant had visited M. 18 times in 1993 and 11 times in 1994. In addition, M. had visited the applicant\u2019s home twice in 1993 and five times in 1994. Telephone contacts had not been restricted. In connection with the substitute family placement the care plan had been reassessed and it had been ordered that the applicant fetch M. once a month for a weekend home leave. Longer leave would be agreed upon separately. Telephone contacts were to take place once a week. Upon appeal the County Administrative Court found that the access question had not been decided in a binding manner, but the social welfare officials interpreted the decision as one in which the court upheld the care plan. Following the Parliamentary Ombudsman\u2019s intervention, the Board rendered a written decision, finding that allowing access to the extent requested by the biological parents would endanger M.\u2019s mental development. By this decision the access had been somewhat reduced on the ground that M. had clearly objected to home leave at the applicant\u2019s home. In 1999 an agreement was reached between the parties according to which M. would spend time with the applicant five times a year about three days in a row and twice a year for about a week each time.

Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 24\u00a0March 1988, Series A no. 130, pp. 36-37, \u00a7 81). The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the competent authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child (see K. and T. v.  ([GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7 178, ECHR\u00a02001VII). After a considerable period of time has passed since the child was originally taken into public care, the interest of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited (see K.A. v.

The minimum to be expected of the authorities is to examine the situation anew from time to time to see whether there has been any improvement in the family\u2019s situation. The possibilities of reunification will be progressively diminished and eventually destroyed if the biological parent and the child are not allowed to meet each other at all, or only so rarely that no natural bonding between them is likely to occur (see K. and T. v.

As a result, he had not had the benefit of having them at his disposal at the hearing on 30 November 1995. Only on 12 June 1996 had he received the care records, but they had been tampered with as some of the entries had been erased from it by L.L. The proposal that the applicant obtain information orally on 7 July 1995 would not have offered a proper and effective means of getting information, in particular as L.L. had proven unreliable. Moreover, it would not have been in accordance with the law as stated by the \u2019s decision. As to the fact that the Board appealed against the County Administrative Court\u2019s decision granting the applicant the right to obtain a copy of the care records, the applicant considered that the Government\u2019s argument that the Board only wanted to obtain a precedent failed as the applicant\u2019s rights had thereby been undermined in an unreasonable and disproportionate manner. The Board had completely forgotten its proper role.",
