It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time (see, inter alia, Vernillo v.

The target of the applicant's criticism was the Mayor, himself a public figure, and the word \u201csumanuto\u201d was obviously not used to describe the latter's mental state but rather to explain the manner in which he had allegedly been spending the money of the local taxpayers (see paragraphs 10 and 65 above). Although the applicant was unable to prove before the domestic courts that his other claims were true, even assuming that they were all statements of fact and, as such, susceptible of proof, he clearly had some reason to believe that the Mayor might have been involved in criminal activity and, also, that his tenure was unlawful (see paragraphs 23-26 above). In any event, although the applicant's article contained some strong language, it was not a gratuitous personal attack and focused on issues of public interest rather than the Mayor's private life, which transpired from the article's content, its overall tone as well as the context (see paragraphs 7, 10, and 18-22 above). Finally, the reasoning of the criminal and civil courts, in ruling against the applicant, was thus \u201crelevant\u201d when they held that the reputation of the Mayor had been affected. It was not, however, \u201csufficient\u201d given the amount of compensation and costs awarded (equivalent to approximately eight average monthly salaries in Serbia at the relevant time) as well as the suspended fine which could, under certain circumstances, not only have been revoked but could also have been converted into an effective prison term (see paragraphs 9 and 15 above; see also paragraph 28 above, in particular Articles 54 and 39, respectively, quoted therein).",

The key question in the concrete context seems, however, to be the nature of the discretionary power. In concreto, we are not dealing here with discretio generalis, but rather with discretio legalis in terms of discretion limited by cogent legal considerations emanating from the law in force that regulate the acts of the public prosecutor as regards a request for the protection of legality. Renowned commentators maintain that Article 419 requires that the public prosecutor \u201cmust submit (a request) if the request is to produce changes of practical significance in favour of the accused\u201d (see, for instance, Tihomir Vasiljevi\u0107, Mom\u010dilo Gruba\u010d, Comments on the Criminal Procedure Code, str. 744). Consequently, it appears that the request for the protection of legality provided the applicant with a reasonable possibility of obtaining an effective remedy, bearing in mind that, as Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice pointed out, \u201cwhat there must be a reasonable possibility of is the existence of a possible effective remedy, and that the mere fact that there is no reasonable possibility of the claimant obtaining that remedy ... does not constitute the type of absence of reasonable possibility which will displace the local remedies rule\u201d (G. Fitzmaurice, 'Hersch Lauterpacht \u2013 The Scholar as Judge' (1961), 37 BYIL, p. 1 at p. 60).",
