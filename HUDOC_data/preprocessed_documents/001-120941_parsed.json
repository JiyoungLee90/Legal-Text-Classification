As the Court understands the Government\u2019s reliance on Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 (b) of the Convention, they consider that the applicant did not suffer a significant disadvantage by virtue of the length of his pre-trial detention that lasted for one year, eleven months and eighteen days.

Firstly, they argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, in that he had not lodged complaints with the administrative courts, he had not appealed against the 29 September 2011 decision, and he had not complained to the . In their submission, the administrative courts provided an effective and easily accessible remedy for the applicant\u2019s complaints, capable of rendering judgments forbidding a public authority to carry out a particular action (faktisk\u0101 r\u012bc\u012bba) and awarding compensation. They submitted two examples of domestic case-law whereby complaints concerning long-term visits had been examined on the merits but had been rejected (case no.\u00a0A420506911, 28\u00a0December 2011; case no.\u00a0A42499106, 22 February 2008). Secondly, the Government considered that the Court could only review the applicant\u2019s allegations which had been reviewed by the administrative courts in response to his complaint about a particular visit. They highlighted that each request for a long-term visit was subject to obtaining permission from the administration of the relevant prison. If that permission was not granted, the decision could be made by the Prisons Administration, whose decision could itself be subject to review by the administrative courts.",

The applicant did not complain about one or several isolated incidents where his right to receive long-term visits, which was established by the applicable provision of the Sentence Enforcement Code (see paragraph 46 above), had been infringed. It transpires from the applicant\u2019s submissions that he was not allowed to receive any long-term visits by his unmarried partner, M.B., and her daughter, because of the mere fact that their relationship had not been registered and because of what he submitted was a formalistic approach adopted by the domestic authorities. Moreover, the Court notes that the applicant, in his application lodged with the administrative courts, clearly noted his dissatisfaction with the fact that he had never received long-term visits by his partner and her daughter. The Government\u2019s submission that these administrative proceedings were solely related to one refused visit is therefore misconceived.

Furthermore, it took the district court a further year to deal with a procedural issue (payment of court fees for lodging an appeal). Eventually, on 23 August 2011 it was decided to reduce the court fees to be paid by the applicant in respect of his appeal, but in the meantime the applicant had been transferred to serve his prison sentence in .

In the present case, the Government have made reference to the relevant provisions of domestic law and, most importantly, their application in practice by the administrative courts in comparable cases. It stems from the rulings provided by the Government that the domestic first-instance courts have accepted and examined complaints about the refusals of long-term visits by the prisoner\u2019s wife\u2019s son in one case (case no.\u00a0A420506911) and by the prisoner\u2019s brother and son in another case (case no.\u00a0A42499106). These rulings have become final as far as the refusals of long-term visits are concerned. Unlike in other cases, there is no suggestion that the notions of \u201caction of a public authority\u201d or \u201csignificant interference with human rights\u201d have been applied by the domestic courts in a manner that is non-compliant with Article 8 of the Convention in so far as they relate to complaints about long-term visits (compare and contrast Meln\u012btis, cited above, \u00a7 51, and Savi\u010ds v. , no.\u00a017892/03, \u00a7\u00a0106, 27\u00a0November 2012). The Court also notes that one of these rulings (in case no.\u00a0A42499106) related to a situation that obtained in and around July and August 2006; the first refusal to allow the present applicant to receive a long-term visit was made in the same period.",

My concern is if this attitude were transposed generally to deprivations of liberty in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1. It is difficult for me to conceive of a situation where a deprivation of liberty in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 can ever be regarded as a non-significant violation. At most a given situation may amount to a mere temporary restriction of one\u2019s liberty, as was implicit in Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC] nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, 15\u00a0March 2012). In Ostendorf v.
