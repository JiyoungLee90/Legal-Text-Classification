At the same time, an accused person often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure has tended to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular situation of vulnerability can only properly be compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure that the right of an accused not to incriminate himself is respected. Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination. In this connection, the Court has noted that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly important in the case of serious charges (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2008, with further references).",

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will, in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during questioning by police without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (ibid., \u00a7 55).",

Indeed, no evidence has been presented to the Court to show that the applicant\u2019s detention in that period had any legal basis. No facts have been alleged, nor any details provided, as to the circumstances in which the applicant had allegedly committed an act of minor disorderly conduct such as to necessitate his being placed under administrative arrest in the period between the murder and the time of his arrest as a suspect in the murder case. Having regard to its case-law on this matter in respect of Ukraine, the Court considers that the present case is another example of the recurrent problem of using administrative detention in an arbitrary fashion to ensure the availability of a suspect for questioning without respecting the due process of law. The Court recalls that it has already urged Ukraine to implement specific reforms in order to put an end to this practice (see Balitskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051, 53 and 54, 3 November 2011).",

Those additional considerations do not apply in the present case. Nevertheless, the Court takes into account the fact that the waiver at issue was made by the applicant at a time when he was arbitrarily detained by the authorities, thus effectively depriving him of prompt judicial review of his detention and exposing him to a risk of unlawful pressure and coercion. In fact no details have been provided to the Court to show what happened to the applicant during the two-day period of his arbitrary detention in police custody. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that during that period the applicant was in a position to communicate with a lawyer who could explain to him the peculiarities of his procedural status. It appears that the authorities deliberately kept the applicant in a continued state of uncertainty before they decided to clarify his wishes regarding the question of his legal representation. Having regard to such dubious circumstances and to the applicant\u2019s vulnerable position at that time, the Court cannot conclude that the applicant waived his right to a lawyer in circumstances which were attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to the importance of such a waiver. It therefore rejects the Government\u2019s contention that there was a valid waiver for the purpose of the Convention.",

In particular, the applicant several days later retracted his initial self-incriminating statements and claimed to be not guilty throughout all subsequent proceedings. However, the domestic courts gave credence to the applicant\u2019s initial self-incriminating statements, which had been made in dubious circumstances without a lawyer. Relying on those statements, the courts convicted the applicant without properly addressing his allegations of a violation of his procedural rights at the relevant time.",
