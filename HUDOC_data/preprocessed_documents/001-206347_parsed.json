It may be important for a State to preserve its secrets, but it is of infinitely greater importance to surround justice with all the requisite safeguards, of which one of the most indispensable is publicity. Before excluding the public from a hearing, courts must make specific findings that closure is necessary to protect a compelling governmental interest and limit secrecy to the extent necessary to preserve such an interest (see, for similar reasoning in the context of criminal trial, Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, \u00a7 83, 4\u00a0December 2008, and Pichugin v. Russia, no. 38623/03, \u00a7 187, 23\u00a0October 2012).",

It did not indicate what documents in the case file were considered to contain State secrets or how they were related to the nature and character of the applicant\u2019s case. There were no measures taken to counterbalance the detrimental effect that holding the hearing in camera must have had on public confidence in the proper administration of justice for the sake of protecting the State\u2019s interest in keeping its secrets.
