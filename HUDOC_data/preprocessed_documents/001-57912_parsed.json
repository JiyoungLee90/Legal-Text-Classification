He maintained that his ancestors had used the proposed name and that he and other members of the Stjerna family had always felt it an injustice only to bear half of the original name. Moreover, the use of his surname gave rise to practical difficulties as it was an old Swedish form, was not well known and was difficult to pronounce.

Although Swedish names were not unusual in , his name, starting with a combination of three consonants - \"stj\" - , was exceptionally difficult for a non-Swedish-speaking Finnish person to spell and pronounce. His mail was delayed as a result of his name being misspelt and the name had given rise to a pejorative nickname: \"kirnu\" in Finnish, derived from the Swedish word \"k\u00e4rna\" (\"churn\" in English). He argued that decisive weight should be given to the fact that he himself resented these sources of inconvenience. The proposed name, Tavaststjerna, although in many ways similar to Stjerna, would not give rise to the same problems; it was more common and better known in the region in which he lived and could not easily be turned into a pejorative nickname.",

Particular importance should therefore be attached to the fact that, in his view, the period of approximately one hundred and sixty years between the death of the last ancestor named Tavaststjerna and his own birth was not long enough to sever the bonds linking him to that family and his sense of belonging to it.",

The existence of such positive obligations must be evaluated having regard to \"the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual\". To this it has added rather vaguely that in the sphere of positive obligations \"the aims mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 8 (art. 8-2) may be of a certain relevance\".

In the Cossey case the claim of the applicant, an operated transsexual, was that she should be issued with a fresh birth certificate showing her present sex rather than her sex at the date of birth. The refusal of the United Kingdom to carry out a modification of its system for recording civil status could be analysed either as a negative interference with the applicant\u2019s rights or as a violation of the State\u2019s positive obligation to adapt its legislation so as to take account of the applicant\u2019s situation. The Keegan case against  concerned the placement of a child for adoption without the natural father\u2019s knowledge or consent, a measure permitted under Irish law. This state of affairs could be taken as a negative interference with the father\u2019s right to respect for his family life or as a failure by  to fulfil a positive obligation to confer a right of guardianship on natural fathers.

Whenever a so-called positive obligation arises the Court should examine, as in the event of a so-called negative obligation, whether there has been an interference with the right to respect for private and family life under paragraph 1 of Article 8 (art. 8-1), and whether such interference was \"in accordance with the law\", pursued legitimate aims and was \"necessary in a democratic society\" within the meaning of paragraph 2 (art. 8-2).",
