The case originated in an application (no. 33302/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Anton Aleksandrovich Vorobyev (“the applicant”), on 14 April 2008.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 18 May 2010 the applicant’s complaints regarding the conditions of his pre-trial detention, a lack of an effective domestic remedy for that grievance, as well as about the absence of sufficient reasons for that detention and its excessive length were communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1983 and lived in Nizhny Novgorod prior to the events of the case.
On 23 September 2005 the applicant was arrested on charges of robbery, theft, forgery and extortion.
On 11 April 2008 the Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and gave him a custodial sentence.
On 21 August 2008 the Presidium of the Regional Court, by way of supervisory-review proceedings, quashed the judgment 11 April 2008 and remitted the case to the trial court for fresh examination. Referring to the gravity of the charges, it also ordered the applicant’s detention to continue for a further three months.
By orders of 17 November 2008 and 16 February and 19 May 2009, the authorised period of the applicant’s detention was extended. These orders cited the gravity of the charges and the possibility of the applicant’s absconding as the main reasons for the continued detention.
On 24 November 2009 the Regional Court found the applicant guilty of a number of grave crimes and sentenced him to a six years and one month’s imprisonment.
Between 24 September 2005 and 14 January 2009 the applicant was detained in remand prison IZ-52/1 of Nizhniy Novgorod. He submitted that the cells had been severely overcrowded and in a poor sanitary condition.
