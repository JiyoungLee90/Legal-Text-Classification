The Court observes that it is not disputed that, when the adoption was granted, there existed certain ties between the applicant and A. In the light of this, and bearing in mind that the parties' arguments before the Court were centred on the issue of compliance with Article 8, the Court proposes to proceed on the basis that it was applicable to the present case (S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck v.

It is not the Court's task to substitute itself for the domestic authorities, but rather to review, in the light of the Convention, the decision taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation. Article 8 requires that the domestic authorities strike a fair balance between the interests involved and that, in the balancing process, particular importance should be attached to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents (see Eski v. , no. 21949/03, \u00a7\u00a035, 25 January 2007, Kuijper\u00a0v.\u00a0the Netherlands (dec.), no. 64848/01, 3 March 2005, and Sommerfeld v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 31871/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062-64, ECHR 2003VIII (extracts)).",

They had been living together for almost three years by the time the adoption was granted (from the time A. was two years and five months till she became five years and two months old), and A. had regarded him as her father. Thus, when the adoption was granted by the District Court, \u201cde facto\u201d family ties had existed between A. and S.A. for a considerable time (see S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck, cited above, pp.\u00a030953096, \u00a7\u00a033). In this context the Court reiterates that the existence or non-existence of \u201cfamily life\u201d is essentially a question of fact depending upon the real existence in practice of close personal ties (see, among other authorities, K. and T. v. Finland [GC], no.\u00a025702/94, \u00a7 150, ECHR\u00a02001VII). The adoption decision in the present case did not set in motion the bonding of the child with the adopter (see, mutatis mutandis, Keegan v. Ireland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055) but, on the contrary, consolidated and formalised existing ties (see Eski, cited above, \u00a7 39, with further references to the above cited cases of S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck and Kuijper).",
