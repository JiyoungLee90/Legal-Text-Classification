Having regard to the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s condition and the absence of any obstacle to performing a medical examination of the cause of his complaints, the Court finds unacceptable the authorities\u2019 failure to address the problem in a timely fashion. The eight-month delay not only put the applicant\u2019s health at risk of serious, irreparable harm, exacerbating the disease, but also prolonged his suffering from the pain. Without speculating as to whether timely diagnostic and curative measures would have given the applicant a chance of recovery, the Court considers that the continuously negligent attitude of the medical authorities towards the applicant\u2019s condition, which was associated with considerable pain, in itself amounted to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
