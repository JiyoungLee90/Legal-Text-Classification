The applicant was a direct witness to the incident when armed men broke into his house, although he did not witness the abduction itself. The abductors arrived in several military-type vehicles and acted as an organised group; they were armed with automatic weapons, used portable radios and spoke unaccented Russian (compare Suleymanov v. Russia, no. 32501/11, \u00a7\u00a0133, 22 January 2013). The incident took place at night. Furthermore, there were no discrepancies between the statements concerning the incident given by the applicant, his wife and by his son, Mr Ibragim Makhloyev. From the material in the criminal case file submitted by the Government, it is evident that two police checkpoints were in place in the vicinity of the applicant\u2019s village. The Court therefore considers that there was a certain limitation on the free movement of vehicles in the area at the time.",

Nevertheless, the official investigation considered the possibility that the perpetrators of the abduction could be State agents. The investigators also considered that that the reason for the abduction could have been a blood feud or hostility towards Mr Maskhud Makhloyev. However, other than questioning a few witnesses, the investigators took no serious steps to check whether the abduction could have been perpetrated for other reasons. No serious steps were taken to verify those hypotheses and no information was obtained that the abductors could have been other than State agents (see, by contrast, Zubayrayev, cited above, \u00a7 81).",

The period of time which has elapsed since the person was detained, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account.

Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s neighbours were questioned after almost four and seven months (see paragraph 48\u00a0above).
