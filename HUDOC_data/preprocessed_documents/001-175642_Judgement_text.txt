The case originated in an application (no. 67081/13) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Portuguese national, Ms Mateus Pereira da Silva (“the applicant”), on 17 October 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr J.J. Ferreira Alves, a lawyer practising in Matosinhos. The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M.F. da Graça Carvalho, Deputy Attorney General.
On 18 March 2015 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Torres Novas.
On 16 February 2004 eviction proceedings were instituted against the applicant’s husband, A.S., before the Court of Torres Novas (domestic proceedings no. 154/04.7TBTNV).
On 31 March 2004 A.S. lodged his submissions in reply (contestação) and on 6 May 2004 the claimant lodged new submissions (réplica).
On 22 September 2006 A.S. died.
On 7 November 2006 the court suspended the proceedings and on 9 November 2007 it declared the proceedings’ interruption as the claimant had not taken the initiative of continuing the proceedings against the defendant’s heirs.
On 18 December 2007 the claimant applied for leave to continue the proceedings against the defendant’s heirs (incidente de habilitação de herdeiros).
After having faced some difficulties in summoning the heirs, the court managed to summon all of them and on 13 June 2009 the defendant’s heirs, including the applicant, were admitted as parties to the proceedings.
On 26 June 2009 the court was informed of the claimant’s death.
On an unknown date one of the claimant’s heirs, A.O., applied for leave to continue the proceedings with her and the other claimant’s heir as parties.
On 22 June 2012 the court admitted the claimant’s heirs as parties to the proceedings.
On 22 January 2010 the court was informed of the death of one of the defendant’s heirs.
On an unknown date A.O. applied for leave to continue the proceedings against the heirs of the deceased party. On 4 May 2010 she provided information on those heirs and in July she provided their birth certificates. On 12 July 2011 A.O. provided the heirs’ addresses, following which they were summoned.
On 30 April 2012 those heirs were admitted as parties to the proceedings.
On 14 December 2012 the court gave a preparatory decision setting out the facts that had already been established and those that remained outstanding (despacho saneador).
On 14 January 2013 the claimant’s heirs requested an inspection to the house, which took place on 3 April 2013.
On 29 May 2013 the hearing that had been scheduled for that day was postponed as the parties’ lawyers were not present.
Subsequently, hearings were held on 18 September, 29 October and 17 December 2013.
On 14 January 2014 the court adopted a decision with regard to the factual basis (resposta à matéria de facto) and on 13 March 2014 it delivered its decision in which it ordered the applicant to vacate the house and to pay rent arrears.
On an unknown date the applicant appealed against that decision. The appeal was declared inadmissible for an unknown reason.
As the applicant had not complied with the 13 March 2014 decision (see paragraph 21 above), on 19 January 2015 the claimant instituted enforcement proceedings against her before the Santarém Court.
According to the latest information received by the Court on 23 November 2015, on that date the enforcement proceedings were still pending at first instance.
