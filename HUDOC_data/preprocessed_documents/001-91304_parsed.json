This is so because the assessment of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally carried out with reference to the date on which the application was lodged with the Court. This rule is subject to exceptions, which may be justified by the particular circumstances of each case (see Prodan v. Moldova, no.\u00a049806/99, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, ECHR 2004III (extracts)). However, in the case at hand the Court does not see particular circumstances justifying a departure from the general rule, bearing in mind that (1) there did not exist an effective domestic remedy enabling the applicants to receive adequate compensation for nearly eight years after the lodging of the present application, and (2) the Government have not shown convincingly that in 2007 it was still possible for the applicants to obtain a valuation of their demolished apartment and bonds for it.

The Court has already dealt with a case where the same defect had led to the annulment of the applicants\u2019 title and found that such a shortcoming could not be characterised as a material breach of the relevant housing regulations. It also found that in so far as the municipality\u2019s decision violated relevant building planning rules, the responsibility for this error lay entirely with the municipal authorities (see Bornazovi v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 59993/00, 18 September 2007). The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. As in Bornazovi, it notes that the Government never claimed that the sale of the flat to the applicants had impeded the realisation of the building plan, which, moreover, was apparently abandoned. In sum, the Court finds that the State administration, not the applicants, had been responsible for the defect that led to the annulment of their property title.",

Their case is thus similar to the case of Tzilevi examined in Velikovi and Others (see \u00a7\u00a7 94 and 226228). Like in Tzilevi, the Court considers that the applicants forewent the opportunity to obtain at least between 15 and 25 per cent of the value of the apartment, as that was the rate at which bonds were traded until the end of 2004. The fact that bond prices rose at the end of 2004 or that the applicable law was amended with practical effect from May 2007 and provided for payment of the bonds at face value cannot lead to the conclusion that the authorities would have secured adequate compensation forto the applicants but for their refusal to receive bonds. The applicants could not have foreseen bond prices or legislative amendments and the Court cannot speculate whether they would have waited four or more years before cashing their bonds. Furthermore, the legislation on compensation changed frequently and was not foreseeable (see Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0191 and 226).",
