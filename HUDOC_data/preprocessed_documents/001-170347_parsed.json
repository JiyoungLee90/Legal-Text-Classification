It further observed that it was a wellentrenched and necessary part of the legal tradition of the United Kingdom to develop the law through judicial interpretation. As the Court of Appeal had specifically addressed the doubts raised in Vinter regarding the clarity of the applicable domestic law, and set out an unequivocal statement of the legal position, that interpretation had to be accepted by the European Court.

The Lifer Manual did not and could not restrict or in any way fetter this obligation. Therefore, as the Court of Appeal had stated, the fact that the text of the Manual had not been revised was of no legal consequence. The Manual remained valid inasmuch as it laid out the approach to be taken where release was sought on grounds of advanced terminal illness or severe incapacity. The McLoughlin decision had further clarified that the Secretary of State was obliged under domestic law to consider all relevant circumstances of each case in a manner compatible with Article 3 \u2013 there was no remaining unclarity as to the law in this regard.

The relevant yardstick in the Secretary of State\u2019s review would be that stated in Vinter, i.e. whether there had been any changes in the life of the prisoner and such progress towards rehabilitation that continued detention could no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds. A whole life prisoner therefore knew what he must do to have a prospect of release, and what criteria would apply to the review. No greater specificity was required; it was neither necessary nor practicable to seek to lay down in greater detail what a prisoner must be able to demonstrate to be considered for release or reduction of sentence. The European Court itself had not identified specific criteria in its Article 3 case law, but expressed itself in more general terms. In every individual case, therefore, all the relevant circumstances of the prisoner would be taken into account.

In any event, identifying such a timeframe was more relevant to a system which did not provide for a review for a very long period, which was not the case in the domestic system. Legal certainty did not require a specific time constraint on sentence review, when that review was premised on the ability of the prisoner to make a case that their detention was no longer justified. This they could do at any time; they were not obliged to wait an indeterminate number of years. That could be regarded as more advantageous to the prisoner than being required to serve a long, minimum term of years before being permitted to apply for review. Regarding the circumstances of the applicant, they noted that he had not suggested at any stage that there was no legitimate penological ground for his continued detention.

He considered that the situation in domestic law remained contrary to Article 3, the McLoughlin decision having failed to remedy the deficiencies identified in Vinter. The Court of Appeal had proceeded on the incorrect assumption that the European Court was mistaken in its analysis of domestic law. Consequently, McLoughlin had merely sought to correct that perceived error, without developing the de jure situation. The review of whole life sentences was still based on a vague discretion vested in a Government minister. He considered that the Court should now rule that such a function must be entrusted to judges not politicians, this proposition finding clear support in the relevant international and comparative materials referred to in Vinter, and being implicit in the Vinter reasoning itself. He drew an analogy in this respect with the evolution that took place both in domestic case-law and Convention case-law requiring the removal of any role for the executive in the determination of sentences. Even if executive review could still be accepted in principle, the domestic system was deficient since the review was conducted by a partisan political figure, as illustrated by public remarks made by the then-Secretary of State following the McLoughlin decision. The procedure therefore did not offer any prospect of fairness, balance and certainty.",

For this to be a realistic prospect, there must be sentence planning, the opportunity to progress through the prison system, and structured reviews. The relevant international instruments identified certain basic procedural standards, demanding clarity and foreseeability as regards the timing of the review and the criteria governing it. These points had been endorsed in the Vinter judgment. In subsequent cases they had been reiterated and further developed. It was not just a question of rehabilitating the prisoner, but a matter of personal safety as well. A prisoner with no real prospect of ever being released risked the destruction of his personality, posing real danger to himself and to those in contact with him in the prison environment.

It noted that this was the reading given to section 30 by the Court of Appeal in the Bieber and Oakes cases, which would be consistent with the requirements of Article 3 as these were set down in Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a021906/04, ECHR 2008. However, in addition to the relevant judicial dicta the Court also had regard to the published official policy and to the application of the law in practice to whole life prisoners. It found that the policy set out by the Secretary of State in the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above) was too restrictive to comply with the Kafkaris principles. It further pointed out that the Lifer Manual gave whole life prisoners only a partial picture of the conditions in which the power of release might be exercised. It concluded that the contrast between section 30, interpreted by the domestic courts in a Conventioncompliant manner, and the narrow terms of the Lifer Manual meant such a lack of clarity in the law that the whole life sentence could not be regarded as reducible for the purposes of Article 3.",

Nor can the published policy fetter the Secretary of State\u2019s discretion by taking account only of the matters stipulated in the Lifer Manual.

The Convention does not prohibit the imposition of a life sentence on those convicted of especially serious crimes, such as murder. Yet to be compatible with Article 3 such a sentence must be reducible de jure and de facto, meaning that there must be both a prospect of release for the prisoner and a possibility of review. The basis of such review must extend to assessing whether there are legitimate penological grounds for the continuing incarceration of the prisoner. These grounds include punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation. The balance between them is not necessarily static and may shift in the course of a sentence, so that the primary justification for detention at the outset may not be so after a lengthy period of service of sentence. The importance of the ground of rehabilitation is underlined, since it is here that the emphasis of European penal policy now lies, as reflected in the practice of the Contracting States, in the relevant standards adopted by the Council of Europe, and in the relevant international materials (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059-81).",

Russia [GC], no. 41418/04, \u00a7\u00a0121, ECHR 2015; see also the cases referred to in Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102). Similar considerations apply under Article 3, given that respect for human dignity requires prison authorities to strive towards a life sentenced prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-104). It follows that the requisite review must take account of the progress that the prisoner has made towards rehabilitation, assessing whether such progress has been so significant that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0113116).

This includes when a review of sentence will take place or may be sought (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122). In this respect the Court has noted clear support in the relevant comparative and international materials for a review taking place no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of sentence, with periodic reviews thereafter (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 68, 118, 119 and 120).

Although the Court of Appeal refrained from specifying further the meaning of the words \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d in this context, or to elaborate criteria, it recalled earlier domestic case-law to the effect that exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in prison is to be taken into account (per Lord Bingham CJ in the 1998 judgment R v Home Secretary ex parte Hindley, and also Lord Steyn when that same case was decided by the House of Lords in 2001 \u2013 see paragraph 19 above). The Court further notes that in Bieber, when explaining the time at which an Article 3 challenge could be brought by a whole life prisoner, the Court of Appeal referred to \u201call the material circumstances, including the time that he has served and the progress made in prison\u201d (reproduced in Vinter and Others, cited above, at \u00a7\u00a049). Having regard to all of these dicta, it is evidently part of the established law of England and Wales that exceptional progress towards rehabilitation comes within the meaning of the statutory language and is thus a ground for review.",

As the Court has already noted above, the term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d encompasses the progress by the prisoner during the service of sentence (see paragraph 55 above). The relevant question is whether those serving life sentences in the domestic system can know what they must do to be considered for release, and under what conditions the review takes place (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122; see also paragraph 18 of Recommendation Rec(2003)22 and Rule 30.3 of the European Prison Rules, at paragraphs 20 and 21 above).",

These judgments are indeed relevant here, in that they illustrate the application by the Court of the Vinter case-law. In the L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar case, it was the lack of specific guidance as to the criteria and conditions for gathering the prisoner\u2019s \u201cpersonal particulars\u201d and for assessing them that was criticised. As there was no duty on the executive to give reasons for a decision, it meant that prisoners did not know what was required of them in order to be considered for release (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58). Under Article 46, the Chamber called for a reform that would ensure the relevant review, and that life prisoners would know \u201cwith some degree of precision\u201d what they must do (at \u00a7 71). In the Harakchiev and Tolumov case, the Court faulted the system as it was pre-2012 for its opacity, for the lack of publicly-available policy statements, for the absence of reasons on individual requests for clemency, and also for the complete lack of formal and informal safeguards (Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 262). In another case, Trabelsi v. Belgium, no. 140/10, ECHR 2014 (extracts), the Chamber based its finding of a violation of Article 3 on the absence of a sentence review mechanism operating on the basis of \u201cobjective, pre-established criteria of which the prisoner had precise cognisance at the time of imposition of the life sentence\u201d (\u00a7 137). The applicant relied on this statement in particular. The Court observes that while there is some variation in the formulations employed in these judgments, the essential point is the same in each of them, namely that there needs to be a degree of specificity or precision as to the criteria and conditions attaching to sentence review, in keeping with the general requirement of legal certainty.",

It is only the last of these that concerns progress by the prisoner. Although the procedure did not provide for the giving of reasons in individual cases, transparency was nonetheless ensured by other means. The Clemency Commission, created to advise on requests for clemency, functioned in accordance with published Rules of Procedure. These required it to take account of the relevant case-law of international courts on the interpretation and application of the relevant international human rights instruments. The rules also required the Clemency Commission to publish activity reports, which it did monthly and yearly, detailing its examination of requests for clemency, its advice to the Vice-President and the latter\u2019s decision on such requests (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-107). The Court found that these measures increased the transparency of the clemency procedure and constituted an additional guarantee of the consistent and transparent exercise of the presidential power (ibid., \u00a7 259).",

The Court refers in this respect to the \u00d6calan (no. 2) case. It found there that domestic law clearly prohibited the applicant from applying at any point in his sentence of aggravated life imprisonment for release on legitimate penological grounds. The Turkish authorities were therefore required to establish a procedure to review whether the applicant\u2019s incarceration remained justified after a minimum term of detention (\u00d6calan (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 204 and \u00a7 207). The domestic system in this case differs in that the process of review can be initiated by the prisoner at any time. The Court recalls that it took note of a similar arrangement in Cyprus, where life prisoners could benefit from the relevant provisions at any time without having to serve a minimum period of imprisonment (Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 103). It is possible to regard this as being in the interest of prisoners, since they are not required to wait for a set number of years for a first or subsequent review. In light of the very serious nature of the crimes committed by persons in this category though, it has to be expected that their period of detention will be lengthy.",

As is stated in section 30 of the 1997 Act, the Secretary of State may order release \u201cat any time\u201d. It follows, as the Government have confirmed, that it is open to the applicant to trigger, at any time, a review of his detention by the Secretary of State. It is not for the Court to speculate as to how efficiently such a system, which has minimum regulation, might generally operate in practice. It is the individual situation of the applicant that is the focus of these proceedings, and he has not suggested that he is prevented or deterred from applying to the Secretary of State at any time to be considered for release. Before concluding, though, the Court refers once again as it did in the Vinter case to the relevant comparative and international materials that show \u201cclear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism guaranteeing a review no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of a life sentence, with further periodic reviews thereafter\u201d (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0120; see more recently and in the same sense Murray, cited above, \u00a7 99).",

In this way, the domestic system, based on statute (the 1997 Act and the Human Rights Act), caselaw (of the domestic courts and this Court) and published official policy (the Lifer Manual) no longer displays the contrast that the Court identified in Vinter (cited above, \u00a7 130).

As shown in the facts in the Grand Chamber judgment, his was defined as a \u201clife case\u201d by the trial judge in 1988, and the Lord Chief Justice recommended that the applicant should never be released. In 1994 the Secretary of State informed the applicant that he had decided to impose a whole life term. In 2008 the High Court found there was no reason to depart from the Secretary of State\u2019s decision. That finding was upheld by the Court of Appeal. It was in that same year that the application was submitted to this Court. Five years later, in 2013, while the present application was still pending, the Court issued its ruling in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, ECHR 2013 (extracts)), which addressed the compatibility of the conditions of life imprisonment in the United Kingdom with Article 3 of the Convention. In that judgment, the Court, interpreting Article 3, established that the Convention does not prohibit the imposition of a life sentence; nonetheless, in order to be compatible with Article\u00a03 such a sentence must be reducible de jure et de facto, meaning that there must be both a prospect of release for the prisoner and a possibility of review (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a042). Such an interpretation was reiterated very recently in Murray v. the Netherlands ([GC], no. 10511/10, ECHR 2016). Such is therefore the consolidated (for the time being) interpretation by this Court of Article 3 of the Convention, an interpretation which is not disputed by the applicant. This interpretation is not, therefore, the object of the case, nor of the applicant\u2019s claim.",

It is plain that the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of the letter of section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances of Prison Service Order 4700 chapter 12 simply does not square with the meaning of the concept of \u201ccompassion\u201d in Western culture. Is the \u201cwide meaning\u201d of compassionate grounds so wide that it has no connection with the dictionary meaning of the word \u201ccompassion\u201d? In this respect, Lord Atkin\u2019s judgment in Liversidge v Anderson should not be forgotten:",

In the view of the Government rather, all relevant circumstances must be taken into consideration.

Likewise, Article 110 (4) of the Rome Statute provides that the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that there are factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the reduction of sentence. These factors are further elaborated in Rules 223 and 224 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence where the following examples are given: the conduct of the sentenced person while in detention, which shows a genuine dissociation from his or her crime; the prospect of the resocialisation and successful resettlement of the sentenced person; whether the early release of the sentenced person would give rise to significant social instability; any significant action taken by the sentenced person for the benefit of the victims as well as any impact on the victims and their families as a result of the early release; individual circumstances of the sentenced person, including a worsening state of physical or mental health or advanced age.",

In \u010ca\u010dko, the basis in domestic law for review is where the prisoner \u201chas demonstrated improvement by fulfilling his or her obligations and by good behaviour, and where it can be expected that the person concerned will behave in an appropriate manner in the future\u201d. In Bodein, the judgment considered that the prisoner\u2019s application for reduction or variation of sentence will be assessed in the light of the degree of danger he or she poses, his or her behaviour and the evolution in his or her personality.

In it, the majority is supposed to provide the ultimate justification for not finding a violation. The paragraph disappoints the reader.

Firstly, in Ullah Lord\u00a0Bingham was not concerned with the situation where Strasbourg had not yet pronounced. Secondly, the lack or insufficiency of Strasbourg case-law should not be used to inhibit domestic courts from giving full effect to Convention rights. Such an agnostic, passive position would defraud the obligations of the Contracting Parties as frontline administrators of the Convention.
