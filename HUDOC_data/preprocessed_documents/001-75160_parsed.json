Russia, no. 59498/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR\u00a02002III, and the cases cited therein). Furthermore, quashing such a judgment, or as in the present case, rendering it ineffective, after it has become final and unappealable will constitute an interference with the judgment beneficiary\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of that possession (see Brum\u0103rescu, cited above, \u00a7 74). Even assuming that such an interference may be regarded as serving a public interest, the Court finds that it was not justified since a fair balance was not preserved and the applicants were required to bear an individual and excessive burden (cf.\u00a0Brum\u0103rescu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 75-80).",

The principle of legal certainty requires that such a ruling has only prospective effect and, in any case, it must not affect earlier judgments and decisions in individual cases.

In the present case, the Supreme Court intervention had an impact on the final judgments in individual cases, but only that it permitted termination of the existing contracts.
