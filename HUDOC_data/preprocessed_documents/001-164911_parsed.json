In their submissions the Government did not claim that the applicant had been free to leave the police station, at least not until he had been allowed to do so. They also failed to submit any document providing a detailed account of what happened at the police station when the applicant was inside. Once it has been established that the applicant was not free to leave the station, the issue of whether he arrived there voluntarily or was taken there, which was also raised by the respondent Government, becomes immaterial (see Salayev v. Azerbaijan, no. 40900/05, \u00a7 42, 9 November 2010, and I.I. v. Bulgaria, no. 44082/98, \u00a7 86, 9 June 2005). The fact that the Russian authorities considered that the applicant had not been detained within the meaning of Russian law does not mean that he was not deprived of his liberty under the terms of the Convention (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 92, 23 February 2012). In those circumstances, the Court considers it established that there was an element of coercion which, notwithstanding the short duration of the detention, was indicative of a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, in addition to the cases cited above, M.A. v. Cyprus, no. 41872/10, \u00a7\u00a0193, ECHR 2013 (extracts); Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, \u00a7 49, 9\u00a0November 2010; and Foka v. Turkey, no. 28940/95, \u00a7\u00a7 74-79, 24 June 2008).",

Nor was it covered by subparagraph (b), since there is no evidence that the applicant failed to comply with any lawful court order or to fulfil any obligation prescribed by law.
