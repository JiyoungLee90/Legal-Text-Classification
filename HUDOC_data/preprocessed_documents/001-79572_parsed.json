This was not true, however, for a person who read the article only superficially and without the necessary concentration. Such a reader was confronted at the very beginning of the article, namely in its third paragraph, with the impugned passage suggesting that jealousy, rudeness and schadenfreude were obvious characteristics of Stefan Eberharter. The content of the offending statement could furthermore not be regarded as far-fetched, as in the milieu of skiing experts Stefan Eberharter was seen as the \u201ceternal bridesmaid\u201d in relation to Hermann Maier and known for his rather ribald expressions.

The article at issue was a satirical and farcical essay on a subject of public interest. Stefan Eberharter was mentioned as the representative of all other ski-racing competitors who had no chance against the overpowering Hermann Maier. The wish put in Eberharter's mouth, to the effect that Hermann Maier should break his other leg too so that he could at last win something, was a humorous, exaggerated and furthermore comprehensible reaction. The humorous nature of the article was already evident from its headline, strapline and first paragraphs.

The court of first instance had therefore rightfully also taken account of readers who might peruse the first paragraphs of the article without understanding its satirical meaning and then discontinue their reading of the essay because it was too demanding. The fact that the offending statement was pure fiction and that Stefan Eberharter was only mentioned as a representative for all competitors of Hermann Maier was not discernable for such a reader. Stefan Eberharter was Hermann Maier's main challenger and he was the first to benefit from Hermann Maier's accident. Besides, any reader would assume that the author of the article had used information not yet known to the public and that there was a real background even behind comic exaggeration. The reported reaction conveyed a negative image of a top athlete who was expected to win in fair competition instead of wishing his competitor serious bodily harm. Stefan Eberharter was presented as a most egocentric person who would stop at nothing and accept any harm done to his competitors. The court concluded that Stefan Eberharter's personal interests outweighed the applicants' right to freedom of artistic expression.",

The article had quoted and commented on excerpts from various Austrian newspapers. In a total of eighteen quotations it had referred to headlines and passages from various other articles reporting statements which had actually been made in connection with Hermann Maier's accident. The impugned statement, attributed to Stefan Eberharter, was the only fictitious statement amongst all those quotations. As the Austrian courts had rightly pointed out, in those circumstances only a highly concentrated reader could have been expected to realise that this passage was pure fiction with comic exaggeration. The offending statement conveyed a negative image of Mr Eberharter's person in a striking and blatant manner. Even considering the satirical nature of this statement, the limits to the guarantees under Article 10 of the Convention had clearly been transgressed as there was no factual basis for the reproach of envy and inappropriate glee. The Government also referred in this regard to the judgment in Lopes Gomes da Silva v. Portugal (no. 37698/97, ECHR 2000X) and the decision in \u00d6sterreichische Schutzgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Nichtraucher and Rockenbauer v.

The article, as was already evident from its headings and the caption next to Mr Maier's photograph, was written in an ironic and satirical style and meant as a humorous commentary. Nevertheless, it sought to make a critical contribution to an issue of general interest, namely society's attitude towards a sports star. The Court is not convinced by the reasoning of the domestic courts and the Government that the average reader would be unable to grasp the text's satirical character and, in particular, the humorous element of the impugned passage about what Mr\u00a0Eberharter could have said but did not actually say. This passage could at most be understood as the author's value judgment on Mr\u00a0Eberharter's character, expressed in the form of a joke.",

The Court acknowledges that such feelings, if actually expressed, would seriously affect and damage any sportsman's good image. However, the Court does not find that the same can be said about this humorous passage, which clearly mentions that Mr Eberharter made no such statement. The Court also notes in this regard that Mr Eberharter had already previously commented on Mr Maier's accident in public, obviously using different words. In sum, the Court considers that the impugned passage about Mr\u00a0Eberharter remains within the limits of acceptable satirical comment in a democratic society.",

The Court further considers that there is also a direct link between the applicant company's claim for the loss of advertising revenue caused by the publication of the judgment in its magazine and the violation found (compare Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v. , no.\u00a039394/98, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2003-XI). The Court agrees with the applicants that the loss of advertising revenue should be calculated on the basis of the normal advertisement rate for similar publication. The advertisement rate for an equal-sized insert in the applicant company's magazine amounted at the material time to EUR 3,400 to which a surcharge of 15% was to be added for special placement. In the present case, the relevant provisions of the Media Act obliged the applicant company to publish the judgment in a section that was the same as, or similar to, that in which the impugned original article had appeared. The Court accordingly awards the applicants EUR 3,910 for the loss of advertising revenue. In sum, the Court awards a total of EUR 7,058.13 in respect of pecuniary damage. This amount includes VAT.",
