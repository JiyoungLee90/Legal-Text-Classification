They did not determine, either finally or provisionally, the applicants' civil rights and obligations (see Fedotova v. Russia (dec.), no. 73225/01, 1 April 2004). The Court therefore concludes that the applicants' complaint about the procedural decision of 4 December 2000 as such is outside the scope of Article 6 of the Convention (see, e.g., Verlagsgruppe News GmbH v. Austria (dec.), no. 62763/00, 16 January 2003; Wiot v. France (dec.), no.\u00a043722/98, 15 March 2001; Apis a.s. v. Slovakia (dec.), no.\u00a039754/98, 13\u00a0January 2000).",
