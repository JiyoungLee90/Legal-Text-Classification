The subsequent decisions to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial underlined the fact that these fears were well-founded, since the applicant had attempted to exert pressure upon the accused (see paragraphs 11 and 13\u00a0above). The Court also observes that the risk of absconding in the applicant\u2019s case was particularly high, since he had no permanent address in Poland and his residence was in the .
