It is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how the injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 87, and Pruneanu v.

In its own case-law the Court has also emphasised the importance of such an initial medical examination. Where no such examination has been carried out or where the examination has not recorded any injuries, the Court has drawn the conclusion that the person entered detention in good health (see, mutatis mutandis, Levin\u0163a v.

The Court notes that the medical board, having made its examination more than a year after the relevant events, did not observe the applicant\u2019s injury itself, but relied on his medical documents. Moreover, it concluded that the injury had been sustained prior to 6 February 2007 even though the only doctor who had actually seen the wound had been unable to draw such a conclusion.

The kind of investigation that will achieve those purposes may vary according to the circumstances. However, whatever the method of investigation, the authorities must act as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. Even when strictly speaking no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that torture or illtreatment has been used (see, among other authorities, \u00d6zbey v. Turkey (dec.), no. 31883/96, 8 March 2001[...]). Moreover, a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. A prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, among other authorities, Indelicato v.\u00a0Italy, no. 31143/96, \u00a7 37, 18 October 2001, and \u00d6zg\u00fcr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v.

It follows that a doctor and an investigator were aware, or should have been aware on 21 February 2007, that the applicant had sustained an injury, possibly while being detained. This should have prompted the authorities to carry out an investigation of the applicant\u2019s possible ill-treatment, even in the absence of a complaint and despite his statement that O. had beaten him.
