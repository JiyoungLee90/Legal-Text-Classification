Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Tan\u0131\u015f and Others v.

She submitted that her son had been abducted and killed by State agents. In her opinion, at the time of his death he had been in the State\u2019s custody and it had been impossible for him to offer active armed resistance to the federal forces. Furthermore, the fact that only one bullet shell had been found at the crime scene refuted the Government\u2019s allegation of an exchange of gunfire between her son and the State agents. Nor did the photographs of Batyr Albakov\u2019s body taken by her family confirm the Government\u2019s allegations as regards the injuries sustained by her son or the time of his death. The applicant also rejected the Government\u2019s argument that the use of force against her son had been lawful. She noted that they had not put forward any argument capable of justifying the use of lethal force against the deceased. Lastly, she argued that the domestic authorities had failed to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances of her son\u2019s death. In particular, she pointed out the following deficiencies and omissions on the part of the authorities: the investigation into her son\u2019s abduction had been delayed; the investigator had failed to take any measures in order to establish Batyr Albakov\u2019s whereabouts, to identify the alleged perpetrators or the vehicles used by them; and the authorities had done nothing to establish whether the use of lethal force employed by law-enforcement agents against the deceased had been justified or to question the witnesses to the shooting. The applicant had not been afforded any procedural status and had been excluded from the investigation. As a result, she had been unable to obtain access to certain materials until after her present application had been communicated to the Government for observations.",

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c).
