Regarding the second period in question, the court acknowledged that the practice of considering pre-trial detention as a measure sine die upon the indictment of a detainee had been changed by the 1996 Supreme Court\u2019s Resolution. However, the decision to extend the applicant\u2019s detention on 19 May 1997 was considered justified since the court had applied the literal meaning of the relevant procedural provisions.

The monitoring of a prisoner\u2019s behaviour as in the present case, although certainly intrusive, is not per se incompatible with Article 3. This measure serves the purposes of both ensuring prison security and protecting the prisoner from the risk of pressure or even physical attack from the criminal community which, in the context of organised crime, cannot generally be excluded. As to the latter, the Court notes that in January 2004 the applicant informed the authorities that he had feared for his life because a certain convicted criminal who had been a prosecution witness during the applicant\u2019s trial, had been committed to Radom Remand Centre at the same time as the applicant (see paragraph 138 above).",
