It is also noted in this regard that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 118, and the authorities cited therein).",

Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair.\u201d",

The Court, like the appeals court, considers the other pieces of evidence on which the trial court relied to be irrelevant for the determination of the criminal charges against the present applicants. Indeed, the person recognised by L.M. as one of the perpetrators was R.K., who is not the applicant in the present case (see paragraph 27 above). The witnesses J.M. and \u0160.K. only stated that they had seen four or five Roma men leaving a car abandoned in the vicinity of the crime scene, without providing any details (see paragraph 36 above).

He was 50-60% certain that the second applicant had been one of them. Secondly, whilst he said that the two men had spoken Serbian without accent, it would appear from the case file that the second applicant was not fluent in Serbian (he made his statement to the investigating judge in Hungarian \u2013 see paragraph 19 above). At the trial, the defence applied to have two social workers examined so as to prove that fact, but the trial court dismissed that application. Thirdly, a police report of 14 March 2008 stated that one of the persons seen by U.\u0110. earlier that day had been probably the first applicant and not the second applicant (according to that report, the other person had probably been the third applicant). Lastly, even assuming that the second applicant had indeed been on that bus, plotting to steal a violin from the home of a musician on the night of 14 to 15 March 2008, it is not clear how this would prove that he stole a tamburitza and a number of other items from the home of L.M., who was not a musician, about two weeks later. As to the DNA evidence belonging to the third applicant found in a car 5 km from L.M.\u2019s home, the Court agrees that this is weighty evidence against the third applicant in view of the fact that a number of items stolen from L.M. had also been found not far from that car.",

That is, the applicant must have paid them, or be bound to pay them, pursuant to a legal or contractual obligation, and they must have been unavoidable in order to prevent the violation found or to obtain redress. The Court requires itemised bills and invoices that are sufficiently detailed to enable it to determine to what extent the above requirements have been met. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 8,100 covering costs under all heads.",
