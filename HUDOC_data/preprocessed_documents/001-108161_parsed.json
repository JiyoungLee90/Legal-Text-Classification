In such cases the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether national law has been observed (Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2000-III). Moreover, any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article\u00a05, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 118, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V).",

The Court would also note that, notwithstanding this change, the authorities had at their disposal the power to issue an arrest warrant so as to consider properly the necessity of pre-trial detention and the personal circumstances of the accused (including those underlying her having missed the previous hearings), once the latter is apprehended and a hearing can be put in place.",
