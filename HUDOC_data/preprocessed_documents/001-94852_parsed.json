Further, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances. It may not, however, be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 (see, mutatis mutandis, Pecevi v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 21839/03, \u00a7 29, 6\u00a0November 2008). The State's responsibility for enforcement of a private judgment extends no further than the involvement of State bodies, including the domestic courts, in the enforcement proceedings. However, the States are under an obligation to ensure that the procedures enshrined in the legislation for the enforcement of final judgments are complied with (see Fuklev v. Ukraine, no.71186/01, \u00a7\u00a7 67 and 91, 7 June 2005).",
