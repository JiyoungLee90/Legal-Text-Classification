Most of the delays in the proceedings were caused by the bad state of health of the plaintiff's advocates. The latter's requests for adjournment of the hearing were granted with the consent of the applicant's lawyer. A delay of four months during the period from 25 February 1999 to 1 July 1999 could have been avoided had the applicant's lawyer informed the President of the District Court earlier of the problem raised by the delay in the examination of the interim order. On 1 July 1999, it was impossible to fix a hearing before September 1999 due to the summer recess. From 1 July 1999 to 17\u00a0March 2000, when the case was taken over by another judge, adjournments were not very long and were mostly due to the state of health of the plaintiff's advocate. On three occasions, the adjournments were justified by the need to summon a witness (an eight-day adjournment), the need to prepare a written account of facts disclosed by the exhibits submitted during the proceedings (a one-month adjournment) and the need to afford time to the newly appointed lawyer for the plaintiff to familiarise himself with the case (a one-month adjournment).",
