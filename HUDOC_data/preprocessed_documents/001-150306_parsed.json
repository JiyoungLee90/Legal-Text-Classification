The Supreme Court referred to Article 85 \u00a7 2 of the Penal Code, and stated that if property was confiscated from a person who had not been involved in the proceedings and who was allegedly the owner of the property but not the object of the decision to confiscate, the person did not lose ownership when the decision to confiscate entered into force, as in such a case ownership does not transfer to the State. Confiscation meant that property or other rights were transferred from one person (the object of the decision to confiscate) to another person (the State); it did not mean that the property was transferred to the State regardless of who had been its owner. The Supreme Court also noted that the object of a decision to confiscate had to be unequivocally clear in the operative part of the court ruling.",

The prosecutor\u2019s office, in its reply to the appeal against the decision of 24 March 2009, had also referred to that possibility, and this was confirmed by pertinent case-law under which the rights of third parties remained in force even after wrongful confiscation of property, and in such a case a person could reclaim the property from the State or obtain compensation.

However, the applicant had not brought an action with a civil court or a complaint under Article 85 \u00a7 2 of the Penal Code.

The applicant also noted that while in the decision in question it had been stated that R. could not have acquired the property, the decision had been made by the police and not by a competent court. Nor was the order sufficiently reasoned; it was only concluded on the basis of R.\u2019s just one year\u2019s income that he did not have the means to acquire the property. The applicant also contended that when interviewed by the police on 10 October 2001 she had affirmed that the items in question had belonged to her husband R.

She contended that as long as it had not been proved that the property had been acquired through crime, she had had no obligation to prove its legal origin. This position had been advanced in the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision: her counsel had argued that the decision lacked reasoning as to why the seized property had been acquired through crime, and why in the opinion of the court the identity of its owner remained unknown. Presentation of proof concerning the legal ownership might have been relevant in compensation proceedings; however, in confiscation proceedings it had been for the authorities to prove that the property had not been acquired legally or that it had not been owned by the applicant\u2019s late husband.

R. cannot be said to have been proved guilty according to law by this decision taken by the police. Thus, it is questionable what purpose it would have served for the applicant, R.\u2019s widow, to challenge this decision. As concerns the property at issue, it was ruled in the decision that the property was to be placed in a police storage facility (see paragraph 15 above); in another decision taken by the police on the same day the property in question was declared as evidence in the criminal case and it was repeated that it was to be stored in a police storage facility (see paragraph 16 above). It is true that it was also mentioned in the first of the decisions referred to that the identity of its lawful owner had not been established and it was unclear to whom it belonged. Nevertheless, the Court is not persuaded that it was incumbent upon the applicant in this phase of the criminal proceedings to challenge the decision of the police whereby the destiny of the property in question was not determined. The Court has taken note, in this connection, of the Government\u2019s reference to the Silickien\u0117 judgment, in which the Court considered the possibility of judicial review of a seizure order as a procedural safeguard for the applicant (see Silickien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 48). However, the Court notes that in Silickien\u0117 this question was dealt with in the context of examination of the merits of the case, the Lithuanian Government\u2019s similar plea of non-exhaustion having been dismissed, because the seizure ordered by the investigator was provisional (see Silickis and Silickien\u0117 v. Lithuania (dec.), no. 20496/02, 10 November 2009). The Court also notes in this connection that the applicant made two enquiries to the police about the seized property and she received the reply from the police on 28 May 2001 that the return of the seized items would be decided by the officer in charge after clarification of their origin, and on 15\u00a0April 2004 that it was for the judge examining the matter to rule on the measures to be taken in respect of the evidence. The Court also notes that the decision to confiscate the property in question was taken several years later, on 24 March 2009, by the Viru County Court. Thus, the Court is not convinced that the decision of the police of 9 April 2001 had any decisive meaning for the determination of the destiny of the property, and it considers that the applicant cannot be reproached for not challenging it.",

She also complained that she had not been heard in court, and asked that the case be remitted to the first-instance court. The Court considers that it was sufficient for the applicant to raise these issues and she did not need to prove that the property was obtained legally. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in its decision of 25 May 2009 did not dismiss the applicant\u2019s appeal because of lack of evidence supporting her claims, but rather considered it as having been established that the property had been obtained through crime. Thus, the Court of Appeal decision appears to support the applicant\u2019s argument about the distribution of the burden of proof \u2013 which rested on the authorities \u2013 and this part of the Government\u2019s objection has to be dismissed.",

Hungary, no. 39311/05, \u00a7 14, 28 April 2009). The Government has not demonstrated that the remedy pursued by the applicant in the present case was ineffective or insufficient, or that the remedies advanced by the Government were clearly more appropriate for the applicant\u2019s grievance. The Court has taken note, in this connection, of the Government\u2019s reference to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 30 April 2013 (see paragraphs 45 and 46 above) and their argument that the applicant, not being a party to the proceedings, should have sought compensation under Article 85 \u00a7 2 of the Penal Code in administrative court proceedings. However, it would firstly appear that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision drew a distinction between situations on the one hand, where a person was involved in criminal proceedings and could defend his rights in these proceedings, and on the other, where he was not involved in the criminal proceedings and could not defend his rights in these proceedings. As the applicant in the present case did appeal against the County Court\u2019s decision concerning the confiscation of the property in question and the Court of Appeal examined her appeal on the merits, the applicant\u2019s position substantially appears to resemble that of a third person involved in the proceedings, even if she was not officially granted that status. Secondly, the Court notes that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in question dealt with the pertinent regulation in the Penal Code and the new Code of Criminal Procedure that entered into force on 1 July 2004, whereas the courts in the present case relied mainly on the provisions of the old Code of Criminal Procedure that was in force until 30 June 2004. The Court therefore considers that the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent interpretation of a later legal regulation could not be of decisive importance for the interpretation of the legislation that was applied by the courts in the applicant\u2019s case. Therefore, this objection must be dismissed.",

Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, \u00a7 49, 20 October 2011, and Neulinger and Shuruk v.

The Court has found in a recent case concerning Estonia that it was sufficient for an applicant to raise a Convention issue in substance before the domestic courts, who were empowered to set aside unconstitutional legal provisions of their own motion if they found that the Code of Criminal Procedure could not be interpreted as permitting the granting of the applicant\u2019s request (see Ovsjannikov v. Estonia, no. 1346/12, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62, 20 February 2014). The Court considers that this finding is also pertinent to the present case. Having regard to the fact that the applicant in her appeal to the Court of Appeal raised the issues of an allegedly unjustified confiscation of the property she was entitled to, lack of reasoning in the County Court\u2019s decision as well as the County Court\u2019s dealing with the matter in written proceedings without inviting her to take part in the proceedings or hearing her, the Court considers that the Government\u2019s plea of non-exhaustion must be dismissed.",

An appeal by the applicant against this decision was dismissed by the Tartu Court of Appeal on 25 May 2009.

There may be proceedings in which an oral hearing may not be required, for example where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate a hearing, and the courts may fairly and reasonably decide the case on the basis of the parties\u2019 submissions and other written materials. The Court has clarified that the nature of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court. The overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article 6 is the key consideration (see Jussila v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42, ECHR 2006XIV, with further references).",

In particular, the Court of Appeal referred to the suspicions against R., including under Article 152-3 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Criminal Code (Violation of the rules for purchase, export, re-export or trading of metals). It was noted that according to the police decision of 9 April 2001 concerning the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings in respect of R., the precious metals and substances containing precious metals had been obtained through crime, and their legal owner had not been identified. The Court of Appeal also referred to the confiscation request of 25 July 2002 by the police to the court, in which evidence had been set out demonstrating that the property had been obtained through crime; according to the Court of Appeal this evidence had included witness statements by K. and the applicant. The Court of Appeal noted that the applicant had been interviewed as a witness in the criminal proceedings and she had stated that she did not know the origin of the items and that they had been obtained by R. The Court of Appeal further noted that the applicant had not claimed title to the property or claimed that it had been her and her husband\u2019s joint property. On that basis, the Court of Appeal concluded that the property had been obtained through crime and had been lawfully confiscated.",

The Court notes that the Court of Appeal merely referred to the documents drawn up by the police, without making any attempt to assess the suspicions raised or conclusions drawn in these documents. As concerns the witness statements, K.\u2019s statements were merely referred to, with no mention of their content. The applicant\u2019s statements were summarised briefly, and from this concluded that the property had been obtained through crime or that its legal owner could not be identified. The Court observes, however, that according to the applicant\u2019s statements this property was obtained by her husband, who had placed his money in precious metals (see paragraph 23 above). In these circumstances, the Court is unable to conclude that the lack of reasoning in the first-instance court\u2019s decision was remedied by the Court of Appeal.",

In the interests of crime prevention, States had a wide margin of appreciation in dealing with property obtained by unlawful means or used for unlawful purposes.

Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 30, Series A no.\u00a0281A). Confiscation in this context is therefore in keeping with the goals of the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, which requires State Parties to introduce confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime in respect of serious offences. Thus, a confiscation order in respect of criminally acquired property operates in the general interest as a deterrent to those considering engaging in criminal activities, and also guarantees that crime does not pay (see Denisova and Moiseyeva v. Russia, no. 16903/03, \u00a7\u00a058, 1 April 2010, with further references to Phillips v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a041087/98, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2001VII, and Dassa Foundation and Others v.\u00a0Liechtenstein (dec.), no. 696/05, 10 July 2007).",

Having regard also to the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the Court notes that in the present case neither R. nor any other accused in the criminal proceedings were convicted of any offence. While in respect of the attempted smuggling of prohibited goods M. and J. were prosecuted, although the criminal proceedings were later discontinued due to lack of public interest, the Court notes that this episode concerned waste containing precious metals, and had no direct link to other items and substances also seized from R., such as gold, silver and diamonds. Although it can be understood that R. was also suspected of a crime related to these items and substances under Article 152-3 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 14 above), there is no information in the case file allowing the Court to conclude that any substantial investigation or judicial determination in this respect \u2013 that is, in respect of the suspected offence of purchase of items made of precious metals from the population \u2013 was carried out. Indeed, the suspicion in question appears to have been based merely on the fact that the items and substances in question were found at R.\u2019s home and workplace. Thus, as the commission of any crimes was not established by the domestic authorities, the Court is unable to see how the property could be confiscated as obtained through crime under Article 63 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Court also notes in this connection that it has not been shown that possession of such items and substances was unlawful in itself.",

In this connection, the Court firstly notes that Article 63 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on which the confiscation decision was based, concerned property received as a result of a criminal offence and not property acquired as proceeds of crime. Moreover, it has not been demonstrated, as regards either of these grounds, that domestic law provided for confiscation of the property of a suspect who died during the criminal proceedings and in whose respect the proceedings were discontinued for that reason without him having been convicted. Secondly, and in any event, the domestic authorities appear to have carried out no assessment as to the sums R. might have obtained through crime and invested in precious metals. In these circumstances, the Court is bound to conclude that the confiscation of the gold and silver items and diamonds was an arbitrary measure, its scope being determined by the somewhat incidental seizure of evidence at the outset of the proceedings. The Court notes that no individual assessment of which pieces of property to confiscate appears to have been carried out (see, by contrast, Silickien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 68; see also Phillips, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053, where the Court was satisfied that the procedure followed in the making of the confiscation order had been fair and respected the rights of the defence). The Court reiterates in this connection that the original County Court confiscation order did not contain a list of the items to be confiscated. Although this deficiency was remedied by the same court, the fact remains that the first-instance court gave no reasons for the confiscation. The Court of Appeal referred to the material in the case file, but provided no analysis of evidence for its own part. These deficiencies, coupled with the procedural shortcomings already dealt with under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see paragraphs 80 to 86 above) are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the fair balance which should be struck between the protection of the right of property and the requirements of general interest was upset in the present case.",

The Court further notes that according to an intestate succession certificate the applicant inherited one third of R.\u2019s property (see paragraph 20 above).
