Consequently, the number of lay assessors assigned to sit with a professional judge should not be less than six.

The Court observes that thereafter the President of the District Court had to select from the general list of lay assessors 156 names for each judge (see paragraph 23 above). However, as it follows from the decision of 6 March 2001, the acting President of the Nagatinskiy District Court of Moscow selected only two lay assessors to sit with judge F. with the consequence that on 1 July 2002 the judge F. instead of drawing lots among 156 lay assessors in order to select two of them for sitting on the bench for the hearing of the applicant\u2019s case \u201cdrew lots\u201d among only two of them.
