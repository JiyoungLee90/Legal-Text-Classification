The merchant ship suddenly changed course, in an attempt to evade the frigate. When attempts were made to contact it on the international radio frequency, it remained silent. At the same time, the crew jettisoned packages over the stern into the sea. The frigate then identified itself and asked the Winner to stop, while signalling the international code SQ (\u201cstop or I shall open fire\u201d)\u00a0; no answer came and the ship was still not flying a flag, so a warning shot was fired, followed by further shots to stop it. At the same time the speedboat was ordered to recover the parcels that had been jettisoned. It only managed to recover one.

It considered that although Cambodia had not signed the Vienna Convention, Article 17.3 of which provided for derogations from the traditional principle of the \u201claw of the flag State\u201d, that did not prevent the French authorities from \u201crequesting Cambodia's cooperation to obtain authorisation to intercept the Winner in order to put a stop to the drug trafficking in which all or part of its crew were suspected of engaging\u201d, based on Article 108 of the Montego Bay Convention and \u201cwith reference\u201d to the Convention of 30 March 1961. According to the Investigation Division, as the provisions of the Vienna Convention did not apply to , it was for that State's authorities to ask the French authorities for the information they needed in order to determine, as they alone were entitled to do, whether the request for assistance was well founded. The court then held that the diplomatic telegram of 7 June 2002 from the French Embassy established the existence of \u201can agreement given without restrictions or reservations by the Government of Cambodia for the planned interception and all its consequences, and was authoritative until proven otherwise\u201d.",

Nor, it pointed out, had the French authorities failed in that obligation in the circumstances. In the light of the reports drawn up by the commander of the Lieutenant de Vaisseau Le Henaff, the Investigation Division found that when the frigate had drawn within sight of the Winner the latter \u201cwas flying no flag\u201d and its captain had \u201cnot only failed to answer the requests to identify the ship, in breach of the rules of international law, and failed to stop the ship, but [had] responded aggressively with a series of dangerous manoeuvres that jeopardised the safety of the French frigate and the lives of the sailors on the speedboat\u201d, and the crew of the Winner had thrown parcels containing large quantities of cocaine into the sea. There had therefore been \u201creasonable grounds\u201d, in the Investigation Division's view, to suspect the Winner of drug trafficking, so that \u201cin using force to stop the Winner and taking appropriate measures to control and restrain the crew, who were confined to their quarters, and to take over and steer the ship\u201d, the commander of the frigate had \u201cstrictly observed\u201d the provisions of Article 17.4 of the Vienna Convention (under which he is authorised, when a ship is boarded and searched, \u201cIf evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found, [to] take appropriate action with respect to the vessel, persons and cargo on board\u201d) and the provisions of the Law of 15 July 1994 as amended, regulating the use of coercion measures, including, if necessary, the use of force in the event of refusal by a ship to submit to inspection (Articles 1 to 10), and providing for the implementation of the inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law in the particular case of drug trafficking (Articles 12 to 14).",

Although it accepted that the exact nature of that action was not specified, the Investigation Division considered that the text concerned provided \u201cat least for the competent naval authorities to limit, if necessary, the freedom of the boarded ship's crew to come and go; otherwise the provision would be meaningless and the safety of the men taking over control of the ship would be seriously jeopardised\u201d. In respect of this last point, it considered that \u201cit cannot be ruled out in the course of such operations against international drug traffickers on the high seas that the crew might have weapons hidden away and might seek to regain control of the ship by force\u201d. It concluded that \u201cthe fact that the Winner's crew were confined to their quarters (...) under military guard so that the ship could be safely taken over and rerouted fell within the appropriate action provided for in Article 17.4 c) of the Vienna Convention\u201d.",

Accordingly, the restrictions placed on the movements of a boarded ship's crew, as authorised in such cases by the United Nations Convention signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988, were not at variance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and did not amount to unlawful detention. It also noted that in this particular case, as soon as the Winner had docked, its crew had been handed over to the police, immediately informed of their rights and placed in custody, then brought before the investigating judge.",

Secondly, the Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 30 March 1961, which had been ratified by France and signed by Cambodia, under Article 35 of which the Parties agreed to assist each other in the campaign against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs. And thirdly, the Vienna Convention of 20\u00a0December\u00a01988 against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (not ratified by ), which organised and improved the cooperation provided for in the Montego Bay Convention. In particular the Vienna Convention provided explicitly, when there were \u201creasonable grounds to suspect illicit traffic\u201d, for a Party to request permission to board a foreign ship from the authorities of the ship's flag State and, if permission was granted, to search the ship and, if evidence of an offence was found, to \u201ctake appropriate action with respect to the vessel, persons and cargo on board\u201d.",

It was true that, unlike the position in the Rigopoulos case, it had not been possible to apply to the liberties and detention judge to authorise the applicants' placement in custody, as that could only have been done after an investigation had been opened, which was only possible after the judge had heard the interested parties. However, the Government submitted that under the French law applicable to interception at sea, firstly the deprivation of liberty concerned had taken place under the supervision of a \u201ccompetent legal authority\u201d, the public prosecutor, and secondly, the applicants had had the benefit of the guarantees specific to that particular procedure. On this last point the Government mentioned that, under the procedure concerned, no questioning of suspects was possible \u2013 \u201cin order to guarantee the hearings that would be held subsequently, in a judicial context\u201d \u2013, body searches were not permitted, the public prosecutor was informed in advance of the operations envisaged for the purpose of detecting and establishing the offence, and the parties concerned received copies of the reports of those operations.

In any event it must afford adequate legal protection and the legal certainty necessary to prevent arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention (see Amuur v.

In the Division's opinion the action taken by the French authorities was justifiable under Article 108 of the Montego Bay Convention, which calls for States to \u201ccooperate in the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances engaged in by ships on the high seas contrary to international conventions\u201d and stipulates that \u201cAny State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in [such traffic] may request the cooperation of other States to suppress [it]\u201d, and\u00a0\u201cwith reference\u201d to the Single Convention on Narcotics of 30 March 1961 (Article 35 of which lays down the principle of mutual assistance between the Parties in the campaign against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs).

The Court also notes, like the applicants,\u00a0that the Government's submissions concerning the applicability of, and compliance with, the said legislative provisions are based on a contradiction. The Government submitted that at the time of the interception the Winner had not been flying a flag, while at the same time asserting that the French authorities had sought confirmation from the Cambodian authorities that the ship was registered in Cambodia, and the judgment of the Investigation Division showed that the ship had been identified as the Winner before the operations commenced.",

The fact remains that the detention imposed on the applicants on board the Winner was not under the supervision of a \u201ccompetent legal authority\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 (the public prosecutor did not qualify as such; see paragraph 61 above), while Mr Rigopoulos had been detained \u201con the orders and under the strict supervision\u201d of the Madrid Central Investigating Court; unlike him, the applicants in the instant case did not enjoy the protection against arbitrariness that such supervision affords. However, that consideration, which the Court duly examined with reference to paragraph 1 of Article 5, does not change the fact that the duration of the applicants' detention was justified by the \u201cwholly exceptional circumstances\u201d described above, and in particular the time it inevitably took the Winner to reach .",
