The authority of the judiciary would have been better served if proceedings had been transparent and the general public had been able to form an opinion on them. Furthermore, the scope of the interlocutory injunction had been greater than that of the defamation claim. Judge Baskova had only challenged the statement that she had used her office to her advantage, the remainder of the publication had not been contested. However, the injunction had prohibited any mention of the traffic accident or of the proceedings in which Judge Baskova had been involved.

The domestic courts had determined that the reputation of Judge Baskova required heightened protection and thus the interference had pursued a \u201cpressing social need\u201d. The interim measure had been proportionate to the legitimate aim as it had been strictly limited in its scope and time. Having regard to the accusatory nature of the allegation contained in the publication, a failure to indicate interim measures could have led to further publications and greater damage to Judge Baskova\u2019s reputation. Accordingly, the application of such interim measures had been of greater public importance than affording the applicant the possibility of \u201cendless stirring-up of doubts about circumstances which were simultaneously being examined in judicial proceedings\u201d. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s claim, the injunction had not affected the publicity of civil proceedings because they had been open to anyone wishing to attend them and also because the applicant had had a vested interest in their outcome. Furthermore, the Government referred to the Court\u2019s finding to the effect that \u201cthe limits of permissible comment on pending ... proceedings may not extend to statements which are likely to prejudice, whether intentionally or not, the chances of a person receiving a fair trial or to undermine the confidence of the public in the role of the courts in the administration of justice\u201d (see News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG\u00a0v. , no.\u00a031457/96, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2000I). In the present case the Government considered that the purpose of the injunction had been the prevention of damage to Judge Baskova\u2019s right to a fair trial and to her authority as a judge. The applicant could have unreasonably undermined the judge\u2019s authority through her continued reporting on a dispute to which she had been a party and which was being considered by courts. If she had had doubts about the conduct of the judge, she could have applied to the judges\u2019 qualification panel with a complaint.",

It prohibited the editor\u2019s office from publishing any materials by any person, including the applicant, in so far as they concerned the road accident and the claim for damages (see paragraph 12 above).

The Court, for its part, is prepared to accept that the injunction envisaged \u201cmaintaining the authority of the judiciary\u201d as one of its legitimate aims, since this phrase includes the protection of the rights of litigants and since the purpose of the injunction was to enable the defamation action to be heard without the plaintiff\u2019s rights in the meantime being prejudiced by the commission of the very act which it was the purpose of the action to prevent (compare Observer and Guardian, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056).

Not one of these versions was contested as untrue or inaccurate in the defamation proceedings, the scope of which was limited to the statement about Judge Baskova\u2019s connections in the judiciary (see paragraph 9 above). In issuing the injunction in the defamation proceedings, the District Court merely referred to the fact that a technical study had been commissioned, without explaining why it considered that further research into, or publications on, the factual circumstances of the road accident would be prejudicial for the outcome of the proceedings. Moreover, since Mrs Baskova was involved in the accident as a private person, the Court finds that the injunction on further publications about the accident could not have been relevant for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the judiciary.",

Nevertheless, although the injunction corresponded to the legitimate aim it sought to achieve, in the Court\u2019s view, its scope was excessively broad and disproportionate to that aim. It must be noted that the Russian legal system has no equivalent of the sub judice rule and the right to report on proceedings in open court is not in principle restricted. The Government\u2019s argument that, the injunction notwithstanding, the proceedings on the claim for damages had retained their public character is irrelevant because the applicant alleged a violation of the right to impart information rather than a violation of the right to a public hearing. The Court reiterates in this connection that the duty of the press to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest extends to the reporting and commenting on court proceedings which contribute to their publicity and are thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that hearings be public (see News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG, cited above, \u00a7 56). It is relevant for the Court\u2019s assessment that the scope of the injunction was not limited to the specific statement about Judge Baskova\u2019s attempt to secure undue advantage in the proceedings, but rather restricted, in a general and unqualified manner, the possibility of printing any material whatsoever relating to these proceedings. The Court is unable to accept that such a sweeping prohibition was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. It agrees with the applicant that the injunction at issue was a disservice to the authority of the judiciary because it reduced transparency of the proceedings and may have given rise to doubts about the court\u2019s impartiality, for \u201cjustice must not only be done; it must also be seen to be done\u201d (see De Cubber v. Belgium, judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series A no. 86, p. 14, \u00a7 26). It is also a matter of particular concern for the Court that the injunction listed as one of its purposes the necessity to prevent the newspaper from publishing materials \u201cstating the opposite view\u201d. It reiterates that the possibility of expressing different views is the very essence of pluralism, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d.",
