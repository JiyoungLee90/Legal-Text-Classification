The Court considers that that argument amounts to saying that until the new legislation came into force the applicant had absolutely no prospect of obtaining a fresh judicial decision on whether he should be granted access to his daughter. Under the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s settled case-law (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d above), even if the Federal Constitutional Court had issued a decision in favour of the applicant \u2013 that is to say quashed the decisions of the civil courts that had heard the case \u2013 the civil courts would have been obliged to stay the proceedings until the new legislation came into force.",

Germany, judgment of 16\u00a0September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1170, \u00a7 37, and Tri\u010dkovi\u0107 v. Slovenia, no. 39914/98, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 54, 12 June 2001). It observes that it has repeatedly held that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time. Although this obligation cannot be construed in the same way for a constitutional court as for an ordinary court, it is for the European Court in the last instance to verify that it has been complied with, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case and the criteria laid down in its case-law (see Pammel v. Germany, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1111, \u00a7\u00a068, and Probstmeier v. Germany, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1137, \u00a7 63). ",

It reiterates, however, that it is important for the Convention to be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective, as opposed to theoretical and illusory (see, mutatis mutandis, Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13\u00a0May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15-16, \u00a7 33, and Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2002-IV). As regards complaints concerning the length of proceedings, it also notes that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires that cases be heard within a reasonable time; in so providing, the Convention underlines the importance of rendering justice without delays which might jeopardise its effectiveness and credibility (see, mutatis mutandis, H. v. France, judgment of 24 October 1989, Series A no. 162-A, pp. 22-23, \u00a7 58, and Moreira de Azevedo v. Portugal, judgment of 23\u00a0October 1990, Series A no. 189, p. 19, \u00a7 74).",
