In this regard, the Court notes that the nature of the alleged violation in the present case is such that it would not be possible to eliminate the effects of the infringement of the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing without reopening the domestic proceedings. Moreover, the Court observes that the domestic law allows the reopening of proceedings in the event of a finding of a violation of the Convention by the Court. However, it appears that there is no provision allowing for the reopening of domestic proceedings on account of a decision by the Court to strike a case out of the list (see paragraph 18 above).",

Russia, no.\u00a072701/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a019 et seq., 15\u00a0March 2005; Groshev v. Russia, no.\u00a069889/01, \u00a7\u00a7 27 et seq., 20\u00a0October 2005; and Mokrushina v. Russia, no. 23377/02, 5 October 2006). It also found a violation of Article 6 in a number of cases where Russian courts refused leave to appear to imprisoned applicants who had wished to make oral submissions on their civil claims. For instance, in the case of Kovalev v. Russia (no.\u00a078145/01, \u00a7\u00a037, 10\u00a0May 2007), despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim of ill-treatment by the police had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been \u201can important part of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings\u201d. In the case of Khuzhin and Others v. Russia (no. 13470/02, \u00a7\u00a7 53 et seq., 23\u00a0October 2008) the Court found that, by refusing to ensure that the imprisoned applicants could attend hearings, and by failing to consider other legal means of ensuring their effective participation in the defamation proceedings, the Russian courts had violated the principle of equality of arms. A similar conclusion was reached by the Court in other cases against Russia where authorities had failed to secure the imprisoned applicants\u2019 appearance before civil courts examining their complaints about the conditions of their detention (see, for instance, Shilbergs v. Russia, no.\u00a020075/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0107-113, 17 December 2009; Artyomov v. Russia, no.\u00a014146/02, \u00a7\u00a7 204-208, 27\u00a0May 2010; and Roman Karasev v. Russia, no.\u00a030251/03, \u00a7\u00a7 65-70, 25\u00a0November 2010). In the cases cited above the Court consistently held that, given the nature of the applicants\u2019 claims which were, to a significant extent, based on their personal experience, the effective, proper and satisfactory presentation of the case could have only been secured by the applicants\u2019 personal participation in hearings. The applicants\u2019 testimony describing the conditions of detention of which only they themselves had first-hand knowledge would have constituted an indispensable part of the plaintiffs\u2019 presentation of the case.",
