As a result, although there is no final conviction in respect of two of the applicants, having regard to the fact that all of the applicants were found guilty under Article 169 of the former Criminal Code and that the criminal proceedings which were initially commenced in 1999 have not yet been terminated, there has been an interference with the applicants' right to freedom of expression. The Court further notes that the interference was prescribed by law, namely Article 169 of the former Criminal Code and Section 7 \u00a7 2 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act on disseminating the propaganda of an illegal, armed organisation through incitement to use violent methods. As to the legitimacy of the aims pursued, the Court observes that the authorities sought to protect national security and public order.

The Court stresses, however, that whilst this assessment should not be taken as an approval of the tone of these slogans, it must be recalled that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see, Karata\u015f v.

However, the issue in this case cannot be limited to the simple advocacy of violence. The applicants were found guilty of disseminating propaganda for an illegal, armed organisation, by way of incitement to use violent methods. Specifically, during a lawful demonstration commemorating the Sivas Massacre, they shouted slogans in favour of an armed, illegal organisation, adding that \u201cIt is the barrel of the gun that will call to account!\u201d, \u201cPolitical power grows out of the barrel of the gun\u201d and \u201cWe are the public's bullet lodged in the barrel of a gun\u201d). Such sentences, printed in a pamphlet would not amount, per se, to a clear and imminent danger, as they are unspecific. However, supporting an illegal, armed organization at a mass demonstration with slogans which have \u201ca violent tone\u201d (see paragraph 41 of the judgment) is a different matter and may amount to support for the violence used by such organisations. In terms of clear and imminent danger, the risk of that danger materialising is significantly increased, given the ongoing terrorist activity. In this context it is irrelevant, in our view, that the demonstration commemorating the massacres was lawful: unlawful acts may be committed at a lawfully convened demonstration too. Vice versa, support of an illegal, armed organisation at an illegal meeting may be protected (see Y\u0131lmaz and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, 17\u00a0July 2008).",

According to the present judgment the slogan shouted in Tasdemir \u201chad clearly amounted to an apology for terrorism\u201d (see paragraph 43 of the judgment) and, a contrario, it does not in the present case. The majority does not explain the difference and we cannot see it. In both cases the slogan uttered at a demonstration was in support of a terrorist group and the language is clearly similar (\u201cto the front line in retaliation\u201d compared to \u201cthe barrel of the gun ... will call to account.\u201d). Of course, the impact of such statements is contextual and the domestic courts are in a better situation to evaluate them in the given circumstances. In both cases the original conviction was serious (the domestic courts took into consideration other factors of culpability too). In the present case, however, the original conviction was reduced to ten months' imprisonment and the appeal is still pending. With the exception of Ms\u00a0Zehra Delikurt, none of the applicants was imprisoned. Ms\u00a0Zehra Delikurt chose to benefit from the Reintegration of Offenders into Society",

However, the proportionality of the sanctions applied is to be considered in the light of the actual impact which the expression has on the protected interest. In the present case the slogans supported the continued use of violence by an armed, illegal organisation. The applicants identified themselves with the violent means used by that organisation. Such identification may amount to the glorification of violent destruction and an expression of moral support (Leroy v. France, no. 36109/03, \u00a7 43, 2\u00a0October 2008). Without taking a position on the specific application of the above consideration in other cases, we do not believe that moral support for terrorism per se deprives an expression of the protection of Article 10. It is possible, for example, that someone agrees with certain terrorists about an alleged injustice, which the terrorists claim to be the reason of their fight. Such agreement on matters of injustice is indirect support only, and does not amount, per se, to the support of terrorist methods. However, in the present case the moral support is expressly and without ambiguity related to the violent means of the illegal movement in a situation where the people present may not have had the benefit of an ulterior exchange of ideas. Moreover the impact of such support given to the illegal, armed group has to be seen in the context of the tensions of the late nineties in Turkey when the likelihood of violent reactions was considerable (for the relevance of local circumstances see Falakaoglou and Sayagli v. Turkey, nos.\u00a022147/02 and 24972/03, 23 January 2007; Leroy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045.)",
