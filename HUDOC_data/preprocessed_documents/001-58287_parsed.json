Nor do the offences appear to have been the result of a concerted plan. In view of the part played by each, the absence of any previous criminal record and the administrative files on the defendants, the Court considers that it must accordingly reduce the length of the prison sentences as indicated in the operative provisions of the judgment and leave it to the discretion of the defendants\u2019 superiors to determine what disciplinary consequences are necessary in the case, the prison sentences being suspended, only in part as regards Herv\u00e9, whose responsibility appears greater, regard being had to his being the officer in charge.",

The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s application to join the criminal proceedings against the police officers as a civil party was an ordinary remedy sufficient to afford redress for the alleged damage. It had to be acknowledged, they argued, that there had been major developments in the proceedings since the Commission\u2019s findings of 25 November 1996. They considered, however, that there were no \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d in the present case allowing the Convention institutions to absolve the applicant from the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies (see the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16\u00a0September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV). The Government submitted that they could not be accused of remaining \u201ctotally passive\u201d since an administrative inquiry had been undertaken on the initiative of the Bobigny public prosecutor\u2019s office, which had subsequently requested, on 22 February 1993, that an investigation be opened. The Government also noted that although the handling of the proceedings had not been uniform, since periods of special diligence had alternated with periods of inactivity, the police officers had nonetheless ultimately been committed for trial at the Versailles Criminal Court. The Government pointed out that if the police officers were convicted, the applicant could, in his capacity as a civil party, claim compensation for the damage he had sustained. From that point of view, his application to join the criminal proceedings could not therefore be deemed to be \u201cineffective\u201d within the meaning of Convention case-law.",

France judgment of 22 September 1994, Series A no. 296-A, p. 18, \u00a7 33, and the Remli v. France judgment of 23 April 1996, Reports 1996-II, p. 571, \u00a7 33). Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention \u2013 with which it has close affinity \u2013 that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 22, \u00a7\u00a048, and the Akdivar and Others judgment cited above, p. 1210, \u00a7 65). Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made \u2013 at least in substance \u2013 to the appropriate domestic body, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see the Cardot v. France judgment of 19\u00a0March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, \u00a7 34).",

However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited above, p. 1211, \u00a7\u00a068). One such reason may be constituted by the national authorities\u2019 remaining totally passive in the face of serious allegations of misconduct or infliction of harm by State agents, for example where they have failed to undertake investigations or offer assistance. In such circumstances it can be said that the burden of proof shifts once again, so that it becomes incumbent on the respondent Government to show what they have done in response to the scale and seriousness of the matters complained of (ibid.).",

This issue is of particular importance if it is recalled that where an individual has an arguable claim that there has been a violation of Article 3 (or of Article\u00a02), the notion of an effective remedy entails, on the part of the State, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see, among other authorities, the following judgments: Aksoy cited above, p. 2287, \u00a7 98; Assenov and Others v.

Whatever the outcome of the domestic proceedings, the police officers\u2019 conviction or acquittal does not absolve the respondent State from its responsibility under the Convention (see the Ribitsch judgment cited above).

In those observations the Government debated the seriousness of the alleged injuries in the light of Dr\u00a0Garnier\u2019s second report (see paragraph 31 above) and the report produced by the eye specialist, Dr Biard (see paragraph 46 above). Thus, notwithstanding these arguments submitted in the alternative, the Government did not at any time contest the other facts alleged by Mr\u00a0Selmouni. The Court points out, as a subsidiary consideration, that those facts were taken as established both by the Criminal Court \u2013 excepting the allegations of rape and loss of visual acuity (see paragraphs 59-61 above) \u2013 and by the Versailles Court of Appeal, excepting the sexual assaults (see paragraph 65 above).",

On the one hand, it had been conducted with due diligence until 22 June 1994, the date on which an investigating judge at the Versailles tribunal de grande instance was appointed. On the other hand, there had been a second period, coinciding with the Versailles investigating judge\u2019s handling of the investigation, in which the authorities had failed to take all positive measures and employ the necessary diligence, regard being had to the seriousness of the allegations and the length of time which had elapsed since the events in issue.",
