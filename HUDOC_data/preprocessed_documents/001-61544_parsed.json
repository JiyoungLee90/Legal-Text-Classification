Moreover, the judgment delivered on 11\u00a0December 1995 contained errors. A supplementary judgment had therefore to be delivered and served on the parties. In its decision of 20 May 1997 the Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Regional Court found that the first instance court had dealt with the case erroneously in that, in particular, it had not correctly specified the experts' tasks as a result of which the experts had not been in a position to submit a sufficient opinion. The case was therefore sent back to the first instance court and further expert opinion had to be ordered. On 12\u00a0January 1998 the Regional Court quashed the first instance decision to discontinue the proceedings as it found that the time-limit set for the plaintiffs to submit further information had been too short. The Court further notes that the Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica District Court decided to obtain an expert opinion on 17 June 1998. It appointed an expert for that purpose on 26 October 1998, that is after more than four months. Almost another five months elapsed before the expert received the case-file on 23 March 1999. Finally, more than three months lapsed before the District Court's judgment of 6\u00a0March 2000 was drafted and served on the parties. ",
