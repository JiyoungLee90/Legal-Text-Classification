He was examined by a duty doctor, M.E. On the basis of a diagnosis of urticaria (a type of allergic reaction), M.E. ordered the administration of intravenous injections of a drug containing glucocorticosteroid (Dexamethason) and an antihistaminic (Synopen). Following the injections, the applicants' son's condition significantly deteriorated. This was probably a result of him being allergic to one or both of the drugs. His skin became very pale, he began to tremble and to feel cold; M.E. noticed signs of tachycardia. A diagnosis of anaphylactic shock was made. Subsequently, at 1.30 p.m., the applicant's son was transferred to intensive care. M.E. ordered the administration of, inter alia, adrenaline. By the time the cardiologist arrived, the applicants' son had stopped breathing and had no pulse. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was given. At around 2.15 p.m. the applicants' son was connected to a respirator and his blood pressure and pulse returned to normal, but he remained in a coma; his brain was severely damaged.",

Firstly, during the first- and/or second-instance proceedings the applicant must have used the supervisory-appeal procedure or lodged a motion for a deadline. Secondly, the proceedings must have been finally resolved (pravnomo\u010dno kon\u010dan). The final resolution of the case in principle refers to the final decision against which no ordinary appeal lies; this is normally the first-, or if an appeal has been lodged, the second-instance court's decision.

Contrary to the arguments of the State party, the Committee considered that the proceedings were prolonged, not because of a procedural error on the part of the authors, but because of a conflict of competence between authorities.

Subsequently, the public prosecutor refused to initiate criminal proceedings against the doctor. Criminal proceedings were then instituted at the applicants' request and were conducted by the applicants in their capacity as \u201csubsidiary\u201d prosecutors. In this respect, it is to be noted that the applicants first requested the opening of a criminal investigation into Doctor M.E.'s conduct on 1\u00a0August 1994. An initial decision to open the investigation was overturned in December 1994. A further request lodged by the applicants on 30 November 1995, after they had obtained a new medical opinion, was upheld and the investigation was reopened on 26\u00a0April\u00a01996 \u2013 almost three years after the applicants' son's death and almost two years after the applicants' initial request. After commencing in 1996, those proceedings continued for more than four years, during which period the case was twice remitted for further investigation after the indictment was lodged on 28 February 1997. They were finally discontinued by the interlocutory-proceedings panel's decision of 18\u00a0October\u00a02000.",

For instance, the second motion for a change of venue was upheld and the proceedings were, as a result, moved to the Maribor District Court. The applicants were also successful on two occasions with their call for individual judges to stand down, although it would appear that the judges concerned ultimately withdrew on their own initiative.",

In the present case, however, it considers that the delays that occurred after the stay was lifted were in many instances not reasonable in the circumstances. For example, as a result of the change of venue following the applicants' request of 11\u00a0June\u00a02001, no hearing was held for a further nine months (paragraphs 59-60 above). After the hearing of 3 April 2002, the proceedings were dormant for four months, as the courts were apparently dealing with the applicants' motions for the judges to stand down. Subsequently Judge M.T.Z. withdrew from the proceedings. During the following ten months, the only action taken by the courts was to reject two motions for a change of venue; no other steps were taken (see paragraphs 61-63 above). In addition, after the adjournment of a hearing scheduled for 23\u00a0and 24 March 2005, and despite the applicants' letter of 4 May 2005 requesting that the proceedings be expedited, it took the court ten months to schedule the next hearing, possibly because the conduct of the case had been taken over by yet another judge (see paragraphs 67-70 above). After the withdrawal of Judge D.M. on 31\u00a0January 2006, four and a half months elapsed before the next hearing was held by a new judge on 16\u00a0June\u00a02006 (see paragraphs 70-72 above). It is worth noting that, subsequent to that hearing, the new judge concluded the first-instance proceedings in less than three months (see paragraph 73 above).",

As regards the Government's argument that the Ombudsman lacked authority to interfere in the impugned domestic proceedings (see paragraph 190 above), the Court is of the opinion that it is not within its competence to\u00a0decide on the Ombudsman's powers under the domestic law, an issue which, moreover, bears no relevance to the applicants' complaints.",

In this respect, I fully agree with what is said in paragraph 161 of the judgment.

Thus, it is not easy to understand what is meant by the requirement for \u201ca genuine connection\u201d between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State for the procedural obligations imposed by Article 2 to come into effect. Furthermore the fact that the majority seem ready to accept such a connection \u201cbased on the need to ensure that the guarantees and the underlying values of the Convention are protected in a real and effective manner\u201d appears to confirm that the jurisdictional limits will be difficult to identify, if they exist at all.

Likewise where the event occurred or was only discovered so close to the critical date that it was not possible to commence an investigation before that date. Where on the other hand no investigation was carried out despite knowledge of the event or where the investigation was terminated before the critical date, I would say that the Court would have jurisdiction only where an obligation to carry out investigative measures was triggered by relevant new evidence or information (see, mutatis mutandis, Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a02457/04, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 27 November 2007).",

Nevertheless, the principles established in the Ble\u010di\u0107 case are, in our view, of some importance in the present case. The procedural obligation, if any, imposed on a State under Article 2 arises in principle at the moment when a death occurs at the hands of agents of a State or, as in the present case, when the relevant authorities of the State are made aware of a credible allegation that the death resulted from medical negligence on the part of hospital authorities. Although the obligation is an autonomous one, in the sense that it is not dependent on the existence of a substantive violation of Article 2, it is an obligation which not only derives from the death but is integrally linked with it. Where, as in the present case, the death occurs prior to the date of ratification, no Convention obligation is imposed on the State under Article 2 in either its substantive or procedural aspect and the Court has no temporal jurisdiction to examine a complaint of a violation of Article 2 in either of its aspects. To hold otherwise would, as in the Ble\u010di\u0107 case, result in the Convention being binding for that State in relation to a fact or situation (the death and the omission to investigate the death) that had taken place before the Convention came into force.",

While, applying the principle of \u201cdetachability\u201d, a complaint of a lack of effective investigation could lead to the finding of a violation of Article 2, a similar complaint under Article 13 would appear to be inadmissible. This is not merely because the Court would be unable to examine whether the applicant had an \u201carguable claim\u201d of a breach of a substantive Convention right (see the Voroshilov case referred to above), but for the more fundamental reason that, where the substantive complaint is inadmissible as being incompatible with the Convention, a complaint under Article 13 is similarly inadmissible, there being no \u201carguable claim\u201d in such circumstances (see, for example, Aliev v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no. 41220/98, 25 May 1999).",

The judgment seeks to dispel such risk by laying down first that, where the death occurs before the date of ratification, only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after that date could fall within the Court's temporal jurisdiction and secondly, that there should exist \u201ca genuine connection between the death and the entry into force of the Convention... for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 to come into effect\u201d (judgment paragraphs 162-163).",
