The case originated in an application (no. 3441/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Barbara Wypukoł-Piętka (“the applicant”), on 20 December 2001.
In a judgment delivered on 20 October 2009, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the excessive length of the proceedings in the applicant's case which had so far lasted sixteen years. The Court also decided to award the applicant 14,000 euros (EUR) for non-pecuniary damage and EUR 1,000 for costs and expenses and dismissed the remainder of the claims for just satisfaction.
On 11 January 2010 the applicant's daughter informed the Court that the applicant had died on 31 August 2008. She also drew the Court's attention to the fact that the applicant had informed the Court that in 2007 she had given her daughter the property to which the proceedings related. The applicant's daughter submitted a notarised deed certifying that she was her mother's only heir, by way of intestate succession. She accordingly requested revision of the judgment within the meaning of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court.
On 9 March 2010 the Court considered the request for revision and decided to invite the Government to submit any observations.
