The case originated in eight applications (nos. 2318/09, 12616/09, 23563/09, 26801/09, 26837/09, 26846/09, 26851/09 and 26859/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Erdal Ölmez and Mr Ali Turgay (“the applicants”), on the dates indicated in the appendix.
The applicants were represented by Mr Ö. Kılıç, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
At the time of lodging the applications, the applicants' representative requested that the respondent Government be notified of the introduction of the applications in accordance with Rule 40 of the Rules of Court and that the cases be given priority under Rule 41.
On 1 September 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give priority to the applications under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court and to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants were both born in 1983 and live in .
At the material time, the applicants were the owners, executive directors and editors-in-chief of five weekly newspapers published in : Politika, Yedinci Gün, Özgür Yorum, Analiz and Ayrıntı. The publication of these newspapers was suspended pursuant to section 6 (5) of Law no. 3713 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act) by various Chambers of the Istanbul Assize Court on different dates between 8 October 2008 and 14 March 2009 for a period of one month on account of various news reports and articles. The impugned publications were mainly deemed to be propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation, the PKK/KONGRA-GEL, and to constitute the approval of crimes committed by that organisation and its members.
Neither the applicants nor their representative participated in these ex parte procedures, and their written objections to the suspension orders were dismissed. Consequently, the orders were executed.
According to the documents in the case file, the applicant Erdal Ölmez was prosecuted on five occasions on account of the various news reports and articles published in Politika, Ayrıntı and Özgür Yorum. The applicant Ali Turgay was similarly prosecuted for material published in Yedinci Gün. It appears that these cases are currently pending before the domestic courts.
