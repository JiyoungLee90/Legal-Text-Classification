Moreover, the term \u201cpropaganda\u201d as provided for by Article 300.0.4 of the CAO purported to penalise a foreigner even introducing religious aspects of a new culture to another person, and the broad application of that provision prohibited any activity, no matter how innocent, if it was religious and carried out by a foreigner, which could not be a legitimate aim of a law in any democratic society.

This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see, among other authorities, Kokkinakis v.\u00a0Greece, 25\u00a0May 1993, \u00a7\u00a031, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0260-A; Buscarini and Others v.\u00a0San Marino [GC], no.\u00a024645/94, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 1999-I; S.A.S. v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a043835/11, \u00a7\u00a0124, ECHR\u00a02014 (extracts); and \u0130zzettin Do\u011fan and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a062649/10, \u00a7\u00a0103, 26 April 2016).",

This aspect of the right set out in the first paragraph of Article\u00a09, to hold any religious belief and to change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However, as further set out in Article 9 \u00a7 1, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one\u2019s belief alone and in private, but also to practise in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take various forms, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Kokkinakis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031, and Leyla \u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a044774/98, \u00a7\u00a0105, ECHR\u00a02005XI). Since the manifestation by one person of his or her religious belief may have an impact on others, the drafters of the Convention qualified this aspect of freedom of religion in the manner set out in Article\u00a09 \u00a7\u00a02. This second paragraph provides that any limitation placed on a person\u2019s freedom to manifest religion or belief must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of one or more of the legitimate aims set out therein (see Eweida and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a048420/10 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a080, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).",
