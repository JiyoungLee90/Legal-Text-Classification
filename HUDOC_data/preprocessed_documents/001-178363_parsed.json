In this respect the Court notes that the applicants raised their complaints under Article 3 of the Convention before the domestic courts that reviewed the lawfulness of their expulsion, but that these arguments were dismissed by the domestic courts (see the appended table). The Court reiterates that, in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when a remedy has been pursued, the use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no.\u00a045744/08, \u00a7 50, 21 December 2010 with further references).
