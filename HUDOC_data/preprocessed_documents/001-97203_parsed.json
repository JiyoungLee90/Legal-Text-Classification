It is further not disputed that the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Municipality\u2019s decision of 12 May 1992, whereby the applicant was given another plot of land instead of land no. 46, was annulled by the \u0130stanbul Administrative Court on 29 May 1995 and that this judgment became final after appeal proceedings. However, the national authorities have failed to take any decision to give effect to the \u0130stanbul Administrative Court\u2019s judgment on the ground that land no. 46 had been transferred to bona fide third persons. Having regard to the circumstances of the case, particularly the manner in which the land in question had changed hands while the proceedings before the administrative courts were still pending, and despite the apparent stay of execution of the Municipality\u2019s decision, the Court considers that the reason given by the authorities, while relevant, cannot justify such an omission in the present case in view of the fact that the situation in question was brought about by their lack of due diligence. Moreover, the Court, reiterating that the obligation to enforce a court decision is not limited to its operative part, as its merits must simultaneously be respected and applied (see Zazanis and Others v. Greece, no.\u00a068138/01, \u00a7\u00a036, 18 November 2004), finds that, in view of the impossibility of transferring land no. 46 to the applicant, the authorities could have sought other means of respecting the ruling of the \u0130stanbul Administrative Court, notably by way of allocating other land to the applicant in plot no.\u00a0195 which would have had the same value as that of no. 46. Finally, no cogent information has been forthcoming from the Government to demonstrate that, in view of the impossibility of enforcing the domestic court\u2019s ruling, the authorities made concrete and reasonable proposals to the applicant in compensation for the financial damage he had sustained. In this connection, the Court recalls that the applicant has been prevented from benefiting from the success of the litigation and remains to this day the owner of land which the domestic courts have established as not only being of lesser value than land no. 46 but also of having a building on it belonging to third persons.",
