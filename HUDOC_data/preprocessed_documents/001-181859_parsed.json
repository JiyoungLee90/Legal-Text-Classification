The participation of many victims and witnesses at the trial had been possible only after the use of coercive measures ordered by the District Court. Moreover, the investigation of the matter had required several forensic examinations and the volume of the evidence collected had been extensive.",

The modification of charges during the pre-trial investigation and the trial had not generated any delay. Although the time-limits for the investigation had been prolonged five times, this had been necessitated by the need, inter alia, to conduct forensic examinations, to find the property belonging to the applicant, to interrogate all victims and witnesses, and to carry out enquiries and searches. As to the trial, the District Court phase had taken about four and a half years during which time 136 court hearings had taken place and had been finally adjourned. The District Court had generally granted the different applications of the parties, which naturally had prolonged the proceedings. Both the applicant and his lawyer had been absent from four hearings; on thirteen occasions the applicant\u2019s lawyer had been absent and the case had been therefore adjourned; and once the case had been adjourned in order to involve another lawyer in the proceedings.",

In contrast, the prosecutor had failed to appear in court on a number of occasions without any good reason and the presiding judge had also adjourned the case many times for reasons unconnected to this case. Almost a half of the 136 adjournments had been due to the repeated non-appearance of victims and witnesses, most of which had been called by the prosecutor. Securing their appearance had clearly been the responsibility of the State. Moreover, the trial had to be restarted from the beginning after one year and three months since the powers of the first presiding judge had been suspended. Also the modifications of the charges had had the same delaying effect.",
