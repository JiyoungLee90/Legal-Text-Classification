The Court implicitly takes as its starting-point the general principle stated in its case-law that where a claimed entitlement, including a purely pecuniary one, discloses features of both public and private law, Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 will be applicable if the latter are predominant (see, for example, the Feldbrugge v. the Netherlands judgment of 29\u00a0May 1986, Series A no. 99, pp. 13\u201316, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030\u201340, and the Deumeland v. Germany judgment of the same date, Series\u00a0A no. 100, pp. 22\u201325, \u00a7\u00a7 60\u201374, where the asserted pecuniary claims were for social-security benefits). The reason for the distinction drawn between the four cases in which Article 6 is found to be applicable and those in which it is not is held by the Court to reside in the essentially pecuniary and economic character of the asserted right. I am not convinced by this distinction, and I consider Article 6 of the Convention inapplicable in all eighteen cases, including the present one. To my mind, a proper and adequate delimitation can only be found if in principle all disputes concerning the conditions of employment in the civil service are deemed to fall outside the ambit of Article 6 of the Convention. Such a result is in my view compatible with the existing case-law of the Court.",

France, the Court observed that \u201cin the law of many member States of the Council of Europe there is a basic distinction between civil servants and employees governed by private law\u201d; and that this had led it in previous judgments to hold that \u201cdisputes relating to the recruitment, careers and termination of service of civil servants are as a general rule outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1\u201d (17 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, pp. 410\u201311, \u00a7 43, and the authorities cited there). The dispute raised by the applicant in the Neigel case \u2013 over a refusal to reinstate her to a permanent post in the French civil service \u2013 related, so the Court found, to her \u201crecruitment\u201d, her \u201ccareer\u201d and the \u201ctermination of [her] service\u201d. Accordingly, despite the fact that her entitlement to reinstatement was not conditioned by the exercise of discretionary power by the French State, the dispute did not concern a \u201ccivil\u201d right within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. Her accompanying pecuniary claim for payment of salary did not attract the application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 because its successful outcome was directly dependent on a finding of unlawfulness as regards the refusal to reinstate her (ibid., p.\u00a0411, \u00a7\u00a044).",

It would be artificial to hold, for example, that pecuniary claims dependent on \u201ccareer\u201d moves in the narrow sense, such as promotion, transfer and reinstatement, should be outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01, whereas those dependent on other aspects of the rules governing remuneration under the employment relationship should not. I fail to perceive how in the latter category the features of private law are predominant if they are not in the former category. In my view, in both categories the features of public law are predominant precisely because of \u201cthe basic distinction between civil servants and employees governed by private law\u201d.",

However, as pointed out in the Neigel judgment, the applicants in these cases were asserting \u201cclaims for purely pecuniary rights arising in law after termination of service\u201d (emphasis added) and \u201cthe Italian State was not using \u2018discretionary powers\u2019 in performing its obligation to pay the pensions in issue and could be compared to an employer who was a party to a contract of employment governed by private law\u201d (loc. cit., pp.\u00a0410\u201311, \u00a7 43). In such circumstances, the features of private law, taken together and cumulatively, will confer on an entitlement to a civil-service pension the character of a \u201ccivil\u201d right within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",
