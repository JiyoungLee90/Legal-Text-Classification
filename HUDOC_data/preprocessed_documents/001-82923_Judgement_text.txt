The case originated in an application (no. 14925/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Ms Teodora Deliuchin (“the applicant”), on 17 December 2002. The applicant was represented by Mr V. Nagacevschi, from “Lawyers for Human Rights”, a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău.
The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr V. Pârlog.
The applicant complained  that the failure to enforce the final judgment of 22 August 2002 in her favour had violated her right to have her civil rights determined by a court within a reasonable time, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and her right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions, as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 15 February 2006 the President of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Chişinău.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In 1997 a criminal investigation was initiated in respect of the applicant. She was detained in the remand centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs between 18 June and 15 July 1998. She was again detained between 30 September and 31 October 1998 in the remand centre of the Ministry of Justice. The applicant allegedly complained to the prison authorities about the harsh conditions of detention in the remand centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
By its final judgment of 20 May 1999 the Court of Appeal acquitted her of all the charges against her.
The applicant initiated civil proceedings claiming damages for unlawful detention and related acts on the part of the prosecution and the courts.
On 26 December 2001 the Ciocana District Court found in her favour and awarded her 12,258 Moldovan lei (MDL, equal to 1,065 euros (EUR) at the time) in compensation for the pecuniary damage suffered and MDL 100,000 (EUR 8,688) for non-pecuniary damage.
On 19 March 2002 the  upheld that judgment.
On 22 August 2002 the Court of Appeal partly quashed that judgment, reducing the compensation for non-pecuniary damage to MDL 10,000 (EUR 752). It upheld the award of compensation for the pecuniary damage suffered. That judgment was final and enforceable.
The Prosecutor General requested the annulment of all previous judgments and the reduction of the award for non-pecuniary damage, as part of an extraordinary procedure. On 19 March 2003 the Supreme Court of Justice rejected that request.
On 21 November 2003 the Ministry of Finance transferred the amount corresponding to the compensation due to the Decisions Enforcement Department. According to that department, the applicant received the money on 26 February 2004. The applicant had submitted the enforcement warrant to the department on 23 October 2002.
