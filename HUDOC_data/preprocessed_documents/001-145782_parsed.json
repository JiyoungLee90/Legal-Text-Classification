Firstly, it is clear that where the death occurred before the critical date, only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction. Secondly, there must exist a genuine connection between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State for the procedural obligations imposed by Article 2 to come into effect. Thus a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision \u2013 which include not only an effective investigation into the death of the person concerned, but also the institution of appropriate proceedings for the purposes of determining the cause of death and holding those responsible to account \u2013 will have been, or ought to have been, carried out after the critical date.

In particular, the investigator failed to inform the applicants of his decision of 18 September 2003 to dismiss the criminal proceedings against R.A, which deprived them of all practical means to challenge that decision. Moreover, in spite of the numerous letters sent by the applicants to the prosecution authorities concerning the lack of progress of the investigation, they replied to them using the same standard wording, that the criminal proceedings concerning their son\u2019s death were underway and that their requests had been added to the relevant case file.",
