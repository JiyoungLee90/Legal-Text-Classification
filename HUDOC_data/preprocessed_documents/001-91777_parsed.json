The \u0130skenderun  further noted that it had taken into consideration the opinion of the majority of the Plenary Assembly of the Forensic Medicine Institute that the applicants had not suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. It considered that the Forensic Medicine Institute, although a State institution, was an independent body. It noted the minority dissenting opinions as an indication of the independence of the members of the Plenary Assembly. The first-instance court finally noted that there had been a disciplinary investigation into the doctors who had examined the applicants during and after their detention in police custody and no sanctions had been imposed on them as a result.",

Consequently, the Court should ascertain which part of the medical evidence submitted by the parties should be taken into consideration in order to determine the merits of the applicants\u2019 allegations of illtreatment.

The Court has held that all health professionals owe a fundamental duty to of care for to the people they are asked to examine or treat. They should not compromise their professional independence by contractual or other considerations but should provide impartial evidence, including making clear in their reports any evidence of ill-treatment (see Osman\u00a0Karademir v. , no. 30009/03, \u00a7\u00a054, 22 July 2008).

The Court considers that, with the passage of time, any physical scar of ill-treatment would either disappear or it would become impossible to determine the date on which the injury had been sustained. This is born out by the report of the 6th Section of Expertise which considered that the veracity of the second applicant\u2019s allegations of anal rape could not be assessed, since the rectal examination of 6\u00a0April\u00a01999 had been conducted too long after the alleged sexual assault (see paragraph 62 above).

The 4th Section noted that the applicants were not suffering from any psychological disorder at the time of their examinations in 2002 and 2004. However, it took into consideration that the applicants had undergone psychotherapy, and the second applicant drug therapy.

Four\u00a0months after the contested facts, the Turkish Medical Association, a respectable professional medical association dealing with professional education, fees and professional ethics, with representation on the Turkish Ministry of Health Central Ethics Committee, issued an opinion on those medical examinations without re-examining the applicants. The opinion states that the complaints made by the applicants were consistent with those that genuine victims of violence and rape would have made. Secondly, in accordance with their deontological principles, they criticise the examination procedure applied by the doctors as not being in conformity with the standards of the Ministry of Health. These views concern examinations conducted upon the applicants\u2019 discharge from police custody (paragraph 23 of the judgment).",

Moreover, the report of the Psychosocial Trauma Centre at the Faculty of Medicine of Istanbul University is based on examinations that took place more than a year after the contested events. More importantly, the finding of the Centre refers to post-traumatic stress disorder. The existence of such disorder does not prove anything about its origins. It may well be that the applicants\u2019 psychological problems had to do with the stress of the detention, or the long-term sentences they had been given, or were even related to remorse for the acts for which they had been convicted. The diagnosis itself remains contested in the light of the decision of the highest expert body in the matter, namely the Plenary Assembly of the Forensic Medicine Institute. Given that the medical opinions are conflicting, and that the balance is overwhelmingly tipped against any indirect evidence of ill-treatment, in the absence of prima facie evidence and in view of the negative finding of a domestic court we cannot see here that the State\u2019s responsibility is established beyond reasonable doubt, even though the State has a certain burden of proof in the event of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences. There is no prima facie sign of sufficiently strong inferences here, be it clear or even unclear. The Court itself is \u201cunable to establish the complete picture\u201d and believes that \u201cit should have been possible to detect the ill-treatment which had such long-term psychological effects\u201d (paragraph 97). Clearly, if it only \u201cshould have been possible\u201d it cannot be said to have happened, especially as the existence of the post-trauma syndrome remains contested. And once again, even if the applicants were in distress, this is not conclusive as to the causes of the distress.",

However, the medical examination of persons in police custody constitutes one of the most essential safeguards against illtreatment (T\u00fcrkan v. Turkey, no 33086/04, \u00a7 42). In this connection, we should like to recall that, in a situation where a female detainee complains of a sexual assault or requests a gynaecological examination, the obligation of the authorities to carry out a thorough and effective investigation into the complaint would include the duty to carry out\u00a0the examination promptly (see, for example, Ayd\u0131n v.\u00a0Turkey, 25\u00a0September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, \u00a7 107). In its recent judgment in the case of L.Z. v. Romania (no. 22383/03, \u00a7\u00a7 32-37, 3\u00a0February 2009), the Court found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on the grounds, inter alia, that the domestic authorities had not ensured the detailed medical examination of an applicant who had complained of anal rape while in prison.",

Turkey, no. 52515/99, \u00a7 81, 13 May 2008). However, in the instant case, it seems that the applicants had a genuine opportunity to refuse to undergo the examination as, the second time they were asked, they were able to refuse it without difficulty. There is no evidence of their objecting to the first examination. For reasons of legal certainty, we find the requirement of written consent indispensable, and we would welcome an exception to the general rule regarding medical examinations. At least, very young people should not have to undergo such tests as the humiliation is virtually inevitable while the protection against ill-treatment resulting from such tests is limited, given the possibility of alternative forms of sexual abuse.",
