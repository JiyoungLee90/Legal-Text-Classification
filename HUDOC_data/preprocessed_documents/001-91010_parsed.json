In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch, cited above, \u00a7 34, and Salman, cited above, \u00a7 100).",

What is in dispute between the parties is the existence of a link between the conduct of the officials in this situation and the infliction of injuries suffered by the applicant. The applicant maintained that the acts of ill-treatment were carried out by G.\u2019s relatives with the consent and assistance of investigator D., who had arranged for the abduction.

The Court, however, considers their account to lack credibility. First, the purpose of the applicant\u2019s detour from the detention facility remains unclear because D. has not explained what investigative action was intended to be carried out, at what destination, or why the convoy had to stop and wait half way. T. and K., on their part, failed to explain their lack of attempts to offer resistance to the kidnappers, or to pursue them, or to report that they had lost the detainee they convoyed. Further incoherence may be observed in the account of the applicant\u2019s return into custody later that evening. In particular, it remains unexplained why D., having received an \u201canonymous call\u201d inviting him to collect the applicant at the designated address, did not seek assistance from his fellow policemen in arresting the kidnappers, but simply picked the applicant up and took him back to the detention facility.",

Even assuming that the convoy fell an innocent victim of the \u201cunidentified perpetrators\u201d, as they contended, their professional duty required them to do everything possible to rescue the inmate in their charge.

For this reason, without having to examine whether the officials\u2019 involvement in the abduction went further than mere negligence, the Court considers it established that there has been a failure to ensure the applicant\u2019s security and that there has been a causal link between the authorities\u2019 conduct and the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment.",

It therefore finds that a procedural obligation arose to investigate the applicant\u2019s allegation of ill-treatment as soon as he brought the matter before the authorities concerned, namely the prosecutor\u2019s office and the detention facility. However, the investigation was only opened more then nine months after the events complained of, and there is no reasonable explanation for this delay. The case was eventually investigated by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Khabarovsk Garrison in criminal proceedings which, despite their lateness, were not necessarily doomed to failure, since the file already contained ample evidence. However, this inquiry has been far from satisfactory. It does not appear that there have been any attempts to gather evidence or to clarify the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s abduction and ill-treatment. The decision of 8 June 2002 by which the criminal proceedings were discontinued contained little more than a statement that none of the persons accused by the applicant had confessed to the kidnapping. When questioned they were not required to provide any specific information relevant to the abduction. It is striking, in particular, that D., T., and K. were not questioned about the vehicles in which the applicant had been kidnapped or returned, that no description of perpetrators was drawn, that there had been no identification parade with the relatives of G. before T., and K. or any search at their premises. Moreover, D., T. and K. were not required to specify the purpose of the applicant\u2019s detour from the detention facility, or to explain their own actions following the abduction in order to verify the allegations of their involvement.",

In particular, the Court held in the relevant cases that the Government had not demonstrated what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by a prosecutor, a court, or another State agency, bearing in mind that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not concern the applicant\u2019s personal situation alone (see Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a062936/00, 9 December 2004; Kalashnikov v.  (dec.), no.\u00a047095/99, 18 September 2001; and most recently, Andrey Frolov v.

Moreover, it notes that the applicant in the present case had in fact complained to the prosecutor\u2019s office (see his complaint of 16 June 2001 referred to in paragraph 28 above), which did not appear to yield any response.

The Court further observes that it has found serious violations of Article 3 of the Convention in the present case, most importantly torture. In these circumstances, it considers that the applicant\u2019s suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation. Nevertheless, the particular amount claimed appears excessive. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant EUR 22,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
