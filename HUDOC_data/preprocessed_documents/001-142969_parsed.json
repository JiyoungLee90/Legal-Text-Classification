They did not point to any aspects of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that she presented such risks. They gave no heed to important and relevant facts supporting the applicant\u2019s petitions for release and reducing the above risks, such as her clean criminal record, permanent place of residence and employment. Nor did they consider the possibility of ensuring the applicant\u2019s attendance by the use of a more lenient preventive measure. Finally, after the case had been submitted for trial in June 2005 the domestic courts issued collective detention orders, using the same summary formula to refuse the applications for release and extend the pre-trial detention of thirty-nine people, notwithstanding the defence\u2019s express request that each detainee\u2019s situation be dealt with individually.",

It is significant that the Administration\u2019s mission was to receive citizens and examine their complaints and its premises were therefore open to the public, subject to identity and security checks. The protesters, however, failed to comply with the established admission procedure: they bypassed the identity and security checks, did not register at the reception desk and did not wait in a queue for an available official to receive their petition. Instead, they stormed into the building, pushed one of the guards aside, jumped over furniture and eventually locked themselves in a vacant office. Such behaviour, intensified by the number of protesters, could have frightened the employees and visitors present and disrupted the normal functioning of the President\u2019s Administration. In such circumstances the actions of the police in arresting the protesters, including the applicant, and removing them from the President\u2019s Administration\u2019s premises may be considered as justified by the demands of the protection of public order (see, for similar reasoning, Steel and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 104, and Lucas, cited above).",

The Court considered that in such circumstances forty-four hours\u2019 detention pending trial and sentencing to twenty-eight days\u2019 imprisonment was proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public order. The second situation concerned a protest against the construction of a motorway. The participants repeatedly broke into a construction site, where they climbed into trees to be felled and onto some of the stationary machinery and placed themselves in front of machinery in order to impede the engineering works. The Court considered that seventeen hours\u2019 detention pending trial and sentencing to seven days\u2019 imprisonment for such disorderly behaviour was compatible with the requirements of Article 10 (see Steel and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 105 \u2013 109).",

That speech triggered a fight between those citizens who wanted to remove the flag and those who wanted to keep it. After that incident, that applicant organised an armed vigil to protect the Albanian flag. The police later found weapons in the town hall and in the applicant\u2019s flat. On the same day as they found the cache of weapons, the police were attacked by a group of about 200 people, who were armed with metal sticks and threw stones, rocks, Molotov cocktails and teargas projectiles at them. The Court found that in the very sensitive interethnic situation of that time the applicant\u2019s speeches and actions had encouraged interethnic violence and violence against the police. When assessing the proportionality of the sanction, the Court took into account that, although the applicant had been sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment, due to an amnesty he spent only one year and three months in prison. Therefore, even if the original sentence could be considered severe, the term actually spent in prison could not be considered disproportionate, regard being had to the facts of the case (see\u00a0Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001).",

Thus, in the case of Ezelin v.

When finding a violation of Article\u00a011, the Court held that the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly was of such importance that a person could not be subjected to a sanction \u2013 even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties \u2013 for participation in a demonstration, so long as that person did not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, \u00a7 53).",

Thus, in the case of Y\u0131lmaz and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 the Court found that four years\u2019 imprisonment for participating in a demonstration during which slogans calling for violence had been chanted by the crowd was disproportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public order and therefore incompatible with Article 10. When assessing the proportionality of the sanction, the Court took into account, among other things, that it had been never established whether the applicants had taken part in chanting the violent slogans (see Y\u0131lmaz and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, \u00a7\u00a7 65-69, 17 July 2008). Finally, the case of Schwabe and M.G concerned the applicants\u2019 arrest immediately before the commencement of a demonstration against a G8 summit. A similar demonstration the day before had ended with rioting, involving well-organised violent demonstrators who had attacked the police with stones and baseball bats. The Court noted that it had not been shown that the applicants had had violent intentions in seeking to take part in G8-related demonstrations. In such circumstances, their detention for almost six days in order to prevent them from participating in a demonstration that risked becoming violent had failed to strike a fair balance between the aims of securing public safety and the prevention of crime and the applicants\u2019 interest in freedom of assembly (see Schwabe and M.G., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0105 and 114-119).",

This offence refers to the conduct of someone who voluntarily takes part in an organised or non-organised movement of disturbance of social order caused by a mass of citizens, which must be accompanied by one or more of acts of violence against one or more persons, by a pogrom against an ethnic or religious group, by acts of arson, by the destruction of movable property (for example, cars) or immovable property, by the use of firearms or explosives or by armed resistance to the authorities. Thus, the offence is not based on a merely potentially dangerous conduct but on the causation of harm as a result of the offender\u2019s conduct, directed either at persons or at property. Yet this is not the sole provision applicable to the conduct of causing mass social disorder in the respondent State. There are three provisions which might be applicable to this conduct: Articles 212 and 213 of the Russian Criminal Code and Article 20.1 of the Russian Code of Administrative Offences. The borderline between these provisions is not at all clear. In the case of non-armed mass social disorder, such as in the present case, it is disputed whether Article 212 of the Russian Criminal Code or Article 20.1 of the Russian Code of Administrative Offences applies. In the case of armed mass social disorder, both Articles 212 and 213 of the Russian Criminal Code may be applied. It is interesting to note that the criminal offence of hooliganism (Article 213 of the Criminal Code) involves the same conduct of breach of public order as the criminal offence of mass disorder (Article 212 of the Criminal Code), but is punishable by a lesser penalty. Hence, the rationality of the penal policy choice to create these two autonomous offences is highly questionable. The overlapping of these legal provisions is aggravated by a prosecutorial practice that frequently imputes to \u201crioters\u201d the offence of \u201cviolent overthrow of State power\u201d (Article 278 of the Russian Criminal Code). In fact, the prosecutorial practice of initially charging participants in political demonstrations with the offence of \u201cviolent overthrow of State power\u201d, for the purpose of justifying their pre-trial detention for long periods of time, and subsequently amending the charges to a lesser charge of participation in mass disorder, is not censured by the domestic courts, which passively accept this prosecutorial practice.",

Among others, member States must take into consideration the following two principles: first, a very broad penal framework, with a great disparity between the minimum and the maximum prison terms, raises an issue of certainty of the penal law under Article 7 (nulla poena sine legge certa), and second, a very long mandatory minimum prison term calls into question the necessity of the State interference.

Article 355 of the Andorran Penal Code makes rioting causing danger to persons subject to a penalty of up to two years\u2019 imprisonment. Article 274 of the Austrian Penal Code subjects participation in a breach of social order to a penalty of up to two years\u2019 imprisonment, and leadership of a riot to a prison term of up to three years. In Belgium, rioting is punished by \u201cpolice penalties\u201d, which may constitute a fine or a prison term of up to seven days (see, for example, Article 70 of the Police Regulations of the city of Brussels). Under Article 239 of the Estonian Penal Code, persons participating in mass disorder who commit desecration, destruction, arson or other similar acts or who disregard a lawful order or offer resistance to a police officer, special constable or any other person combating such activities on a legal basis, or incitement of such person to non-performance of his or her duties, are liable to a pecuniary penalty or up to five years\u2019 imprisonment. Article 238 of the same Code punishes the offence of organising or planning disorder involving a large number of persons or incitement to participation in such disorder, if such disorder results in desecration, destruction, arson or other similar acts, with three to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. Section 2 of Chapter 17 of the Finnish Penal Code makes non-violent rioting subject to a fine or imprisonment for at most one year, participation in a violent riot to a fine or imprisonment for at most two years and leadership of a violent riot to a fine or imprisonment for at most four years. Section 14 of the Irish Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 makes the offence of riot punishable by a fine and/or a period of imprisonment of up to ten years, but sets no minimum prison term. Violent disorder, which is covered by Section 15 of the Act, is subject to the same penalty. Article 283 of the Lithuanian Criminal Code punishes participation in non-armed rioting with a prison term of up to five years and armed rioting with a term of up to six years. Section 324 of the Croatian Penal Code makes rioting subject to a fine or a period of imprisonment ranging from three months to three years. The aggravated offence of rioting committed out of hatred, towards large number of persons, with the use of arms, endangering the life or physical integrity of other persons or resulting in extensive material damage, is punishable by imprisonment of between six months and five years. Article 431-3 of the French Criminal Code punishes participation in a non-armed riot with a fine and one year\u2019s imprisonment and participation in an armed riot with a fine and three years\u2019 imprisonment. Article 225 of the Georgian Criminal Code punishes the offence of organising or leading mass disorder involving violence, pogrom, arson, the use of arms or explosive devices, or armed resistance against a Government representative, with imprisonment for a term ranging from three to ten years, while mere participation in the riot is punishable by prison sentences ranging from two to eight years. Article 186 of the Dutch Penal Code punishes participation in a riot with a prison term of up to three months or a second-category fine. Article 125 of the German Penal Code punishes rioting with a fine or a prison term of up to three years, and armed rioting with a prison term of six months to ten years. Article 274 of the Liechtenstein Criminal Code punishes participation in a riot accompanied by murder, bodily harm or damage to property with a prison term of up to three years. Article 385 of the Macedonian Penal Code punishes those who participate in a crowd which by means of joint action performs acts of violence against people or damages or destroys property on a large scale, with a fine or with imprisonment for up to three years; if during the action of the crowd a person is killed or sustains serious bodily injury, or large-scale damage is caused, the participants in the crowd are liable, by virtue of their participation, to imprisonment for between three months and five years. The leader of the crowd is punished with a prison term of one to ten years. Article 399 of the Montenegro Criminal Code punishes rioting with a prison term ranging from three months to three years, and when there is bodily harm or serious humiliation of third parties, with a term ranging from six months to five years. Article 136 of the Norwegian Penal Code makes rioting subject to a prison term of up to three years and when there is violence against persons or property, to a prison term ranging from two months to five years. Article 302 of the Portuguese Penal Code punishes participation in a riot with one year\u2019s imprisonment or 120 day-fines, and organisation of a riot with three years\u2019 imprisonment or 360 day-fines; however, when the riot is armed the upper limit is doubled. The lower limit is one month\u2019s imprisonment or ten day-fines. Article 344 of the Serbian Criminal Code punishes rioting with a prison term of three months to three years, and where there is bodily harm or serious damage to the property of third parties, with a prison term ranging from six months to five years. Article 514 of the Spanish Penal Code punishes the leaders of unlawful demonstrations with a prison term of between one and three years and a fine; participants carrying arms or other dangerous implements are liable to a prison term of between one and two years. Section 1 of Chapter 16 of the Swedish Penal Code punishes participation in a non-violent riot with a fine or a prison term of up to two years, and leadership of a riot with up to four years\u2019 imprisonment. Section 2 of the same chapter punishes participation in a violent riot with a fine or a prison term of up to four years, and leadership with a penalty of up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. These provisions do not set a minimum penalty. In some countries such as Hungary the crime of rioting is associated with the immediate aim of impeding the exercise of constitutional authority by means of violence or threats of violence, or of coercing the Parliament, the President of the Republic, the Supreme Court or the Government to take certain measures, but even in this case the crime is punishable with imprisonment of between two and eight years (Article\u00a0140 of the Hungarian Criminal Code). Based on this comparative law review, it can be ascertained that a minimum prison term of three years for the criminal offence of participating in mass social disorder, even when accompanied by damage caused to property, is per se problematic from the standpoint of the principle of necessity.",

But Article 64 does not establish a clear set of conditions for the application of this concession. Although it refers to a list of \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances, this list is not exhaustive and judges may refer to other circumstances. The lower courts exercise considerable discretion in the application of this list of circumstances, since the higher courts have failed to date to give any guidelines as to how the said provision should be construed and have thus left the first-instance judges with ample room for a subjective evaluation of the appropriate punishment in each particular case. Scholars and commentators on the Criminal Code do not provide the judges with any additional guidance. This serious defect in the legal framework impacts not only on the conditions for the application of the provision in question but also on the consequences of its application. Judges have the following two options: either to give a sentence below the minimum set out in the relevant article of the Criminal Code, but in any case not below the minimum established by the Code for each type of punishment (for example, in the case of imprisonment the minimum is two months), or to give a less severe punishment (for example, if an offence is punishable by imprisonment only, the judge may decide to apply a fine or correctional labour). Such is the plethora of possible alternatives for sentencing that defendants cannot anticipate the penalty that they might incur. In sum, the lawfulness of the interference with the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression and expressive conduct by the domestic prosecutors and courts is called into question by this additional element of uncertainty involving sentencing.",

In Appleby and Others, the Court assessed the limits of the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression on another person\u2019s private property such as a shopping centre. As an obiter dictum, the Court added that under the Convention there was no positive obligation to create rights of entry to all publicly owned property, such as government offices and ministries, in order to allow freedom of expression to be asserted, if there were alternative and effective means for those concerned to convey their message. In the case at hand, the administration building served as the executive office of Russia\u2019s President, with its various bureaucratic services and branches. One of these branches was the front desk for the reception of members of the public and their applications and complaints. Thus, the building used by the President of the Russian Federation\u2019s Administration can be considered as a non-public forum which, by governmental design, is not an appropriate platform for unrestrained communication, assembly and demonstration. Here, the State is granted much greater latitude in regulating freedom of expression and expressive conduct. In addition to applying regulations as to time, place and manner, the State may reserve the forum for its intended purposes, as long as the regulation of expression and expressive conduct is reasonable and not an effort to suppress them merely because public officials oppose the forum user\u2019s view. Special restrictions may be imposed with regard to the simultaneous entry and gathering of large crowds inside public buildings during working hours. Even when enjoying authorised entry and gathering inside a public building, the forum users are not supposed to misuse their freedom of expression and expressive conduct by means of acts of violence against persons or property. A fortiori, no violence may be used for entering and remaining inside a public building under the guise of a political form of expression or assembly. Violence does not become legitimate simply because it takes place in an assembly, even when it pursues political aims.",

In the case at hand, the nature of the interference and of the expression and expressive conduct point in the direction of a narrow margin of appreciation, but the place where they occurred points in the opposite direction. Assessing the weight of these factors on both sides of the scales, the balance is clearly tipped in favour of the essence of the interference and the expression, to the detriment of the circumstantial element of space. Overall, a narrow margin of appreciation prevails in the particular circumstances of the case.",

The domestic courts gave two reasons: first, the demonstrators had committed serious breaches of public safety and order by disregarding established norms of conduct and showing manifest disrespect for society; and second, while performing the above disorderly acts, the defendants had destroyed and damaged property in one of the offices of the reception area of the President\u2019s Administration building. These arguments are based on the protection of public order and public property and the prosecution of criminal conduct as legitimate aims for the restriction of the freedom of expression and expressive conduct. And they are well founded. Taking into account the fact that the applicant entered the building with a considerable number of demonstrators involved in the action of the National Bolsheviks Party, and that the group bypassed identity and security checks, pushed aside the guard who had attempted to stop them, did not comply with the guards\u2019 lawful demands to leave the premises, took over office no. 14 on the ground floor, damaged the furniture and the walls of the office, blocked the door with a heavy metal safe and conducted an unauthorised meeting, it was justified to assert not just that there was a clear and imminent danger of commission of criminal acts, but moreover that criminal acts had already been committed by the group of demonstrators which warranted the police action to restore order and bring the demonstrators to justice. In other words, the arrest of the demonstrators by the police and their charging with criminal offences corresponded to a pressing social need and were therefore covered by the second paragraph of Article 10 of the Convention.",

                        "content": "11.\u00a0\u00a0In view of the serious disorder and considerable damage caused by the demonstrators, the punishment of the described conduct as a criminal offence was not incompatible with the protection of their freedom of expression and a fortiori with their freedom of assembly. Nevertheless, the domestic courts\u2019 reaction was disproportionate in the circumstances of the case, because they kept the defendant in pre-trial detention for a year in spite of the fact that two months after the demonstrators\u2019 arrest the prosecutor had dropped the initial extremely serious charges of attempted violent overthrow of the State and charged the demonstrators with the less serious offence of participation in mass disorder. Admittedly, the domestic courts applied the minimum prison penalty prescribed by law for the crime imputed to the applicant and subsequently suspended this prison sentence, taking into consideration the fact that the defendants had voluntarily compensated the pecuniary damage caused by their actions and that the applicant had \u201cpositive character references\u201d. But the domestic courts could have gone further. They had three alternatives: maintaining the charges against the applicant and making use of their power to apply a prison sentence below the minimum set out in the relevant provision; applying a different penalty, such as a fine or correctional labour (Article 64 of the Criminal Code); or even using their power to amend the charges during the trial and try the defendant for a lesser offence, provided that her situation was not aggravated as a result and her defence rights were not impaired (Article 252 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). At the least, the \u201cpositive character references\u201d that led the courts to suspend the prison sentence could have prompted them also to apply Article 64 of the Criminal Code. The legitimate pressing social needs pursued by the domestic authorities of restoration of public order and prosecution and punishment of criminal conduct could have been achieved without such heavy-handed interference with the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression and expressive conduct.",

She was rightly arrested and brought to justice. But the response of the Russian justice system was excessive, in view of her pre-trial detention and her sentencing to a prison term of three years. This excessive response was made possible by the severity and lack of clarity of Russian law on the punishment of participation in mass social disorder and by the wide discretionary powers with regard to the sentencing of defendants to a penalty below the minimum set by the applicable criminal provision. We therefore conclude that there has been a violation of Article\u00a010.",
