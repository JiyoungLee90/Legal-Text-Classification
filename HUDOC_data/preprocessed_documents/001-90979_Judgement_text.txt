On 9 December 1990 the applicant took part once again in a car convoy organised by persons from Kyrenia wishing to return to their homes in the north peacefully. The participants in the convoy had informed the Prime Minister of Turkey, the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) in  and the commander of the UN forces on the island of their intention to return home. They drove to the Mia Milia bufferzone checkpoint on the main road linking  and Kyrenia. There they stopped and asked the UN forces officer on duty to be allowed to return to their homes, property and villages. They requested him to transmit their demand to the Turkish military authorities. Four hours later, the UN officer announced to the applicant and the other participants in the convoy that their request to drive through the checkpoint and enter the northern part of  had been refused. The applicant claimed that they had been told that their request had been refused by the Turkish military authorities. The respondent Government contended that the UN officer had consulted the Turkish-Cypriot authorities.
