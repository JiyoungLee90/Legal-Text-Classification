It further notes that in the case of Guk it found that Mr\u00a0Guk\u2019s allegation about a use of a bag over a prisoner\u2019s head had not been supported by any evidence (ibid., \u00a7 73). In addition, it observes that there is no evidence that the applicant ever raised the above complaints before the domestic authorities. Lacking any evidence that these complaints were raised before the domestic authorities and not having the benefit of their findings in relation thereto, the Court, mindful of its subsidiary role under the Convention, cannot determine the reliability of the applicant\u2019s contentions. Similar considerations apply to the allegations about the prohibition on using mattresses and bedding during the daytime. Therefore, these aspects of the case are manifestly ill-founded (see similarly Andrey\u00a0Yakovenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a063727/11, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, 13\u00a0March 2014).",
