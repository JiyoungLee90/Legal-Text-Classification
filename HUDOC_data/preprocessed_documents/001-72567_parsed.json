Three new experts examined Mr. Luberti on several occasions; they saw him for the last time on 14 May 1979. Although their report agreed with the previous report in other respects, it differed as regards the precise diagnosis of his illness; it also found that at the moment of the crime Mr. Luberti lacked the capacity to understand and not just the capacity to form an intention (capacit\u00e0 d\u2019intendere e di volere). In addition, the report contained observations on the applicant\u2019s behaviour during his meetings with the experts. It mentioned certain symptoms of the illness that was diagnosed: evidence of megalomania was to be found in Mr. Luberti\u2019s overestimation of himself, in his superiority complex in regard to the experts, in his conviction that he was immortal and in his antagonistic attitude to the world around him. Furthermore, statements by the applicant alleging that he was the victim of widespread international conspiracies showed clearly that he was suffering from persecution mania.

The hearings were held on 12 May, that is even before the \u2019s judgment had been deposited in its registry (29 May). The material before the Naples Supervision Division included a medical report dated 16 April 1981 - that is, less than a month after Mr. Luberti\u2019s return to the psychiatric hospital -, which had been drawn up for the purposes of the inquiry into the case; the Chief Medical Officer (Direttore capo sanitario) of the hospital stated therein that \"from the clinical point of view there [was] no reason why the security measure should not be terminated\".",

Quite apart from that, the report was not sufficient in itself to necessitate a decision to release Mr. Luberti, especially in view of the fact that it contradicted both the findings contained in the judgment of the Appeal Court of Assize and made only a few months previously (16 November 1979), and also the expert opinions on which that judgment had been based. The Rome Supervision Division, therefore, had to proceed with circumspection and had to verify for itself Mr. Luberti\u2019s mental state.",

The termination of the confinement of an individual who has previously been found by a court to be of unsound mind and to present a danger to society is a matter that concerns, as well as that individual, the community in which he will live if released; the instant case involved someone who had committed homicide, a factor which increased the inherent difficulties of any assessment in the psychiatric field.

Its decision, which was adopted on 4 June 1981 and deposited in the court registry on 10 June, led on 15 June to Mr. Luberti\u2019s release. These various intervals of time are not inordinate: in the Court\u2019s opinion, the Naples Supervision Division carried out its task as rapidly as could be reasonably expected. If the Rome Supervision Division had acted with more dispatch, it might perhaps have been feasible to arrive sooner at the conclusion that the continuation of the confinement was no longer necessary. The Court does not rule out this possibility but, on the basis of the evidence before it, it does not consider that it has been established that the applicant\u2019s detention continued beyond the period justified by his mental disorder. There has therefore been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (art. 5-1).",

Neither can it be forgotten that as early as 17 November 1979 Mr. Luberti had lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation (see paragraph 11 above). He was evidently attempting, by contesting the reasons given by the Appeal Court of Assize for rejecting the plea that the victim had committed suicide, to avoid the security measure ordered on 16 November; he challenged that measure directly, on 19 November, before the Rome Supervision Division. Although he was certainly entitled to utilise all the means of defence available to him under the law, the fact that he had simultaneous recourse to two procedures which, though distinct, had the same basic object no doubt occasioned a loss of time that cannot be attributed to the authorities (cf., in the context of the \"reasonable time\" referred to in Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1), the Eckle judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, p. 36, \u00a7 82).

As soon as the Rome Court of Appeal had given its ruling (4 May 1981) and without awaiting the deposit of its judgment in the court registry (29 May 1981), the Naples Supervision Division began its consideration of the merits of the case and acted with the expedition required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention; the Supervision Division\u2019s order, adopted on 4 June 1981 and deposited on 10 June, led on 15 June to Mr. Luberti\u2019s release.
