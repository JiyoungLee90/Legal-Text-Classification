Such an interpretation would make it impossible to pursue proceedings in respect of persons who, acting as agents of the State, had committed crimes before 1\u00a0January 1990 but had subsequently been acquitted before that date because the authorities had found it politically expedient to find them not guilty.

It emphasises the serious nature of the allegations made in the present case. Excessive length of judicial proceedings and delays in investigating alleged violations of human rights protected under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention are an object of recurrent complaints brought before the Court in cases against Poland. The Court cannot but note that this appears to disclose a structural problem which calls for adequate general measures to be taken by the authorities. No such measures are mentioned in the unilateral declaration submitted by the respondent Government. Furthermore, the Court is of the view that the sum proposed in the declaration in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant as a result of the alleged violation of the Convention does not bear a reasonable relation to the amounts awarded by the Court in similar cases against Poland in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see, among many other authorities, Ciecho\u0144ska v.\u00a0Poland, no. 19776/04, \u00a7\u00a087, 14\u00a0June 2011; Wasilewska and Ka\u0142ucka v.\u00a0 Poland, nos. 28975/04 and 33406/04, \u00a7\u00a070, 23\u00a0February 2010; Mojsiejew v.

While it is normally death in suspicious circumstances that triggers the procedural obligation under Article 2, this obligation binds the State throughout the period in which the authorities can reasonably be expected to take measures with the aim of elucidating the circumstances of a death and establishing responsibility for it (see \u0160ilih v.  [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7 157, 9\u00a0April 2009, with further references).\u00a0\u00a0The Court has consistently examined the question of procedural obligations under Article 2 separately from the question of compliance with the substantive obligation and, on several occasions, a breach of a procedural obligation has been alleged in the absence of any complaint as to the substantive aspect of this Convention provision (see Calvelli and Ciglio v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a032967/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04157, ECHR\u00a02002I, and Byrzykowski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 11562/05, \u00a7\u00a7 86 and 94118, 27\u00a0June 2006). It is clear from the Court\u2019s case-law that the procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation under Article 2 has evolved into a separate and autonomous duty capable of binding the State even when the death took place before the critical date (see \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0159160).",

Where the death occurred before ratification, only procedural acts or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction (ibid, \u00a7 162). Furthermore, there must be a genuine connection between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of that State for the procedural obligation to come into effect. In practice, this means that a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision have been, or should have been, carried out after ratification. The Court has also held that circumstances may emerge which cast doubt on the effectiveness of the original investigation and an obligation may arise for further investigations to be pursued (see Hackett v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a034698/04, 10\u00a0May 2005).",

Thus, in \u0160ilih, the death of the applicants\u2019 son occurred a little more than a year before the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Slovenia, while, with the exception of the preliminary investigation, all the criminal and civil proceedings were initiated and conducted after that date (see \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0165). Similarly, the fact that all the major events of an investigation occurred after the ratification date was sufficient to establish the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction, even though the applicant\u2019s son had died four years and three months before the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Ukraine (see Lyubov Efimenko v. , no. 75726/01, \u00a7\u00a065, 25\u00a0November 2010).

The Court notes that the issue of prescription was also examined in the judgments given on 17\u00a0January 2001, 12 September 2001 and 14 December 2010. Moreover, in his appeal against the judgment of 17 January 2001 the Prosecutor General argued that the court had wrongly applied provisions concerning criminal liability arising in connection with crimes committed by agents of the communist regime prior to 1 January 1990. Hence, serious differences arose in the interpretation of the applicable legal provisions and their application to the circumstances of the present case. It is true that the Court\u2019s power to review compliance with domestic law is limited (see, mutatis mutandis, Fredin v.\u00a0Sweden (no. 1), 18 February 1991, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 192, and Stankiewicz v. Poland, no. 46917/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2006VII). The Court has already noted the intention of the domestic legislator to come to terms with the country\u2019s totalitarian past (see paragraph 52 above). However, as regards I.K.\u2019s case, as a result of the excessive length of the judicial proceedings, partially caused by the diverging opinions of various courts on the issue of prescription, the offence became prescribed.",
