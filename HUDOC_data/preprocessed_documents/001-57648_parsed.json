The mere fact that a commercially damaging statement is true does not necessarily constitute a defence against a charge of acting in breach of the principles of fair competition. According to the rules of competition, such statements are acceptable only if they are based on sufficient grounds and if the manner and extent of the criticism in question remains within the limits of what is required by the situation because it is contrary to honest practices to engage in competition by making disparaging statements about competitors (see Federal Court of Justice, Gewerblicher Rechtsschutz und Urheberrecht (\"BGH GRUR\") 1962, pp. 45 and 48 - Betonzusatzmittel). In this case, at the time of the publication there was not sufficient cause to report this incident. The exact circumstances had not yet been clarified. The appellant in its reply had agreed to undertake an immediate investigation and to contact Mrs L\u00fcchau in order to clarify the position. The respondents were aware that criticism of the appellant could not be fully justified before further clarification had been sought, as they themselves had described the appellant\u2019s reply as a provisional answer. Accordingly, they should have taken into consideration that any such premature publication of this incident was bound to have adverse effects on the appellant\u2019s business, because it gave the specialised retailers an effective argument which was capable of being used against the appellant with their mutual customers, and one which could be used even if the incident should turn out to be an isolated mishap from which no conclusion could be drawn as to the appellant\u2019s business policy. In these circumstances, at all events at the time of the publication, there were not sufficient grounds for reporting this isolated incident.

As, simply, an additional and related item of information, it qualifies for the same legal assessment, in particular because it was liable to strengthen the unfavourable impression which inevitably resulted from the mere recounting of the incident. The Court of Appeal considered that this was no more than an illustration of the fact that the journalist had not been in a position to verify what had been told to him, but this observation conflicts with its earlier conclusion that the wording used expressed at least serious doubts as to the accuracy of the information and that in this case, consequently, the description of events put forward by the appellant was presented as being, probably, unreliable. The Court of Appeal ought therefore to have stated on what basis it reached a conclusion contrary to the ordinary meaning of the words.

However, this merely represented a value judgment, and as such could not give rise to objections. Yet, under section 1 of the 1909 Act, the decisive issue is not whether the statement is to be regarded as a value judgment or as an allegation of fact. The expression of a value judgment can also exert an unacceptable influence in the field of competition under section 1 of the 1909 Act (see BGH GRUR 1962, p. 47 - Betonzusatzmittel). In this case, there were in any event not sufficient grounds for such a sweeping suspicion. A single case of this type did not constitute evidence for suspecting immediately that the appellant\u2019s commercial policy was fraudulent.

This is the case for articles in the press where - as here - the nature of the questions dealt with gives grounds for supposing that the debate was not closed by the publication of the first article (BGHZ 31, pp. 318 and 319 - Alte Herren; BGH, Neue Juristische Wochenschrift (\"NJW\") 1966, pp. 647 and 649 - Reichstagsbrand).

It is permissible for a competitor to criticise another publicly only if he has sufficient reasons for so doing and if the nature and scope of his criticism remain within the limits required by the situation. In this field, the prohibition on publishing criticism is therefore the norm and it falls to the person who takes the risk of publishing such criticism to show that there were sufficient grounds for his criticism and that it remains within the strictest limits. In considering whether this proof has been furnished, the court weighs up only the interests of the two competitors.",

In this field the basic assumption is that this right is used to serve the general interest, in particular as far as the press is concerned, and that is why in this context the freedom to criticise is the norm. Thus in this field it falls to the person who alleges that the criticism is not acceptable to prove that his claim is well-founded. In determining whether he has done so, the court must weigh up the general interest, on the one hand, and the individual interests of the party who claims to have been injured, on the other.",

It follows that to classify under the law on unfair competition the question whether an article published by an organ of the press is acceptable is to place that organ of the press in a legal position which is fundamentally different from that to which it is entitled under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention and one which is clearly unfavourable to it. That is why, in my view, for that organ of press, such a classification constitutes a considerable restriction on the exercise of the freedoms guaranteed to it under Article 10 (art. 10). It should therefore be asked whether it can be necessary in a democratic society to restrict the rights and fundamental freedoms of an organ of the press in this way solely because that organ has espoused the cause of specific economic interests, namely those of a particular sector of a specialised trade. I am in no doubt that this question must be answered in the negative. This is clear from the fact that, as far as I know, such a rule extending the scope of the law on unfair competition to the detriment of freedom of the press is unknown in the other member States of the Council of Europe, and rightly so because, in certain respects, all newspapers may be regarded as partisan, having espoused the cause of certain specific interests.",

In my view, it follows from the foregoing that the Court ought to have considered that in this instance it had to examine a case in which the assessment of the national authorities suffered from a fundamental defect and that, accordingly, it ought itself to have determined whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society. Indeed, in such circumstances the margin of appreciation plays no role because this margin cannot justify assessments incompatible with the freedoms guaranteed under the Convention. I emphasise this point because, for my part, I do not deny that in the field of freedom of expression the  can limit the scope of its review by leaving the States a certain margin of appreciation.",

                        "content": "In my view - and here too I find myself in agreement with the joint dissenting opinion - it is necessary to ask whether it was established convincingly (see the Barthold judgment of 25 March 1985, Series A no. 90, p. 25, \u00a7 58) that the private interests of the Club were more important than the general interest, in accordance with which not only the specialised reader but also the public as a whole should have been able to acquaint themselves with facts having a certain importance in the context of the struggle of small and medium-sized retail undertakings against the large-scale distribution companies. In answering this question, I, like the authors of the joint dissenting opinion, reach the conclusion that the reply must be negative. Like the Court (see paragraph 35 of its judgment), I take into account the fact that in a market economy an undertaking which seeks to set up a business inevitably exposes itself to close scrutiny of its practices. That is why the Club, which was in that situation, cannot in principle complain that the specialised press, which has given itself the task of defending the interests of its competitors on that market, analyses its commercial strategy and publishes its criticisms thereof. Such criticism contributes, as the Court stressed, to the openness of business activities. Since the freedom of expression also applies to \"statements\" which hurt, care should be taken not to find such criticism unacceptable too quickly simply because it harms the undertaking criticised. In this instance, it cannot be denied that the article published by markt intern is unfavourable to the Club and reveals a very critical attitude in the latter\u2019s regard. On the other hand, it reported an incident which, as has not been contested, in fact occurred and it did not purport to offer a definitive assessment of the Club\u2019s commercial practices, but invited retailers to supply additional information. For my part, I am not convinced that it is truly necessary to prohibit such an article in a democratic society.",
