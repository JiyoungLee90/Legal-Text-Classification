It held that the Municipal Court had established the facts correctly (continuous possession of the land in good faith since 1912) but had erred in its application of the substantive law. It established, firstly, that the land in question had been in social ownership on 8\u00a0October 1991 and that under the relevant legislation it had not been possible to acquire ownership of socially owned property by adverse possession before that date unless the statutory requirements for doing so had been met by 6 April 1941 (see paragraphs 18, 24 and 30-31 below). However, those requirements had not been met in the plaintiffs\u2019 case. That was so because under Article 1472 of the 1811 Civil Code (which was applicable in Croatia from 1852 until 1980, see paragraphs 17-19 and 21\u00a0below) immovable property owned by municipal authorities could be acquired by adverse possession only after forty years.

The period necessary for acquiring ownership by adverse possession would have expired in 1989. [However, by that time the property was already in social ownership, having been transferred in 1983].

Rather, what was important was whether the ownership of the property in question had been vested in him by the operation of law at the time when section 388(4) of the 1996 Property Act in its original text had still been in force (see paragraphs 8, 10, 26-27 above).",

If national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate (see Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032-33, ECHR 2000-XI). In this connection the Court notes that under section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act the applicants may now file a petition for reopening of the civil proceedings in respect of which the Court has found a violation of the Convention. Given the nature of the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and the reasons for which it has found a violation of that Article, the Court considers that in the present case the most appropriate way of repairing the consequences of that violation would be to reopen the proceedings complained of. As the domestic law allows such reparation to be made, the Court considers that there is no call to award the applicants any sum in respect of pecuniary damage (see Trgo, cited above, \u00a7 75).",

By virtue of that provision, in force between 1 January 1997 and 20 December 1999 (that is 2.5 years before the applicants filed their claim for the recognition of their right of ownership), the period between 6 April 1941 and 8\u00a0October 1991 could also be taken into account for the calculation of the number of years of adverse possession (see paragraph 27 of the judgment).

My understanding is that a complaint contains an allegation, and that it is characterised by the facts of the allegation. Furthermore, the Court can, in my opinion, recharacterise the facts, or better: the complaint, by considering that the complaint is to be examined under another Article or paragraph than the one relied upon by the applicant. By contrast, however, it seems to me that the Court cannot \u201ccreate\u201d a new complaint not invoked by the applicant (see Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 172).",

The allegations should also be the same. In my opinion, this is not the case here.",
