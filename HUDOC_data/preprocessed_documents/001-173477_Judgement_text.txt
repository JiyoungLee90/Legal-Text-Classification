It considered all the transactions with the flat to be void and ordered the transfer of the title to the flat to the City of Moscow and the applicant’s eviction.

The court established that S. had died intestate with no surviving kin and that the flat should have been considered bona vacantia. The court ruled that the case fell under one of the two exceptions to the protection of a bona fide purchaser’s title, which required that precedence be given to the previous owner who had been deprived of the property against his or her will. The applicant’s title to the flat was annulled and the title was transferred to the City of Moscow.

.  On 26 April 2012 the Perovskiy District Court of Moscow found P. guilty of several counts of fraud and sentenced him to five and a half years’ imprisonment. In particular, the court established that P., acting in concert with other persons whose identity was not known, had fraudulently acquired N.’s flat and sold it to the first applicant on the basis of a forged will. The court also found that the flat was bona vacantia which therefore vested in the State and, by having fraudulently acquired title to it and then sold it to the first applicant, P. had caused damage to the State.
.  On 25 June 2012 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 26 April 2012 on appeal.
