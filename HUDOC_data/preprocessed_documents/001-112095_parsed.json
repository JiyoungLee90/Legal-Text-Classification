No evidence of any injury to the police officers was adduced. Even conceding that the police officers might have needed to resort to physical force to prevent the applicant\u2019s interference with the search they were to conduct, it is obvious that the beatings the police officers subjected the applicant to were not conducive to the desired result, that is, facilitating the search.
