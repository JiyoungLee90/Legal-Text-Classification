Furthermore, the Government drew attention to the fact that no uptodate information had been provided on Mr D.\u2019s situation since March 2001 and that there was no indication that the applicant had made contact with Mr D. since that date with a view to resolving jointly the problem of his deregistration. Referring to the Court\u2019s decision in Siebert v. Poland ((dec.), no. 40328/98, 25 May 2004), the Government emphasised that Mr\u00a0D. was free to register as permanently resident at any other place where he was deemed to have met the permanent place of residence requirements specified in the relevant legal provisions. Without any further substantiation, the Government also claimed that, assuming that Mr D. was destitute, in order to be able to deregister as permanently resident at the applicant\u2019s house, he could seek to re-register as permanently resident at one of the numerous humanitarian establishments located all over the country. Referring to the Court\u2019s judgment in Chapman v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 27238/95, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2001I), the Government further argued that neither Article 8 nor any other provision of the Convention guaranteed housing of a particular standard or at all. Finally, with reference to the Court\u2019s decision in V\u00e1clav\u00edk v. Slovakia ((dec.), no.\u00a041372/98, 30 September 2003), the Government maintained that the Contracting States were free to regulate the registration of their citizens.

Her situation was thus plainly unresolvable in . The applicant conceded that the problems concerning the household waste charges and social contributions towards dwelling costs had eventually been resolved, but only after she had been forced to explain the circumstances to the relevant authorities, a situation which she had found distressing. The applicant considered that, as a lawabiding citizen, she was entitled to peace of mind as to whether she complied with all of her civic duties and obligations. The current state of affairs, however, left her in a constant state of uncertainty in this respect and she was disturbed by having to explain it repeatedly. Furthermore, the applicant claimed that the fact that official mail was being sent to Mr D. at her address and that the police had visited her house in search of him had upset her, and that the latter incident had damaged her reputation among her neighbours. In the circumstances, it was possible that the police could come again and that they could even conduct a search of her home. As it had been impossible to sell the house, she was forced to live in it with her former husband, which also disturbed her privacy. The applicant concluded that the above annoyances amounted to an interference with her rights as protected under Article 8 of the Convention. The disputed registration was in fact inaccurate and could not have any legitimate justification. Finally, the applicant submitted that, as there was an apparent flaw in the applicable legislation, the problem was of a general character and concerned a large number of people.",

That Mr D.\u2019s deregistration from the applicant\u2019s house is possible thus appears to be a question of fact rather than a question of law. The Court does not find it established that Mr D. can set up a new permanent place of residence within the meaning of the Registration of Citizens\u2019 Place of Residence Act of 1982 in a humanitarian establishment, or that there is a lawful means for compelling Mr D. to register elsewhere if his economic position does not permit him to do so.",

The Court observes, however, that even in the absence of any direct interference by a public authority, the obligation to secure the effective exercise of Convention rights imposed by Article 1 of the Convention may involve positive obligations on a State and that these obligations may require the adoption of measures to protect Article 8 rights even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see, for example, X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23, Series A no. 91, and Whiteside v. the United Kingdom, no. 20357/92, Commission decision of 7\u00a0March 1994, Decisions and Reports 76-A, p. 80).

It further finds that this interference derived directly from the provisions of the 1982 Act, which only permitted a former resident of a house to remove his or her name from the register where that person had established a new permanent place of residence elsewhere, which in the present case Mr D. was unable to do. The Court notes that the Government have not advanced any argument in terms of the public interest to justify the system under the 1982 Act, whereby the official registration of a permanent place of residence does not correspond to the actual situation. In these circumstances, the Court finds that no fair balance has been struck between the interests of the applicant and those of the community and that there has, in consequence, been a failure in the domestic legal system to secure the applicant\u2019s rights to respect for her private life and home under Article 8 of the Convention.",
