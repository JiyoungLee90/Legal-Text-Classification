The Ministry established a number of procedural irregularities in the proceedings conducted by the Centre, including the fact that the contact agreement of 29 January 2002 had included neither all the necessary elements nor an enforceability clause, and thus could not be enforced. It was also found that the parents had not been engaged in appropriate counselling activities provided by the Centre and that J.G.\u2019s request for less frequent contact, which had been motivated by the applicant\u2019s aggression, should have been properly evaluated, and that in conducting that evaluation the applicant should have had a more open opportunity to present his views and an assessment should have been made of whether S. had in fact been exposed to any aggression on the part of the applicant.

On 9 July 2004 an expert panel appointed by the Celje Social Work Centre proposed that contact supervised by a competent professional should proceed after the summer holidays and that a psychologist should be appointed to assess S.\u2019s emotional and behavioural state and possible trauma in relation to her parents. On 15 July 2004 the social worker assigned to the case visited S. at home. She stated that she did not wish to have any contact with the applicant for at least two years and that she also did not wish to have any more contact with the social workers or other professionals involved in the case. Nevertheless, S., the applicant and J.G. attended an interview with the psychologist, M.B. In her report of 6\u00a0November 2004, M.B. established that it would not be possible, at that time, to achieve a balance between S.\u2019s desire not to see her father and the preservation of an emotional connection with him. The level of conflict between the two was so deeply rooted that it was not possible to expect any closeness and confidence to develop between them.

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 180, ECHR 2006V, and the cases cited therein). The Court notes that the audit of the Maribor Social Work Centre only covered the period from 5\u00a0September 2001 to March 2004 at the latest, whereas the child contact proceedings continued until 10 April 2009 (see paragraph 93 above). Moreover, the audit, while addressing certain procedural irregularities in the work of the centre, contained no conclusions pertaining to the applicant\u2019s complaints adduced before the Court. Finally, no measures taken as a result of the audit could have had any bearing on the applicant\u2019s individual position, as his case was transferred to the Celje Social Work Centre less than a month after he had received the Ministry\u2019s audit report (see paragraph 51 above). The applicant can therefore still claim to be a victim of the alleged violation of Article 8 in respect of the child contact proceedings.",

The Court therefore agrees with the applicant that although he did not appeal against a few procedural and interim decisions adopted in the administrative and non-contentious child contact proceedings, these decisions had a very limited and transitory effect on the overall course of the proceedings, which were of great complexity.

It is true that, having succeeded with his supervisory appeals under the 2006 Act, the applicant could have subsequently claimed compensation under this Act (see paragraph 102 above). However, the Court has already held that the remedies introduced by the 2006 Act specifically concern the right to have one\u2019s case examined within a reasonable time, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, but do not address situations in which the excessive length of proceedings is examined in terms of interference by the State with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8, in view of the positive obligations of the State under that provision (see Eberhard and M. v.

Having regard to the fact that the applicant sought redress for the alleged violations of his rights under Article 8 by using the available remedies in the divorce, child custody and maintenance proceedings and the child contact proceedings and therefore exhausted all the possibilities available to him in the course of family law proceedings, the Court considers that he was not required to embark on another attempt to obtain redress by using the civil remedies cited above, and therefore also rejects this objection made by the Government.",

In this regard, the Government noted the findings of a number of psychologists, according to which S. had been evaluated as mature for her age and resolute in her thinking and expression. Two experts had assessed her rejection of the applicant as genuine and not the result of external manipulation; they had noted that the level of conflict between the applicant and S. was so severe that she could not have, at the time, re-established an emotional connection with her father.

The competent authorities had dealt with the case on a regular, sometimes almost daily basis. However, the applicant\u2019s actions, such as the constant flow of criminal and other complaints about the work of the social work centres\u2019 employees and the judges deciding the case and complaints to various institutions and authorities of irregularities in the proceedings had created deadlock in the proceedings, as the officials were more engaged in writing reports in response to the inquiries of to those institutions than in carrying out their main role of deciding on the contact arrangements. Moreover, his numerous applications for the disqualification of officials and motions for the institution of disciplinary proceedings against them had resulted in delays, as the main proceedings could only continue after the competent authorities had decided on the issue of disqualification or disciplinary action. Further delays in the child contact proceedings had been caused by the applicant\u2019s failure to attend interviews and oral hearings which had had to be rescheduled and his request for the transfer of jurisdiction to another social work centre. Finally, the proceedings had been delayed for long periods of time due to the applicant\u2019s two requests for the appointment of new psychologists, the late payment of fees for their appointment and the applicant\u2019s subsequent failure to cooperate with either of the psychologists.",

In this regard the Court would first point out that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited and that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply that law (see, for example, Eriksson v.

Based on J.G.\u2019s request for a revised contact schedule, on 15 November 2002 the Maribor Social Work Centre issued an order restricting contact to one four-hour session a month. It is evident from the case file that the monthly sessions were likely to lead to conflict between the applicant and S., and that some of them were not attended by S. On 15 September 2003 the applicant sought modification of the decision of 15 November 2002 in order to have more frequent contact with his daughter. In this set of proceedings involving a number of experts, interviews with the concerned parties and oral hearings an interim order was issued on 22 March 2005 prohibiting contact between the applicant and S., which on 19 July 2006 was followed by a first-instance administrative decision confirming the prohibition of contact. On 19 March 2007 this decision was set aside by the Ministry and the case was transferred to the competent district court. On 10\u00a0September 2008 the court decided not to set up a contact schedule; however, this decision was later set aside by the higher court. Finally, on 25\u00a0February 2009 the applicant withdrew his request for setting up a contact schedule due to his daughter\u2019s approaching the age of majority.",

This was reflected in the subsequent psychological assessment of November 2004, according to which the level of conflict had progressed to the point where it was not possible to expect any development of mutual confidence. In this respect, the Court regrets that the proposed contact sessions to be supervised by a third party were not implemented immediately upon their recommendation in March 2004; however, the continuing rapid decline of the relationship in the months thereafter (see paragraphs 48 and 53 above) renders it difficult to conclude that a faster response from the authorities would likely have resulted in a considerable improvement of the situation. In addition, in the interviews with the social workers and psychologists S., then aged thirteen, categorically expressed a negative, even hostile attitude towards the applicant, which was confirmed by his own accounts of their contact. Thus, the authorities established that continued forced contact would cause harm to S.\u2019s emotional and personal development and on 22 March 2005 suspended contact by an interim order followed, on 19 July 2006, by a decision on the merits. Although this decision was set aside by the Ministry for failure to examine the possibility of re-establishing contact before deciding to prohibit it, the Court observes that S. had been interviewed two weeks prior to the decision, and her attitude to contact remained unchanged.",

From the point of view of substantive law, both types of procedures were intended to decide on the contact between a child whose parents were separated and a parent who did not reside with his or her child and thereby enable them to exercise their right to contact.",

The applicant was able to participate effectively in both types of proceedings: he could attend hearings, submit evidence and comment on the submissions of the other party, and he also had the right to appeal. Furthermore, it must also be reiterated that the administrative decisions adopted by the social work centres were subject to judicial review before three levels of jurisdiction and that the applicant\u2019s right of access to court was in no way impaired.",
