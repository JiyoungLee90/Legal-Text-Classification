Thereafter, the prosecutors and the courts put forward the same grounds or did not put forward any grounds whatsoever for maintaining the applicant's detention but simply stated that the previously chosen preventive measure was the correct one. However, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires that, after a certain lapse of time, the persistence of a reasonable suspicion does not in itself justify the deprivation of liberty and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention (see Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 80, 21 December 2000, and I.A.\u00a0v.\u00a0, no. 28213/95, \u00a7 102, Reports of Judgments and Decisions\u00a01998-VII).

No such reasons were given by the courts in the present case. Furthermore, at no stage did the domestic courts consider any alternative preventive measures instead of detention on remand, and by relying essentially on the gravity of the charges, the authorities extended the applicant's detention on grounds which cannot be regarded as \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d.",
