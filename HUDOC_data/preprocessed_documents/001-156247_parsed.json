It is particularly notable in this respect that in its decisions not to institute criminal proceedings the prosecutor\u2019s office explicitly acknowledged that such measures had not been taken because the investigative procedure chosen by them, the pre-investigation enquiries, did not allow for this (see paragraphs 38 and 34 above).",
