He submitted that the condition of the laboratory when it was searched on 13\u00a0December 2000 showed that it had not been used recently. Thus the trial court was wrong to conclude that the applicant had been committing an offence continuously up to 15\u00a0December 2000 and to apply the more severe legal regulation that entered into force on 12\u00a0December 2000.",

The court considered that the police had secured in his laboratory large quantities of substances for the production of narcotics, with appliances which had not been dismantled and showed signs of recent use.

As the Court has stated on a number of occasions (see, among other authorities, L\u00fcdi, cited above, p.\u00a021, \u00a7\u00a047), it may prove necessary in certain circumstances to refer to statements made during the investigative stage.
