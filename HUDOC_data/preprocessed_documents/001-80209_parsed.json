It had been established that the applicant had been involved in the importing of these ten kilograms of cannabis long before 6 September 1996. According to the Supreme Court, the telephone conversations between H. and the applicant had not therefore had any impact on the receipt by the applicant of the imported narcotics. Thus, the involvement by J.M. and J.O. could not be regarded as having had any causal relation with the offence of which the applicant had been convicted. In order to convict someone of incitement to commit an offence it was a pre-condition that the offence had actually been committed.

In the light of the Court of Appeal judgment the essence of the application as regards fairness was the lack of an oral hearing or any hearing at all of the parties before the Court of Appeal. Both the applicant and the prosecutor were equally surprised at the grounds and justifications given by the Court of Appeal in the first set of proceedings. In such circumstances, the reservation made by  was not the key element as the reservation could not be interpreted, as suggested by the Government, as a general reservation regarding the fairness of the Court of Appeal proceedings. Since it decided not to hold an oral hearing, the Court of Appeal was under an obligation to secure the fairness of the proceedings by other means. The applicant was convicted on the basis of evidence that had not been relied upon by the prosecutor in the District Court nor by the Court of Appeal.

Encouraged by them, H. had later ordered one kilogram of cannabis and agreed to meet the applicant the same night in order to make the purchase. H. had co-operated with the police of his own free will. He had called the applicant once on 6\u00a0September and three times on 8 September 1996. At the material time, there had been no provisions of law on the use of induced deals, nor on other unconventional investigation methods. Domestic law did not provide for the possibility of dropping charges in cases where an accused had been induced by the police to commit an offence. The offender was responsible for the offence irrespective of any incitement. In assessing the fairness of a trial, incitement by the police could only be relevant in a situation where \u201can otherwise law-abiding citizen\u201d would not have committed the offence without being induced by the police. In the present case, the allegation about police incitement had been subject to thorough scrutiny by courts at three levels of jurisdiction in two separate sets of proceedings, in both of which the essential question had been whether the applicant would have committed the offence had he not been induced into doing so. In addition, the Supreme Court had examined the issue in the re-opening case. The outcome of all these proceedings had been the same; the courts had found that the applicant had had, prior to the police involvement, an arrangement to receive the narcotics. The applicant had been convicted of several narcotics offences committed before the offence subject to dispute.

Subsequently, they had refused to produce the telephone metering information, which would have helped to clarify the chronology of events, and had thus been directly relevant to the assessment as to whether the offence had taken place before or after the police involvement. The information as to the time of the first call had been essential. He had had no other way of obtaining this information than from the police. By the time the County Administrative Board had delivered its decision, the deadline for the appeal to the Court of Appeal had expired. Moreover, on 25 April 1997 he had learned that the material he had received was inadequate. In fact, the full telephone metering information had never been disclosed to him. From the defence point of view the decisive moments of criminal proceedings were during the pre-trial investigation and the District Court proceedings. If during that phase the defence had not been given all the relevant information, it was in general futile to discover such information after the expiration of the time-limit for appeal. The County Administrative Board had held that the police had acted wrongly in withholding the information. In fact, its reasoning transferred the burden of proof to the Government regarding the violation of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03(b). The granting of equality-of-arms only after an appeal to the Court of Appeal had been filed had not sufficed to compensate the violation that had already taken place.

Their pre-trial statements, which had been regarded by the Court of Appeal as decisive, had not been read out at the District Court hearing. During the hearing they had only acknowledged the charges against them and the prosecution had not put any questions to them.

Accordingly, the County Administrative Board had annulled the police's decision not to disclose the telephone metering information and ordered it to be submitted to the applicant. It had found that the information was secret, but as a party to the proceedings he had a right to be informed of documents which might affect his case. It had considered that, from an objective point of view, the relevance of the requested information could not be excluded and that it was a matter for the defence to decide which facts to rely on. The applicant had finally obtained the information and although the relevant time-limit for appeal had expired, he had submitted further material to the Court of Appeal.

The Court reiterates that, although the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law, the requirements of a fair criminal trial under Article 6 entail that the public interest in the fight against crime cannot justify the use of evidence obtained as a result of police incitement (see Teixeira de Castro, cited above, pp. 1462-63, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03436). In Teixeira\u00a0de\u00a0Castro the Court found that the activities of the two police officers had gone beyond that of undercover agents, in that they had not \u201cconfined themselves to investigating the applicant's criminal activity in an essentially passive manner\u201d, but had \u201cexercised an influence such as to incite the commission of the offence\u201d. Their actions had \u201cgone beyond those of undercover agents because they had instigated the offence and there was nothing to suggest that without their intervention it would have been committed\u201d (ibid., pp. 1463-64, \u00a7 38-39). In arriving at this conclusion the Court laid stress on a number of features of the case before it, particularly the facts that the intervention of the two officers had not been part of a judicially supervised operation and that the national authorities had had no good reason to suspect the applicant of prior involvement in drug trafficking: he had no criminal record and there was nothing to suggest that he had a predisposition to become involved in drug dealing until he was approached by the police (ibid., p.1463, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38).",

The Court notes that the police officers' intervention did not take place as part of an operation ordered and supervised by a public prosecutor. Nor was there any legislation concerning induced deals. Further, the police did not suspect that the applicant was a drug trafficker; on the contrary, he had no criminal record and no preliminary investigation concerning him had been opened. Indeed, he was not even known to the police officers, who came into contact with him only through the intermediary H. Furthermore, the drugs were not at the applicant's home; he obtained them from a third party who had in turn obtained them from other persons. At the time of his arrest, the applicant did not have more drugs in his possession than the quantity H. had requested. The Court has doubts whether there was convincing evidence to support the Government's argument that the applicant was, at the time of H.'s first call from police custody, predisposed to commit the offence in question. While it is true that the applicant subsequently admitted having committed narcotics offences earlier that year, what is relevant is that there was nothing to directly bind him to the offence now in question.

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest.

The applicant learnt about this by chance at a late stage of the District Court proceedings. Defence counsel informed the Helsinki District Court that he had requested the police to produce the telephone metering information as regards calls from and to the applicant's mobile telephone but that it had not yet been granted (see paragraph 21 above). The police clearly opposed the applicant's attempts to have the extent to which the police had been involved in the matter cleared up as they made an application to the Espoo District Court for an order authorising them not to disclose to the applicant that his telephone had been under surveillance. Permission not to inform the applicant that his mobile telephone had been under surveillance was granted. Given the reasons provided and the circumstances in which the police had operated, it transpires that the police were unwilling to reveal the true course of their actions which may have resulted in the applicant's committing a criminal offence. It appears that the police had given the Espoo District Court the false impression that the applicant was not even aware that his telephone had been under surveillance in the first place (see paragraph 22 above). The next day the police informed the applicant of the decision, declining to disclose the records of surveillance. The defence made a second request on 29\u00a0November and a third request on 2 December 1996 that the District Court order the police officer in charge of the investigations, Superintendent J.M., to produce the telephone metering information at the next hearing. The prosecutor, having submitted that the allegation about the calls made from police custody appeared to be true and that he did not rule out the possibility that the only reason the applicant took possession of the cannabis was the call from H., the defence rested their case (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above).",

Whilst it is clear that Article 6 \u00a7 2 governs criminal proceedings in their entirety, and not solely the examination of the merits of the charge (see, for example, Minelli v. Switzerland, judgment of 25\u00a0March\u00a01983, Series A no. 62, pp. 15-16, \u00a7 30; Sekanina v. Austria, judgment of 25\u00a0August 1993, Series A no. 266-A; and Allenet de Ribemont v.

Once an accused has properly been proved guilty of that offence, Article 6 \u00a7 2 can have no application in relation to allegations made about the accused's character and conduct as part of the sentencing process, unless such accusations are of such a nature and degree as to amount to the bringing of a new \u201ccharge\u201d within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 2 (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 37-38, \u00a7 90).",

That reiteration thus appeared in a judgment which was separate from the case against the applicant. Accordingly, the Court finds that no sufficient link has been established between the first and the second set of proceedings which could justify extending the scope of the application of Article 6 \u00a7 2 to the latter. The fact that the Supreme Court altered the wording in question (see paragraph 50 above) does not detract from this position.",
