The principal issue relevant for the ruling in the case was the amount of compensation to be paid by the defendant. Even the fact that the court had to obtain expert evidence in order to estimate the damage could not in itself render the case complex. The Court concludes that the character of the factual and legal issues to be considered by the court do not warrant the opinion that the case was complex.",

It is true that the applicant committed a mistake in that he originally lodged his action against a natural person, the manager of the State-owned farm, and not against State entity. However, in the Court's opinion, the rectification of such a procedural error should not have lasted a whole year.

Therefore it took eighteen months to consider the request of the applicant to have legal aid granted. It is true that the applicant appealed three times against the refusals given in these proceedings. However, the decisions given by the first-instance court were twice subject to reconsideration by the appellate court. Pursuant to the provisions of Polish law, in appeal proceedings, the second-instance court orders reconsideration of the first-instance decision if it finds that the lower court failed to examine properly the relevant evidence. Thus, the lack of diligence on the part of the Koszalin Regional Court in examining the applicant's financial situation made it necessary to consider the legal aid issue twice.
