It is primarily on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the established facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court must determine whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Assenov and Others v.

France, judgment of 17 March 1997, Reports 1997 II, \u00a7\u00a043; Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7\u00a043). Expectation of a heavy sentence and weight of evidence may be relevant but are not as such decisive and the possibility of obtaining guarantees may have to be used to offset any risk (see Baginski v. Poland, no. 37444/97, \u00a7 72, 11 October 2005). In this connection, the Court also observes that although in the instant case the applicant\u2019s lawyer had suggested giving a guarantee to the domestic court, it appears from the case file that this proposal was never taken into consideration by the national courts. The domestic authorities have thus failed to mention any factual circumstances capable of showing the existence of a danger of the applicant\u2019s absconding.\u00a0Secondly, the authorities have never referred to any previous convictions which could give a ground for a reasonable fear that the applicant might commit a new offence if released (see Toth v. Austria, judgment of 12 December 1991, Series A no. 224, \u00a7 70). As regards the danger posed to the public, this argument does not appear in itself a persuasive consideration in the circumstances of the present case (see Romanov v. Russia, no. 63993/00, \u00a7 94, 20 October 2005).\u00a0The Court also notes that although, in general, the expression \u201cthe state of evidence\u201d may be a relevant factor for the existence and persistence of serious indications of guilt, in the present case it cannot alone justify the length of the detention of which the applicant complains (see Letellier, cited above; Tomasi v. France, judgment of 27 August 1992, Series A no. 241-A; Mansur v. Turkey, judgment of 8\u00a0June 1995, Series A no. 319-B, \u00a7 55).",
