It notes that both domestic court judgments clearly make mention of the reasonable time requirement invoked by the applicants. This was so notwithstanding that the applicants\u2019 pleas were mostly based on the fact that they did not consider the LAB\u2019s decision conclusive and that the constitutional jurisdictions seemed to have addressed only that aspect and not to have taken into consideration the twenty years it took the authorities to come to such a decision. However, had they opted to do so, the constitutional jurisdictions could have found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in respect of the length of the proceedings and thereby provided, if need be, adequate redress. The Court therefore considers that, in relying on the reasonable time requirement under Article 6 before the constitutional jurisdictions, which did not reject the applicants\u2019 claim on procedural grounds but examined to some degree the substance of the claim, the applicants made normal use of the remedies which were accessible to them and which related, in substance, to the facts complained of at the European level (see, mutatis mutandis, Zarb Adami v.\u00a0Malta (dec.), no.\u00a017209/02, 24 May 2005).",

Secondly, they complain generally about the amount of compensation determined. Therefore, in so far as the applicants\u2019 complaint is directed against the acts and omissions of the State in relation to the implementation of an entitlement to a compensatory measure vested in them under Maltese law - an entitlement which continued to exist after 23 January 1967 and still exists today - the Court has temporal jurisdiction to entertain the complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland (dec.) [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a075-76, ECHR 2002-X).

They further emphasised that exhaustion was not dependent on whether the domestic courts had understood the arguments submitted to them. Moreover, the applicants had not instituted civil proceedings to obtain the apportionment of the compensation because the civil courts in ordinary jurisdiction were not in a position to alter the amount of compensation determined by the LAB, and any division would have left them with an illusory amount of compensation.
