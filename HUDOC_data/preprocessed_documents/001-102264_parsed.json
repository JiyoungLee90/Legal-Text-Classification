The proceedings were, however, for reasons not explained to the Court, discontinued on 12 August 1992 (see paragraph 16 above). Subsequently, a motion requesting restitution of the entire property was lodged on 7 September 1992. The Court further notes that on 27\u00a0February 1995 the applicant requested to have a part of the property returned (see paragraph 27 above). The Court is of opinion that by lodging this request \u2013 and therefore asking for the property in question to be divided into two parts - the applicant wanted to simplify the procedure and in consequence, to accelerate the proceedings. It appears that the applicant's choice of legal action was indeed correct, as the decision returning a part of her property was already given on 12 November 1999. Accordingly, the applicant's motion of 28 May 2000 (paragraph 38 above) is to be seen as a consequence of her earlier choice of action (see paragraph 27 above) and not as a new motion initiating a different set of proceedings. The Court finds it immaterial that the proceedings were concluded with different decisions (see paragraphs 37 and 47 above), as the proceedings were initiated by a motion lodged on 8 February 1989, aiming at acquisition of the entire property in question. For those reasons the Court considers that the length of the proceedings should be assessed globally.",
