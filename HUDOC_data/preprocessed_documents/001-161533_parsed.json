Russia, no. , \u00a7 48, 7 October 2004). The Court is persuaded that the legislative removal of the first applicant\u2019s tobacco retail licence amounts to an interference with its right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions. However, this grievance could have effectively been remedied, in the circumstances, by granting a tobacco retail concession personally to the second applicant under the new rules. This is essentially so because the second applicant applied personally for a concession, in the family company\u2019s stead, only since legal persons were not eligible as such. The Court considers that the measure of control of use of property (see\u00a0V\u00e9kony, cited above, \u00a7 30) resulting, jointly, from the statutory removal of the first applicant\u2019s licence and the non-granting of a licence to the second applicant is most appropriately regarded as an occurrence affecting the second applicant. Therefore, the Court is satisfied that the second applicant can claim to be the victim of the violation alleged, whilst the first applicant cannot. In regard to the latter, the application is therefore is incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 4.",
