Switzerland, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no.\u00a0140, p. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, and Garcia Ruiz v. Spain [GC] no. 30544/96, ECHR 1999-I, \u00a7 28). Similarly, it is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law and the Court will not substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness. This principle applies, inter alia, to the application of procedural rules concerning the nomination of witnesses by parties (see Tamminen v. , no.\u00a040847/98, \u00a7\u00a038, 15 June 2004). In this connection, the Court further reiterates that it is not within its province to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the national courts. However, under the Court\u2019s case-law, the requirements of fairness of the proceedings include the way in which the evidence is taken and submitted. The Court\u2019s task is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety, including the way in which evidence was taken and submitted, were fair within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, inter alia, Dombo Beheer B.V. v.\u00a0the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0274, pp.\u00a018,19, \u00a7\u00a0 31.).",

This is borne out by the absence of detailed provisions such as paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 applying to cases of the former category. Thus, although these provisions have a certain relevance outside the strict confines of criminal law (see, mutatis mutandis, Albert and Le Compte v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 10 February 1983, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a058, p.\u00a020, \u00a7\u00a039), the Contracting States have greater latitude when dealing with civil cases concerning civil rights and obligations than they have when dealing with criminal cases (see Pitk\u00e4nen v. , no.\u00a030508/96, \u00a7\u00a059, 9 March 2004).",

Most significantly for the present case, it is clear that the requirement of equality of arms, in the sense of a fair balance between the parties, applies in principle to such cases as well as to criminal cases (see Feldbrugge v. the Netherlands, judgment of 29 May 1986, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a099, p.\u00a017, \u00a7\u00a044 and Dombo Beheer, cited above, p. 19, \u00a7 33). In that connection the Court considers that as regards litigation involving opposing private interests, equality of arms implies that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case - including his evidence - under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent. It is left to the national authorities to ensure in each individual case that the requirements of a fair hearing are met (see Dombo Beheer, cited above, p. 19, \u00a7 33).",

P. and \u0160. T. Later on, at the hearing held on 23 April 2003, the applicant withdrew her request that E. P. be heard, and proposed that the court hear evidence from further five witnesses, M. C., S. R., V. G., N. I. and N. Z. She stated that the relevance of their evidence was that they could provide information on the care provided to her by persons other than the defendants, who had undertaken an obligation to care for the applicant in order to acquire all her property post mortem. Thus, the evidence heard from these witnesses would, in the applicant\u2019s view, show that the defendants had failed to provide her with adequate care and hence had failed to fulfil their contractual obligations, which entitled the applicant to seek the termination of the contract in question.",

In this connection, the Court notes that the contract in question together with its annex was submitted by the applicant as an enclosure when her civil action was lodged on 23 October 2002. The receipts for payment were submitted by the defendants at the beginning of the trial and the parties\u2019 evidence was heard at the hearing held on 6 February 2003.",

The Court notes however that after that date four more witnesses called on behalf of the defendants were heard as follows: at the hearing held on 17 March 2003, in the absence of the applicant and her counsel, Lj. M. and \u0160. M., the parents of one of the defendants, were heard, while on the hearing held on 23 April 2003 R. P. and A. A. were heard.",

In this connection the Court observes that, although it is not its task to examine whether the court\u2019s refusal to admit the evidence submitted by the applicant was well-founded, in its assessment of compliance of the procedure in question with the principle of equality of arms which is a feature of the wider concept of a fair trial (see Ekbatani v.
