Accordingly, it was immaterial that, as submitted by the VCA, its decision complied with certain regulations adopted during the restitution process. The Court of Appeal considered that the first-instance court had correctly found that the forest on the plot given to I.B. was urban forest and therefore a forest of national importance, and thus property rights in respect of that part had to be annulled. However, it stated that when determining the area covered by forest the information had to be taken not from the Real Estate Register but from the Register of Forests (Mi\u0161k\u0173 kadastras), which was administered by the State Forest Management Service. According to the latter, the plot given to I.B. included 0.25 hectares of forest. The Court of Appeal therefore partly amended the decision and annulled I.B.\u2019s property rights to 0.25 hectares of land, as well as the applicants\u2019 rights to that part of the plot.

It noted that the presence of forest on the plot of land given to I.B. had been confirmed by the data in the Register of Forests. It also noted that that forest was included in the list of forests of national importance created in 2002 (see paragraph 12 above). The court observed that even though restoration of property rights was a continuous process and included the preparation of various documents, the final decision to restore property rights had to comply with the law in force at the time of the adoption of that decision. It concluded that the VCA\u2019s decision to give the plot to I.B. (see paragraph 13 above) had been contrary to the Constitution and other legislation providing that forests of national importance could only be owned by the State (see paragraphs 86, 88 and\u00a089 below). Accordingly, it annulled I.B.\u2019s property rights to 1.73\u00a0hectares of the land, as well as the applicants\u2019 rights to that part of the plot. The court observed that there was no dispute that I.B. had retained the right to restoration of his property rights, and the State was thus under an obligation to restore his rights to 1.73 hectares of land.",

It reiterated that, in line with the Constitution and the Law on Forests, urban forests were considered forests of national importance and could only belong to the State (see paragraphs 86, 88 and 89 below). The court also emphasised the importance of forests to the environment and the obligation of the State to protect them in the public interest. It then noted that the former village of Vaidotai had become part of the Vilnius city municipality in 1996 (see paragraph 10 above), so any forests within that area were urban forests. The court also observed that the forest given to the applicant and G.D. had been included in the list of forests of national importance approved by the Government in 2002 (see paragraph\u00a012 above). Accordingly, the VCA\u2019s decision to give that forest to the applicant and G.D. had been adopted after the forest had already become a forest of national importance (see paragraph 41 above). The court held that it was immaterial whether other administrative acts on which the VCA\u2019s decision had been based remained valid (see paragraph 44 above) because property rights had been restored to the applicant and G.D. by that decision and not by any other acts. The court therefore annulled the applicant\u2019s and G.D.\u2019s property rights to the 2.12 hectares of forest.",

In response to the applicant\u2019s argument that she had lost the opportunity to have her property rights restored (see paragraph 47 above), the Vilnius Regional Court stated that Lithuanian law provided for partial restitution, and that where it was impossible to restore property rights in natura, it could be done in other ways, including by monetary compensation (see paragraphs 92 and 97 below). Therefore, the court considered that the applicant had retained the right to have her property rights restored in one of the forms provided for by law.",

The applicant argued that if authorities or officials had acted unlawfully, the State should have to buy the land from her, and that the public interest should be protected without prejudice to her rights.",

It observed that even though the Real Estate Register did not contain information about the presence of forest on the applicant\u2019s land, it had been proven by the data provided by the State Forest Management Service. The court reiterated that forests of national importance could only be owned by the State (see paragraphs 86, 88 and\u00a089 below), and that forests situated in cities were considered forests of national importance, irrespective of whether they had been officially designated as such (see paragraph 102 below). It observed that the former village of Kry\u017eiokai had become part of the Vilnius city municipality in 1996 (see paragraph 10 above). Accordingly, the court held that the VCA\u2019s decision to restore the applicant\u2019s property rights had been unlawful and had to be annulled.",

In accordance with the Civil Code, J.S. was ordered to return 0.15 hectares of land to the State, and the applicant was ordered to return LTL 49,500 (approximately EUR 14,340) to J.S. (see paragraph 94 below). The court noted that the applicant had retained the right to restoration of her property rights, and that the restitution process had to be \u201ccontinued at the expense of the VCA or its successor, by finalising (and not starting afresh), in the same order of priority, the restitution process that had already begun\u201d. It accepted the applicant\u2019s argument that she might face financial difficulties as a result of having to return money to J.S. because she no longer had the necessary amount. The court gave the applicant six months from the date on which the decision became final to return the money to J.S. It observed that it had no authority to directly order the VCA to complete the restoration of the applicant\u2019s property rights within that period of time, but that \u201cthe activity of the VCA or its successor in the restitution process could constitute grounds for reducing the possible expenses of that institution, if [the applicant and J.S.] were found to have suffered losses as a result of unlawful acts established in the present decision ... and had to be compensated\u201d.",

It stated that the institutions responsible for adopting decisions on restoration of property rights had to verify whether all the conditions for restitution provided by law were complied with and, when deciding to restore property rights in natura, whether the property in question was not a type which could only belong to the State.

The Court is therefore satisfied that the decisions adopted by the VCA to restore the applicants\u2019 property rights to plots of land including urban forests did not comply with the aforementioned legislation, and the annulment of those decisions was therefore in accordance with the law. It is also satisfied that the requirement for the applicants, after their property rights had been annulled, to return the relevant plots to the State was in accordance with the law (see Article 1.80 of the Civil Code in paragraph\u00a094 above).",

It appears from the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling of 12 April 2012 (see paragraph\u00a0103 above) that, at the time when her property rights were annulled and she was ordered to return the money to the purchaser and return the plot to the State (see paragraphs 67, 68 and 70-73 above), the practice of the domestic courts was inconsistent. In some cases, the courts annulled all subsequent transfers of the property and ordered the parties to return to the other what they had received from the transaction (like in the fourth applicant\u2019s case), whereas in other cases, the courts held that the State had to reclaim the property from the final purchaser. The Supreme Court decided to harmonise the case-law and adopt the latter position (see paragraph\u00a0103 above). The Court takes note of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision; it also reiterates that divergence of case-law, in itself, cannot be considered contrary to the Convention (see Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a013279/05, \u00a7 51, 20\u00a0October 2011).

In this connection, the Court reiterates that it is not its task to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as such errors may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7\u00a028, ECHR 1999-I, and Jantner v. Slovakia, no. 39050/97, \u00a7 32, 4\u00a0March\u00a02003). In other words, the Court cannot question the assessment of the domestic authorities unless there is clear evidence of arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia (striking out) [GC], no.\u00a060654/00, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2007\u2011I). It therefore considers that in the present case it was primarily the role of the domestic courts to establish whether the applicants\u2019 land included forests and whether those forests were of national importance, in accordance with domestic law. The Court cannot overlook the fact that in some of the applicants\u2019 cases different public registers provided inconsistent information about whether their land was forested (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 67 above), or that the various authorities in charge of the protection of forests had not objected to the restoration of that land to the applicants (see paragraphs\u00a016, 43 and 65 above). However, the domestic courts held that the presence of forests on the applicants\u2019 land had been sufficiently established by the information provided by the State Forest Management Service (see paragraphs 23, 26 and 67 above). The courts also found that those forests were urban forests because the areas in which they were situated had become part of the Vilnius city municipality in 1996, and that they had been officially designated as forests of national importance in 2000 (see paragraphs 19, 26, 46 and 67 above). Having examined the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning, the Court cannot regard their findings as arbitrary and sees no reason to substitute them with its own assessment.",

At the same time, Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 to the Convention does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances (see Scordino v.\u00a0Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a095, ECHR\u00a02006V; Kozac\u0131o\u011flu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a02334/03, \u00a7 64, 19\u00a0February\u00a02009; and Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins v.

It observes that the Court of Appeal did not refer to any actions of the fourth applicant which might have demonstrated her bad faith, nor did it provide any relevant arguments why it had reached that conclusion with regard to the fourth applicant in a situation in which the only unlawful actions had been carried out by the authorities. The Court is not convinced that the fourth applicant (or any other applicants) should have questioned the actions of the relevant authorities instead of expecting the latter to take all measures to avoid mistakes in application of the legislation \u2013 especially taking into account the complexity and technical nature of the legal acts governing the process of restoration of land titles (see Misiukonis and Others v. Lithuania, no. 49426/09, \u00a7 60, 15\u00a0November 2016; see also the position of the Supreme Court of Lithuania in paragraph\u00a0103 above). Therefore, the Court concludes that all the applicants obtained their property in good faith, and thus should not have had to bear the burden of remedying the mistakes for which the authorities were solely responsible (see the references provided in paragraph\u00a0140 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that, contrary to the Government\u2019s submissions (see paragraph\u00a0129 above), it is immaterial for the assessment of the burden borne by the applicants how long they had owned the property in question before it was taken from them, or how much other property had been restored to them and not annulled.",

The Court is mindful that it is not its role to determine the best way for States to correct errors made by authorities in the process of restoring property rights (see Misiukonis and Others, cited above, \u00a7 63). However, it reiterates that the correction of those errors should not create disproportionate new wrongs (see the references provided in paragraph 140 above). In the present case, the Court agrees with the applicants that expecting them to undergo a lengthy additional process, without having regard to their particular situation and the reasons why they had lost the previously restored property, had been disproportionate (see also the Vilnius Regional Court\u2019s decision in the fourth applicant\u2019s case in paragraph 68 above).",

The Court observes that Lithuanian law provides several forms of restoration of property rights, including not only restitution in kind but also monetary compensation, compensation in securities and discharging liabilities to the State (see paragraph 92 above). It reiterates that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not guarantee the right to acquire property and it cannot be interpreted as imposing any general obligation on the Contracting States to restore property which was transferred to them before they ratified the Convention; nor does Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 impose any restrictions on the Contracting States\u2019 freedom to determine the scope of property restitution and to choose the conditions under which they agree to restore property rights of former owners (see Slivenko v. Latvia (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a048321/99, \u00a7\u00a0121, ECHR\u00a02002-II; Jantner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a034; and Kopeck\u00fd v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, \u00a7 35, ECHR\u00a02004IX). Accordingly, the Court considers that, after the applicants\u2019 property rights were annulled, Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 did not impose an obligation on the authorities to give the applicants new property in kind, but that they could have been compensated in any of the forms provided for by domestic law, in line with the principles established in the Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 142 above).",

However, the Court observes that from the end of 2013 the applicant\u2019s attitude was less cooperative \u2013 she did not attend the first two meetings to which she was invited (see paragraph\u00a058 above), she failed to send a properly authorised representative to the third meeting (see paragraph\u00a059 above), and at the fourth meeting she refused the plots offered to her, although the minutes did not indicate any reasons for the refusal (see paragraph 60 above).

Be that as it may, the Court considers that even if the applicant could be regarded as not having fully cooperated, the overall delay in the restitution process was nonetheless imputable to the authorities \u2013 in particular, it cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that no action at all appears to have been taken between November\u00a02013 and April 2016 (see paragraphs\u00a058 and\u00a059 above; see also the ruling of the Constitutional Court of Lithuania in paragraph 98 above).",

In several previous cases in which the applicants had failed to properly express their will as to their preferred way of restitution, the Court considered that payment of monetary compensation was compatible with the Convention (see Nekvedavi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania (merits), no.\u00a01471/05, \u00a7\u00a062, 10\u00a0December 2013, and Valan\u010dien\u0117 v.

In the Court\u2019s view, such explicit refusal distinguishes the fourth applicant\u2019s situation from that of the third applicant (see paragraphs\u00a0157 and\u00a0158 above) and other cases in which the applicants had failed to express their intentions but the Court nonetheless considered that the authorities should have proceeded with restitution irrespective of the applicants\u2019 will (see Nekvedavi\u010dius, \u00a7\u00a062, and Valan\u010dien\u0117, \u00a7 63, both cited above). It observes that the applicant herself effectively suspended the restitution process and any delays which followed after that cannot be considered the responsibility of the authorities. In this connection, the Court also reiterates that within the scheme of the Convention it is intended to be subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Burden v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013378/05, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2008; Austin and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09 and 2 others, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2012; and Sargsyan v.\u00a0Azerbaijan (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a040167/06, \u00a7\u00a7 29-32, 12 December 2017). It should therefore not be treated as the first-instance authority for restoring property rights, without allowing the domestic authorities an opportunity to do so.",
