The case originated in an application (no. 23261/13) against the Hellenic Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by fifty-seven applicants of various nationalities whose names appear in the annexed list. They were represented by Mr K. Tsitselikis and Mr A. Spathis, lawyers practising in Thessaloniki.
The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent’s delegates, Ms K. Paraskevopoulou and Mr. I. Bakopoulos, Legal Counsellor and Legal Assistant respectively to the State Legal Council. The Albanian and Italian Governments did not make use of their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention).
On 16 May 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were or are still detained in Ioannina Prison.
Of the applicants, the fourth was released on 11 March 2013 and the eighth was transferred to Alikarnassos Prison on 6 December 2012. The fifteenth applicant was released on 1 March 2013 and the twenty-first on 14 March 2013. The twenty-ninth, forty-ninth, fifty-fourth and fifty-seventh applicants were released on 28 February 2013, the forty-third on 11 March 2013, and the fiftieth on 7 March 2013, while the fifty-sixth was transferred to Amfissa Prison on 14 December 2012.
Additionally, the ninth, twenty-fifth, thirty-second and thirty-fifth applicants were released on 30 May 2013, the tenth and twenty-sixth applicants on 16 May 2013, the twelfth and forty-fourth applicants on 4 April 2013, the thirteenth on 28 May 2013, the sixteenth on 9 May 2013, the eighteenth on 14 June 2013, the nineteenth, twenty-second, twentyfourth, forty-first and forty-fifth applicants on 9 April 2013 and the twentieth on 23 May 2013. The thirty-fourth and fifty-third applicants were released on 31 May 2013, the thirty-ninth and forty-eighth on 26 April 2013, the fortieth and fifty-second on 30 April 2013, the forty-sixth on 10 April 2013 and the fifty-first on 11 April 2013.
The applicants alleged that the prison had held 235 prisoners but had only been designed for 85. There were four big cells measuring approximately 45 sq. m each, which had accommodated 32 detainees. There were also four smaller cells: cell no. 5 measured 16 sq. m and had accommodated 20 detainees, cell no. 6 was 12 sq. m and had held 10 detainees, cell no. 7 had an area of 16 sq. m and had housed 20 detainees while cell no. 8, which used to be laundry room, measured 10 sq. m and had accommodated 9 detainees. A corridor of 34.5 sq. m had accommodated 40 detainees.
The cells had had no tables or chairs. Inmates had been confined to their cells for seventeen hours a day as recreational or educational activities had not been provided. They had had to take their meals inside their cells.
There was not enough separation between prisoners serving sentences and those in pre-trial detention. Additionally, healthy prisoners had been held together with sick prisoners, resulting in exposure to contagious diseases. Inmates had to wash and dry their clothes and underwear in the toilet facilities, which further spread contagious diseases. Medical care had been inadequate, particularly as regards psychological health.
On 13 and 25 February 2013 the applicants and other prisoners lodged a complaint with the prison authorities about their conditions of detention, but received no reply.
The Government asserted that Ioannina Prison had four cells measuring 50 sq. m with two toilets each, one cell of 36 sq. m, two which measured 15 sq. m, one of 37.63 sq. m and two solitary confinement cells, each 8 sq. m in area. The dining room was 78 sq. m while the corridors had an area of 300 sq. m. At the time of the applicants’ application with the Court, the prison had held 210 to 230 detainees.
Extensive repair works had been carried out in 2012 throughout the prison facilities and all areas had been repainted, stools had been placed in the cells, and a bookcase, television and table tennis table had been added to the dining-room, which served several purposes. Moreover, a fully equipped gym had been built for detainees. The detainees’ daily schedule also included free time in the prison yard from 3 p.m. until half an hour before sunset. Numerous cultural events had been regularly organised for the inmates’ entertainment.
The cells had been regularly disinfected and cleaned on a daily basis. Ventilation and heating had been adequate in the cells and common areas. Appropriate standards of hygiene had been strictly observed and each new inmate was provided with clean clothing and blankets. All detainees had access to the prison infirmary and there were two general doctors, a dentist and three nurses. In emergencies, inmates were transferred to the Korydallos Prison Hospital or to an external hospital.
The relevant domestic law and practice is described in Kanakis v. Greece (no. 2) (no. 40146/11, §§ 62-68, 12 December 2013), and Chatzivasiliadis v. Greece (dec.) (no. 51618/12, §§ 17-21, 26 November 2013).
Following its visit to Greece in April 2013, the CPT published a report dated 16 October 2014 (CPT/Inf (2014) 26), in which the following is stated:
“105. Ioannina Prison, built in 1968, accommodated adult males who have been convicted to a sentence of less than five years or are on remand. With a capacity for 70 persons, it was holding 232 prisoners (130 on remand) at the time of the visit. In 2010, numbers had temporarily dropped to 190 inmates, but in general this facility has been holding between 200 and 250 prisoners, and on occasion even close to 300. The prison is formed by a single building, with an inner court yard that is used for outdoor exercise. The accommodation block consists of nine dormitories located on two floors.
In 2012, the European Court of Human Rights found that the conditions in Ioannina Prison amounted to degrading treatment, due to severe overcrowding and the resulting lack of space. Already in 2009, the Greek Ombudsman had noted that the dormitories and cells were “absolutely insufficient” for the number of inmates and that the living space per inmate was “absolutely intolerable”. Regrettably, the delegation found that overcrowding remained a massive problem, affecting all parts of the prison.
There are four large dormitories in Ioannina Prison, measuring some 50 m² which at the time of the visit were accommodating some 30 prisoners each. Five smaller dormitories, situated on the ground floor, measured between 15 m² and 32 m², and were accommodating between eight and 18 inmates. 176 prisoners were accommodated inside these nine dormitories, while the remaining 56 prisoners had to sleep in the corridors, several of them in bunk beds (some two to a bed), others on mattresses placed on the floor. There was a complete absence of privacy for the inmates placed in the corridors.
Notwithstanding the overcrowding, the large windows in the dormitories offered good access to natural light and sufficient ventilation, and artificial lighting was adequate. Further, the in-cell sanitary annexes (two showers, two toilets and two sinks) were fully partitioned. However, some of them were in a bad state of repair and had mould growing on the ceiling.
In sum, the conditions of detention at Ioannina Prison remained very much the same as described by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgment of Samaras and others.”
