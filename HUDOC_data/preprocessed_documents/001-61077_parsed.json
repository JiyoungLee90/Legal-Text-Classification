However, in case these should not be sufficient, screens would be erected where necessary regardless of the expected reductions at source. Further reductions were expected from the use of modern concrete sleepers instead of the conventional wooden ones on which the initial noise level assessments had been based. Finally, if the noise levels still turned out to be too high in practice, other measures would be considered, such as further modifications to rolling stock, avoiding operations at night and lowering maximum speeds. The standards to be applied, including those with regard to the accumulation of noise caused by the new railway and the A15 motorway, were those set out in Outline Planning Decision \u2013 Part 4. Stricter standards would be applied in the vicinity of sensitive locations such as hospitals and schools and certain designated rural areas (stiltegebieden \u2013 \u201csilent areas\u201d).

It further considered that it did not follow from the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act that where, like in the present case, a separate appeal lay against an outline planning decision, no routing decision could be taken before the outline planning decision had become final.

It was noted that there had been an additional study made in respect of areas where the concentration of the population, and therefore the group risk, was greatest. Moreover, the government had specified additional safety measures for these areas in its statement of defence, as well as specific ways of operating the railway so as to minimise the dangers attending the transport of dangerous goods. As to the individual risk, the routing decision provided that new development which would increase it within 30 m from the centre line of the track would be prevented; this made it unlikely that the individual risk would be increased further away from the track.

But more precisely the issue is what was the subject matter of the relevant proceedings. In this connection, the Court refers in paragraph 200 to the fact that the advisory opinion given on the Transport Infrastructure Planning Bill and the subsequent proceedings on the appeals brought against the routing decisions cannot be regarded as involving the same case or the same decision.

The advice concerns the procedure leading to the outline planning decision which is to form the basis of, and be transformed into, a draft routing decision.

The Act was designed to introduce a new legislative framework for large-scale transport projects of major national importance. It did so by, inter alia, simplifying procedures for securing the cooperation of provincial, regional and local authorities whose territories might be affected by the project and by restricting to a single appeal the legal remedies available to those objecting to decisions of national and local authorities.

In deciding whether in any given case there exists a legitimate ground to fear that the requirements of independence and impartiality are not met, the standpoint of a party is important but not decisive.

Having regard to the importance of the confidence which courts must inspire in the public, I consider that in such a case a broad rather than a strict legal approach should be taken to the question whether the proceedings on the appeals against the routing decision could reasonably be regarded as involving \u201cthe same case\u201d as that on which the members of the Council of State had already advised.",

While the issues on which the Council of State, in its capacity as advisory body to the government, was required to advise and those which, in its judicial capacity, it had to decide were clearly not identical and while the links between the two may be said to be more remote than those which were examined by the Court in Procola and McGonnell, I consider that those links were sufficiently strong to regard the proceedings before the Administrative Jurisdiction Division as relating to the same case and, thus, to give rise to doubts which were objectively justified.",

A strict and visible separation between the legislative and executive authorities on the one hand and the judicial authorities of the State on the other is indispensable for securing the independence and impartiality of judges and thus the confidence of the general public in its judicial system. Compromise in this area cannot but undermine this confidence.",

It is clear from the facts that the plans for the construction of the Betuweroute railway were contested as from the start and that the executive sought a way to simplify and shorten the planning procedures for this and other major transport infrastructure projects, which eventually resulted in the Transport Infrastructure Planning Act. In view of the explicit references to the Betuweroute railway in the two advisory opinions given by the ordinary councillors of the Netherlands Council of State on the Transport Infrastructure Planning Bill, it is obvious that the impact of this bill on the realisation of this project was taken into consideration by the ordinary councillors when they exercised the advisory functions of the Council of State.",

Had this been the case, there would have been no room for doubts as, unlike the ordinary councillors, the extraordinary councillors have only one function \u2013 namely, the administration of justice. An even better possibility to remove all doubts would of course be to incorporate administrative-law proceedings entirely in the regular judicial system by establishing either a separate administrative-law division at the level of the Netherlands Supreme Court or a separate administrative judicial authority as a final appeal body.",
