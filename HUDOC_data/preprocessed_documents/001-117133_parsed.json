This meant that the archived material which the tax authorities could demand to review included a great quantity of sensitive personal data. If the tax authorities were to be empowered to demand the copying of archives, the risk of dissemination and abuse of sensitive personal data would increase considerably beyond what followed from a review on the taxpayer\u2019s premises. This applied especially to the copying of electronic archives. The search facilities for an electronic archive were different from those used for a traditional paper-based archive. Even if electronically stored data were deleted, they could be reconstructed. Also, electronically stored data might be disseminated far more easily and effectively than information on paper. The right of the tax subject to be present when the tax authorities opened and reviewed the archive did not constitute a guarantee against abuse. There was no way of ensuring that that right had been respected. Therefore, weighty considerations of legal security and protection of privacy militated against conferring on the tax authorities a right to demand a copy of the archive. As the majority in Parliament had pointed out in the context of the legislative amendment in 1984, the requirements of legal security and protection of privacy were an overriding political aim in a democratic society. In particular, since the parliamentary majority had voted strongly against search and seizure, and since copying for subsequent review at the tax office was in reality a form of seizure, Mr\u00a0Justice Skog\u00f8y found that the tax authorities clearly should not be empowered to require a copy without the question being first considered by the legislator and a clear statutory power given for copying.",

The applicant companies disputed that the interference was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d. They argued that it had exceeded the wording of the relevant statutory provisions and that the law in question failed to fulfil the quality requirements in the Court\u2019s case-law. Moreover, the reasons relied on by the Supreme Court, although partly relevant, had not been sufficient to establish convincingly that the \u201cseizure\u201d of the backup tape had been necessary in a democratic society. There had been no effective safeguards against abuse. In any event, the interference could not be considered strictly proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. A significant proportion of the seized backup tape had contained information that was irrelevant for tax audit purposes and had included private material pertaining to employees and other persons working for the applicant companies. The Supreme Court\u2019s majority had underestimated the seriousness of the interference arising from the risk of spreading and misuse of sensitive personal data.",

In this connection they argued inter alia that contrary to Article 8 of the Convention the inspection lacked a legal basis in national law and that the copying could not be justified as proportionate or \u201cnecessary\u201d for the purposes of this provision (see paragraphs 32-36 above). In their additional written pleadings the applicant companies further clarified that their arguments drawn from Article 8 of the Convention were not new but had been raised previously (see paragraph 37 above). In the absence of any express indication to the contrary in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment or otherwise, the Court finds no reason to assume that the Article 8 plea was subsequently withdrawn or not pursued before the Supreme Court. Thus, the Court is satisfied that the applicant companies\u2019 grievances were sufficiently raised, expressly or in substance, to enable the Supreme Court to consider the matters now complained of under the Convention. Indeed, the Supreme Court did take the opportunity, albeit without reference to Article 8 of the Convention, to assess the applicable safeguards of various interests, including those in place for the protection of privacy (personvernhensyn). Accordingly, the applicants must be considered to have fulfilled the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

As had been pointed out by the minority of the Supreme Court, the provision was limited to \u201creview\u201d; to demand copies was far more interfering. When Parliament had authorised search and seizure in 1980, it had done so in order to ensure that important documents would not be hidden or deleted. If the authorities were to be empowered to copy the archive in question, it would mean conferring on them an authority over and above the intentions of Parliament in 1984 (see paragraph 58 above).

A number of factors indicated that the law was not sufficiently clear and precise. The tax authorities could easily have adhered to existing requirements by conducting the search on-site, limiting it to what was relevant for tax assessment purposes, and requiring the production of any documents necessary for those purposes. The fact that the \u201cseizure\u201d of the backup tape related to large amounts of data, including personal e-mails and lawyer-client correspondence, and affected the important interests of a wide group of persons, suggested a strict requirement of precision. The \u201cseizure\u201d had been planned and executed as a \u201cdawn raid\u201d and had been coercive in nature owing to the pressure that had been brought to bear on the applicant companies to surrender the backup tape.

So would, in the view of the Supreme Court majority, a requirement enabling the authorities to obtain copies of documents where a review of those copies appeared expedient. Nothing in the relevant rules prevented either such copying (see paragraphs 51 above) or the taking of a backup copy of the server to the tax authorities\u2019 premises for review there (see paragraphs 51-55 above).

It was not limited to accountancy documents but extended to all documents that might be relevant to the tax assessment (see paragraph 41 above). Considerations of efficiency of the tax audit suggested that the tax authorities\u2019 possibilities to act should be relatively wide at the preparatory stage (see paragraph 42 above).

This view finds strong support in Judge Skoghoy\u2019s dissenting opinion: \u201cThe fact that the taxpayer ... has the right to be present when the tax authorities open and conduct their review of the archive does not in any way guarantee against abuse. It would not be possible to control whether this right is being respected. Important legal protection and personal integrity considerations therefore argue against granting the tax authorities the right to demand copies of the archive\u201d.",

Of course, it was probably more convenient for the tax authorities to make a copy, but the disadvantages inflicted on all three applicants as well as their employees through the impugned measure far outweigh the alleged advantages which the authorities may have obtained by conducting an examination at their own premises. It is important to emphasise at this point that Kver and IOR, like the first audited company BLH, have found that significant amounts of important documents were copied and they expect these documents to be reviewed by the tax authorities.",

Employees and other people working for the applicant companies must also have such protection, where professional and private correspondence and a large volume of work-related documents, irrelevant to tax-audit purposes, are taken by the authorities and lie open for review in their premises.",
