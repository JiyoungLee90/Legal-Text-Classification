It had served the public interest as it had been ordered in order to safeguard public safety and to control the possession of arms by individuals. All States were entitled to control access to weapons as a fundamental power vested in them on the strength of their sovereignty. They were also under a positive obligation to ensure safety by way of licensing the possession of weapons. The States enjoyed a margin of appreciation in this regard. Under the Court\u2019s case-law the scope of this margin varied depending on the issue concerned in a case. The State\u2019s margin of appreciation in issues concerning arms control was particularly wide. A\u00a0requirement to obtain a licence to possess weapons fell within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation and could not be regarded as imposing an excessive individual burden on the applicant.

However, in the present case the court discontinued the criminal proceedings, finding that the seriousness of the alleged offence was negligible. The court had regard to the applicant\u2019s character and to the lack of criminal intent on his part (see paragraph\u00a017 above). The circumstances of the case were therefore fundamentally different from cases where confiscation orders were made in the context of criminal proceedings concerning charges of serious or organised crime and where there was a strong suspicion or certainty confirmed by a judicial decision that the confiscated assets were the proceeds of an offence (see Phillips v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a041087/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09-18, ECHR 2001-VII), which were deemed to have been unlawfully acquired (see Riela and Arcuri, both cited above, and Raimondo v.\u00a0Italy, 22\u00a0February 1994, \u00a7\u00a029, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0281-A) or were intended for use in illegal activities (see Butler v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a041661/98, 27\u00a0June 2002). Furthermore, the confiscation order concerned the entire collection, with no distinction being made between objects which could still be qualified as weapons within the meaning of the arms control legislation and those which, as the court acknowledged, had been disabled (see paragraph 18\u00a0above). The Court is of the view that in these circumstances the confiscation order covering the entire collection should be regarded as a deprivation of property.",

                        "content": "2.\u00a0\u00a0The violation in this case depends to an appreciable extent on the peculiar nature of three provisions of Polish law \u2013 Articles\u00a017 paragraph\u00a01(3), 39 and 100 of the Criminal Code (\u00a7\u00a7 29 and 30, above) \u2013 which, when applied in combination to the facts of the case, create a manifest imbalance between the public interest and the rights of the applicant. To be sure, in principle there appears to be nothing objectionable if a provision of law provides for the confiscation, or indeed, for the removal or the destruction, of an object the existence or possession of which is in breach of some provision of law even if the person concerned is acquitted of the criminal charge of illegal possession of that object. This was the general approach taken by the Court in Saliba v. Malta (no. 4251/02, 8 November 2005). This point is only very vaguely reflected in the last sentence of \u00a7 62 of the present judgment. In the instant case, however, we have neither an acquittal nor a conviction, but a discontinuation of the proceedings coupled with a judicial acknowledgment that the offence was of a \u201cnegligible\u201d nature in terms of seriousness \u2013 de minimis non curat praetor. In the present case this suffices for a finding of disproportionality, and this is where the Court\u2019s reasoning should, in my view, have stopped. In many jurisdictions trifling offences are dealt with, upon conviction, by a simple reprimand or admonition; on the contrary in this case the applicant had the benefit of not being found guilty annihilated for all practical purposes by the confiscation of a priceless collection. The domestic court\u2019s views on the character of the applicant and on \u201cthe lack of criminal intent on his part\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 46 and 17) are irrelevant (apart from the fact that it is not clear whether by criminal intent that court was referring to a specific intent or to motive; as the respondent Government rightly observed, the applicant, as a retired army commissioned officer and an expert on weapons, could not but have known that at least some of the weapons required licensing). The reasons contained in \u00a7\u00a7 52 to 57 are irrelevant to a finding of a breach of the Convention on the facts of the instant case.",

On the positive side, however, the decision in the instant case clearly departs from the case-law of the Court which, as a rule, has considered \u2013 wrongly in my view \u2013 confiscation pursuant to proceedings of a criminal nature as a measure of control of use of property rather than of deprivation (\u00a7 46, and the cases there referred to; see, more recently, Milosavljev v.\u00a0Serbia, no. 15112/07, 12 June 2012, \u00a7 53).
