Moreover, his decision had been upheld by the regional court without providing any additional arguments justifying the interference. The applicant submitted that the domestic law did not prohibit the possession of leaflets, the more so where they contained information that was in the public domain. There had been no evidence linking the applicant with the offence of illegally distributing leaflets; thus, the real aim of the search had been to intimidate him for no particular reason. In those circumstances it could not be said that it had pursued any legitimate aim.

The Court will assess in particular whether the reasons adduced to justify such measures were relevant and sufficient and whether there were adequate and effective safeguards against abuse (see, for example, Buck v.

Secondly, the Court must consider the particular circumstances of each case in order to determine whether, in the case at hand, the interference in question was proportionate to the aim pursued. The criteria the Court has taken into consideration in determining this latter issue are, inter alia: the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure were effected; the manner and circumstances in which the order was issued, in particular whether any further evidence was available at that time; the content and scope of the order, having particular regard to the nature of the premises searched and the safeguards implemented in order to confine the impact of the measure to reasonable bounds; and the extent of possible repercussions on the reputation of the person affected by the search (see Buck, cited above, \u00a7 45 and K.S. and M.S. v.\u00a0Germany, no. 33696/11, \u00a7 44, 6 October 2016).",
