On this point, it notes that the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s 2004 binding interpretative decision, which clarifies in respect of what facts compensation is due under this provision, refers to \u201cpretrial detention\u201d, a term taken from the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure and referring exclusively to one form of deprivation of liberty imposed in the course of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 36 above). However, in the case at hand the applicant was never placed in \u201cpretrial detention\u201d. He was first in police detention under section 70(1) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act (see paragraphs 13 and 31 above) and then in detention ordered by a prosecutor under Article 152a \u00a7 3 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, pending a judicial determination of whether or not he should be placed in \u201cpretrial detention\u201d (see paragraphs 17 and 34 above). When brought before a judge, he was released on bail (see paragraph 20 above). It thus seems unlikely that the domestic courts would have found that his deprivation of liberty fell within the ambit of section 2(2) of the SRDA and that he was entitled to compensation for it, despite his acquittal. The Government \u2013 who are under the burden of proving the effectiveness of the remedies which they invoke \u2013 have not pointed to any domestic court judgment under section 2(2) of the SRDA in which compensation has been awarded in such circumstances. The Court is therefore not persuaded that a claim under this provision can be seen as an effective remedy in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.",

It is clear from the domestic courts\u2019 caselaw and from the 2004 interpretative decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation that in examining claims under this provision these courts confine their attention to whether the persons concerned have been acquitted and prior to such acquittal placed in \u201cpretrial detention\u201d, and do not review whether they have been brought promptly before a judge who would rule on the initial need for their detention (see paragraphs 37 and 38 above).

By making an order to this effect the Pleven District Prosecutor\u2019s Office blatantly ignored the clear and unambiguous provisions of domestic law. It is not for the Court to speculate whether this happened because that Office was not aware of the March 2000 amendments to the 1968 Criminal Code or for other reasons. As regards the immediately preceding period, when the applicant was in police detention, the Court notes that section 70(1)(1) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act does not distinguish between privately and publicly prosecutable offences (see paragraph 31 above). However, it is apparent from the interpretation given to this provision by the  that the powers which it bestows upon the police are ancillary to their duty to investigate crime (see paragraph 32 above). It is clear that the police have no power to conduct preliminary investigations in respect of privately prosecutable offences such as insult. The applicant\u2019s police detention on this basis was therefore also unlawful.",

When examining the criminal charges against the applicant the Supreme Court of Cassation specifically found that these actions had been entirely peaceful, had not obstructed any passersby and had been hardly likely to provoke others to violence. On this basis, it concluded that they did not amount to the constituent elements of the offence of hooliganism and that in convicting the applicant the Pleven District Court had \u201cfailed to give any arguments\u201d but had merely made blanket statements in this respect (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above).

Exercising his powers under Article 152a \u00a7 3 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 34 above), the prosecutor ordered that he the applicant be detained for a further seventytwo hours, without giving any reasons why he considered it necessary, save for a stereotyped formula saying that there was a risk that he might flee or reoffend. It does not seem that when thus prolonging the applicant\u2019s detention the prosecutor took appropriate steps to ensure his immediate appearance before a judge, as mandated by the provision cited above (see paragraph 17 above). Instead, the matter was brought before the Pleven District Court at the last possible moment, when the seventytwo hours were about to expire (see paragraph 20 above).

The events must be seen in the context of a political debate which, although, critical of the Government, was not violent. Thus, as found by the Supreme Court of Cassation, the applicant\u2019s actions on 10 July 2000 were entirely peaceful, did not obstruct any passersby and were hardly likely to provoke others to violence (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above, and Steel and Others, cited above, \u00a7 110). However, the authorities in  chose to react vigorously and on the spot in order to silence the applicant and shield the Minister of Justice from any public expression of criticism. They also kept the applicant in custody for an inordinate amount of time \u2013 three days and twentythree hours \u2013 before bringing him before a judge who ordered his release. These measures were clearly not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the Government and of its members must be subject to close scrutiny by the press and public opinion. Furthermore, the dominant position which the Government and its members occupy makes it necessary for them \u2013 and for the authorities in general \u2013 to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, and the associated custodial measures, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of their adversaries (see, mutatis mutandis, Castells v.\u00a0Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 236).",
