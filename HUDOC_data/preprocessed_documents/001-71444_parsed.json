Equally, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 cannot be interpreted as restricting the freedom of Contracting States to choose the conditions under which they agree to restore property which was transferred to them before they ratified the Convention (see Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7 35). The enactment of laws providing for the restitution of confiscated assets or compensation of persons who suffered such confiscation requires a wide-ranging review of many moral, legal, political and economic issues. Finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has stated that it will respect the legislature's judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see James and Others [v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98], p. 32, \u00a7 46, and The former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2000XII). This logic applies particularly to such fundamental changes of a country's system as the transition from a totalitarian regime to a democratic form of government and the reform of the State's political, legal and economic structure, phenomena which inevitably involve the enactment of large-scale economic and social legislation (see Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7 149).",

The Court notes that this legislative development did not take place prior to the process of selling former owners' property, which would have been desirable, but in the course of that process (see paragraphs 23-32 above). This was likely to result, for example, in a situation where property which was sold because it was considered as \u201cnationalised by transfer of title\u201d at the time of its sale was in fact \u201cwithout title\u201d when assessed against later interpretations given by the Government, and this was undeniably a source of conflict when two different persons had competing legitimate interests in the same building: on the one hand, the former tenants, to whom the law had granted the right to acquire ownership of the property in which they lived, and, on the other, the former owners, whose properties were ordered to be returned at the close of proceedings for recovery of immovable property, upheld by the national courts in final decisions which were subsequently impossible to enforce in practice.",

In addition, on several occasions the Supreme Court refused to compare competing titles, holding that, where the courts had upheld the sale of someone else's property, this consolidated, ipso jure, the transfer of title to the property to the purchaser, an effect that could not be overturned by the comparison of titles (see paragraph 45 above).",

The Court reiterates that its sole duty, according to Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting States. In particular, it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see, in particular, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7\u00a028, ECHR 1999-I).",

The shifting definition of the concept of State title, which was crucial in determining whether the purchasers could have realised that the State was not the owner of the property at the time of its sale, and the lack of precision with regard to who was to take the reasonable steps to clarify the legal status of a building put up for sale by the State, were further aspects of this complexity. In the Court's view, these problems, which were not resolved by the courts examining the applicant's action to set aside the contracts of sale, probably reflected the general uncertainty which surrounded the definition and evaluation of good faith in domestic law.",

Nonetheless, the applicant cannot be criticised for not having immediately brought a third action for recovery of possession against the purchasers, given the human effort and financial resources involved in the two sets of proceedings he had already brought before the domestic courts, which also constituted appropriate remedies capable of providing redress for his complaints (see paragraph 69 above).",

In addition, it was no longer open to him to bring an action for recovery of possession against the purchasers under ordinary law (see paragraph 44 above). Even supposing that he could have brought such an action, his chances of success would have been uncertain, given the Supreme Court of Justice's consistent case-law, which systematically dismissed actions for recovery of possession where it found that the purchasers had acted in good faith (see paragraphs 45-48 above).",

The general uncertainty thus created had repercussions for the applicant, who was unable to recover his entire property, even though he had obtained a final judgment ordering the State to return it to him. Consequently, the State has failed to comply with its obligation to recognise the applicant's right to the effective enjoyment of his possessions as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, thus upsetting the \u201cfair balance\u201d between the demands of the public interest and the need to protect the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions (see, mutatis mutandis, Sovtransavto Holding, cited above, \u00a7 96).",
