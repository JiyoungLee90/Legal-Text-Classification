However, the domestic authorities did not take measures to remove that ambiguity. They failed to establish with sufficient clarity whether the applicant had sustained rib fractures and, if so, the time and other circumstances of those injuries.

In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force that has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Labita v.

It notes that the medical certificate of 26 August 2005, the only item in support of the applicant\u2019s allegation, was issued more than one year and five months after the alleged ill-treatment. The certificate was produced by a nephrologist whose principal area of expertise did not cover bone fractures. That doctor did not make any conclusive findings as to the fractured ribs but recommended a further examination by a traumatologist. Nor did he give any opinion as to the time when the possible injuries could have been caused or how they could have been sustained. To the extent that those questions remained unanswered because of the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to act, this matter has been examined under the procedural aspect of Article 3 and the Court has found a procedural violation of that provision of the Convention. As regards the substantive aspect of Article 3, the Court considers that the available material does not allow it to establish conclusively that the applicant sustained the fractured ribs or any other injuries when he was under the control of the authorities.",

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during questioning by police without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz v.

It is relevant to note that under the domestic law a minor suspect was entitled to mandatory legal representation (see Smolik, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032 and 56).

In substantiating the applicant\u2019s guilt in the murder, the domestic courts indeed \u2013 as contended by the Government \u2013made no express reference to the applicant\u2019s confession of 19 March 2004, let alone the other statements given on that day, which had no relevance in that context. However, the domestic courts neither expressly excluded the confession of 19 March 2004 from the case file, nor made any ruling as to its role in the applicant\u2019s conviction (see Khayrov v. Ukraine, no. 19157/06, \u00a7\u00a078, 15 November 2012). On the contrary, they referred to the applicant\u2019s self-incriminating statements which he made on 20 March 2004 in the presence of lawyer. In that regard it is notable that the applicant\u2019s questioning in the morning of 20 March 2004 started with the investigator\u2019s request to give details which the applicant had not explained in his confession of 19 March 2004. It appears therefore that that interview was in fact a direct development of his confession of 19\u00a0March 2004. In these circumstances the absence of any reference to the confession of 19\u00a0March 2004 does not rule out its effect on the applicant\u2019s conviction.",
