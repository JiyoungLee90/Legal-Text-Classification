It is not disputed between the parties that the writ of execution was received by the military unit and that in August 2005 the judgment was partially executed (see paragraphs 7-9 above). The applicant, having been unsatisfied with only partial enforcement, attempted to obtain an additional decision specifying the amounts to be paid under the initial judgment, a judicial decision clarifying the judgment of 29\u00a0March 2005 in that part, or a duplicate of the writ of execution \u2013 all with the view to be able to claim the outstanding amounts under the judgment of 29\u00a0March 2005. However, his requests were rejected (see paragraphs 10-12 above). In the view of the foregoing, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument, as it appears that the applicant took reasonable procedural steps in order to enforce the judgment in his favour (compare with Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v. Russia, nos. 10511/08 and 5866/09, \u00a7 29, 31\u00a0January 2012, and Li v.
