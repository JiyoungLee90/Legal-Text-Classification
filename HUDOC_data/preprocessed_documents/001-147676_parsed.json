Acting in the general interest did not exclude responsibility for making untrue statements. In the present case there was no evidence, in the form of either documents or witness statements, proving that Mr J.M. had indeed actively collaborated with the secret services. Therefore, in the light of the material collected in the case, the court concluded that the applicant had not proved the veracity of his statements.

According to the conclusion of this resolution a journalist\u2019s actions would not be considered illegal if they were made in the public interest and the duty to act with due diligence was fulfilled. Imposing an obligation on a journalist to prove the veracity of each statement would unjustifiably limit the freedom of the press in a democratic society. However, the Supreme Court considered that this approach could not be applied to the applicant\u2019s case as his statement had been of a private nature and the applicant could not be considered to be a journalist with a socially necessary duty to inform. Therefore, the interpretation of the law adopted by the lower courts was correct.

An untrue statement would remain illegal even if all efforts had been made to diligently collect and examine its factual basis.

The Court observes that the Supreme Court held a hearing on 10 September 2009 at which it announced the ruling and gave the main lines of reasoning orally (see paragraph 20 above). Subsequently, it was open to the applicant to apply to be served with a written copy of the full version of the reasons. The applicant\u2019s lawyer did that and on 30 November 2009 he received the judgment with the reasoning (see paragraph 21 above). While it is true that the written copy of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment was not served automatically, nevertheless this service was available to the applicant upon request and its long delay was exclusively the responsibility of the judicial authorities. The said judgment, which in its final version ran to fifteen pages, contained detailed legal reasoning. In those circumstances the Court considers that the object and purpose of Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention are best served by counting the six-month period as running from the date of service of the written judgment (see Worm v.

Although they confirmed that the claimant had indeed been registered as a collaborator and in the past there had been a two-volume-file on him, the file in question could no longer be found. The courts thus concluded that it could not be proven that the claimant had intentionally and secretly collaborated with the regime within the meaning of the domestic law on lustration. The applicant\u2019s statement was considered untrue. According to the domestic court\u2019s assessment untrue statements infringing upon another person\u2019s rights had to be considered illegal.",

To call somebody a secret collaborator with the communist-era security services carries a negative assessment of his behaviour in the past and is surely an attack on his good name. The Court reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is a right which is protected by Article 8 of the Convention as part of the right to respect for private life (see Chauvy and Others, cited above, \u00a7 70; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no. , \u00a7 40, 21\u00a0September 2010; and Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v.\u00a0France, no. 40454/07, \u00a7 53, 12 June 2014). The domestic authorities were therefore faced with the difficult task of balancing two conflicting values, namely freedom of expression of the applicant on the one hand and Mr\u00a0J.M.\u2019s right to respect for his reputation on the other (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7 84, 7 February 2012).",

Other persons were required by the Supreme Court to meet a higher standard in that they were to prove the veracity of their allegations (see paragraph 22 above). In such case the question of due diligence would be taken into account only when establishing their fault i.e. the sanction.
