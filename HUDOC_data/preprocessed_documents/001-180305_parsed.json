The court further held that despite S.K.\u2019s statement of 24 March 2005, the forensic report of 15 April 2002 had established that the applicant had had intercourse with her. In the absence of evidence that corroborated the fact of the applicant having forced himself on S.K., it could not be established beyond doubt that the act of sexual intercourse itself had not been consensual. The court stated in that connection that even if S.K. had been drunk that night, her allegations of rape and of being held against her will needed to be supported by some sign of resistance. In the light of the conclusion that there had been no indication of a criminal offence committed by the police officers, the court then held that the applicant and S.A. could not be deemed to have committed the separate offence of the unlawful use of a public vehicle.

More specifically, it is not the Court\u2019s task to assess whether the applicant, after having been acquitted in the criminal proceedings, was entitled to have the dismissal annulled or to be reinstated in the police force, a question that may be independent from the acquittal in the criminal proceedings. In the view of the Court, Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention does not guarantee a person acquitted of a criminal offence a right to reinstatement to his previous job even where there is a link between the criminal and disciplinary proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a025424/09, \u00a7\u00a082, ECHR 2013). The Court has stated in this context that Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 does not concern the question whether the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings is as such compatible with the guarantees enshrined in Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention (see Kemal Co\u015fkun, v.

The Court has acknowledged in its caselaw the existence of two aspects to the protection afforded by the presumption of innocence: a procedural aspect relating to the conduct of the criminal trial, and a second aspect, which aims to ensure respect for a finding of innocence in the context of subsequent proceedings, where there is a link with criminal proceedings which have ended with a result other than a conviction (see, generally, Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94). Under its first aspect, the principle of the presumption of innocence prohibits public officials from making premature statements about the defendant\u2019s guilt and acts as a procedural guarantee to ensure the fairness of the criminal trial itself. However, it is not limited to a procedural safeguard in criminal matters: its scope is broader and requires that no representative of the State should say that a person is guilty of an offence before his guilt has been established by a court (Konstas v. Greece, no. 53466/07, \u00a7 32, 24\u00a0May 2011). In that respect the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only in the context of a criminal trial, but also in separate civil, disciplinary or other proceedings that are conducted simultaneously with the criminal proceedings (see Kemal Co\u015fkun, cited above, \u00a7 41). While the scope of the first aspect under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention covers the period in which a person has been charged with a criminal offence until the criminal proceedings are final, the second aspect of the protection of the presumption of innocence comes into play when the criminal proceedings end with a result other than a conviction, and requires that the person\u2019s innocence vis\u00e0vis the criminal offence is not called into doubt in subsequent proceedings (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 94).",

The Court observes in that connection that disciplinary and criminal proceedings were begun simultaneously against the applicant following the allegations that he had raped S.K. while on duty and while using his authority as a police officer. The disciplinary decision to dismiss the applicant from the police force was adopted on 28\u00a0November 2002, while the criminal proceedings were still pending. The reasoning of the disciplinary decision was endorsed by the Ankara Administrative Court in its judgment of 4 July 2003.

The second aspect of Article 6 \u00a7 2 is relevant because of the subsequent administrative court decisions upholding the impugned statement and which allegedly did not take into account the applicant\u2019s acquittal, which had been pronounced in the meantime. Therefore, the Court can assess under the first aspect of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention whether the reasoning adopted in the disciplinary proceedings, before the final decision in the criminal proceedings, violated the applicant\u2019s right to be presumed innocent (see, in particular, Kemal Co\u015fkun, cited above, \u00a7 44). It can further determine whether the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decisions, which came after the final decision in the criminal proceedings, complied with the requirement to respect the establishment of the applicant\u2019s innocence.

They explained that when an acquittal in criminal proceedings was based on the lack of the constitutive elements of an offence, the conduct in question could still qualify as a disciplinary offence under a different standard of proof. They further submitted that the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s case-law supported the position that when criminal proceedings came after disciplinary proceedings and ended with a complete acquittal, such as a decision on the grounds that the acts had not been committed by the accused, the administrative courts reviewing the lawfulness of the disciplinary sanction could annul it or reclassify it under different legal grounds.",

The presumption of innocence is infringed if a judicial decision or a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question (see, among others, Matija\u0161evi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 23037/04, \u00a7\u00a048, ECHR 2006\u2011X; Garycki v. Poland, no. 14348/02, \u00a7 71, 6 February 2007; and Wojciechowski v. Poland, no. 5422/04, \u00a7 54, 9 December 2008). The latter infringe the presumption of innocence, whereas the former have been regarded as unobjectionable in various situations examined by the Court (see, among others, El Kaada v. Germany, no. 2130/10, \u00a7 54, 12\u00a0November 2015). In that connection the Court has emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence. While the use of language is of critical importance in this respect, the Court has further pointed out that whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see, Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42, ECHR 2000-X; Konstas, cited above, \u00a7 33; Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 126; and El\u00a0Kaada, cited above, \u00a7 55).",

The Court reiterates that the Convention does not preclude that an act may give rise to both criminal and disciplinary proceedings, or that two sets of proceedings may be pursued in parallel. The Court reiterates that even exoneration from criminal responsibility does not, as such, preclude the establishment of civil or other forms of liability arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof (see, for example, Ringvold v. Norway, no. 34964/97, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2003-II; Jakumas v. Lithuania, no. 6924/02, \u00a7 57, 18\u00a0July 2006; \u00c7elik (Bozkurt) v.

However, there would be an issue under Article 6 \u00a7 2 if, in the absence of a final criminal conviction, there was a statement imputing criminal liability to an applicant for the misconduct alleged against him in disciplinary proceedings (see\u00a0Kemal Co\u015fkun, cited above, \u00a7 53 and the cases cited therein).",

Be that as it may, the Court observes that the aim of the disciplinary investigation was to determine whether the applicant had raped or assaulted S.K., offences which categorically belong to the sphere of criminal law. Yet the principle of the presumption of innocence dictates that disciplinary authorities stay within their respective forum and refrain from imputing criminal liability to an applicant where no such liability has been established by a competent criminal court. That is the fine line that divides disciplinary liability from criminal liability, the nuances of which the domestic authorities are required to reflect in the wording of decisions in order to respect an accused\u2019s right to the presumption of innocence. The need to maintain the distinction between disciplinary and criminal liability in the language used by the domestic authorities becomes all the more necessary in circumstances where, as in the present case, the disciplinary and criminal proceedings end at different times and come to conclusions that appear to be contradictory.",

The prohibited acts and conduct listed in the impugned section 8 (6) of the disciplinary regulations, which are defined as disciplinary misconduct and which provided legal grounds for disciplinary sanctions, constitute criminal offences, however, there is no indication whether a criminal conviction is necessary in order for the disciplinary authorities to rely on those grounds. In the absence of such clarification in the text of the disciplinary regulations itself, the Court finds that in the present case the lines between disciplinary and criminal liability were blurred in the applicant\u2019s case from the very beginning of the disciplinary investigation. Furthermore, taking into account the fact that the disciplinary authorities referred to the applicant as \u201cthe accused\u201d in the decision to dismiss him, while describing his conduct as \u201csexual assault\u201d, without any qualification that would keep that assessment to the disciplinary sphere, the Court holds that they violated the applicant\u2019s right to be presumed innocent in the pending criminal proceedings. Moreover, the administrative court\u2019s judgment of 4 July 2003, which upheld the impugned reasoning given by the disciplinary authorities, described the applicant\u2019s conduct as \u201chaving intercourse with S.K. without her consent\u201d. In the Court\u2019s opinion, that statement amounted to pronouncing the applicant guilty of rape. In that regard, the Court cannot agree with the Government that the statement did not impute criminal guilt to the applicant. The Court considers that impugned statements must always be read in their context. Regard being had to the disciplinary context of the case, in which one of the legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s dismissal was \u201crape or sexual assault\u201d under section\u00a08(6) of the disciplinary regulations, and the way in which the administrative court summarised the events of 12 April 2002, the statement that the applicant had intercourse with S.K. without her consent cannot but convey to a reader of the judgment the impression that the applicant was guilty of raping S.K. (see, mutatis mutandis, Cleve v. Germany, no.\u00a048144/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06061, 15 January 2015).",

Austria, 25 August 1993, \u00a7\u00a030, Series A no. 266A). In that connection, the second aspect of the protection afforded by Article 6 \u00a7 2 requires that a person must be treated in a manner that is consistent with his or her innocence after the conclusion of criminal proceedings which have terminated in an acquittal or discontinuation (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 103). Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuation decision in any other proceedings, the fair trial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public. To a certain extent, the protection afforded under Article 6 \u00a7 2 in this respect may overlap with the protection afforded by Article 8 (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 94).",

The applicant explicitly argued before the Supreme Administrative Court that he had been acquitted of all charges in the criminal proceedings and that therefore the grounds of his dismissal under section 8(7) of the disciplinary regulations could no longer be considered compatible with the law. Against that background, the Court considers that the Supreme Administrative Court needed to explain why it regarded that the reasoning employed by the disciplinary authorities and the first-instance court could continue to be in accordance with the law, although the applicant had been acquitted in the meantime in the criminal proceedings. That was the only way it could have avoided the situation complained of by the applicant, namely that he was left with two contradictory judgments.
