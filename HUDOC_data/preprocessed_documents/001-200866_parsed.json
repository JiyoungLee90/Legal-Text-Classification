The amendments as a result of Act\u00a0X of 2009 [which amended the Civil Code and was aimed at ameliorating the position of land owners who were subject to controlled rents] were of little comfort given that the applicants had been suffering a breach for a long time and would continue to do so for another twelve years given that Article\u00a01531I of the Civil Code resulting from the 2009 amendments  which provided for a possibility of owners regaining their property  could only come to play after twenty years from 2008. Furthermore, the fact that the applicants had not lodged proceedings before the RRB could not play in their disfavour given that the RRB was bound by law and therefore it could not award an amount of rent which would have fulfilled the proportionality requirement.",

It then took four years for the applicants to file their submissions. At that stage the court accepted the applicants\u2019 request to nominate a court-appointed expert, but it then took six years, until 2006, for a courtappointed expert to submit a technical report, which was confirmed on oath in January 2007, and a firstinstance judgment was delivered on 28\u00a0March 2008. During that time, in 2003 the court had asked the parties for submissions and the applicants had presented their submissions only a year later in 2004. The proceedings before the appeal court had not been excessively long, while it was true that the appeal was lodged on 16\u00a0April 2008 and was appointed for hearing on 12\u00a0April 2010, the final judgment had been issued just two months later. It was thus clear that most of the delay was due to the applicants, namely, four years for their submissions, and then six years for the additional technical experts\u2019 report  although the latter\u2019s delay was justified given that two of the experts had to be replaced. However, given that the case was of average complexity the State could not be exonerated from its responsibility of an overall twentyoneyear delay. Nevertheless, given the responsibility of the applicants for part of the delay, in the Constitutional Court\u2019s view a finding of a violation was sufficient just satisfaction in the present case.",

However, given that the application of Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta, in combination with Act\u00a0XLV of 1973 as amended by Act IX of 1974 had breached the applicants\u2019 human rights, the Constitutional Court ordered that such laws could no longer be relied on as a basis for the occupation of the premises in the present case. As to compensation, having considered that the applicants had waited twentythree years to lodge constitutional redress proceedings and the disproportion of the rent received by the applicants in the light of the market value, as well as the order invalidating the effects of the impugned laws between the parties at issue, the Constitutional Court awarded EUR\u00a025,000.

The Court observes that what the Constitutional Court considered as \u201cmost of the delay\u201d amounted on its own account to about ten years (four for submissions and six years for the courtappointed expert reports) out of twentyone, and the Constitutional Court considered that the six years\u2019 delay awaiting the experts who had to be replaced following their promotion was also partly justified. In this connection, the Court would reiterate that experts work in the context of judicial proceedings under the supervision of a judge, who remains responsible for the preparation and speedy conduct of proceedings (see, for instance, Proszak v.\u00a0Poland, 16 December 1997, \u00a7 44, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII, and \u0141ukjaniuk v. Poland, no.\u00a015072/02, \u00a7\u00a028, 7\u00a0November 2006). It follows that the applicants conduct cannot be said to have contributed to \u201cmost of the delay\u201d.

There is no doubt that, in law, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction could annul an order and evict a tenant (as sometimes ordered by the first-instance constitutional jurisdiction, see paragraph 67 in fine above), which measure would have prevented the continuation of the violation. However, it is clear, from the caselaw relied on by the Government, that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where as a result of a protected rent regime (such as that arising from Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta at issue in the present case) the owners have suffered an excessive burden leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action. More particularly, the Constitutional Court revokes such an action when it was ordered by the firstinstance court. Indeed, the Government have not provided one example of a final finding ordering eviction, despite having been requested to do so, and despite the fact that numerous violations of the kind have been found at the domestic level. In similar circumstances, in Apap Bologna (concerning violations arising from requisition orders) the Court found that, despite having the power to do so, in practice, the Constitutional Court had repeatedly failed to take the required action which would bring the violation to an end (ibid., \u00a7\u00a086).",

According to the Court, such an order would constitute a measure vis\u00e0vis an individual applicant, which would provide for an end to the violation without affecting the tenant. The same was reiterated in the more recent Portanier judgment, \u00a7\u00a048, which noted that this course of action has not been popular with the constitutional jurisdictions, and where the Court reiterated that in the event that the constitutional jurisdictions award a higher future rent (to be paid by the Government, with the possibility of an arrangement with the tenants who would have for years benefitted from a generous regime), eviction would not always be necessary. Indeed, when the measure did pursue a legitimate aim (such as the social protection of needy tenants), the adaptation of the future rent to present circumstances might be sufficient to repair the existing disproportionality and thus bring the violation to an end. The Court notes that, in the present case, despite the less weighty legitimate aim, an adequate future rent in the light of that aim, could nonetheless bring the violation to an end. Moreover, the future rent would have had to be established only until 2028 date when the lease will no longer be protected under Chapter\u00a069 of the Laws of Malta.

From the domestic caselaw brought to the Court\u2019s attention by the Government, that same action appears to have become customary, at least since 2016. In Portanier the Court maintained that it still had doubts as to this approach, and reiterated its reservations about the fact that the Constitutional Court, whose role is to bring a violation to an end and to redress the upheld violation, abdicates the responsibility assigned to it by the Constitution of Malta and refers applicants to yet another remedy despite it having the power and authority to grant such redress (\u00a7 51). In that case, while having set out a number of considerations, in view of the parties\u2019 limited submissions and the fact that the applicant had been successful in evicting the tenants, the Court refrained from adjudicating on the effectiveness of that approach in general (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a05254).

It follows that the inaction of both parties has led to the status quo remaining that which existed on the date of the Constitutional Court judgment, more than three years ago. In this connection the Court makes reference to its caselaw to the effect that it is inappropriate to require an individual who has obtained judgment against the State at the end of legal proceedings to then bring enforcement proceedings to obtain satisfaction (Musci v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 64699/01, \u00a7 90 ECHR 2006V (extracts)).

Moreover, as the law stood at the time of the Constitutional Court proceedings, the bank would in any event lose the protection of the law and therefore would have to vacate the property when the lease comes to an end in 2028. It follows that, in the circumstances of the present case, there seems to be no particular justification for delaying redress and continuing to perpetrate the violation established. Thus, in the absence of an award covering future rent until 2028, the Court considers that the only remedy capable of giving adequate and speedy redress to the applicants in the situation of the present case was for the Constitutional Court to order eviction \u2013 a course of action it failed to undertake, as is its normal practice (see paragraph\u00a071 above).",

The mere fact that an amount of compensation awarded is low, or that no amount is awarded at all, does not render the remedy in itself ineffective, although it does have an impact on the Court\u2019s assessment of the applicant\u2019s victim status concerning the length of proceedings complaint (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, Zarb v.

In the present case the Constitutional Court denied the applicants any compensation whatsoever without giving sufficient reasons (see paragraph\u00a047-48 above). Moreover, the two cases relied on by the applicants and one of the cases put forward by the Government, as well as the applicants\u2019 own case, suggest that the Maltese Constitutional Court far too often fails to award any compensation at all for such breaches. Even when they do make an award, the cases brought forward by the Government indicate that the Constitutional Court generally awards sums which do not constitute adequate redress (compare, Apap\u00a0Bologna, cited above, \u00a7\u00a089, in relation to pecuniary awards in property cases). Indeed, the Court observes that in around two thirds of the cases relied on by the Government the Constitutional Court made awards which were significantly lower (between 20 and 40 % of the amount), or even manifestly unreasonably lower (as low as 2 and 5 % of the amount) than what the Court would have awarded in those circumstances. Thus, the material brought forward by the parties appears to be sufficient evidence to show that the remedy at issue does not fulfil this criterion due to a regular practice of significantly or unreasonably low compensation awards in such cases, or even no compensation at all, as happened in the present case.",

In particular, the Court has held that to conform with the reasonable time principle, a remedy for length of proceedings should not in principle and in the absence of exceptional circumstances, last more than two and half years over two jurisdictions, including the execution phase (see Gagliano Giorgi v.\u00a0Italy, no. 23563/07, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2012). The Court notes that the parties have not elaborated on this matter. However, the fact that the constitutional redress proceedings in the present case lasted nearly six years over two jurisdictions raises doubts about the speediness of the remedial action itself.",

Malta (just satisfaction), no. 35349/05, \u00a7\u00a018, 17\u00a0July 2008). Thus, the situation in the present case might be said to involve a degree of public interest which is significantly less marked than in other cases and which does not justify such a substantial reduction compared with the free market rental value (see, Zammit and Attard, cited above, \u00a7 75).",
