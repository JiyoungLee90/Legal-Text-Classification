The conflict between the two countries, which has centred on the status of the province of Nagorno-Karabakh, gradually escalated into full-scale war in early 1992. On 5 May 1994 a ceasefire agreement (the Bishkek Protocol) was signed by Armenia, Azerbaijan and the \u201cNagorno-Karabakh Republic\u201d (see further Sargsyan v.

It cannot, and must not, usurp the role of Contracting States whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection. States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

Furthermore, its conclusions were not accompanied by any photographic evidence, as opposed to the Armenian forensic report which was supported by colour photos.

This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that a person has been killed by an agent of the State. The mere fact that the authorities have been informed of the death will give rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances in which it occurred (see, for instance, Iorga v. Moldova, no. 12219/05, \u00a7 26, 23 March 2010, with further references).

What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. For an investigation into an alleged unlawful killing by State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded as necessary for the persons responsible for carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events. This means not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection but also a practical independence. The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to identify the perpetrator(s) will risk falling foul of this standard. Furthermore, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next-of-kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see, for instance, Tahsin Acar v.

Instead, his arrest and death became known in Armenia through Azerbaijani media reports. The only official communication in this respect was the death certificate delivered to the Armenian authorities on 26 October 2010 by the ICRC which it had received from the Azerbaijani General Prosecutor\u2019s Office (see paragraph 17 above). Furthermore, the Azerbaijani Prosecutor-General refused to reply to the request for legal assistance made by the Armenian Prosecutor-General under the 1993 CIS Convention, even when that request was repeated via the CIS Coordinating Council (paragraph 28). In this connection, the Court cannot accept the respondent Government\u2019s contention that the Azerbaijani authorities had no duty to cooperate on account of the suspension of all diplomatic relations between the two countries. The lack of diplomatic relations does not absolve a Contracting State from the obligation under Article 2 to cooperate in criminal investigations (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v. Cyprus and Turkey [GC], no. 36925/07, \u00a7 244, 29\u00a0January\u00a02019; see also the overview of the case-law on the duty to cooperate set out in that judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 222-236). It appears that the documents relating to the Azerbaijani investigation came to the knowledge of the applicants and the Armenian authorities only following the communication of the present application. The applicants, as Mr\u00a0Saribekyan\u2019s next-of-kin, thus had no opportunity to safeguard their interests.",

In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element, as recognised in Article 1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see, among other authorities, Akta\u015f v.

However, in order for a separate violation of Article 3 of the Convention to be found in respect of the victim\u2019s relatives, there should be special factors in place giving their suffering a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress inevitably stemming from the aforementioned violation itself. The relevant factors include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question and the involvement of the applicants in the attempts to obtain information about the fate of their relative (see, among other authorities, Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, \u00a7 177, ECHR 2013). While a family member of a \u201cdisappeared person\u201d can claim to be a victim of treatment contrary to Article 3, the same principle would not usually apply to situations where the person taken into custody has later been found dead. In such cases the Court would normally limit its findings to Article 2. However, if a period of initial disappearance is long it may in certain circumstances give rise to a separate issue under Article 3 (see Bitiyeva and Others v.

However, the Court is unable to establish, on the basis of the information available, that he was subjected to ill-treatment throughout the whole period of detention. Nevertheless, the Court takes into account the Armenian forensic report of 21 December 2010 which, apart from strangulation injuries, recorded haemorrhages in the kidney, chest, lumbar, left thigh and rectum as well as a cranio-cerebral trauma, all caused by blunt objects (see paragraph 22 above). These injuries, estimated to have been sustained by Mr Saribekyan during the last days of his detention, were described in detail and supported by extensive photographic evidence. In the Court\u2019s view, neither the documents in the case file nor the observations of the respondent Government give reason to question these findings. Consequently, the Court finds that Mr Saribekyan was subjected to ill-treatment in the form of severe physical violence during the final days of his life, while he was detained at the Military Police Department in Baku. In addition, as has already been noted in the examination of the complaints under Article 2 (see paragraph 72 above), the circumstances surrounding the events, notably the general context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations and the likelihood that the officers and guards at the detention facility knew about the serious accusations against Mr Saribekyan, called for a careful investigation by the Azerbaijani authorities as to whether ethnic hatred had been a contributing factor to his ill-treatment.",

While the tense relationship between Azerbaijan and Armenia was undoubtedly an exacerbating factor causing emotional distress for the applicants, the mentioned periods of time, in particular the first one during which the applicants did not know the whereabouts of their son, do not as such appear long. It is true, as has been concluded above, that the Azerbaijani investigation into his death was ineffective and did not involve either the applicants or the Armenian authorities. Consequently, the events that led to their son\u2019s death have not been fully elucidated and no one has been held responsible for his ill-treatment and death. However, the Court does not consider that this element raises an issue distinct from the above finding that the flawed investigation involved a violation of the procedural aspect of Article 2. Moreover, noting, inter alia, that the applicants did not witness any of the events in question, it finds that there is no sufficiently special feature in the case which gives the suffering of the applicants a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress which may be regarded as inevitably caused to relatives of a victim of a serious human rights violation.",
