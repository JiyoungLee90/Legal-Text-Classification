In addition, Law no. 304/2004 expressly stated that an appeal on points of law had to be examined by a court sitting as a bench of three judges.

It held that, under Article 2811 of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure, judgments delivered by first-instance courts in respect of disputes where the subject-matter of the litigation had been valued at less than one billion Romanian lei (approximately EUR\u00a027,000) were not subject to an ordinary appeal. The applicant had estimated the value of the disputed estate to be EUR 9,244. A dispute between parties which concerned the annulment of a legal instrument relating to a particular estate had a pecuniary content and could be valued. The value of the assets specified in the legal instrument had to be taken into consideration for the purposes of establishing which court had jurisdiction. The value indicated by the applicant was the only criteria for establishing the value of the estate concerned. Consequently, the only relevant criteria in determining the competent court was the value of the assets specified in the instrument the applicant sought to annul. Therefore, the proceedings brought by the applicant were regulated by Article 2811 and consequently the judgment delivered by the District Court could only be challenged by way of an appeal on points of law. The lawfulness and thoroughness of that judgment had been examined by the County Court. Under Article 2811 the Court of Appeal no longer had subject-matter jurisdiction to review the aforementioned judgments. The fact that the County Court had erroneously decided and classified the applicant\u2019s challenge of the District Court judgment as an ordinary appeal rather than an appeal on points of law did not have any legal significance. The type of appeal that could be lodged against judgments was prescribed by law and not by the courts. The fact that the County Court had wrongfully classified the applicant\u2019s challenge could not result in a breach of the mandatory provisions of Article 2811, which provided for two levels of jurisdiction by creating a third. Consequently, the court had no subject-matter jurisdiction and could not examine the applicant\u2019s reasons for the appeal on points of law.",

The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see\u00a0Korolev, cited above). In other words, the absence of any significant disadvantage can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant (see\u00a0Adrian\u00a0Mihai Ionescu, cited above). In order to determine the seriousness of the consequences of the applicant\u2019s allegations, the matters at stake in the case before the domestic courts could not be decisive except in those circumstances where the value was small or insignificant (see Giusti v.\u00a0Italy, no. 13175/03, \u00a7 35, 18 October 2011).",

In the present case, however, unlike in the cases of Dumitrescu and Negreanu cited above, the Ia\u015fi County Court dealt with the appeal on points of law lodged before it in a bench composed of two judges. The Court considers therefore that the bench of the Ia\u015fi County Court which delivered its decision on the merits of the case as a second and last-instance court was not composed in accordance with the domestic law in force at the material time.",
