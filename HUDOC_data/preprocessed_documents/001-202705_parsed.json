This person had arrived from Istanbul and had travelled on a Chadian passport found to be authentic. The applicant had reported to the immigration authorities and submitted an asylum request on that very same day, without holding any kind of documentation.

In the additional interview, the applicant confirmed that he was indeed the person who could be seen in the stills. He stated that the person who had arranged and facilitated his travel had only handed him the passport \u2013 which the applicant said bore his picture, but the personal details of a different person \u2013 at checkpoints.

The applicant was interviewed in relation to that request. He stated that he was a Sudanese national from Darfur and that the passport which he had used to enter the Netherlands was not his own, and that he still feared a return to Sudan, as he would be forced to fight either with the military against his ethnic group or with his ethnic group against the military. The applicant submitted two documents: a declaration of residence (domicilieverklaring) issued by authorities in Sudan, and a statement of origin. Upon receiving the first document, the applicant had gone to the Sudanese embassy in the Netherlands, which had issued him with a statement confirming that he was from Sudan. The applicant had also gone to the Chadian embassy in Belgium in order to obtain a document confirming that he did not have Chadian nationality, but his request in that regard had been refused.

The Administrative Jurisdiction Division held that neither the documents submitted by the applicant in his second set of asylum proceedings nor the fact that the Deputy Minister had accepted that the applicant had Sudanese nationality in another set of proceedings relating to his placement in immigration detention was capable of affecting the finding made in the proceedings relating to his first asylum application that he had Chadian nationality. The applicant had not demonstrated that he did not have this nationality. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division found that the applicant had not adduced any new facts or circumstances, and that no special circumstances pertained to justify examining his repeat asylum request on its merits. In connection with this last consideration, reference was made to the Court\u2019s judgment in Bahaddar v. the Netherlands (19\u00a0February 1998, \u00a7 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I).",

As such an objection did not have automatic suspensive effect, the applicant also sought a provisional measure from the Regional Court in order to stay his removal pending a decision on his objection. He argued that his removal to Sudan would lead to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, as he was from Darfur and of a non-Arab ethnicity, and he would therefore attract the negative attention of the authorities immediately upon his arrival at the airport in Khartoum. He further argued that it had not been assessed whether there was a real risk of his removal exposing him to treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention, and that this was contrary to Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention. Moreover, as he had an arguable claim of a violation of Article\u00a03, he should have had access to an effective remedy with automatic suspensive effect.",

He held that the applicant had still not demonstrated that he did not hold Chadian nationality. He had entered the Netherlands on a genuine Chadian passport and his claim that he had obtained this passport through bribery had remained unsubstantiated. Moreover, he had stated that his mother was Chadian and he had a command of a Chadian (tribal) language. In so far as it was to be assumed that the applicant also held Sudanese nationality, it was relevant that he had given only vague, summary and demonstrably incorrect statements as regards his Sudanese origins. He had indicated during his first interview of 15 May 2010 that he hailed from Darfur, where he claimed to have lived for the first seventeen years of his life. He had further stated that Darfur was an independent region, and that he did not know where Darfur was or to which country it belonged. Furthermore, he was barely able to provide information about Nyala, where he had allegedly lived during the three years preceding his arrival in the Netherlands. The Deputy Minister further considered that, although it appeared from the language analysis (see paragraph 7 above) that the applicant could be identified as originating from Sudan, the findings of this analysis contradicted the course of the applicant\u2019s life as described by him. He was unable to give the names of any places in the vicinity of Nyala, and could provide little information about this town where he had allegedly lived. Furthermore, although the applicant\u2019s speech contained authentic elements from the Arabic language of Darfur, his speech also showed a strong influence of the Arabic language as spoken in the region of Khartoum. It was also striking that his vocabulary was unusually large for someone who claimed to be uneducated. The conclusion of the language analysis was that, although it was likely that the applicant had a Darfuri background and belonged to the non-Arab population group of that region, he must have spent a significant part of his life outside Darfur. Accordingly, the Deputy Minister found that the applicant had not established that Darfur should be considered his region of origin, as he had given summary and incorrect statements about that region and there were strong indications that prior to his arrival in the Netherlands he had lived for a lengthy period outside the Darfur region, and consequently no credence could be given to his alleged region of origin and the problems he had allegedly encountered there. Furthermore, the Deputy Minister did not find it established that the applicant, if removed to Sudan, would be exposed to a risk of treatment in breach of Article 3 on account of having participated in a demonstration by the Sudanese opposition held in The Hague on 28 January 2016, or that he would risk forced conscription into the Sudanese army.",

The court further noted that, under section 8:51a(1) of the General Administrative Law Act, it could enable an administrative authority to repair or have repaired a flaw in an impugned decision, and in such a situation it would hand down an interlocutory ruling in accordance with section 8:80a of the General Administrative Law Act.

On 25 September 2017 the applicant submitted his written reaction to that additional reasoning. On 18\u00a0October 2017 the Regional Court requested that the Deputy Minister submit a further explanation as to why, given the findings of the language analysis (see paragraph 7 above), he had held that the outcome of the language analysis did still allow for the possibility that the applicant had grown up in Chad.",

This report further stated that it was plausible that the applicant had a background in Darfur (Sudan) or Chad, and that it was possible that he had spent his early childhood in Darfur or in Chad, but because of his Arabic speech, this was rather unlikely. As regards the applicant\u2019s alleged Tunjur origin, the report stated that, as the Tunjur did not have their own language, in practice, it was not possible to verify a person\u2019s alleged Tunjur origin, and in the opinion of the TOELT, the applicant had submitted nothing warranting the assumption that he actually belonged to the Tunjur. During the language analysis carried out in December 2010, the applicant had demonstrated a command of Gorane, better known as Tubu or Tedaga, a language spoken in Chad, Niger and Nigeria. He had stated that he had learned it from his mother. The applicant submitted written comments on this report on 16 November 2017.",

It found that, having regard to the additional submissions of the Deputy Minister, the Deputy Minister had sufficiently reasoned why he did not assume that the applicant hailed from Darfur and why it had not been excluded that he originated from Chad. Referring to the TOELT-report of 31 October 2017, it further accepted that it was plausible that the applicant had resided in the region of Khartoum for most of his life or his entire life. The Deputy Minister had thus correctly found that Khartoum should be considered the applicant\u2019s region of origin and that the applicant had not established that he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention there.

As regards the applicant\u2019s participation in a demonstration by the Sudanese opposition held in The Hague on 28 January 2016, the Court also notes that this demonstration was directed against the former regime of Omar Al-Bashir, and not against the current government of Sudan. Consequently, this argument is no longer pertinent. Furthermore, unlike the situation in the cases of N.A. v. Switzerland and A.I. v.\u00a0Switzerland (both cited above), there is no evidence before the Court of the applicant\u2019s involvement in any Sudanese political opposition or Sudanese opposition group abroad which would consequently cause him to fear ill-treatment by the current authorities upon his return to Sudan.",
