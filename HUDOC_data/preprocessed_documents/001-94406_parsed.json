In particular, the second applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that because of the domestic courts\u2019 erroneous recording of his pre-trial detention, he would have to serve one additional year of detention. This error was, in fact, corrected by the High Court of Cassation and Justice on 14 July 2006 (see paragraph 31 above). Lastly, invoking in substance Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, the second applicant complained that he could not comply with the confiscation order concerning the 1.48 g of heroin, since the heroin found on 18 November had already been surrendered to the investigators and he did not possess any other drugs. The Court notes, however, that the confiscation order referred to the same drugs that were seized by the police during the events on 18 November (see paragraph 30 above), and that no other measures were taken against the applicants that would affect their property rights for the purposes of Article 1.",
