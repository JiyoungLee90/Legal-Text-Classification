The case originated in an application (no. 63012/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Sándor Harmati (“the applicant”), on 11 October 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr J. Fiala-Butora, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
.  The applicant complained under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 about an allegedly unjustified interference with his electoral rights.
On 25 June 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Érd.
The applicant suffers from an intellectual disability. On 4 October 2000 he was placed under plenary guardianship by the Budapest II/III District Court. As an automatic consequence flowing from Article 70(5) of the Constitution, as in force at the material time, he was deleted from the electoral register. Consequently, he could not vote in the general elections held in Hungary on 11 April 2010.
