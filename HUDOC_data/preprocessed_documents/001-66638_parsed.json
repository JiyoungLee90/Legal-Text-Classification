The decisions of those commissions were intended to settle all property claims arising out of past expropriations. Such claims \u2013 including claims concerning outlays incurred by a former user of a property \u2013 could be brought before a civil court only in those exceptional cases provided for in section 64 of the 1989 Law where a property commission was unable to restore a property to its original owner.

The Court notes that a dispute arose during the proceedings before the Property Commission as to the amount that should be awarded to the applicant association for its expenditure on maintenance of the property. As the parties could not agree on the amount to be paid, the Property Commission assigned two experts who assessed it at PLZ\u00a0420,353,658 (PLN 42,035). However, the applicant association challenged this finding and proposed its own calculation of the amount which should be awarded. The Property Commission, in a decision which, under the provisions of the 1989 Law, could not be appealed to a higher administrative authority, ordered the religious association to pay the applicant association PLZ 420,353,658 (PLN 42,035), that is to say, the amount estimated in accordance with the experts\u2019 opinion.",

It is true that the first-instance court, in its judgment of 15\u00a0December 1995, assessed the outlays to be reimbursed to the applicant association at PLN 546,133.02. However, this judgment was not final. It cannot therefore be assumed that, had the merits of its case been determined by a final judgment, the applicant association would have received the same amount. Nonetheless, the Court does not find it unreasonable to regard the applicant association as having suffered a loss of opportunity in that it could not obtain a ruling on the merits of its claim (see Tinnelly & Sons Limited and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1665, \u00a7 93).
