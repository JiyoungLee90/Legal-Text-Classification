In the trial court\u2019s view, such statements had shown the applicant\u2019s approval of, and support for, the activities of the PKK and its leader. Thus it interpreted those statements as the applicant\u2019s efforts to legitimise the terrorist organisation and its leader. Then the court referred to the statements of the two anonymous witnesses, Salihli X1 and Salihli X2, and stated that their identities had been kept secret for fear of their being targeted by the PKK, given that they had testified against a person who had been spreading its propaganda. It went on to note that the applicant\u2019s statements throughout the proceedings had demonstrated that he held opinions similar to the explanations given by the anonymous witnesses regarding the words he had used. Further, the trial court also listed the content of the expert report and its findings regarding the wedding party held by the applicant\u2019s nephew.",

The court also concluded that the applicant\u2019s actions during his nephew\u2019s wedding party, that is to say waving a red, yellow and green flag allegedly symbolising the PKK, had prompted other persons to chant slogans and wave banners in favour of the PKK and its leader. As a result, the Assize Court found the applicant guilty of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation. According to the trial court, as the applicant\u2019s speeches and acts were in support of a terrorist organisation, which employed the method of armed violence, and of its convicted leader, they could not be considered to fall within the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression.",

Moreover, the applicant and his lawyer had neither been informed of nor invited to attend those hearings. That practice clearly put the defence in a disadvantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis the public prosecutor and, in the absence of any procedural safeguards, breached the right to equality of arms (compare Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26\u00a0March 1996, \u00a7 66, Reports 1996II, where the participation of the defendant\u2019s lawyer in the questioning of two anonymous witnesses by the investigating judge was considered sufficient).",

However, the Court observes that at the same hearing, the applicant\u2019s lawyer submitted that he could not subject the personalities of the two anonymous witnesses to a challenge given that he had not been informed of their identities. In addition, at the hearing of 18 August 2009 the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested that the anonymous witnesses be examined. Similarly, when the applicant\u2019s lawyer raised that issue in some detail in his appeal, the Court of Cassation did not address that submission by providing reasons in respect of it. In view of the above, the Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant merely objected to the evidence given by the anonymous witnesses. In any event, the Court reiterates that challenging the written statements of anonymous witnesses or putting written questions to them are not sufficient to enable the defence to properly test the credibility and reliability of their evidence when the witnesses\u2019 identities are not known or disclosed to the defence (see Balta and Demir, cited above, \u00a7 59, and compare Tseber v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a046203/08, \u00a7 63, 22 November 2012).",
