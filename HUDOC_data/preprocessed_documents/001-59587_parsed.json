K. is also incapable of creating an emotional relationship with the children.

In his expert statement Dr E.V., a child and youth psychiatrist, reached a similar conclusion. Already in the spring of 1992 Dr J.H. realised that K.\u2019s problem was related to the fading of the boundaries between her and her children. She stated that K. amalgamated herself and her children into a single entity without being able to see the unique and individual nature of the children. According to J.H., K. was also unable to take into account the children\u2019s needs in relation to their age. Dr E.V. finds that the children do not seem to be objects independent of K. but that she sees them as \u2018self-objects\u2019. She finds it difficult to realise that children are individual human beings in need of love and care. Instead, she sees them as if they were meant for her own personal use.\u201d",

In particular, paragraph 3 of Article 43 provides that the Grand Chamber is to \u201cdecide the case\u201d \u2013 that is the whole case and not simply the \u201cserious question\u201d or \u201cserious issue\u201d mentioned in paragraph 2 \u2013 \u201cby means of a judgment\u201d. The wording of Article 43 makes it clear that, whilst the existence of \u201ca serious question affecting the interpretation or application of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, or a serious issue of general importance\u201d (paragraph 2) is a prerequisite for acceptance of a party\u2019s request, the consequence of acceptance is that the whole \u201ccase\u201d is referred to the Grand Chamber to be decided afresh by means of a new judgment (paragraph 3). The same term \u201cthe case\u201d (\u201cl\u2019affaire\u201d) is also used in Article 44 \u00a7 2 which defines the conditions under which the judgments of a Chamber become final. If a request by a party for referral under Article 43 has been accepted, Article 44 can only be understood as meaning that the entire judgment of the Chamber will be set aside in order to be replaced by the new judgment of the Grand Chamber envisaged by Article 43\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03. This being so, the \u201ccase\u201d referred to the Grand Chamber necessarily embraces all aspects of the application previously examined by the Chamber in its judgment, and not only the serious \u201cquestion\u201d or \u201cissue\u201d at the basis of the referral. In sum, there is no basis for a merely partial referral of the case to the Grand Chamber.",

There can therefore be no doubt that their complaints in this respect are covered by the decision of the same date on the admissibility of the application, as is in fact borne out by the Chamber\u2019s subsequent proceedings on the merits, where the emergency care orders were examined together with the subsequent normal care orders.

In the present case, no such plea of inadmissibility was made by the Government in their written or oral observations at the admissibility stage.

However, consideration of what is in the best interests of the child is in every case of crucial importance. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned (see Olsson v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 27 November 1992, Series A no. 250, pp. 35-36, \u00a7 90), often at the very stage when care measures are being envisaged or immediately after their implementation. It follows from these considerations that the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities for the regulation of the public care of children and the rights of parents whose children have been taken into care, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see, for example, Hokkanen v. Finland, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 20, \u00a7 55, and Johansen, cited above, pp. 1003-04, \u00a7 64).",

When a considerable period of time has passed since the child was originally taken into public care, the interest of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited. The Court thus recognises that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of taking a child into care. However, a stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by the authorities on parental rights of access, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between the parents and a young child are effectively curtailed (see Johansen, cited above, ibid.).",

According to the Government, K. had behaved violently and threatened to use violence against the children before. It was also noted that K. had been released from mental hospital only a month earlier and that she was not being treated for her mental illness at the time of giving birth. A week before J. was born the social welfare authorities had reached the conclusion that K. would probably not be capable of looking after M. and the new-born child at the same time, even with the help of T. and assistance measures of open care. The Government also observed that T. had called the health care centre only three days before J. was due to be born, expressing concern about K.\u2019s mental health. K.\u2019s mother had also apparently been worried about her daughter\u2019s mental health immediately before J.\u2019s birth on 18\u00a0June\u00a01993. The Government further expressed their concern that, if Article 8 were to be read as entitling parents to be involved in the decision-making process leading to emergency care orders, such orders would in many cases lose their meaning or would be impossible to implement.

In a situation in which, as detailed in the medical and social reports, the mother of the children was seriously mentally ill, there were social problems in the family and the prospects for the healthy development of the children in foster care appeared far more positive than the expected development in the care of their biological parents, the authorities could reasonably base the contested decisions on the assessment that was made of what was in the best interests of the children.

As regards the present situation, including the period after the delivery of the above-mentioned Chamber judgment, the Grand Chamber likewise arrives at the same conclusion as the Chamber. It observes that, whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate reunion of the family, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the best interests of the child must be taken into account. Where contacts with the parents appear to threaten those interests, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them and those of the parents (see, inter alia, Hokkanen, cited above, p. 22, \u00a7 58). Having regard to the situation of the children in this later period, it cannot be found that the assessment of the Finnish child welfare authorities fell foul of Article 8 \u00a7 2.

On the other hand, its finding of a violation in relation to the taking into care as such of the children is grounded on a somewhat narrower basis than that of the Chamber: the Grand Chamber has restricted its finding to the emergency care order and to one child, J. (see paragraphs 164-70 and 173-74 above). Notwithstanding this difference, the Court considers it appropriate in equity to award the applicants the same sums by way of just satisfaction as those awarded by the Chamber: the stress, unhappiness and frustration caused to the applicants by the shortcomings held by the Grand Chamber to be in violation of Article 8 cannot have been significantly less than the suffering attributable to the violations found by the Chamber. In so far as any reduction in the amount recoverable might at all have been warranted, this is offset by the need to take account of the delay in the receipt by the applicants of the award of just satisfaction resulting from the prolongation of the proceedings consequent upon the Government\u2019s referral of the case to the Grand Chamber.

The additional reason behind the emergency care order was the urgency of the situation. It can be inferred from the judgment that, according to the majority opinion, there was no such urgency as to justify the emergency care order.",

In my view these arguments are equally, not to say to some extent a fortiori, valid with regard to J. as well. Without the emergency care order, nobody would have been legally entitled to prevent K., the person having sole custody of J., from taking the baby with her when leaving the hospital. That the fragile mental health of the applicant could, in such a situation, have entailed risks for the well-being of the child (cf., for example, paragraph 167 of the judgment) was an eventuality which the authorities must have been entitled to take into account.",

This is as such correct and undisputed. It is precisely because of the foreseeability of the birth of a new baby that the authorities seem to have taken certain precautionary steps (see paragraph 22). In so far as it appears to be suggested that an emergency care order is compatible with Article 8 only in situations of unforeseen emergency, I recall that in the case of M. the Court accepts that the emergency care order was justified even in the absence of an unforeseen emergency. Moreover, under domestic law, section 18 of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph 103), an emergency care order (kiireellinen huostaanotto, literally \u201curgent taking into care\u201d) is foreseen not only for suddenly arising emergencies but also for other situations of urgency where delays could endanger the well-being of the child. In my view the authorities, within their margin of appreciation, could reasonably consider that this was such a situation. A care order was not thinkable before the birth of the child, whereas any delay thereafter could have entailed the risks indicated earlier.",

In practical terms, the decision to take J. urgently into care prevented K. from removing the child from the hospital. Beyond this, the emergency care order as such could not legally restrict K.\u2019s access to the child. For such restrictions, a separate decision was needed (and rendered on 21 June 1993, when unsupervised \u2013 but not other \u2013 access was prohibited; see paragraph 27 of the judgment). Therefore I have some difficulty in reconciling the characterisation of the emergency care order as a whole \u2013 as distinct from the way in which it was implemented \u2013 as \u201cdrastic\u201d (see paragraph 168) with the unanimous finding that the normal care order was compatible with Article 8.

No convincing explanation has been submitted by the Government as a justification for what, prima facie, appears to have been an overreaction by the hospital staff to the emergency care order and, perhaps, to the letter of 11 June 1993 (see paragraph 22 of the judgment). That the staffing situation of the hospital may have caused practical problems for a less severe manner of executing the care order (see paragraph 161) is not an explanation releasing the Government from their responsibility.",

This alone speaks in favour of a more cautious approach in reviewing the behaviour of the local authorities. More importantly, it should be borne in mind that the essence of an emergency care order is that action must be taken on the spot in order to prevent particular harm from occurring. There is little room for the authorities, pressed to take an immediate decision, to reflect on whether lesser measures can be taken since the situation is such that time is of the essence. The Court, in my view, should be more sensitive to the real dilemmas facing the authorities in situations where emergency steps must be taken. If no action is taken, there exists the real risk that harm will occur to the child and that the authorities will be held to account for their failure to intervene. At the same time, if protective steps are taken, the authorities tend to be blamed for unacceptable interference with the right to respect for family life. I believe that it is recognition of this type of genuine dilemma that supports and justifies a generous application of the margin of appreciation in this area in a manner which affords the benefit of doubt to the welfare of the child at risk. I would have thought it appropriate for the Court to be particularly cautious where the rights of the child are imperilled.

It is true that in obvious cases of danger no involvement of the parents is called for, but in relation to M., where no imminent danger was visible, the involvement of the parents in the decision-making process was necessary, which did not mean that it would be impossible to implement the care order. I cannot see that such a normal procedure in the case of M. would have been detrimental to his protection. The reasons the majority of the Court have advanced not to accept the necessity of the emergency care order in respect of J. (see paragraph 168 of the judgment) apply also in my view a fortiori in relation to M. There were no reasons why the normal procedure for taking children into care could not have been followed. When K. and J. were in hospital and M. in the children\u2019s home, there was no emergency situation. It has further to be taken into account that M. was placed voluntarily by his parents in the children\u2019s home. There was no indication of a change of the parents\u2019 intention to let M. stay in the children\u2019s home or to get special care if needed. The emergency action in respect of M. aggravated the harsh measure which the authorities took in relation to J. and her mother. The fact that M. could have been removed from the safe environment of the children\u2019s home at any time (see paragraph\u00a0169) could not justify an emergency measure. It is a danger which had already existed for a long time, since the voluntary placement of M. in the children\u2019s home. I am unable to see under these circumstances why a danger should suddenly be deemed to have arisen and I cannot accept the Court\u2019s reasoning that the lack of association of both T. and K. in the decision-making process was understandable in order not to provoke a crisis in the family before the stressful event of J.\u2019s birth. Both T. and K., as parents, were even more closely associated with the decision-making process after the emergency measures, when they tried to take action against them. So this argument is rather counter-productive. Also, the argument that the order was limited in time to fourteen days does not justify the emergency action, as no danger existed. In fact, it was not an emergency action, it was a preparatory action for the normal care orders, but Finnish law does not foresee such a \u201cpreparatory stage\u201d for normal care orders.",
