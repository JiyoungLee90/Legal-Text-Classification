The document he had finally produced was not in his name, and therefore it could not be taken into account as evidence. Never in the course of the administrative proceedings had he referred to the conduct of human traffickers before his hearing by the court. The second applicant\u2019s statements were incoherent on the issue of the duration of his stay in Serbia and the submission of a request for asylum. The applicants had not relied on any specific fact that could have led the authority to consider Serbia non-safe in their respect.

The law currently incorporates many key provisions of the 1951 Convention. Furthermore, the provisions on subsidiary protection in the law are in conformity with relevant EU standards. The law also provides for certain rights up to the standard of nationals for those who benefit from international protection, as well as free legal aid during all stages of the asylum procedure. Nevertheless, some key provisions are still not in line with international standards.

The new amendments, which were adopted on 18 June 2015, introduce a procedure for registration of the intention to submit an asylum application at the border, protect asylum-seekers from the risk of refoulement and allow them to enter and be in the country legally for a short timeframe of 72 hours, before formally registering their asylum application.",

However, such confinement is acceptable only if it is accompanied by safeguards for the persons concerned and is not prolonged excessively. Otherwise, a mere restriction on liberty is turned into a deprivation of liberty (see Amuur v.

In order to determine whether someone has been \u201cdeprived of his liberty\u201d within the meaning of Article 5, the starting-point must be his or her specific situation and account must be taken of a whole range of factors (see De\u00a0Tommaso\u00a0v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, \u00a7 80, 23 February 2017). The notion of deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 contains both an objective element of a person\u2019s confinement in a particular restricted space for a not negligible length of time, and an additional subjective element in that the person has not validly consented to the confinement in question (see Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2012). The objective elements include the type, duration, effects, and manner of implementation of the measure in question, the possibility to leave the restricted area, the degree of supervision and control over the person\u2019s movements and the extent of isolation (see, for example, Guzzardi\u00a0v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7\u00a095, Series A no. 39; H.M.\u00a0v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a039187/98, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002\u00a0II; H.L.\u00a0v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, no.\u00a045508/99, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2004 IX; and Storck\u00a0v. Germany, no. 61603/00, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2005\u2011V). The difference between deprivation of and restriction upon liberty is one of degree or intensity, and not of nature or substance (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a029226/03, \u00a7 91, 23 February 2012, Austin and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2012 and the references contained therein). The mere fact that it was possible for the applicants to leave voluntarily cannot rule out an infringement of the right to liberty (see Riad and Idiab, cited above, \u00a7\u00a068).",

Consequently, the Court cannot accept at face value the Government\u2019s argument concerning the possibility of leaving the transit zone voluntarily. Owing to the circumstances, the applicants could not have left the transit zone in the direction of Serbia without unwanted and grave consequences, that is, without forfeiting their asylum claims and running the risk of refoulement.",

France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2010; Takush v. Greece, no. 2853/09, \u00a7 40, 17 January 2012; and Kholmurodov\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia, no. 58923/14, \u00a7 84, 1 March 2016). Those norms may clearly also stem from European Union law. In this respect, the Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, especially the courts, to interpret and apply domestic legislation, if necessary in conformity with the law of the European Union. Unless the interpretation is arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2007I), the Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of that interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Waite and Kennedy v.

Furthermore, the Convention also requires that any deprivation of liberty must be compatible with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Riad \u00a0and Idiab, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071 and the authorities cited therein).",

Indeed, it finds it quite difficult to identify in the provisions at hand any reference to the possibility of detention at the transit zone. The Government\u2019s submissions, according to which the applicants\u2019 stay at the transit zone, although it did not amount to detention, had nevertheless a compelling basis in national law (see paragraph\u00a060 above) only cast doubt on the clarity and the foreseeability of the domestic provisions in question.",

However, the Court is of the view that it would certainly be artificial to examine the facts of the case without considering the general context in which those facts arose. In its assessment, the Court will thus bear in mind, together with other factors, that the undeniable difficulties and inconveniences endured by the applicants stemmed to a significant extent from the situation of extreme difficulty confronting the authorities at the relevant time (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 184-185).",

The Dublin III Regulation and Directive 2013/32/EU provided that Member States of the EU were free to determine which countries they regarded as safe third countries and could create their own lists of those countries (as was done by, for example, Germany or France). Hungary had established its list of safe third countries by issuing Government Decree no.\u00a0191/2015. (VII.21.) on the definition of safe countries of origin and safe third countries (see paragraph 33 above). Serbia was on that list because it could be considered as a safe third country in general, owing to the fact that it was a party to the Geneva Refugee Convention and a candidate for EU membership. As such, it received financial and technical support from the EU to meet the requirements of membership and to reform its asylum system. Furthermore, to the Government\u2019s knowledge, there was no case-law under the Convention indicating that Serbia had failed to maintain a properly functioning asylum system and was thus not a safe third country.",

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the destination country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, for example, Saadi v.
