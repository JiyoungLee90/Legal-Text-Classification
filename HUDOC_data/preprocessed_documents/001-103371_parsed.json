The inmate confirmed that he had been the one who had first informed the applicant's former husband of his son's death. X further confirmed that he had had doubts about the suicide theory from the very beginning, and that he had shared those doubts both with the applicant and with her former husband during telephone conversations. However, those doubts remained mere speculation, as he had failed to identify any tangible facts in support of them. X also suggested that the applicant and her former husband had accused him of extortion by way of retribution, as they believed that he had been hiding the truth about the death of their son.",

The applicant's son had borrowed GEL 80 from the \u201ckitty\u201d, using it to buy an Ericsson T10 mobile phone from another inmate. However, being unable to repay the debt, the applicant's son had started receiving threats and insults.

Consequently, it was only after the applicant's husband had left the prison that X had started telephoning both him and the applicant, telling them that he knew the truth about the death of their son. He had asked the deceased's parents to arrange for his transfer to another prison, so that he could feel more secure and thus give them all the necessary details. Subsequent to those telephone talks with the deceased's parents, the lawyer N.A-dze (see paragraph\u00a032 above) had telephoned X, asking him for a meeting in order to learn more about the suspicious death. However, the Khoni prison governor, A.L-iani, had never allowed the lawyer inside the prison. After the death of the applicant's son, X himself had become the target of the makurebelis, who had demanded that, as someone close to the deceased, he repay his debt or have it repaid by the family. Not being able to repay the debt, X had been beaten by the two makurebelis on 25 November 2005. He had therefore been forced to call the deceased's father to attempt to obtain the required amount.

Thus, the \u201ckitty\u201d was established as an obligatory \u201ctax\u201d with the connivance of the prison authorities, which also benefited personally, and was compulsory for all prisoners save the makurebelis, with certain other exceptions. Besides monthly payments, other types of income were also put into the common fund, such as a percentage of any money won by prisoners from gambling. Part of the \u201ckitty\u201d was paid to the prison administration, which, in return, would impose less severe restrictions (for example, permission to play cards, permission for prisoners to leave the cell when they wished to do so, and permission to receive items prohibited by law from visitors, such as mobile phones). If the prison was a \u201cblack zone\u201d, then the \u201ckitty\u201d was also used for various activities of mafia bosses. As to the role of the makurebelis, the applicant submitted that there existed two types of such \u201csupervisors\u201d in prisons \u2013 the cell makurebeli and the building makurebeli. The cell makurebeli monitored the situation within the cell to ensure that his cellmates duly paid their contributions, whilst the building makurebeli operated at a higher level and supervised the process of collecting the \u201ckitty\u201d in the whole prison. A makurebeli was not necessarily a mafia boss either in a \u201cblack zone\u201d or a \u201cred zone\u201d, but an influential prisoner whose authority was tolerated by the prison administration.",

Notably, the site where Zurab Tsintsabadze's body was discovered was not sealed off pending the arrival of the investigators, contrary to Article\u00a0333 \u00a7\u00a01 and Article 335 \u00a7 1 of the CCP (see paragraph 59 above and compare with Vachkovi v.

It is highly regrettable that the investigative, prosecution and judicial authorities failed to give due consideration to that important procedural irregularity, despite the applicant's repeated complaints to that effect (see paragraphs 39 and 41 above). Nor can the Court overlook the fact that, in contrast to the action taken in respect of the other objects allegedly discovered by the prison staff on the site, the investigator inexplicably failed to seal the chairs which, having been reportedly discovered underneath the feet of the hanged prisoner, obviously represented an extremely valuable piece of evidence (see paragraph 11 above).",

It is also regrettable that, contrary to the regional prosecutor's clear and very useful instruction to that end, the Ministry's investigation department never took the trouble to identify and question the security guard at the Khoni prison who, while on duty on the night of 30 September 2005, had been monitoring the storeroom and was thus capable of testifying as to when and with whom the applicant's son had entered it (see paragraph 33 above).",

On the contrary, the authorities confronted them with a fait accompli in providing them, ex post facto, with the NFB's autopsy report establishing the cause of the death. Such a manifest lack of involvement of the applicant in such a significant investigative procedure deprived her of the opportunity to exercise her rights as a civil party, which limited the public scrutiny of the relevant forensic examination, thus tainting the credibility of its findings (see, mutatis mutandis, Beker, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 49 and 51-52).",

In particular, the alternative autopsy report established, along with the strangulation mark on the deceased's neck, another lesion, caused by a blunt object (see paragraph\u00a030 above). Obviously, a further verification of the origins of that additional lesion could have shed light on the well-foundedness of the official version of suicide, on the one hand, and the applicant's allegations of homicide, on the other. It is regrettable that the investigative authority failed adequately to investigate or explain that patent contradiction between the two autopsy reports. For example, as was also suggested by the regional prosecutor (see paragraph 33 above), the investigator could have interviewed the independent experts or even confronted them with the State expert on the issue of the existence and origins of the lesion in question. However, in deciding to rely on the State expert's oral explanations only, the investigator acted one-sidedly in the Court's opinion (see Esat Bayram, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051).",

Firstly, the letter bore a date subsequent to the applicant's death on 30 September 2005, and the investigator's explanation that the applicant's son had \u201cno doubt\u201d mixed up the months was pure guesswork. Secondly, even assuming that he had indeed mistaken the date, it would be incongruous to think that the applicant's son had forgotten the name of his former wife as well, bearing in mind that his passion towards her had supposedly driven him to suicide. Thus, the Court notes that the forename of his former wife was Maka, whereas the impugned letter was addressed to a certain Nino (see paragraphs 7 and 34 above). If the letter was meant to be addressed to the applicant's friend Nino, who had apparently been sending money to the applicant's son in prison (see paragraph 43 above), then it becomes difficult to understand why the investigator never attempted to approach that woman to enquire about the nature of her relationship with the applicant's son. Most importantly, as the applicant complained on several occasions, the authorities failed to notice that the pockets of her son's clothes had been examined by the prison staff immediately upon the discovery of his body, and only three objects \u2013 a packet of cigarettes, a lighter and an analgesic tablet \u2013 had been discovered there (see paragraphs 11 and 39 above). Nor did the investigators take the trouble to verify whether it was possible for the letter, which had supposedly dropped from the deceased's person, to remain unnoticed in the refrigerator of the morgue for more than a month, between 1-3 October and 8 November 2005, given that the established practice was to clean the refrigerator two or three times a month (see paragraphs 16 and 34-36 above). Furthermore, the investigative authorities failed to arrange for an examination of the letter by a forensic handwriting and/or fingerprint expert, as requested by the applicant on several occasions. In this connection, the Government's argument, based only on the NFB's covering letter of 10\u00a0November 2005 (see paragraphs 34-35 and 65 above), that the handwriting had been identified as belonging to the applicant's son remains an unsubstantiated assertion, in the absence of an expert report on the requisite handwriting examination.",

However, his silence could validly be explained, as the inmate noted himself, by the fear factor. The Court, in general, is not oblivious to the well-known illicit practices prevailing in Georgian prisons at the material time and of the consequent fear amongst ordinary prisoners of either mafia bosses or prison administrations (see also the relevant excerpts from the US State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Georgia, paragraph 61 above), the latter being capable of acting, as the applicant eloquently described, through the informally privileged inmates known as makurebelis (see paragraphs\u00a06668 above). In particular, as was also confirmed by the statements of Zurab Tsintsabadze's father, when the latter came to the Khoni prison on 1\u00a0November 2005 to collect his son's body, X approached him as if he wanted to confide something in him but could not do so as the meeting was closely watched by one of the makurebelis in question (see paragraph\u00a068 above). Indeed, the Court does not find it implausible that, being in the hands of the makurebelis and the prison administration, the inmate X, possessing incriminating information against them, was too intimidated to speak up overtly and dared to give the relevant hints to the deceased's parents only during telephone conversations (see paragraphs 43, 46 and 49 above). The same fear factor could also be the reason for the retraction of the incriminating statements against the makurebelis and the prison administration by another inmate, V.M.-shivili, who had apparently also observed the suspicious events preceding Zurab Tsintsabadze's death on 30\u00a0September 2005 (see paragraphs 47, 64 and 57 above).",

Consequently, the Court does not exclude the possibility that the governor's clearly predisposed position could have easily influenced the statements of the prison staff and inmates, including X, since those witnesses in the investigation were under his direct authority and supervision.",

Consequently, the domestic authorities were under a direct obligation to take all the necessary measures for the objective verification of those allegations, which were also confirmed by the results of the Public Defender's Office's own inquiry, including the possibility of bringing charges against the persons incriminated by X (see Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no. 32457/04, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 27 November 2007). Indeed, if a single complaint of extortion sufficed for the immediate initiation of criminal proceedings against X (see paragraph 44 above), then the legitimate question arises as to why so many serious accusations against the makurebelis and the Khoni prison administration, credibly implicating them in Zurab Tsintsabadze's homicide and the cover-up of the crime, did not lead to the initiation of criminal proceedings against them as well.",

Furthermore, despite the serious indications calling for caution as regards those two persons, who in the normal course of events should have been treated as the main suspects in a case of homicide (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a038361/97, \u00a7\u00a0120, ECHR\u00a02002IV), the investigative authority simply accepted their statements, in which V.T.-shvili and Z.L.-iani merely said that they were not makurebelis and denied the existence of the practice of a \u201ckitty\u201d, referring to the unofficial status of their prison (see paragraph 51 above). The authority never sought to undertake any further investigative measures to prove or disprove X's allegations. Thus, for example, it could probably have approached the lawyer N.A-dze who, as disclosed by the case file, had served as a link between the applicant and X and who could thus have appeared to be an additional source of information concerning the wellfoundedness of X's allegations (see paragraphs 32 and 49 above); the applicant's sister could also have been interviewed, as she was apparently aware of the debt owed by her late nephew to the \u201ckitty\u201d (see paragraph\u00a029 above); nor did the investigative authorities take the trouble to verify the allegation that the prison governor, A.L.-iani, was related to one of the suspects, Z.L.-ani, the establishment of which fact would have also been relevant to the verification of alleged collusion between the two (see paragraph 54 above).",

As to the Government's argument that since the Georgian lawyer was a member of the non-profit-making organisation GYLA, the legal assistance in question should automatically be considered to have been rendered free of charge, the Court observes that in a recent Georgian case it found that the teamwork of the lawyers from GYLA and EHRAC in proceedings before the Court could not be left without compensation and that similar evidence of the lawyers' work \u2013 a detailed and credible itemisation of the hours spent \u2013 was acceptable proof of the expenses incurred by the applicant's representatives (see Klaus and Iouri Kiladze v.
