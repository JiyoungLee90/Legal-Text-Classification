In each of these cases the investigations were formally pending at the time when the applications were lodged with the Court. The criminal proceedings in all the cases were suspended and resumed on several occasions throughout the periods concerned. The applicants maintained reasonable contact with the authorities, cooperated with the investigation, and, where appropriate, took steps to inform themselves of the progress of the proceedings and to speed them up, in the hope of a more effective outcome (see paragraphs 34, 36, 90, 121, 145, 177, 191, 237, 247, 248 and 262 above). Given the overall time frame which passed since the abductions and the initiation of the relevant criminal proceedings, as well as the applicants\u2019 active stance in the proceedings and the lack of significant periods of inactivity on their part, the Court is satisfied that the applicants in the above seven cases lodged their applications within reasonable time (see Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey\u00a0[GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7 166, ECHR 2009).",

The first applicant informed the authorities immediately after the events in question and requested assistance in the search for her son. However, from the documents submitted by the applicants it appears that between August 2001 and April 2008, that is to say for more than six years, the investigation was dormant. The Court further notes that the Government did not submit the criminal-investigation-file documents in that case which could have allowed the Court to assess the first applicant\u2019s stance in those proceedings. No explanation was provided for the failure to produce these documents, and their contents were not specified. Therefore, taking into account that the first applicant lodged an official complaint without undue delay and that she consistently gave statements about the abduction of Mr Rumid Isayev during her questioning by the investigators in criminal proceedings concerning the abduction of her two other sons (see paragraph 16 above), the Court considers that the first applicant complied with the six-month requirement.",

Turkey (dec.), nos. 46744/07 et al., \u00a7 58, 1 June 2010). However, in the present case the circumstances in which the applicant\u2019s husband was abducted and then disappeared, were never elucidated and the finding of the body was preceded by a period of four days during which he had been considered missing. The applicant maintained active contact with the investigators throughout the period in question and the investigation and cooperated with them by giving timely and sufficiently detailed account of her husband\u2019s abduction. It appears that she did not perceive this remedy as ineffective but rather expected that the authorities would, of their own motion, provide her with an adequate answer to her serious complaints. It could not be said therefore that the applicant failed to show the requisite diligence by waiting for the pending investigation to yield results (see, for similar reasoning, Dovletukayev and Others v. Russia, nos. 7821/07 and 3\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7 179-81, 24 October 2013).",

Following her persistent complaints, a criminal case was opened three years and six months after the abduction (see paragraph 202 above). There was a discernible lull in the investigation comprising more than six years. Such a long period of inactivity on the part of the authorities could have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the pending investigation. The Court notes however that during that period operational search activities were undertaken (see paragraph 206 above) and that the applicant remained active in trying to establish the whereabouts of her son and to resume the proceedings (see paragraphs 208 and 210 above). It also notes that only in 2011, that is to say eleven years after the abduction, did the investigators question more witnesses to the events (see paragraph 207 above). The Court therefore considers that it was reasonable for the applicant to wait for developments that could have resolved crucial factual or legal issues (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2012). The delay in the opening of the criminal case, or the lull in the proceedings, therefore, cannot be interpreted as her failure to comply with the six-month requirement (contrast Utsmiyeva and Others v. Russia (dec.), no. 31179/11, \u00a7\u00a7 34-40, 26 August 2014).",

Drawing inferences from the Government\u2019s failure to submit documents which were in their exclusive possession or to provide another plausible explanation of the events in question, the Court considers that Mr Rumid Isayev was abducted by State service personnel after his arrest at the checkpoint (see, for similar reasoning, Israilova and Others v.

The Court further notes that the account of events submitted by the first applicant was based partially on witness statements (see paragraph 114 above), and that the eyewitnesses to the incident had not been questioned despite the prosecutor\u2019s explicit orders to this end (see paragraph 116 above). The first applicant kept the authorities abreast of developments, in particular concerning calls from unknown men who offered information about her husband in exchange for money (see paragraph 109 above). Having found that Mr Kh.M., allegedly an agent of a law-enforcement authority, had been involved in the abduction the first applicant consistently maintained his involvement in the abduction before the authorities and then in her statements to the Court (contrast Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, \u00a7 77, 17 June 2010).

Therefore, in the absence of another plausible explanation of the events on the part of the Government, the Court considers that the applicants have presented a prima facie case that Mr Musa Bamatgiriyev had been abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by them.",

Whether a failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on specific evidence, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.

Therefore, the Government\u2019s argument concerning the applicability of Article 5 of the Convention instead of Article 2 is inconsistent. However, leaving aside the contradictory nature of the Government\u2019s position in this regard and assuming that the applicants\u2019 abducted relatives were under the control of State agents after abduction, then the period of time which has elapsed since each person was placed in detention, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may, along with other elements of circumstantial evidence before the Court, provide grounds to conclude that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. The Court considers that such a situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere \u201cirregular detention\u201d in violation of Article 5. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 86, and Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2000 VI). Accordingly, the Court finds that Article 2 of the Convention applies and that the Government\u2019s objection in that connection should be rejected.",
