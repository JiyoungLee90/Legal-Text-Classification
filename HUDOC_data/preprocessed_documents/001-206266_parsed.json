The court furthermore stated that her claim was in any event ill-founded. Relying on a video recording of the event of 12\u00a0October 2013, the court established that the police had interfered with the public gathering because of the conflict between the demonstrators and counter-demonstrators. The court found that the applicant had been one of the active participants in that conflict. It therefore concluded that her arrest had been lawful. The court was not convinced by witness evidence stating that the applicant herself had not breached public order because the witnesses belonged to the same group of demonstrators as the applicant. The court furthermore concluded that her arrest had been lawful, as its duration had not exceeded forty-eight hours (the maximum length of administrative detention provided by Article 27.5 of the CAO). Lastly, the court found that the applicant\u2019s allegation regarding the authorities\u2019 failure to ensure the personal safety of the demonstrators had been unsubstantiated by evidence. It noted that about 550 police officers had been deployed by the authorities and that no harm had been caused to the applicant.",

The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a044158/98, \u00a7 92, 17\u00a0February 2004; Identoba and Others v. Georgia, no. 73235/12, \u00a7 93, 12\u00a0May 2015; and Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania, no. 41288/15, \u00a7 107, 14\u00a0January 2020). Referring to the hallmarks of a \u201cdemocratic society\u201d, the Court has attached particular importance to pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness. In that context, it has held that although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of the majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 25, \u00a7\u00a063; S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v.

Genuine, effective freedom of peaceful assembly cannot, therefore, be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere: a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the object and purpose of Article 11 of the Convention. This provision sometimes requires positive measures to be taken, even in the sphere of relations between individuals, if need be (see\u00a0Plattform\u00a0\u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v.\u00a0Austria, 21 June 1988, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 139; Wilson and the National Union of Journalists and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a030668/96,\u00a030671/96\u00a0and\u00a030678/96, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2002V; Ouranio Toxo v.

That positive obligation is of particular importance for persons holding unpopular views or belonging to minorities, because they are more vulnerable to victimisation (see B\u0105czkowski and Others v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a01543/06, \u00a7 64, 3\u00a0May 2007).",

However, this is not the only facet of the prohibition of discrimination in Article 14. The right not to be discriminated against in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under the Convention is also violated when States, without an objective and reasonable justification, fail to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different (see\u00a0Thlimmenos v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no.\u00a034369/97, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000IV;\u00a0D.H. and Others v.\u00a0the Czech Republic [GC], no.\u00a057325/00, \u00a7\u00a0175, ECHR 2007IV;\u00a0Kuri\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Slovenia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a026828/06, \u00a7 288, ECHR 2012; Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and\u00a053134/99, \u00a7 35, 10\u00a0May 2007; Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a048420/10, 15 January 2013; and J.D. and A v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a032949/17 and 34614/17, \u00a7 84, 24 October 2019). The prohibition deriving from Article\u00a014 will therefore also give rise to positive obligations for the Contracting States to make necessary distinctions between persons or groups whose circumstances are relevantly and significantly different. In the case of Identoba (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 100) the Court considered that the State had violated its obligations under the principle of non-discrimination due to the failure to protect demonstrators from homophobic violence and to launch an effective investigation.",
