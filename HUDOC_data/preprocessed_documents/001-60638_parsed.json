By the time of the Revolution in 1789 there were seventy-three attorneys at the King's Bench. The Revolution brought their activities to an end. They became counsel at the Tribunal of Cassation that was created in 1790, and subsequently, in 1804, members of the Court of Cassation Bar. Another group of lawyers practised at the Conseil d'Etat. The two groups were merged by an ordinance of 10 September 1817. That ordinance, which for many years served as the Bar Council Charter, was amended by a decree of 28 October 1991 (which codified the conditions of access to the profession and has since undergone a number of subsequent amendments; see also the law of 20 March 1948, which made women eligible to enter the profession, and the decree of 15 March 1978, allowing lawyers to practise in professional partnerships).

In addition, the right to conduct one's own defence was a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 6 (see Foucher v. France, judgment of 18 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II) that was also applicable in proceedings before the Court of Cassation. He said that in Voisine v. France (no. 27362/95, 8 February 2000) the Court had noted that the applicant in that case, who had not been represented by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, had not benefited from the practice whereby advocates-general at the Court of Cassation informed counsel to the parties of the tenor of their submissions before the hearing. The applicant's rights had therefore been infringed, as he had been unable to establish the tenor of the advocate-general's submissions or to reply to them and had not been summoned to the hearing. The fact that he had not applied for legal aid could not constitute a waiver of his right to adversarial process. Litigants could not therefore, without a breach of the provisions of the Convention, be treated differently depending on whether or not they were assisted by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar.",

They contended that they had been deprived of unity of time and place, as their pleadings had been lodged at the beginning of the proceedings before the Court of Cassation, whereas the advocate-general had made his submissions on the day of the hearing. Furthermore, appellants in the Court of Cassation had to make their representations in writing whereas the advocate-general made his submissions orally. The solution would therefore be to permit appellants in the Court of Cassation to take part in all the stages of the proceedings before the Criminal Division, including the hearing, with the assistance of a lawyer of their choosing, that is to say without being required to instruct a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. On that point, they challenged the monopoly of the members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, pointing out, inter alia, firstly, that lawyers practising at a European bar had sufficient technical expertise to take part in proceedings before the Court of Cassation, as attested by the fact that they were entitled to appear before all other national and European courts and, secondly, that the monopoly on the rights to address the Court of Cassation was not based on any provision of domestic law.",

Accordingly, convicted persons who appealed to the Court of Cassation were no longer \u201c[persons] charged with a criminal offence\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention because, as a matter of principle, their guilt had already been established by the courts below. The guarantees under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) should not therefore extend to stages of the proceedings, such as an appeal to the Court of Cassation, that did not concern the determination of the charge. In any event, the right to conduct one's own defence could be regulated by domestic law (see, among other authorities, Croissant v. Germany, judgment of 25 September 1992, Series A no. 237-B; Correia de Matos v. Portugal (dec.), no. 48188/99, ECHR 2001-XII). The Government accordingly concluded that the Convention did not prohibit States from making an accused's representation by a lawyer compulsory for certain aspects of criminal proceedings before trial and appeal courts and that, a fortiori, there was nothing to guarantee appellants in the Court of Cassation a right to conduct their own defence at all stages of the proceedings before the Criminal Division of that court.",

The very specific nature of appeals to the Court of Cassation served to explain the special features of the procedure followed by that court, the desirability of using specialist lawyers and, conversely, the limited importance given to oral hearings. The ordinary procedure in both civil and criminal appeals to the Court of Cassation entailed in principle compulsory representation by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, a rule that did not in any respect contravene the provisions of the Convention. However, as an exception to that rule, French law did not make representation compulsory for the written stage of appeals to the Court of Cassation by persons appealing against conviction. Such persons were entitled to sign the notice of appeal and to lodge a signed pleading in person in accordance with the statutory rules. Regard being had to the essentially written nature of the procedure, all appellants therefore had the same rights to put forward their arguments, whether they were acting in person, or were assisted, either by a member of the ordinary bar or by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. In addition, whether drafted by an appellant in person or signed by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, the written submissions crystallised once and for all the arguments that could be made against the impugned decision, such that no further points could be added orally. It was neither necessary nor usual for members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar to make oral submissions: since oral submissions were optional under Article 602 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar did not even attend hearings, save in the very rare instances when they wished to address the court at hearings in which the argument was always highly technical and largely incomprehensible to the layperson. Although appellants to the Court of Cassation could nevertheless make an application under an ordinance of 15\u00a0January 1826 for permission to appear in person, without being represented by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, such applications were very rarely granted, as they were of no real benefit to an appellant lacking the requisite knowledge of the law governing appeals to the Court of Cassation or of the techniques used in such appeals. Offering appellants the right to make oral representations at the hearing would therefore only create an appearance that the adversarial principle was being observed, whereas that principle constituted a right that was intended to be concrete and effective, not purely formal. Moreover, in Voisine, cited above, the Court had acknowledged that the special nature of the procedure before the Court of Cassation could justify the monopoly of the right to make oral representations being reserved to specialist lawyers, notwithstanding its finding of a violation of Article 6 for the failure to communicate the advocate-general's submissions. Indeed, in Reinhardt and Slimane-Ka\u00efd (judgment of 31 March 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 666, \u00a7 106) the Court had said that the practice currently used, whereby advocates-general informed the parties' lawyers prior to the hearing of the tenor of their submissions and the parties' lawyers were entitled in cases where there was an oral hearing to reply to them, afforded the parties an opportunity of apprising themselves of the advocate-general's submissions and of commenting on them in a satisfactory manner. In the Government's submission, only a practice of that type could guarantee an effective debate. Incidentally, statistical data for the year 2000 clearly showed that unassisted appellants were four times less likely to be successful in an appeal to the Court of Cassation than parties assisted by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. That was a reflection of the difficulty experienced by unrepresented appellants in formulating valid points of law.",

At the material time, it was the practice systematically to grant provisional legal aid in criminal cases to convicted persons who had lodged an appeal to the Court of Cassation. That practice had now been abandoned save in exceptional cases, but legal-aid applications were dealt with very rapidly. Accordingly, appellants who, like the applicants, decided not to be represented by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, either chosen by them or assigned by the legal-aid office, deliberately chose the written procedure rather than a different procedure offering the advantages of assistance by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar.

But even in the former case the written submissions crystallise all the arguments against the impugned decision. Oral submissions are optional, under Article 602 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and, in practice, members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar do not attend hearings, save in very rare cases (see paragraph\u00a037 above). It has to be acknowledged that some High Contracting Parties to the Convention operate a similar system, whereas others require appellants to be represented by a lawyer. In the Court's view, such an option is undoubtedly sufficient to justify a difference in procedure, since whether or not the appellant is represented depends not on a rule of automatic application but on the appellant's own choice. Self-evidently, the fact that the appellant has made that choice and, consequently, waived the advantages to be gained from having the assistance of a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Colozza v. Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, pp. 14-15, \u00a7 28). The Court considers that French law affords sufficient guarantees in that connection. In any event, Mr Adoud and Mr Bosoni were assisted by a member of the ordinary bar who was fully competent to inform them of the consequences of their choice which, in the circumstances of the instant case, was therefore freely made and conscious. The same applies to Mr Meftah, who was advised by a citizens advice bureau during the proceedings before the domestic courts. ",

Admittedly, the applicants in those cases were represented by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. However, recently in Frett\u00e9 v. France (no. 36515/97, ECHR 2002-I) the Court ruled that those requirements applied also to a case in which a litigant before the Conseil d'Etat had elected, with the Conseil d'Etat's permission, not to be represented. The Court noted that he had been unable to ascertain the general tenor of the Government Commissioner's submissions and had therefore been deprived of the possibility of lodging a note to the court in deliberations in reply.

Theoretically at least, in all these cases, litigants may represent themselves, ask to be informed of the tenor of the advocate-general's submissions and lodge a note to the court in deliberations.

It is correct, as pointed out in paragraph 46 of the judgment, that there are a number of High Contracting Parties to the Convention in which representation by a lawyer is compulsory for proceedings before a similar high court. In the latter case, I would have no difficulty accepting that the system is compatible with Article 6 and that no problem of a possible breach of this Article arises as a result of not allowing individual appellants to address the court concerned in person. The participation of all the parties in the proceedings through a lawyer places them in a position of equality and secures them effective participation as litigants through their lawyers (see Dombo Beheer B.V. v.\u00a0the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1993, Series A, no. 274, p. 19, \u00a7\u00a033). However, once the system accepts that a party does not have to be legally represented before the Court of Cassation, fairness, in my view, requires (see Dombo Beheer B.V., ibid.) that the system place such litigant in the same position, as far as rights and liberties are concerned, as a litigant represented by a lawyer.

In \nparticular, as regards the possibility of being heard by the Court of Cassation an ordinance of 15 January 1826, which is still in force, provides that the parties may be heard after obtaining the permission of the court. No distinction between parties who are legally represented and those who are not is made in that ordinance. Yet, in practice the Court of Cassation has, through its settled case-law, established a general principle of not allowing individual litigants who are not legally represented by the prescribed specialist lawyers to participate in the oral hearing, regardless of the particular circumstances of their case (see paragraphs 26 and 27 of the judgment).

Otherwise, were it necessary for every alternative procedure to comply with all the requirements of Article 6, such simplified forms of procedure as the Italian summary judgment (giudizio abbreviato) or, a fortiori, the procedure on a guilty plea would have to be regarded as being contrary to the Convention. As a result, procedures that are essential for the administration of justice could no longer be used. However, the Court has previously found the choice of the summary judgment procedure in Italy to be compatible with Article 6 of the Convention (see Kwiatkowska v. Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000) and the Commission reached a like conclusion with regard to the procedure on a guilty plea (see X v. the United Kingdom, no. 5076/71, Commission decision of 23 March 1972, and R.O. v. the United Kingdom, no. 23094/93, Commission decision of 11 May 1994, unreported).",
