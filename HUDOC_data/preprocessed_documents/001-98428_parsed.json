In this respect, ECRI would like to express its concern about a draft law on the modification and completion of certain legislative acts adopted in its first reading by Parliament on 11 October 2007. According to this draft law, only persons having exclusively Moldovan citizenship are entitled to work in senior positions in the government and in several public services. From the information it has received, ECRI understands that if this draft law enters into force as it stands, Moldovan citizens with multiple citizenship would be seriously disadvantaged compared with other Moldovan citizens in access to public functions. It thus appears that, if the law enters into force as such, this could lead to discrimination, i.e. unjustified differential treatment on the grounds of citizenship. ECRI understands that a wide-ranging debate is occurring within  at the time of writing this report as far as this draft law is concerned and that many sources both at the national and international level have stressed the need to revise the text thoroughly before its final adoption in order to ensure its compatibility with national and international standards.",

Relying on O\u010di\u010d v. Croatia ((dec.), no. 46306/99, ECHR 1999-VIII), they further contended that the applicant\u2019s claim was an actio popularis seeking review of legislation in the abstract as at the time of his application to the Court, the Law in question had never been applied to him to his detriment. The cases to which the Chamber referred to support its conclusion that the applicant was a victim were distinguished by the Government because, in those cases, unlike in the present case, the Law being challenged had entered into force. Although the Court had considered an applicant a potential victim of an enacted Law which had never been applied to him, it had never before found an applicant to be a victim or a potential victim of a draft law. The Government relied on The Christian Federation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in France v. France ((dec.), no. 53430/99, ECHR 2001-XI), where the Court observed that it had accepted the notion of a potential victim in cases where the applicant was not in a position to demonstrate that the legislation about which he complained had actually been applied to him because of the secret nature of the measures it authorised (see Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28); where a Law punishing homosexual acts was likely to be applied to a certain category of the population, to which the applicant belonged (see Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1981, Series A no.\u00a045); and, lastly, where the forced removal of aliens had already been decided on but not yet carried out and enforcement of the measure would have exposed the persons concerned to the risk of treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 in the country of destination (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7\u00a0July 1989, Series A no. 161) or would have infringed the right to respect for family life (see Beldjoudi v. France, 26 March 1992, Series A no.\u00a0234A). The Government argued that States Parties had not agreed when ratifying the Convention that draft laws could be challenged before the Court. If such challenges were possible, where there was no possibility at domestic level to challenge a draft law applicants would be encouraged to come directly to the Court, breaching the principle of subsidiarity and leading to a large increase in the number of cases before the Court.",

However, it is open to a person to contend that a Law violates his rights, in the absence of an individual measure of implementation, if he is required either to modify his conduct or risks being prosecuted or if he is a member of a class of people who risk being directly affected by the legislation (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 34, ECHR 2008; Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v.

Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a037). In assessing whether an applicant can claim to be a genuine victim of an alleged violation, account should be taken not only of the formal position at the time when the application was lodged with the Court but of all the circumstances of the case in question, including any developments prior to the date of the examination of the case by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Akdivar and Others v.

In this respect, it refers to its case-law on loss of victim status where it has examined objections raised by respondent Governments that steps taken by or in the respondent State subsequent to the lodging of the application with the Court afforded adequate redress for the alleged violation such that the applicant could no longer be considered a victim for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention (see, for example, Amuur v.\u00a0France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 36, Reports 1996III; Chevrol v. France, no.\u00a049636/99, \u00a7\u00a7 37-43, ECHR 2003III; Siliadin v. France, no. 73316/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 63, ECHR 2005VII; and Ramazanova and Others v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a044363/02, \u00a7\u00a7 36-39, 1 February 2007). In a number of cases, applications have been ruled inadmissible or struck out of the list where such subsequent steps have provided adequate redress to the applicant, who has accordingly lost his victim status (see, for example, Conrad v. Germany, no.\u00a013020/87, Commission decision of 13 April 1988, DR 56; Caraher v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 24520/94, ECHR 2000I; and Ohlen v.\u00a0Denmark (striking out), no. 63214/00, \u00a7\u00a7 28-31, 24 February 2005).

Further and in any event, even before his election the knowledge that, if elected, he would be required to take steps to renounce his Romanian nationality if he wished to take his seat in Parliament undoubtedly affected him throughout his electoral campaign. He may, moreover, have lost votes since the electorate was aware that there was a chance that he would decide not to take his seat if that would mean losing his status as a dual national.

They pointed out that when the ECN was ratified in 1999, the number of Moldovans holding dual nationality was insignificant as it was not permitted under the law in force at the time (see paragraph 22 above). Accordingly, no reservation in respect of Article 17 was thought necessary. They further explained that in 1999,  was not a parliamentary republic as it is today, but a semi-presidential republic. The legislature therefore played a greater role in the State today than it did then. Although of the other Council of Europe member States which banned dual nationals from sitting as MPs, Azerbaijan, Lithuania and Malta had not ratified the ECN and Bulgaria had lodged a reservation to Article 17, Moldova could simply denounce the ECN and, if it wished to do so, re-ratify it subject to a reservation in respect of Article 17.

The example of Mrs\u00a0Savga (see paragraph 144 above) was evidence of the arbitrary application of the new Law. In the applicant\u2019s submission, it was relevant for the Court whether the effect of rules governing elections excluded a group of persons from participating in the political life of a country, whether discrepancies created by a particular electoral system could be considered arbitrary or abusive and whether the system tended to favour one political party over another (referring to, inter alia, Aziz v.\u00a0Cyprus, no. 69949/01, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2004-V, and Yumak and Sadak, cited above, \u00a7 121).

They further emphasised that a number of Laws passed between 1991 and 2000 did not impose a condition of single citizenship for candidacy for certain public posts. One example was Law no. 720 of 18 September 1991, regulating presidential elections. The Romanian Government, relying on \u017ddanoka v.\u00a0Latvia ([GC], no. 58278/00, \u00a7 135, ECHR 2006-IV) and \u0100damsons v.\u00a0Latvia (no. 3669/03, \u00a7 123, 24 June 2008), argued that even if a condition of single citizenship could have been justified in the early years following Moldovan independence, with the passage of time and the consolidation of democracy, such a condition could no longer be justified. It was therefore difficult to understand the position of Moldova, which for three parliaments had allowed multiple citizens to become MPs but which now, some seventeen years later, considered the possession of another citizenship to constitute a grave danger to Moldova and assimilated dual nationality with treason.

In a democratic State committed to the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, it is clear that the very role of MPs, and in particular those members from opposition parties, is to represent the electorate by ensuring the accountability of the government in power and assessing their policies. Further, the pursuit of different, and at times diametrically opposite, goals is not only acceptable but necessary in order to promote pluralism and to give voters choices which reflect their political opinions. As the Court has previously noted, protection of opinions and the freedom to express them is one of the objectives of the freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, and in particular Articles 10 and 11. This principle is all the more important in relation to MPs in view of their essential role in ensuring pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy (see, regarding the importance of freedom of expression for political parties in general, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2003-II).",

Any other view would undermine the ability of MPs to represent the views of their constituents, in particular minority groups. The Court has previously emphasised that there can be no justification for hindering a political group solely because it seeks to debate in public the situation of part of the State\u2019s population and to take part in the nation\u2019s political life in order to find, according to democratic rules, solutions capable of satisfying everyone concerned. Similarly, in the present case, the fact that Moldovan MPs with dual nationality may wish to pursue a political programme which is considered by some to be incompatible with the current principles and structures of the  does not make it incompatible with the rules of democracy. A fundamental aspect of democracy is that it must allow diverse political programmes to be proposed and debated, even where they call into question the way a State is currently organised, provided that they do not harm democracy itself (see Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045 and 47, Reports 1998-III, and Manole and Others v. Moldova, no.\u00a013936/02, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2009).",

In this regard, the Court observes that Law no.\u00a0273 was the third aspect of an electoral reform package, whose other measures consisted of raising the electoral threshold and banning electoral blocs (see paragraph 37 above). All the measures proposed had a detrimental impact on the opposition, which had previously found it difficult to secure enough votes to meet the threshold to enter Parliament and had succeeded in doing so only through the formation of electoral blocs (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above). The results of the April 2009 elections, in which of the 101 MPs elected, 21 were negatively affected by Law no. 273 and all 21 were opposition MPs (see paragraph 59 above), demonstrate the disproportionate effect of the new Law. The applicant\u2019s allegation that the Law exempts from its scope the residents of Transdniestria, a large number of whom hold Russian nationality, raises further concerns about the true aim of the legislation (however, see further paragraph 187 below concerning the ambiguity surrounding this exemption). Finally, the Court considers it significant that the amendments were introduced less than a year before the general elections (see paragraph\u00a044 above). Following the April 2009 elections, a further amendment was introduced to the electoral legislation, which was again criticised by opposition parties as being intended to improve the prospects of the governing party and its political allies (see paragraph\u00a063 above). In this regard, the Court refers to the Venice Commission Code of Practice in Electoral Matters, which warns of the risk that frequent changes to electoral legislation or changes introduced just before elections will be perceived, rightly or wrongly, as an attempt to manipulate electoral laws to the advantage of the party in power (see paragraph\u00a086 above). It is also significant that the Monitoring Committee and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed concern at the changes to the electoral legislation, which they considered restricted opportunities for political forces to participate effectively in the political process and thus weakened pluralism (see paragraphs 47 and 49-50 above).",

Bulgaria currently adopts the same approach as  (see paragraph 87 above).  continues to prohibit dual nationality (see paragraph 90 above).

In the circumstances, the Court considers the argument that the measure was necessary to protect Moldova\u2019s laws, institutions and national security to be far less persuasive. In order for the recent introduction of general restrictions on electoral rights to be justified, particularly compelling reasons must be advanced. However, the Government have not provided an explanation of why concerns have recently emerged regarding the loyalty of dual citizens and why such concerns were not present when the law was first changed to allow dual citizenship. The Government argued that the numbers involved \u2013 around one-fifth of current MPs hold or are in the process of applying for a second nationality \u2013 are sufficient to justify the approach taken (see paragraph 140 above).

Sanctions for illegal conduct or conduct which threatens national interests are likely to have a preventative effect and enable any particular threat posed by an identified individual to be addressed. The Government have not suggested that security clearance for access to confidential documents is inadequate to ensure protection of confidential and sensitive information. It should be noted that both of these measures are concerned with identifying a credible threat to State interest in particular circumstances based on specific information, rather than operating on a blanket assumption that all dual nationals pose a threat to national security and independence.

It is appropriate to consider in this context the objection ratione materiae raised by the respondent Government (see paragraphs\u00a0131-32 above). The Court emphasises that it has consistently held that it must take into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. It is for the Court to decide which international instruments and reports it considers relevant and how much weight to attribute to them. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see, inter alia, Demir and Baykara, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, and Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 95). In the present case, the Court considers the provisions of the ECN, the conclusions and reports of ECRI and the Venice Commission (see paragraphs 45 and 51 above) and the resolutions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see paragraphs\u00a048-50 above) to be relevant to its assessment of whether Law no.\u00a0273 is proportionate. In particular, in making reference to the ECN, the Court is not seeking to examine the applicant\u2019s right to hold dual nationality but rather the right of the respondent State to introduce restrictions on his right to take his seat following his election as a result of his dual nationality and the compatibility of any such restriction with Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",

Concerns were expressed as to the discriminatory impact of Law no. 273 as well as its impact on the ability of a number of political forces to participate effectively in the political process. The Court further takes note of Article 17 of the ECN and Moldova\u2019s undertaking pursuant to that Article to ensure that Moldovan nationals in possession of another nationality have the same rights and duties as other Moldovan nationals (see paragraph 85 above).",

In this respect, the Court emphasises the disproportionate effect of the Law on the parties which were at the time of its introduction in opposition (see paragraph\u00a0168 above). Pluralism and democracy must be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise, which necessarily entails various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, \u00a7 45, Reports 1998I, and Leyla \u015eahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7\u00a0108, ECHR 2005XI). In order to promote such dialogue and exchange of views necessary for an effective democracy, it is important to ensure access to the political arena for opposition parties on terms which allow them to represent their electorate, draw attention to their preoccupations and defend their interests (see Christian Democratic People\u2019s Party v. Moldova, no.\u00a028793/02, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2006-II).",

The introduction of the prohibition in the present case shortly before the elections, at a time when the governing party\u2019s percentage of the vote was in decline (see paragraphs 31-44 above), further militates against the proportionality of the measure.",
