The case originated in an application (no. 32800/12) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Aurel Rădulescu (“the applicant”), on 25 April 2012.
The applicant was represented by Ms N. Popescu, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the material conditions of his detention and the lack of segregation of smokers from nonsmokers in the cells he occupied had breached his rights guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention.
On 17 January 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1954. At present he is serving his prison sentence in Jilava Prison.
On 11 October 2011 the High Court of Cassation and Justice sentenced the applicant to ten years’ imprisonment.
Since 23 September 2009 the applicant has been held in a number of different detention centres. Initially he was detained in Bucharest police station and then transferred to Rahova and Jilava Prisons. In respect of the establishments in which he was detained, the applicant alleged that he had been kept in overcrowded cells in poor conditions of hygiene. He also alleged that, despite the fact that he was a non-smoker, he had been detained with inmates who smoked inside the cell in all three prisons.

Excerpts from the relevant legal provisions concerning the rights of detainees, namely Law no. 275/2006, and from the relevant parts of the reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) on prison conditions are given in the case of Iacov Stanciu v. Romania, (no. 35972/05, 24 July 2012).
The relevant parts of the report of the Romanian Helsinki Committee of 12 June 2008 in respect of the conditions of detention in Jilava Prison read as follows:
“... the basement of the old part of the prison building was completely flooded with waste water ... Consequently, rats and cockroaches (and bed bugs according to some detainees) have infested the cells in that part of the building. Moreover, most cells were also infested with lice, mainly due to worn out bed mattresses. No delousing operation could be effective as long as the mattresses were not replaced ... The prison management claimed it had engaged several pest control companies, which all gave up after taking note of the situation in the prison. Another notorious problem was the extremely poor water quality (muddy and filled with impurities) - unfit for drinking and risky even for washing ... In terms of detention space, the total area of detention space was 3034.81 sq. m, while the population was 1460, meaning 2.08 sq. m of available detention space per detainee, half of the minimum norm recommended by the CPT ... The kitchen area was totally unhygienic and the food quality was poor ...”
