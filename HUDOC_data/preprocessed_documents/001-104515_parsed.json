The Court reaffirms its earlier conclusions that the remedies referred to by the Government cannot be regarded as sufficient for a 's obligations under Article\u00a02 or 3 of the Convention as they are aimed at awarding damages rather than identifying and punishing those responsible. In this connection the Court recalls that in cases of wilful ill-treatment or unlawful use of force resulting in death, the breach of Article 2 or 3 cannot be remedied exclusively through an award of compensation to the relatives of the victim (see Leonidis v. , no. 43326/05, \u00a7 46, 8 January 2009). This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful police ill-treatment to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough in the prosecution and punishment of those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity and the general legal prohibitions of killing and torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite their fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Nikolova and Velichkova v. , no. 7888/03, \u00a7 55, 20 December 2007 and the cases cited therein).",

No other steps were taken in the investigation during that period.

As an inmate he suffered injuries during a security operation in Gebze prison. Those injuries bear out his claim of inhuman and degrading treatment. Given the improprieties in the investigation following the applicant's injury, the Government could not be said to have satisfactorily discharged their burden of explaining the injuries. For this reason, we find that Article 3 was violated and we therefore voted with the majority on the question of non-pecuniary damage.",

The applicant was wounded in the foot. This is certainly not life-threatening, but the nature of the wound alone is not decisive for the applicability of Article\u00a02 of the Convention. In fact, in a number of cases the Court has examined complaints under this provision where the alleged victim did not die as a result of the impugned conduct (see Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no.\u00a050385/99, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2004-XI, and Alk\u0131n v. Turkey, no. 75588/01, \u00a7\u00a029, 13 October 2009). In such circumstances, the degree and type of force used and the intention or aim behind the use of force may, among other factors, be relevant in assessing whether in a particular case the State agents' actions in inflicting injury short of death are such as to bring the facts within the scope of the safeguard afforded by Article 2 of the Convention, having regard to the object and purpose pursued by that Article (see Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7 51).",

Where the intervention resulted in killings, the Court considered the application under Article 2 (see G\u00f6mi and Others v. Turkey, no. 35962/97, 21 December 2006, and Peri\u015fan and Others v. Turkey, no. 12336/03, 20\u00a0May 2010); it did so even in a case where the applicant survived the injury to his pancreas (see \u0130smail Altun v. Turkey, no. 22932/02, 21\u00a0September 2010). However, in the case of Peri\u015fan and Others, the complaints under Article 2 of the Convention of those applicants who did not suffer life-threatening injuries were examined from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention.",

Turkey, no. 31866/96, 10 October 2000, see further Kurnaz and Others v. Turkey, no. 36672/97, 24 July 2007). In the present case, the applicant did not substantiate his claim that the other injured inmates had been shot or that firearms had been used on a large scale. The Court did not find established in the present case any facts which would allow us to conclude that the nature of the operations, including the use of force, was comparable to the security operations at  or Bayrampasa prisons. In the absence of an at least potentially lethal wound there is nothing in the case file, apart from the unsubstantiated allegations of the applicant, that would point to a degree and type of force or an intention or aim behind the use of force that would trigger the analysis of the facts under Article 2 on an exceptional basis. Therefore, as no clear issue arises under Article 2 in the present case, the State has no obligation to bear the burden of providing plausible explanations in regard to that Article.",
