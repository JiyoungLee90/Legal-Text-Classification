The land had belonged to the State and hence had not been ownerless at the material time, so the District Court should not have applied the acquisitive prescription rules to the case. As a result, the judgment had damaged the State\u2019s pecuniary interests. The Deputy Prosecutor General further argued that the District Court had been obliged to involve, as parties to the proceedings, the local branch of the Real Estate Registry, as well as the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office as the authority vested with management of land. By failing to do so, and adopting a judgment affecting their rights in their absence, the District Court had also violated the procedural law. The Deputy Prosecutor General requested the Court of Appeal to restore the expired time-limit for appeal, arguing that the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office had not been aware of the judgment of 8 June 2001 and therefore had been deprived of the possibility of lodging an appeal, while the Prosecutor\u2019s Office had been informed about that judgment by the Mayor\u2019s letter of 24 February 2009.",

Furthermore, the fact that the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office had been aware of his becoming the new owner of the plot of land was confirmed by the compulsory payments he had to make for that property. Thus, on the one hand, by virtue of Article 61 of the LC, the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s office had alienated the plot of land to him, received a sum of money and since then had continued to levy property tax and, on the other hand, it now claimed to be unaware of that transaction. Moreover, the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office had been notified of his becoming the new owner of the plot of land by virtue of the Law on the State Registration of Rights in Respect of Property. Hence, the Mayor\u2019s Office had been aware of the registration of his property rights on the basis of the court judgment of 8 June 2001 and of the direct sale of the plot of land, and had not \u2013 as it claimed \u2013 become aware of that judgment from a letter of 24\u00a0February 2009.",

Both the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office and the Real Estate Registry, which had registered his property rights in respect of his property on the basis of that judgment, were public authorities. During all the years when he was considered the owner of the property he had regularly paid property taxes. On at least one occasion, namely on 29 July 2008, a representative of the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office had performed a rectification of the borders of his plot of land. The Government alleged that the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office had become aware of the judgment of 8 June 2001 by a letter from the local branch of the Real Estate Registry dated 24 February 2009, but in reality the Mayor\u2019s Office had been aware of the applicant\u2019s ownership rights much earlier.",

It was therefore unreasonable to claim that the Mayor\u2019s Office had not been, and could have not been, aware of that judgment. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s claim that the judgment had been reversed on the ground of gross violations of substantive and procedural law was erroneous, since the Civil Court of Appeal had not applied Article 207 \u00a7 7 of the CCP but Article 207 \u00a7 5, which specifically protected the rights of third parties. In any event, their argument that a substantive violation of the law justified the reopening of the case after eight years was incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Lastly, the quashing of the final judgment had amounted to an unjustified interference with his property rights in violation of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1. As regards the alleged procedural violation of the law, the Shengavit District Court had been free to involve the Mayor\u2019s Office as a party of its own motion, and the fact that it had failed to do so should not have had negative consequences for him and resulted in the quashing of the judgment in his favour after eight years.",

Under the domestic law, land which was not in the ownership of physical or legal persons or the local communities belonged to the State, and it was the Mayor of Yerevan who was vested with the power to allocate land in Yerevan. Thus, the Shengavit District Court had been obliged to involve the Mayor of Yerevan as a party to the proceedings since the dispute concerned State property and affected the State\u2019s ownership rights, which it had failed to do. The Deputy Prosecutor General also had the right to appeal against this judgment since under the Constitution he was entitled to act in cases where State interests were at stake. The Court of Appeal had found their motions seeking to restore the missed time-limit to be valid, since both authorities had become aware of the judgment of 8 June 2001 from a letter of the local branch of the Real Estate Registry of 24 February 2009 and had been entitled to appeal against it within three months, by virtue of Article 207 of the CCP. Thus, by admitting their out-of-time appeals and eventually quashing the judgment of 8 June 2001, the Court of Appeal sought to correct a gross procedural error which had impaired the very essence of administration of justice.",

Secondly, the rectification of the borders had been performed by an employee of a State Closed Joint-Stock Company founded by the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office, and not the Mayor\u2019s Office itself. Thirdly, all judgments in Armenia were adopted on behalf of the State and this did not mean that all the public authorities acting on behalf of the State were aware of all such judgments, unless they were specifically notified. Finally, the Real Estate Registry, when registering the applicant\u2019s ownership rights, was not obliged to verify ex officio the lawfulness of the judgment presented by him.

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, inter alia, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999VII). Legal certainty presupposes respect for the principle of res judicata, that is the principle of the finality of judgments. This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for reexamination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003-IX).",

It decided to accept the submissions of the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office and the General Prosecutor, arguing that they had become aware of the judgment of 8 June 2001 only in February 2009, and to admit for examination their appeals lodged in May 2009 (see paragraph 21 above), which eventually led to a fresh examination of the case and the quashing of the final judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour (see paragraph 22 above).",

Ukraine, no.\u00a061333/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-38, 2 November 2004, and Pravednaya v. Russia, no.\u00a069529/01, \u00a7\u00a7 27-34, 18 November 2004), but the reopening of proceedings after a considerable lapse of time on the ground that an affected party had not been aware of them, which in essence amounted to renewing the timelimit for an ordinary appeal. The Court has previously considered it appropriate to uphold the principle of legal certainty in a number of similar cases where this fundamental principle was undermined through the use of such procedural mechanisms as the extension or the renewal of the timelimit for an ordinary appeal (see Ponomaryov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 3236/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42, 3 April 2008, and Bezrukovy v. Russia, no. 34616/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a033-44, 10 May 2012). The Court acknowledged \u2013 and found it reasonable \u2013 in those cases that the legal systems of many member States provide for a possibility to renew procedural time-limits if there are valid reasons to do so. At the same time, if the time-limit for ordinary appeal procedure is renewed after a considerable lapse of time and for reasons which do not appear to be particularly persuasive, such a decision can infringe the principle of legal certainty. While the renewal or the extension of the timelimit for an ordinary appeal remains primarily within the domestic courts\u2019 discretion, such discretion is not unlimited. The courts are required in every case to indicate the reasons for their decision, as well as to verify whether the reasons for renewal of a time-limit for appeal could justify the interference with the principle of res judicata, especially when the domestic legislation does not limit the courts\u2019 discretion either on the time or on the grounds for the renewal of the time-limits (see Ponomaryov, cited above, and Bezrukovy, cited above). When the domestic law does not contain any prohibitive limit in this respect, an allegation of abusive renewal of the time-limit for an appeal against a final judgment calls for close supervision by the Court. Its task is to assess the particular circumstances of the case at hand and the manner in which the pertinent domestic regulations were actually applied (ibid., \u00a7 35).",

As for the grounds for admitting the out-of-time appeals, as already noted above, the Court of Appeal was motivated by the protection of the interests of a third party, in this case the State represented by the Yerevan Mayor\u2019s Office and the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, whose rights had been affected by the final judgment. The Court has previously found that the protection of the rights and interests of third persons is a legitimate consideration which may justify the quashing of a final and binding judgment. In particular, it found that there had been a \u201cfundamental defect\u201d justifying the reopening of proceedings if the impugned judgments had affected the rights and legal interests of a person who, like in the present case, had not been a party to the proceedings in question (see Protsenko v. Russia, no. 13151/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02934, 31 July 2008) or who had been unable to participate in them effectively (see Tishkevich v.

The Court has no reasons to doubt that the rights of the State, which was not represented in the proceedings in question, were affected by the final judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour, as interpreted by the Court of Appeal and not disputed by the applicant. It accepts that the reopening of proceedings on such a ground is in principle a legitimate consideration justifying a departure from the principle of legal certainty.",

He contested, in particular, the allegation that the authorities acting on behalf of the State had become aware of the judgment of 8\u00a0June 2001 and its effects only after a delay of almost eight years. The Government disputed those arguments. The Court considers that it was for the domestic courts, notably the Court of Appeal, to address such questions, to examine and assess the evidence adduced and to establish that fact. It notes, however, that the Court of Appeal appears to have failed to carry out any examination of this issue and to address any of the applicant\u2019s arguments in that respect, despite its controversial and disputable nature and despite what was at stake. It failed to provide any reasons whatsoever for its decision to accept the Mayor\u2019s and the Deputy Prosecutor General\u2019s submissions and to admit their appeals lodged almost eight years after the judgment had become final, its entire reasoning amounting to the mere finding that those submissions \u201cwere substantiated\u201d (see paragraph 21 above).",

The Court of Appeal further failed to address the Deputy General Prosecutor\u2019s claim that it had become aware of the judgment of 8 June 2001 from the Mayor\u2019s letter of 24 February 2009, despite its being in direct contradiction with the Mayor\u2019s argument of having been notified of that judgment only on 18 March 2009 (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above). Lastly, it failed to address in any way the question of when the authorities in question \u201cought to have become aware\u201d of the adoption of the judgment of 8 June 2001, one of the conditions contained in Article 207 \u00a7 5 of the CCP which could be seen as providing an important additional safeguard against any abusive use of the right guaranteed under that Article.",
