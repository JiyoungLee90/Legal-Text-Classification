Two forensic examinations had established no connection between that beating and the latter\u2019s death. The experts had examined but dismissed the possible traumatic origin of the kidney disease. There had been no other evidence that the applicants\u2019 son had been ill-treated. The material concerning the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s death had been disjoined from the criminal case against Mr\u00a0D., and then a separate pre-investigation inquiry into his death had been carried out. That pre-investigation inquiry had been carried out by an independent authority \u2013 the military prosecutor\u2019s office \u2013 and it had been full and objective. Within the framework of the preinvestigation inquiry five forensic examinations had been carried out. According to the experts small misdiagnoses which had occurred had not been a direct cause of the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s death because the treatment provided to him at all stages had had no contraindications, and had been timely, correct and full. The cause of his death had been acute tubular interstitial nephritis, aggravated by acute renal failure and acute pneumonia.",

It was not until 3\u00a0September 2005 when the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s state of health had deteriorated even further, that he was allowed to see a doctor. According to the medical records made following the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s admission to the medical unit on 3 September 2005, he had been ill for the previous three days (see paragraph 9). Based on that record the civilian experts concluded that the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s illness had begun in late August (see paragraph 57 above). In a later forensic report military experts doubted the above conclusion (see paragraph 62). However, the Court does not need to determine whether the applicants\u2019 son fell ill with the kidney disease in early or late August 2005. It was a matter for the State authorities to investigate. The Court observes in this connection that the failure to allow the applicants\u2019 son to visit a doctor became the reason for the disciplinary reprimand of the concerned military officers, 1st Sr. Lt. P. and Capt. O. (see paragraph 27 above). Thus, the delay in ensuring the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s access to medical care was a fact and it was known to the investigating authorities. However, at no point did the investigator or the experts examine the implications of that delay for the outcome of the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s illness.",

That fact had been established by experts as early as in November 2005. The medical expert panel found that the failure to perform those tests had contributed to the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s death (see paragraph 36 above). Even if the other experts later doubted that earlier testing or that tests of blood and urine as opposed to a biopsy would have allowed correct diagnosis and successful treatment of the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s disease (see paragraph 62 above), the fact that no medical tests were carried out for eight days following his admission to the medical unit is undeniable. Whether or not blood and urine tests could have ensured the correct diagnosis and cure is yet again not decisive in terms of the State\u2019s obligation to safeguard life, but performing those tests would have been a reasonable step to take in any event. The explanation given by the medical unit\u2019s doctor that the tests were not done because the laboratory technician was on leave (see paragraph 54 above) is not acceptable. It only demonstrates that the medical unit was not properly equipped or staffed to provide an adequate level of medical care (see Magnitskiy and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 32631/09 and 53799/12, \u00a7 261, 27\u00a0August 2019).

Russia, no. 41675/08, \u00a7 53, with further references, 18\u00a0June\u00a02015, and Trapeznikova and Others v. Russia, no. 45115/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03436, 1\u00a0December 2016). The Court also held that, in the absence of a proper criminal investigation, it is impossible to carry out a whole range of investigative measures such as questioning, confrontations, searches, seizures, reconstructions, and so forth, while ensuring the validity of the collected evidence (see Fanziyeva, cited above, \u00a7 53, with further references, and Trapeznikova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34-36). Furthermore, lack of a criminal investigation seriously undermines the procedural rights of the victims with regard to the investigation, such as the right to lodge applications, to put questions to experts or to obtain copies of procedural decisions (see Kleyn and Aleksandrovich v. Russia, no.\u00a040657/04, \u00a7\u00a057, 3\u00a0May 2012). As evidenced by the present case (see paragraph 59 above), the applicants were not granted victim status and, therefore, could not exercise the procedural rights accompanying that status. Thus, the pre-investigation inquiry carried out in the present case did not and could not satisfy the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention to the State\u2019s procedural obligation.",

Although the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s superior officers, P. and O., were subjected to disciplinary reprimands for the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s initial delayed access to medical care (see paragraph\u00a027 above), those proceedings did not concern other personnel or subsequent periods of medical assistance to the applicants\u2019 son.

Furthermore, the applicants\u2019 civil action seeking to establish civil responsibility on the part of their son\u2019s military unit\u2019s personnel was dismissed. It should be noted that the national courts mostly referred to the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings of 10 March 2007 as evidence of the lack of fault in the actions of the military unit\u2019s personnel (see paragraph 68 and 70 above). It would thus appear that the refusal to open a criminal investigation also undermined the applicants\u2019 chances of success in the civil courts, which did not carry out independent fact finding for the purpose of determining the cause of the death and holding those responsible to account (see Shovgurov v. Russia (dec.), no. 17601/12, \u00a7 63, 25\u00a0August 2015).",
