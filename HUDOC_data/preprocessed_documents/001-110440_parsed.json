Public-order considerations may lead the State to introduce highsecurity prison regimes for particular categories of detainees and, indeed, in many State Parties to the Convention more stringent security rules apply to dangerous detainees. These arrangements, intended to prevent the risk of escape, attack or disturbance of the prison community, are based on separation of such detainees from the prison community together with tighter controls (see, for instance, Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 80-82 and 138; Messina (no. 2) v. , no. 25498/94, ECHR 2000-X, \u00a7\u00a7 42-54; Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-109; Rohde v.

In the nature of things, in cases where, as in the present one, numerous persons are involved, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or accomplices or otherwise obstruct the proceedings must be considered a valid argument militating in favour of imposing detention, rather than other measures. This ground, even taken together with other reasons advanced by the authorities, might not by itself have been enough to justify a prolonged continuation of detention on remand. However, having regard to the fact that the period in question amounted to 11 months, the Court is satisfied that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for keeping the applicant in custody.",

Assessing the authorities\u2019 conduct from the point of view of Article 5 \u00a7 3, the Court has already found that, despite the nature of the case, the investigation was terminated without undue delay (see paragraph 109 above). It comes to the same conclusion in respect of the court proceedings. The trial at first instance lasted from 16 June 2005 to 30\u00a0December 2008, that is to say, for 3 years and some 6 months (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above). Given that during that time the Regional Court listed 98 hearings, of which only a few were adjourned for valid reasons, that the hearings were held at regular intervals and that there were no periods of inactivity (see paragraphs 11 and 21 above), the Court finds that the first-instance proceedings were terminated within a \u201creasonable time\u201d.

As stated above, detention entails inherent limitations on the detainee\u2019s private and family life, including restrictions on family visits or, if so justified by the nature of the offence and detainee\u2019s circumstances, special arrangements for such visits (see paragraphs 122-123 above). In particular, in cases involving high-security prison regimes where the applicants are charged with, or convicted of, a serious offence representing a considerable social danger \u2013 for instance, violent or organised Mafia-type crime \u2013 the application of such measures as a physical separation of a detainee from his visitors through a special transparent partition can be justified by the prison security needs or the danger that a detainee would communicate with criminal organisations through the family channels (see, for instance, Van\u00a0der Ven, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 54; and Messina no. 2, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027 and 72). However, the extended prohibition on direct contact with family members is accepted under Article 8 only in so far as the authorities have not failed to fulfil their duty under this provision to enable, and assist, the applicant in maintaining contact with his close family and secured a fair balance between his rights and the aims of the special regime (see Messina no. 2, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73 and paragraphs 123-124 above).",

Nevertheless, to justify long-term restrictions, there must exist a genuine and continuing danger of that kind (see paragraphs 94, 129 above and  (no. 2), cited above \u00a7\u00a7 66-73). In that regard, the Court notes that the first visit from the applicant\u2019s wife was an open visit enabling them direct contact and unrestricted conversation (see paragraphs 34 and 58 above). In the light of the material in the Court\u2019s possession, it appears that neither this first visit, nor any further events or the applicant\u2019s own behaviour during his detention (see paragraphs 84 and 101-102 above) revealed any grounds to believe that he intended to use his wife or daughters as intermediaries to restore contacts with the criminal community or that open family visits from them would jeopardise the prison security. Indeed, subsequently, open visits were granted to the applicant each year, although rarely, at different intervals and on an irregular basis (see paragraphs 3338 above). In the Court\u2019s view, this shows not merely the lack of a consistent pattern in the authorities\u2019 decisions but also, indirectly, that in reality the measures taken were not apparently related to any tangible fear or risk that could possibly legitimise the impugned restrictions under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (cf.

However, positive obligations of the State under Article\u00a08, in particular an obligation to enable and assist a detainee in maintaining contact with his close family (see paragraphs 123-124 and 129 above), includes a duty to secure the appropriate, as stress-free for visitors as possible, conditions for receiving visits from his children, regard being had to the practical consequences of imprisonment. That duty is not discharged properly in situations where, as in the present case, the visits from children are organised in a manner exposing them to the view of prison cells and inmates and, as a result, to an inevitably traumatic, exceptionally stressful experience. The Court agrees that, as the applicant said, the exposure to prison life can be shocking even for an adult and, indeed, it must have caused inordinate distress and emotional suffering for his daughters (see paragraphs 39 and 119 above). It further notes that, owing to the authorities\u2019 failure to make adequate visiting arrangements, the applicant, having seen the deeply adverse effects on his daughters, had to desist from seeing them in prison. Throughout his detention from 14 July 2004 to the end of 2008 he saw his oldest daughter twice and each of the two younger ones once. In effect, he was deprived of any personal contact with them for several years (see paragraphs 33-34 and 37 above).",
