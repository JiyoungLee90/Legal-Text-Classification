In the requests for extension of the regime issued prior to each decision of the commission, the director of the remand centre emphasised the violent nature of the crimes which the applicant had allegedly committed. In the requests of 19 October 2004 and 9 January 2005 the authorities referred to the applicant\u2019s \u201cpersonal circumstances (ruthless and cruel manner in which the crimes were committed taken together with the knowledge of box and combat techniques)\u201d. In the more recent requests the remand centre authorities pointed out that the applicant had not taken any active part in the \u201csocial rehabilitation process\u201d and had been of low moral character. All the commission\u2019s decisions and the requests by the remand centre issued between April 2005 and 2012 had similar wording.",

The applicant stressed that all movement in his cell had been constantly monitored.

That had diminished his human dignity and caused him feelings of inferiority.

However, the appointment of a defence counsel does not necessarily settle the issue of compliance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c).
