It has held on many occasions that, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused. The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of an individual within their control is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (see, among other authorities, Orhan v. Turkey, no.\u00a025656/94, \u00a7\u00a0326, 18 June 2002, and the authorities cited therein). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v.

A military vehicle had also been seen near the scene of the incident on the night of 13 June 2001 (see paragraph 17 above).

In the light of these considerations and having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, and more specifically the considerable lapse of time since the day on which Artur Bersunkayev went missing, the Court finds that he must be presumed dead following unacknowledged detention by State agents.",

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur v.  [GC], no.\u00a021594/93, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 1999III). In particular, there must be an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, \u00a7\u00a0102-04, and Mahmut Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022535/93, ECHR 2000-III, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-07). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan\u00a0v. the , no.\u00a037715/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-92, 4\u00a0May 2001).",

In that context, it has repeatedly stressed that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. To minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104).",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

[GC], no.\u00a023763/94, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 1999IV). This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. Failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

The Court further notes that the provisions of Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the Government referred, do not preclude disclosure of the documents from the file of an ongoing investigation, but rather set out the procedure for and limits to such disclosure. The Government failed to specify the nature of the documents and the grounds on which they could not be disclosed (see, for similar conclusions, Mikheyev v. Russia, no.\u00a077617/01, \u00a7\u00a0104, 26 January 2006). The Court also notes that in a number of comparable cases that have been reviewed by the Court, the Government submitted documents from the investigation files without reference to Article\u00a0161 (see, for example, Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7\u00a046, 24 February 2005, or Magomadov and Magomadov v. , no.\u00a068004/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a036 and 82, 12\u00a0July 2007), or agreed to produce documents from the investigation files even though they had initially invoked Article 161 (see Khatsiyeva and Others v.

In particular, in the Assanidze judgment the Court held that the respondent State was to secure the applicant\u2019s release so as to put an end to the violations of Article 5 \u00a7 1 and Article 6 \u00a7 1, whereas in the Tahsin Acar\u00a0judgment the effective investigation was mentioned in the context of the Court\u2019s examination of the respondent Government\u2019s request for the application to be struck out on the basis of their unilateral declaration. The Court further notes its above finding that in the present case the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in the early stages by the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to take essential investigative measures and that after seven years the investigation was unable to make any meaningful findings as regards Artur Bersunkayev\u2019s fate (see paragraphs 100 and 109 above). It is therefore very doubtful that the situation existing before the breach could be restored, and particularly not as a result of the measures requested by the applicant.",

As regards the Government\u2019s argument, the Court notes that whilst it is true that Mr Timothy Otty QC was not mentioned in the power of attorney signed by the applicant, he only provided advice on evidence as an expert rather than attempting to represent the applicant. On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s lawyers, being themselves human rights experts, did not provide any explanation as to why it had been necessary for them to seek advice from another expert in this field. Against this background, the Court is not convinced that the costs and expenses in this part can be regarded as necessarily incurred. Accordingly, the Court rejects the applicant\u2019s claim in the part regarding the professional fees of Mr Timothy Otty QC.",
