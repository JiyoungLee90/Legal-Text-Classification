The applicant claimed that on 8 January 2007, while he and his brother were driving in their van to their place of work in \u0130zmir, a number of plain-clothes police officers on two motorbikes indicated to him that he should pull over. The police officers then told him that he had been driving erratically and asked him to get out of the vehicle. The applicant and his brother had got out of the van and asked to see the police officers\u2019 identity cards. The police officers then became agitated and started hitting the applicant\u2019s brother. When the applicant asked them to stop, they sprayed him with tear gas and he fell to the ground. Then one of the police officers put his fingers in the applicant\u2019s nostrils and pulled him up and the applicant tried to push that police officer away. The applicant then heard one of the police officers cocking his pistol. Thinking that the plain-clothes police officers, who had refused to show him their identity cards, could in fact be robbers, the applicant got hold of a wooden stick from the back of his van to defend himself. At that moment, one of the police officers, C.U., fired three rounds towards the applicant. One of the bullets hit the applicant\u2019s abdomen and he fell to the ground. The police officers then handcuffed the applicant and his brother. One of them grabbed the wooden stick and started hitting the applicant\u2019s brother, while another officer hit and kicked the applicant. Although the applicant\u2019s brother asked the officers to take the applicant to a hospital, they did not listen to him. Instead, the applicant and his brother were taken to a police station, where they were placed in custody. The applicant\u2019s brother had shouted and asked the custody officers to take his brother to a hospital.",

The doctors observed a bullet entry hole, five centimetres above his navel, and a corresponding bullet exit hole on the lower lumbar, three centimetres above the sacrum. The doctors noted that, as it travelled through the applicant\u2019s body, the bullet had damaged the applicant\u2019s small and large intestines, and considered his injury to be life-threatening. It was also stated in a medical report that his injury would prevent him from working for a period of fortyfive days. A neurosurgeon who examined the applicant concluded that the applicant\u2019s injuries amounted to a \u201cpermanent deterioration in the functioning of one of his organs or his nerves\u201d. It was also established in December 2008 that as a result of having been shot, the applicant had developed \u201cpost-traumatic stress disorder\u201d and \u201csevere depression\u201d. Three neurosurgeons who examined the applicant stated in their report of 11\u00a0December 2009 that they had observed atrophy (wasting away of the muscle) of the applicant\u2019s thigh muscles and sensory loss on the front of the thighs. Finally, according to a report issued by a hospital in \u0130zmir on 19\u00a0April 2010, as a result of the applicant\u2019s injury, his ability to work had been reduced by 27% (see also paragraph 53 below).",

However, noting that the trial court had then suspended the pronouncement of its judgment, the Constitutional Court concluded that the suspended judgment could neither be regarded as a deterrent punishment for the police officers nor as adequate redress as regards the applicants\u2019 complaints of ill-treatment. It also concluded that the suspension of the pronouncement of the judgment had resulted in impunity and rendered the investigation ineffective because one of the important requirements of an effective investigation was to ensure that perpetrators of such offences were subjected to punishments which corresponded to the seriousness of their offences.",

The Constitutional Court concluded that by suspending the pronouncement of its judgment the trial court had not only used its power of discretion to lessen the consequences of a serious criminal act, rather than to show that such acts could in no way be tolerated, but had also acted in breach of the obligation to conduct an effective investigation capable of leading to the punishment of those responsible for life-threatening offences.
