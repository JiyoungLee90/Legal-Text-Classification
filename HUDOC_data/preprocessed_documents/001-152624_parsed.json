In addition, as apparent from the applicants\u2019 case, decisions of the prosecution authorities to discontinue proceedings under Chapter Three, after establishing that their continuation was unjustified, had no binding force. In the present case, even though they concluded in 2002 that there was no legal ground for bringing an action for forfeiture against the first applicant and her husband, in 2004 the prosecution authorities opened new proceedings under Chapter Three, concerning the same people and the same period of time (see paragraphs 711 above). It thus appears that, as pointed out by the applicants (see paragraph 36 above), the prosecution authorities were free to \u201copen, suspend, close and open again proceedings at will at any time\u201d. All this, coupled with the fact that the procedure under Chapter Three of the CPA was very rarely resorted to after 1989 (see paragraph 28 above), means that the CPA did not meet the foreseeability requirement set out in the paragraph above, which entails that a person should be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to reasonably foresee the consequences which a given action may cause (see, mutatis mutandis, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

In the case, this led to the courts reaching conflicting conclusions as to whether the evidence presented to them was relevant and sufficient to prove as \u201clawful\u201d part of the income claimed by the applicants (see paragraphs 13 and 16 above). Eventually the Court of Appeal found the income at issue unproven and thus \u201cunlawful\u201d, even though it had not been alleged that the first applicant and her husband had breached any legal regulation. To this was added the fact that the burden of proof in proceedings under the CPA was placed on the defendants (see paragraph 25 above); thus, the applicants had to show that the first applicant and Mr Dimitrov had received \u201clawful\u201d income, without there being any clarity as to what constituted \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of the CPA.

However, the Court cannot accept this argument. It observes, first, that sections 31(2) and 42(4) of the CPA stipulated expressly that the procedures provided for in Chapter Three were inapplicable to proceeds of crime, as these were to be treated under the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 24 above). Moreover, it is significant that at no point during the domestic proceedings against the applicants did the authorities attempt to establish that the properties whose forfeiture was being sought had been acquired through proceeds of crime. This point was also indicated by the Government (see paragraph 33 above).",

It is also noteworthy that that tax legislation was applied to the first applicant and her husband, as the tax authorities initiated probes into their incomes and in two decisions of 23 June and 26 November 2004 established the amount of tax due from them (see paragraph 21 above).
