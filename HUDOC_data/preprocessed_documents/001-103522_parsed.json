If a party insists on calling a witness whose testimony may be important to the case, the court should take all available measures to ensure this witness's presence in court. When that witness is available for questioning, the reading out of his or her deposition should be considered inadmissible evidence and should not be relied upon. However, when the witness is not available for questioning, the defence should still be provided with appropriate procedural safeguards such as a challenge to the deposition which has been read out, a request for challenge by way of examining further evidence, and pre-trial face-to-face confrontation between that witness and the defendant, in which the latter is given the opportunity to put questions to the former (see also the admissibility decision of 7 December 2006 (no. 548-O)).",

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7\u00a0102, ECHR 2005-I). In this context, \u201cpressure\u201d includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a Convention remedy. The fact that the individual actually managed to pursue his application does not prevent an issue arising under Article 34: should the Government's action make it more difficult for the individual to exercise his right of petition, this amounts to \u201chindering\u201d his rights under Article 34 (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 105 and 254, Reports 1996-IV). The intentions or reasons underlying the acts or omissions in question are of little relevance when assessing whether Article\u00a034 of the Convention was complied with; what matters is whether the situation created as a result of the authorities' act or omission complies with Article 34 (see Paladi v. Moldova [GC], no. 39806/05, \u00a7 87, 10 March 2009).",
