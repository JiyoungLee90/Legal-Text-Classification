Its primary purpose is to maintain legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are examined within a reasonable time, and to prevent the authorities and other persons concerned from being kept in a state of uncertainty for a long period of time. That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see, among many other authorities, Sabri\u00a0G\u00fcne\u015f v.

That is why the Court has to examine compliance with the rule even in the absence of an objection by the Government to that effect (see Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a034979/97, ECHR 2000-I; Ble\u010di\u0107 v.
