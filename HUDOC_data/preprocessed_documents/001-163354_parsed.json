Being aware that the Member of Parliament\u2019s Status Act provided for housing support, the author speculated that he might be willing to change his views in exchange for a flat in Kyiv. For the applicant company, the lack of coherence in the plaintiff\u2019s demand that a subjective opinion be retracted was illustrated by the fact that the plaintiff and the first-instance court had been unable to formulate a specific statement of retraction and had resorted to the requirement to publish the text of the judgment itself. For the applicant company, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to formulate a specific retraction illustrated the rationale behind section 47-1 of the Information Act, under which value judgments were not subject to retraction. The applicant company argued that the requirement to retract the statement by publishing the text of the court judgment contradicted section 37 of the Press Act. The applicant company also argued that the author had not had the requisite intent to disseminate untrue information.

Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a026682/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999IV). Accordingly, a high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities thus having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, will normally be accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest (see Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7 125, 23 April 2015). Moreover, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider in respect of a politician than a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his words and deeds by journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance. A politician is certainly entitled to have his reputation protected, even when he is not acting in his private capacity, but in such cases the requirements of that protection have to be weighed against the interests of the open discussion of political issues (see Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7\u00a042, Series A no. 103).",

In fact, the entire closing part of the article was dedicated to explaining the exaggerated nature of its first part, which included in particular the statements found to be untrue and defamatory. However, the domestic courts appear to have taken these statements in isolation, removed from this context (compare, for example, Dichand and Others v. Austria, no. 29271/95, \u00a7 46, 26 February 2002).",
