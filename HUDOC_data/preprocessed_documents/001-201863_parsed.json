The national authorities, including courts, are expected to interpret and apply national law in the light of the Convention, as interpreted by the Court. The Court has found that the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty did not fall within the ambit of any subparagraph of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. By failing to apply the relevant standards, as outlined in paragraphs 34-36 above, the national courts failed to deal properly with the applicant\u2019s claim relating to the legality of the police actions and, by implication, barred an eventual compensation claim, which could have been based, under Russian law, on the finding of such illegality. Accordingly, the courts that undertook judicial review under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not enforce the applicant\u2019s right to compensation (see Boris Popov, cited above, \u00a7 86).",
