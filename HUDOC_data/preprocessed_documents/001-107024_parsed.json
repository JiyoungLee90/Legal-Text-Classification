In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article\u00a03 (see V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024888/94, \u00a7\u00a071, ECHR\u00a01999-IX).",

The Court notes that from 30\u00a0June 2005 to 18\u00a0July 2006 the applicant was unlawfully at large. That period should be excluded from the overall length of the proceedings (see Girolami v. , 19 February 1991, \u00a7\u00a013, Series A no. 196E). The Court further notes that the period from 25\u00a0September 2008, when the applicant\u2019s conviction became final and no proceedings were pending, to 11\u00a0March 2009, when the appeal judgment was quashed by way of supervisory review and the case was remitted to the appeal court for fresh consideration, should not be taken into account (see, for example, Brovchenko v. , no. 1603/02, \u00a7\u00a097, 18 December 2008). Accordingly, the criminal proceedings against the applicant lasted for approximately three\u00a0years and eight and a half months. This period spanned the investigation stage and that of the judicial proceedings, when the case was reviewed by the trial court and twice by the appeal court, the first appeal judgment having been quashed by way of supervisory review and the case having been remitted for a fresh examination to the appeal court.",
