Having regard to the material submitted before it, the Court finds a number of delays imputable to the State: it took the trial court one year to fix a hearing following the submission of the applicant's claim (see paragraphs 6 and 9 above); nearly nine months lapsed between the introduction of the employer's counter-claim and the hearing of 19\u00a0March\u00a01999 (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above); a total delay of nearly one year resulted from the trial court's requests for expert examinations of the parties' claims (see paragraphs 12-14 above). As to the latter, the Court notes that the principal responsibility for a delay caused by the expert examinations rests ultimately with the State (see Capuano v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 25\u00a0June 1987, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0119, \u00a7\u00a032). In addition, the Court points out that the experts were working in the context of judicial proceedings, supervised by a judge, who remained responsible for the preparation and the speedy conduct of the trial (see Scopelliti v. Italy, judgment of 23\u00a0November\u00a01993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0278, \u00a7\u00a023). Furthermore, the trial court was required under section 300 (3) of the Act (see paragraph 34 above) to restart the trial after every change of the composition of the panel of judges (see paragraphs 15-17 above) which added to the length of the proceedings. Finally, the proceedings lay dormant for nearly one year and ten months following the appellate court's decision of 7 June 2001 (see paragraphs 23-25), a period during which the trial court did not take any procedural step. That period cannot be attributed to the applicant for the reasons stated above (see paragraph 52 above).",
