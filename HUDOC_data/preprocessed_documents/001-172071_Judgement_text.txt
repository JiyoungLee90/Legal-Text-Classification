The case originated in two applications (nos. 35081/10 and 68117/13) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“theConvention”) by Tehnogradnja DOO, a limited liability company based in Serbia (“the applicant company”), on 20 May 2010.
The applicant company was represented by Mr G. Nalić and D. Ignjatović, lawyers practising in Belgrade. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, and more recently their current Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 11 July 2014 and 16 September 2014 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
On 25 March 2004 the applicant company concluded a contract with Univerzal Banka AD (hereinafter “the bank”), a private institution based in Belgrade. Under the terms of this contract, the applicant company acquired a debt belonging to the bank resulting from a final court judgment of 28 December 1999. That judgment was rendered against a socially-owned company called Mehanizacija (hereinafter “the debtor company”) with its seat in Vladičin Han. On 29 August 2000, upon the bank’s application to that effect, the Leskovac Commercial Court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and the debtor company subsequently paid a part of the judgment debt.
On 14 April 2005, upon the applicant company’s application to that effect, the Leskovac Commercial Court again ordered the full enforcement of the judgment in question.
On 26 July 2005 the applicant company concluded a settlement with the debtor company, which was later annulled following an application by the debtor company by a decision of the Leskovac Commercial Court of 22 January 2009. That decision became final on 3 March 2010.
.  On 24 December 2001 the Leskovac Commercial Court ordered the debtor company to pay the applicant company specified amounts.
.  On 2 February 2005, upon the applicant company’s application to that effect, the Leskovac Commercial Court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment.
On 1 March 2010 the Leskovac Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor company. As a result, all of the other ongoing enforcement proceedings against the debtor company were stayed.
The applicant company duly reported its claims based on the above-mentioned judgments.
On 15 October 2010 the Leskovac Commercial Court recognised a part of the applicant company’s claims and instructed the applicant company to initiate civil proceedings in respect of the remainder.
On 29 May 2012 the Leskovac Commercial Court ruled partly in favour of the applicant company and dismissed the remainder of its claims. That decision was upheld by the Commercial Appeals Court on 25 October 2013. The domestic courts found that the contract which the applicant company had concluded with the bank (see paragraph 5 above) entitled it only to the recovery of the amount paid for the transfer of the debt owed to the bank in question, not the judgment debt itself.
The insolvency proceedings are still ongoing.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies, as well as enforcement and insolvency proceedings, has been outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia (nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and 71-76, 15 January 2008) and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia ((dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013). Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially-owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional redress has likewise been outlined in the admissibility decision in Marinković v. Serbia ((dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26 -29 and 31-44, 29 January 2013), the judgment in Marinković v. Serbia (no. 5353/11, §§ 29-31, 22 October 2013) and the decision in Ferizović v. Serbia ((dec.), no. 65713/13, §§ 12-17, 26 November 2013).
