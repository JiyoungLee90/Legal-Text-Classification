In a judgment delivered on 14 April 2011 in relation to a dispute on the appointment of a District Court judge, the Supreme Court stressed that despite the advisory role of the Evaluation Committee at the material time, the Minister of Justice, when making a proposal for a judicial appointment contrary to the Committee\u2019s recommendation, was nevertheless bound by the principle of appointing the most qualified candidate to a public post and by the duty of \u201csufficient investigation\u201d under section 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act (see paragraph 115 below for further information on this judgment).",

Amongst other important changes concerning the composition and the mandate of the Evaluation Committee, including an increase in the number of members to five and the extension of its mandate to cover the appointment of Supreme Court justices, the amendments introduced the rule that when making judicial appointments the Minister of Justice could only appoint candidates who were considered by the Committee to be the most qualified for a given post. In order to appoint a candidate who had not been considered the most qualified by the Committee, the Minister of Justice needed to obtain the approval of Parliament. This was, according to the Act\u2019s preparatory material, intended to further ensure the independence of the judiciary. That material referred to international legal instruments and recommendations on the appointment of judges, and underlined the importance of proper procedure in judicial appointments, in the light of the judiciary\u2019s significant role in securing fair trial rights and maintaining the checks and balances inherent in the separation of powers. It furthermore referred to an unwritten fundamental principle of Icelandic administrative law, whereby appointments to public posts had to be based on objective considerations and the most qualified candidate had to be appointed to any public post (see paragraph 114 for further information on the aforementioned unwritten administrative law principle).",

It also matters whether the applicants\u2019 experiences have been varied, such as whether they have experience in applying legal rules in different areas of law.

The first option would be to refer the matter back to the Committee for reassessment. As a second option, the Minister could choose to remedy the flaws herself, which would require her to evaluate all the candidates in the light of the \u201cMinister\u2019s objectives\u201d (the expression used in the email) and the relevant legal criteria. In such circumstances, a substantive assessment would have to be made of the qualifications of each applicant based on new grounds. In the legal advisor\u2019s opinion, the standard procedure in these circumstances would be to request the Committee to conduct a new evaluation. He further noted that the Minister\u2019s decision in respect of judicial appointments was an administrative act and therefore had to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act no.\u00a037/1993 (see paragraph 108 below). He lastly proposed that it might be wise to inform the candidates about any change in the emphasis placed on one of the assessment criteria and to give them an opportunity to present new information that could be relevant for the fresh evaluation.",

In this instance, fifteen positions had been advertised and the Committee had found that fifteen of the candidates under its review had been more qualified than the remaining ones for those positions. It had, therefore, not been necessary to propose a list of more than fifteen candidates in its report. The Committee\u2019s evaluation table had clearly shown the ranking of the individual candidates. The Chairman continued that the Minister had asked to be able to choose from among, for example, twenty\u00a0candidates for the fifteen vacant posts. If this approach were to be followed, the candidate ranked 20th in the Committee\u2019s evaluation table could be chosen over candidates ranked 5th, 10th and so forth. According to the Chairman, this approach would contradict the purpose of Act no. 45/2010 as it had been described in the preparatory material (see paragraph 14 above). The intention behind the legislative framework requiring a separate expert committee to assess candidates for judicial posts, as opposed to leaving that assessment to the Minister of Justice alone, had been to safeguard judicial independence in the light of developments in other European countries.",

The Minister was, however, of the opinion that the Evaluation Committee had not given \u201cjudicial experience\u201d the weight that the post of judge at an appellate court required. The Minister further argued that the assessment of candidates for judicial posts was not an exact science; it would not be possible to separate a qualified candidate from an unqualified one by a difference of 0.025 points on a scale of 1 to 10, and nothing in Rules no. 620/2010 had called for such working practices. After reviewing the assessment report, the candidates\u2019 comments on that report and the working documents presented to her, the Minister had concluded that a number of other candidates with many years of judicial experience should also have been included on the Evaluation Committee\u2019s list. She thus stated that she considered a total of twenty-four candidates to be eligible for the judicial posts, including those proposed by the Committee, and that she had drawn up her list of fifteen candidates on the basis of the principles described above.

The CSC held at the outset that under the Constitution, the role of the judiciary was to supervise the other holders of State powers, and that evaluation committees, such as that which had been set up in Iceland, served the purpose of limiting the power of the executive branch in the appointment of judges, by providing professional opinion on the qualification of candidates. If the Minister of Justice wished to depart from the list of candidates proposed by the Evaluation Committee, she had to present arguments for her proposal. Moreover, the choice had to be objective and the most qualified person had to be selected for the position. The CSC noted that the Evaluation Committee had considered that all thirty-three candidates fulfilled the legal requirements to be eligible for the relevant office. On this basis, and upon a discussion of the grounds underlying the Minister\u2019s proposal for appointment of judges to the Court of Appeal, including the deviations from the Committee\u2019s proposal, the CSC stated that it accepted the list proposed by the Minister. It stressed that Parliament\u2019s role in this process should be limited to reviewing whether the proper procedure had been applied by the Minister, whether an appropriate comparison of the candidates had been undertaken and whether the Minister\u2019s evaluations had been objective.",

Moreover, the minority expressed serious reservations regarding the Minister\u2019s compliance with principles of administrative law, including the requirement of sufficient investigation, the right of the candidates to comment and the general principle of domestic law that only the most qualified candidates should be selected for office, referring to the Supreme\u00a0Court\u2019s judgment of 14\u00a0April 2011 in case no. 412/2010 (see paragraph 13 above and 115 below).

They further requested the annulment of the decision not to include them on the list of fifteen candidates proposed to the President of Iceland for appointment after the vote in Parliament. In addition, they demanded compensation for pecuniary damage and 1,000,000\u00a0Icelandic kr\u00f3nur (ISK, approximately 9,000\u00a0euros (EUR) at the material time) for personal injury (non-pecuniary damage).

In this connection, the Supreme Court reiterated that although the President of Iceland was formally the highest State official under the Constitution, in practice the Ministers were the supreme holders of executive power according to a wellrooted constitutional tradition. The arrangements made under the former and the new Judiciary Acts entailing the involvement of the Evaluation Committee and Parliament in the process of the appointment of judges did not change this constitutional tradition. Accordingly, it was the Minister of Justice, and not Parliament, which held the power to determine who would be proposed to the President of Iceland for appointment as judge to the Court of Appeal.

In the second judgment, the Supreme Court had held that the power of a Minister in respect of appointments to public posts was limited by the applicable laws and general principles of administrative law concerning such appointments and the evaluation of the competencies of the candidates. The Supreme Court stated that in the context of judicial appointments, the rule of investigation under section 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act had been transferred from the Minister to the Evaluation Committee following the establishment of such committee by Act no. 92/1982.",

The Supreme Court noted that the qualifications of those eleven candidates had been assessed by the Evaluation Committee, which clearly possessed the expertise to assess such matters, and had conducted its assessment in accordance with the relevant domestic laws. In these circumstances, the procedure followed in respect of those eleven candidates, including the single vote held before Parliament, did not present any irregularities, provided that an opportunity had been made available to vote separately on each candidate upon request.",

Accordingly, the Minister had to ensure that her own investigation and assessment were based on expert knowledge, on a par with that of the Evaluation Committee, and that the instructions concerning the evaluation procedure as set out under Rules no. 620/2010 on the work of the Evaluation Committee \u2013 rules that had been put in place by the Ministry of Justice to guide the work of the Committee (see paragraph 107 below) \u2013 were taken into account in her assessment. According to the Supreme Court, this was all the more important given that under the relevant law, the assessment report prepared by the Evaluation Committee limited the powers of the Minister of Justice and prohibited her from proposing a candidate who was not considered by the Committee to be the most qualified to the post of judge, unless the Minister obtained the consent of Parliament. The Supreme Court stressed that when making appointments to judicial posts, the decision taken by the Minister did not involve a post accountable to the Minister, but rather concerned members of a different branch of the State\u2019s government which had a monitoring role vis-\u00e0-vis the other branches and whose independence was guaranteed by Article 61 of the Constitution and section\u00a024 of the former Judiciary Act.",

Depending on the outcome of such comparison, the Minister should then have given due reasons for her decision to seek Parliament\u2019s approval for her proposal to depart from the Committee\u2019s conclusions. Only in this manner could Parliament have sufficiently served its role in the process and taken a position on the Minister\u2019s assessment. Accordingly, and in keeping with the requirements of temporary provision IV of the Judiciary\u00a0Act\u00a0no.\u00a050/2016, the Minister of Justice had been bound to present an independent proposal for each of the four candidates who had not been among the fifteen listed by the Evaluation Committee. In the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, this view was also supported by the second paragraph of temporary provision IV, under which the non-acceptance by Parliament of any of the candidates proposed by the Minister of Justice would require the Minister to submit new proposals for Parliament\u2019s acceptance.",

The inadequate character of the investigation conducted by the Minister of Justice prevented her from reaching a different decision on the competencies of the candidates from that previously reached by the Evaluation Committee on the basis of the same data. Furthermore, she could not rely on considerations of gender under the Equality Act no. 10/2008 as those were only applicable in cases where two candidates of different genders had been considered equally qualified. The Supreme Court noted that neither in its initial letter addressed to Parliament on 29 May 2017, nor in the memorandum sent to the CSC the next day, had the Minister substantiated her proposals in a manner that had satisfied the minimum requirements noted above. The Minister of Justice had therefore breached the requirements of section 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act in the context of the procedure for appointment of Court of Appeal judges.",

In support of his claim, the applicant referred to the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Free Trade Association States (EFTA Court) of 14\u00a0February 2017 in case E-21/16 and the judgment of the General Court of the European Union (EU) of 23 January 2018 in case no.

Where that is not the case and the appointment is thus unlawful \u2018the judge in question is not a lawful holder of judicial power and a court\u2019s judicial rulings in which he has participated constitute a dead letter\u2019, as is argued in [the applicant\u2019s] observations before the Supreme Court. The conclusion drawn from the cited words cannot be sustained unless it is considered that a person\u2019s appointment as a judge under these circumstances would be vitiated by nullity (\u2018markleysa\u2019), thus not only that flaws in the appointment process would result in its annulment. It must be taken into account that in the aforementioned assessment report of the Evaluation Committee of 19 May 2017, it was concluded that all the 33 candidates fulfilled all the requirements provided for by law to hold the office of judge in the Court of Appeal, a fact that has not been challenged. The appointment of the judges was conducted in accordance with the formal procedural rules of Chapter III of Act\u00a0no.\u00a050/2016, as well as temporary provision IV of the same Act, albeit with the exception that, during the parliamentary procedure on the Minister of Justice\u2019s proposals on the appointment of the judges, the requirements of the second paragraph of the temporary provision were not followed in that Parliament should have voted on each and every judge separately, but not all the judges at the same time, as was in fact done. This issue, however, has already been addressed in the aforementioned judgment of the Supreme Court [of 19 December 2017], where it was concluded that this was a defect of no significance. Taking this into account, as well as the fact that all the fifteen judges were appointed to office by letters signed by the President of Iceland on 8 June 2017, co-signed by the Minister of Justice, it cannot be concluded that the appointment of [A.E.] was vitiated by nullity, nor is it accepted that judicial rulings of the Court of Appeal, which she has delivered along with others, are for that reason a \u2018dead letter\u2019.",

Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights), it must be recalled that in the aforementioned judgments of the Supreme Court [of 19 December 2017] it was concluded that such flaws were in the procedure at the level of the Minister of Justice preceding the appointment of the fifteen Court of Appeal judges and that the State was liable for damages. In this case, this finding has in no way been challenged and these judgments have, therefore, evidential value in this respect in accordance with section 116(4) of the Civil Procedure Act. In this regard, it must also, in particular, be emphasised that it cannot be accepted, as was argued in the aforementioned memorandum of the Minister of Justice of 30 May 2017, that by only increasing the weight ascribed to judicial experience from that which such experience was ascribed by the Evaluation Committee in its internal table, relied upon in its assessment report of the 19th of the same month, but relying in other respects on the \u2018sufficient investigation\u2019 of the Committee as to each assessment factor, the finding could be made that four named candidates for the post of judge in the Court of Appeal, but not others, would be removed from the group of the fifteen most qualified, and four specific named candidates would be moved up into that group rather than others [sic]. When assessing the consequences of the said flaws in the Minister of Justice\u2019s procedure, account must be taken of the fact that the appointment of all the fifteen judges of the Court of Appeal for an indefinite term, which has in no way been annulled by a court, became a reality upon the signing of their letters of appointment, dated 8 June 2017. As stated above, they all fulfilled the requirements of section 21(2) of Act no. 50/2016 for appointment to the office of judge, including the requirement of item 8 of the said paragraph, that is, being considered to be qualified to hold such office in the light of their professional experience and legal knowledge. From that time, the judges have held positions (cf. Article 61 of the Constitution) which preclude them from being discharged from office except by a judicial decision. From the time the appointment of these judges took effect, they have, according to the same provision of the Constitution (see section 43 (1) of Act no. 50/2016) been under the main obligation in the performance of their official duty to follow only the law. They have also been afforded, in accordance with the last mentioned provision of law, independence in their judicial work but also the duty to perform it under their own responsibility and never to follow instructions from others in their work. With reference to all of the above, there is no sufficient reason to justifiably doubt that [the applicant] enjoyed a fair trial before independent and impartial judges, in spite of the flaws in the procedure at the level of the Minister of Justice.\u201d",

According to the District Court, this finding could not be understood to mean that the Minister was limited in her comparison to those particular candidates directly concerned by her decision; if the Minister considered it appropriate to grant increased weight to judicial experience, then she should have duly assessed all candidates on the basis of that consideration. Otherwise, she would be prevented from claiming that she had selected the fifteen most qualified candidates on the basis of their experience of judicial work. The court held that neither the evidence in the case file, nor the Minister\u2019s submissions before it, offered a clear picture as to the nature of the comparison made by the Minister between the candidates in terms of their judicial experience.",

In these circumstances, and despite the proposal by the Evaluation Committee for their appointment, J.H. and E.J. could not be considered to have had a legal right to be appointed as judges to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal upheld, however, the District Court\u2019s findings in respect of J.H.\u2019s claims for non-pecuniary damage.

The conditions are, inter alia, that new evidence has come to light which could have had great significance for the outcome of the case if it had been available before the judgment was announced (point (a)), or that there were serious defects in the processing of the case which affected its outcome (point (d)). The State Prosecutor can also request reopening for the benefit of the convicted person if he considers that the conditions in section 228(1) of the Act are fulfilled. In accordance with section 229 of the Act, the request for reopening shall be made in writing and sent to the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings. It shall include detailed reasoning as to how the conditions for reopening are considered to be fulfilled. Pursuant to section\u00a0231 of the Act, the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings decides whether proceedings will be reopened. If a request for reopening is approved the first judgment remains in force until a new judgment is delivered in the case. Section 232 of the Act states that the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings can accept a request for the reopening of a case which has been finally decided in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court and a new judgment will be delivered if the conditions of section 228 are fulfilled. A case will not be reopened in the Court of Appeal unless the time-limit to request leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has expired or the Supreme Court has rejected leave to appeal.",

The defendants in the relevant case had been convicted of tax offences, which the Court had found to be in violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention (see the case of J\u00f3hannesson and Others v.\u00a0Iceland, no. 22007/11, 18 May 2017).

The appointment having been made prior to the introduction of Act no. 45/2010, at which time the Evaluation Committee\u2019s recommendations on judicial appointments were not yet binding on the Minister of Justice, the latter had disregarded the recommendation of the Evaluation Committee and had proposed a candidate who had only been considered \u201cqualified\u201d, instead of one of the three who had been considered \u201cvery well qualified\u201d.

The previously applicable third and fourth paragraphs of section 12 of Act no. 15/1998 relieved the Minister of Justice ... to a significant extent of this duty of investigation when making appointments to positions of District Court judge, instead placing it in the hands of the Evaluation Committee, which was appointed with a view to ensuring that specialised expertise would be available there to assess the qualifications of applicants for a position as District Court judge ... Although the Evaluation Committee\u2019s opinion was not binding on the Minister, ..., it must be kept particularly in mind that its investigation replaced by law an investigation which the Minister would otherwise have been obliged to carry out. As a result, if the Minister considered there to be a reason to deviate from the opinion of the Evaluation Committee when appointing a District Court judge, then his/her decision would have to be based on further investigation under section 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act, taking into account among other things his own instructions in Rules\u00a0no.\u00a0693/1999 on matters relating to the assessment of the applicants\u2019 qualifications, while at the same time ensuring that comparable expert knowledge was exercised as in the case of the Evaluation Committee\u2019s work.

The principle also entails that, in general, it is impermissible to take into account unrelated criteria such as political views or amity/animosity. In cases where public servants are to be recruited or appointed, authorities \u2013 or the recruitment companies they employ \u2013 increasingly appear to use a method whereby the criteria through which candidates are to be evaluated are enumerated and each criterion given a certain weight. Candidates are then awarded points for each criterion and their total score is calculated. The candidate who achieves the highest score is generally considered the most competent by the appointing authority. Deciding on the applicable criteria and their weight before evaluating candidates is in general in compliance with the appointing authority\u2019s task to evaluate candidates based on their professional competencies.",

In other instances, the criteria have been divided into categories, i.e. different categories of professional experience, where each category can only give a certain maximum number of points. The result is often that the candidate who has done the highest number of jobs, and thus obtains points from the most categories, achieves a higher score than a candidate who has mastered a certain professional experience, without any substantive assessment as to whether the long experience of the latter candidate constitutes better preparation for the post than the varied experience of the former.",

In this regard, I emphasise that the evaluation procedures followed by the authorities should enable them to meaningfully and substantively evaluate candidates, in order to recruit the most qualified candidate for each post. In general, I believe that in the light of the evaluative nature of the choice of candidate for a public post and the criteria on which such a choice can be based, care should be taken when making that choice on the basis of points, as described above.\u201d",

States should take specific measures guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary, protecting judges from any form of political influence in their decision-making through the constitution or adoption of laws establishing clear procedures and objective criteria for the appointment, remuneration, tenure, promotion, suspension and dismissal of the members of the judiciary and disciplinary sanctions taken against them.

In order to secure the independence of judges and the selection of the most suitable candidates, the Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of the establishment and application of objective criteria in the selection of judges. The principle of objective criteria was also highlighted by the Human Rights Committee and by the Committee against Torture. These objective criteria should relate particularly to qualifications, integrity, ability and efficiency. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that selection of judges must be based on merit alone, a key principle also enshrined in Recommendation No. R (94) 1228 and the Statute of the Ibero-American Judge...",

A response has now been made to this criticism, and the Minister of Justice has submitted a bill to the Althingi on amendments to the Judiciary Act, No.\u00a015/1998. Under the amendments proposed, the aim is that the Minister of Justice would appoint a five-man selection committee to examine the qualifications and competence of applicants for the position of both Supreme Court and district court judges ... This selection committee would submit to the Minister of Justice written and reasoned comments on applicants for positions as Supreme Court judges. In its comments, the committee would adopt a position as to which applicant was the best qualified to be appointed to the position, but would be able to name two or more as being equally well qualified.",

To counter those risks, the CCJE has recommended that every decision relating to a judge\u2019s appointment or career should be based on objective criteria and be either taken by an independent authority or subject to guarantees to ensure that it is not taken other than on the basis of such criteria.

Venezuela, the Court emphasized that judges, unlike other public officials, enjoy specific guarantees due to the independence required of the judiciary, which the Court has understood as \u2018essential for the exercise of the judiciary.\u2019 The Court has reiterated that one of the main objectives of the separation of public powers is to guarantee the independence of judges. The purpose of protection is to ensure that the judicial system in general, and its members in particular, are not subject to possible undue restrictions in the exercise their duties by bodies outside the Judiciary, or even by judges who exercise functions of review or appeal. In line with the case law of this Court and of the European Court of Human Rights, and in accordance with the United Nations Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary (hereinafter \u2018Basic Principles\u2019), the following guarantees are derived from judicial independence: an appropriate process of appointment, guaranteed tenure and guarantees against external pressures.",

The Chamber considered, thirdly, that having regard to their nature and gravity, the breaches of the national law in the instant case by the Minister of Justice had been of a fundamental nature, as they lay at the core of the appointment process. The Chamber moreover noted \u2013 in the light of the factual findings of the Supreme Court \u2013 that in addition to constituting a fundamental defect in objective terms, the breaches in question had also demonstrated the Minister\u2019s manifest disregard for the applicable rules in force at the material time. The Chamber lastly noted that the failure of Parliament \u2013 as confirmed by the Supreme Court \u2013 to adhere to the rule of separate voting on each candidate had also amounted to a serious defect in the appointment procedure, given that the relevant rule had been introduced to minimise the risk of party-political interests unduly influencing the process of appointments to the newly established Court of Appeal.",

He argued in this connection that despite the advice provided by her own legal staff and the clear precedent set by the Supreme Court judgment of 14 April 2011 (see paragraphs 36 and 115 above), the Minister of Justice, who was a lawyer herself, had ignored the legal obligations that had been incumbent on her in the process of judicial appointments to the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court had similarly found in its judgments of 19 December 2017 that the Minister had acted \u201cin complete disregard\u201d of the obvious danger to the reputational interests of the plaintiffs \u2013 namely the two non-appointed candidates \u2013 in that case. The applicant contended, on the basis of the aforementioned elements, that the Minister had breached the relevant laws with intent or with such gross negligence, that it bordered on intent. Referring, once again, to his arguments regarding the close political relations between the Minister of Justice and A.E.\u2019s husband B.N. (see paragraph\u00a089 above), the applicant argued that the Minister\u2019s decision had been motivated by political considerations and had amounted to abuse of power. He also argued in this connection that two of the candidates removed from the list by the Minister had been associated with left-wing parties in different capacities, and that candidate number 30 proposed by the Minister had been the husband of a friend and former colleague of hers.",

He claimed firstly that one of the rejected candidates was a District Court judge who had been ranked higher than all of the four District Court judges whom the Minister had chosen to appoint instead. Secondly, she had appointed a male District Court judge who had been ranked 30th on the Evaluation Committee\u2019s list, but had chosen to ignore a female District Court judge ranked 22nd. In the applicant\u2019s submission, these examples demonstrated that the Minister had not been justified in her decision and suggested an abuse of power.",

According to the applicant, this was a conscious decision on the part of Parliament, aimed at ensuring the approval of all four candidates who had not been on the Evaluation Committee\u2019s list, and as such it had constituted a breach of a very serious nature. To illustrate his point, the applicant explained that if the proposals had not been put to a single vote, Parliament would then have had to take separate a vote to reject, for instance, the candidate ranked in the 7th place in favour of a candidate ranked 30th, who was among the four proposed by the Minister. It was therefore evident that Parliament had failed to act as a check on executive power and had thus neglected a legal duty vested in it for these exact circumstances. The applicant further argued that the explanations given by Parliament to justify the single vote were not satisfactory, as parliamentary custom could not take precedence over statute law. Like any other institution, Parliament had to abide by the law, particularly when the law in question was specifically designed to ensure due process in the appointment of judges and to curb the powers of the executive in that regard by assigning a supervisory function to Parliament.",

They considered it important to stress that the initial proposal submitted by the Evaluation Committee had met with criticism in Parliament, both from the opposition and from the coalition parties. The criticism had been two-fold: first, it was considered that the Evaluation Committee\u2019s proposal had disregarded gender equality, since of the fifteen candidates proposed, only five were women; second, it was considered that the Evaluation Committee had not given adequate weight to judicial experience. The list proposed by the Evaluation Committee would, therefore, have needed to be changed in any event and in her proposal to Parliament, the Minister of Justice had taken the relevant concerns into account. The Government further stressed that section 4 of the Minister of Justice\u2019s Rules no.\u00a0620/2010 listed the objective factors on which the Committee was expected to base its assessment, but it did not say anything about the weight to be accorded to each assessment factor. The Committee had taken it upon itself to give judicial experience the same weight as litigation and administrative experience. The four candidates removed from the Evaluation Committee\u2019s list by the Minister of Justice had received 0.5, 1.0, 3.5 and 5.5 for judicial experience according to the Committee\u2019s assessment table, whereas the four candidates added to the list had received 9.5, 8.5, 7.0 and 6.0. A.E., who was among the female candidates proposed by the Minister, had a thirty-two year judicial career and had more judicial experience that any of the four candidates excluded from the list. That said, the proposal made by the Minister had not been based on objective numerical values; when she proposed that more weight be given to judicial experience, this did not merely involve comparing the years of experience of the candidates, but also a subjective evaluation of their quality and capabilities. As for the gender equality considerations, the Government did not contest that such considerations only came into play under the Equality\u00a0Act if candidates of different genders were \u201cequally qualified\u201d, but argued that, contrary to the findings of the Evaluation Committee, the Minister had considered more than fifteen candidates to be equally qualified for the post.",

While the requirements of the \u201csufficient investigation\u201d rule under section 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act, which sought to ensure the factual accuracy of administrative decisions, applied strictly in the field of judicial appointments \u2013 given the importance of considerations such as the separation of powers and independence of judges \u2013, the Government argued that it was not absolutely certain what that requirement entailed in this specific field.

It was established in that judgment that A.E. was fully vested with legal office, that she had participated in the applicant\u2019s case \u201cin accordance with domestic law\u201d and the Court of Appeal was, in determining his case, \u201cestablished by law\u201d. There was nothing arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable in the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that even if there were shortcomings in the procedure preceding A.E.\u2019s appointment, this did not entail that the Court of Appeal lacked competence to decide on the applicant\u2019s case. It was therefore important not to confuse the legal effects of the procedural flaw in question regarding the other candidates (that is, the candidates who were removed from the list by the Minister of Justice) with the legal effects of the same flaw on the status of A.E. or on the applicant\u2019s case. That procedural flaw was remote from the proceedings in that case. The Supreme Court had found that, as a matter of domestic law, A.E.\u2019s status had been unaffected by the procedural flaws identified and that, therefore, the Court of Appeal did not lack competence to act as a \u201ctribunal\u201d as a result of A.E.\u2019s presence. According to the Government, its competence in this sense was solely decided by the interpretation of domestic law. The Government argued that while the Chamber had accepted the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion as to the existence of flaws in the appointment procedure, it had disregarded the same court\u2019s conclusion regarding the lack of any significant legal consequence of the flaw. The approach adopted by the majority implied that the legal effects of breaches of domestic law should not be assessed according to domestic law itself, but immediately and directly according to independent criteria laid down by the Chamber, and this would have the effect of detaching the violation of national law from its legal effects under national law. Referring in particular to the Supreme Court judgments concerning the candidates J.R.J. and \u00c1.H., the Government stressed at the hearing before the Grand Chamber that A.E.\u2019s appointment had been considered valid and effective as a matter of law. If the procedural defects identified had no implications or significance for A.E., then the logical conclusion was that they could not have any effect for the applicant either.",

The Government further argued that recent developments in Iceland had shown that the Evaluation Committee had changed its assessment procedure since 2017 and had now adopted the practice of proposing more candidates than the number of advertised posts, which is what the Minister of Justice had requested from the Committee in the present case (see paragraphs 22 and 25 above). They referred in this connection to an assessment report delivered by the Evaluation Committee on 9 December 2019 in the context of an appointment to the office of Supreme Court judge, where the Committee had proposed three candidates as being the most qualified for one advertised post.",

It was only as a result of unforeseen developments that general elections were called on 15 September 2017, and that the elections were held prematurely in October 2017 \u2013 that is, some three years prior to the initially scheduled date. In these circumstances, it could not be argued that the Minister had proposed B.N.\u2019s wife A.E. to the post of a Court of Appeal judge as part of a political deal to secure her Ministerial post in the new government. The Government added that not only was there a complete absence of material to support the applicant\u2019s extraordinary allegations of bad faith against a wide range of persons and institutions, but also that none of those allegations had been made at the domestic level, which meant that the principle of exhaustion of domestic remedies prevented him from raising them before the Court now.",

Accordingly, the \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d requirement was a facet of the overarching object of Article 6. In the Government\u2019s view, the \u201cestablished by law\u201d requirement could be construed in one of two ways. Under the first approach, the function of the term \u201cestablished by law\u201d would be to emphasise that Article 6 required access to a body which had jurisdiction to take legally binding decisions, in that (i) the \u201ctribunal\u201d itself had a proper foundation in domestic law, and (ii) the bench trying a particular case was validly constituted as a matter of domestic law. Under the second approach, the term \u201cestablished by law\u201d would be construed as importing an additional requirement that there be no legal defect relating to a judge\u2019s appointment that would \u201cdestroy the essence of the right to a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal\u201d. The Government argued that the first of these approaches was more consistent with the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d interpretation rule under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention of 1969 on the Law of Treaties. The second approach, on the other hand, was not necessary in order to achieve the aims of Article 6: importing considerations of fairness, independence and impartiality into the \u201cestablished by law\u201d requirement would arguably duplicate protections provided elsewhere in Article 6, and obscure the specific function of that requirement. According to the Government, that function \u2013 reflected in the first approach identified above \u2013 was to ensure that the body hearing a case was legally competent to issue a binding determination in that particular case.",

The Commissioner contended that not only should the legal basis, the jurisdiction and the composition of a tribunal be regulated in advance by law, but the law in question should also determine the criteria and the procedure for the appointment of judges, and the appointments should in turn be conducted in compliance with those provisions. Strict observance of such provisions was essential to prevent unlawful interference with the appointment procedure by other branches of government, in particular the executive, and thus to ensure the independence and impartiality of judges. Such strict compliance would also serve to build public trust in the administration of justice and thereby to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the judiciary. The Polish Commissioner considered that it was essential not only that judges be independent and impartial, but also that the procedure for their appointment appeared to be so.",

The Commissioner further supported the notion that instances of flagrant violation had to be fundamental in nature and form an integral part of the appointment process. Accordingly, only those breaches that had a substantial impact on the conduct and/or outcome of the process would pass the \u201cflagrant breach\u201d threshold.

The question is always whether, in a given case, the\u00a0requirements of the Convention are met (see Kleyn and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98 and 3 others, \u00a7 193, ECHR\u00a02003VI, and Henryk Urban and Ryszard Urban v. Poland, no.\u00a023614/08, \u00a7 46, 30 November 2010).",

It notes in this connection that in two separate judgments delivered on 19 December 2017 (see paragraphs 67-75 above), the Supreme Court of Iceland has already established that the relevant law had not been complied with in so far as the appointment of the four judges proposed by the Minister, including A.E., was concerned. Firstly, by replacing four of the candidates \u2013 whom the Evaluation Committee had considered to be amongst the fifteen best qualified for appointment to the Court of Appeal \u2013 with four others \u2013 who had not made it to the top fifteen according to the Evaluation Committee\u2019s assessment \u2013 without carrying out an independent evaluation of the facts or providing adequate reasons for her decision, the Minister of Justice had breached section 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act. In this connection, she had also disregarded the wellestablished general principle of Icelandic administrative law that only the most qualified candidates should be selected to public posts. Secondly, the Icelandic Parliament had not held a separate vote on each individual candidate proposed by the Minister of Justice, as required under temporary provision IV of the new Judiciary Act. These findings were, moreover, repeated in the judgment delivered subsequently by the Supreme Court in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 90 above).",

The Grand Chamber should accordingly proceed on the basis that the process by which A.E. was appointed to the Court of Appeal breached some of the relevant rules of domestic law on judicial appointments.

As the Court has previously held, a tribunal that is not established in conformity with the intentions of the legislature will necessarily lack the legitimacy required in a democratic society to resolve legal disputes (see Lavents v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 58442/00, \u00a7 114, 28 November 2002).",

It goes without saying that the higher a tribunal is placed in the judicial hierarchy, the more demanding the applicable selection criteria should be.

The case in question concerned the conviction of an applicant (in 2002) by a district court composed of one professional judge and two lay judges, who had been appointed as lay judges in 1991 and 1999, respectively. After having established that the appointment of the lay judges in question had not been in compliance with the relevant domestic procedure in force at the material time, the Court concluded that the district court that issued the judgment against the applicant with those lay judges\u2019 participation could not be regarded as a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d. The judgment in Ilatovskiy, despite its differences from the present case, provides a clear example of a situation where irregularities in the appointment procedure may compromise the legitimacy of a court or tribunal, in which the appointed judges later participate, as one \u201cestablished by law\u201d.",

That requirement reflects the principle of the rule of law and seeks to protect the judiciary against unlawful external influence, from the executive in particular (see paragraph\u00a0211 above), although it is not excluded that such unlawful interference may also emanate from the legislature or from within the judiciary itself. It moreover encompasses any provision of domestic law \u2013including, in particular, provisions concerning the independence of the members of a court \u2013 which, if breached, would render the participation of one or more judges in the examination of a case \u201cirregular\u201d (see paragraph\u00a0212 above).

There is, therefore, already a considerable consensus among the States surveyed in this regard and this cannot be overlooked by the Court. The results further show that in many other States this matter remains undetermined; it is, therefore, not excluded that if a similar question were to arise in those States, the domestic courts could, in principle, interpret the requirement of a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d as covering the process of judicial appointment as well.

Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, \u00a7 56, 20\u00a0October 2011; see also the Rule of Law Checklist prepared by the Venice Commission, paragraph 123 above, where legal certainty is identified as one of the benchmarks of the rule of law). Under the Convention law, the principle of legal certainty manifests itself in different forms and contexts, such as requiring law to be clearly defined and foreseeable in its application (see, for instance, Medvedyev and Others v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2010, in the context of Article 5), or requiring that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see, for instance, Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no.\u00a028342/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999VII). This latter aspect of legal certainty presupposes, in general, respect for the principle of res judicata, which, by safeguarding the finality of judgments and the rights of the parties to the domestic proceedings \u2013 including any persons involved as victims \u2013, serves to ensure the stability of the judicial system and contributes to public confidence in the courts. According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, while the requirements of the principle of legal certainty, and the force of res judicata, are not absolute (see, for an example in the criminal-law sphere, Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a019867/12, \u00a7 62, 11 July 2017), a departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character, such as the correction of fundamental defects or a miscarriage of justice (see, for instance, Ryabykh v. Russia, no.\u00a052854/99, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2003IX, and OOO\u00a0Link Oil SPB v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a042600/05, 25 June 2009). These notions do not, however, lend themselves to precise definition; the Court has to decide, in each case, to what extent the departure from the principle of legal certainty is justified (see, for instance, Sutyazhnik v. Russia, no.\u00a08269/02, \u00a7 35, 23 July 2009).",

Where the national courts have duly assessed the facts and the complaints in the light of the Convention standards, have adequately weighed in the balance the competing interests at stake and have drawn the necessary conclusions, the Court would need strong reasons to substitute its assessment for that of the national courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v.

According to the latest legislative changes, the Evaluation Committee, which initially had advisory status only, was subsequently granted the power to issue binding recommendations for judicial appointments to courts at all three levels. While the law did allow the Minister, exceptionally, to deviate from the Committee\u2019s assessment to a certain extent, use of such discretion was always subject to the control of Parliament (see paragraphs 19 and 105 above).",

In their 2010 report submitted to the Human Rights Committee on the implementation of the ICCPR, the Government of Iceland expressly stated that the relevant legislative changes had come about as a response to the growing concerns in the country that the rules governing the selection and appointment of judges did not sufficiently guarantee the independence of the judiciary, on account of the role played by ministers in the appointment process (see paragraph 120 above). Similarly, in its evaluation report on Iceland published in 2013, GRECO underlined that \u201cbefore the new [appointment] system applied, the Minister was not bound to follow the advice of the relevant judicial bodies when appointing a person to judicial office and indeed it happened in the past that appointments were made arbitrarily raising criticism as to political influence having filtered in the process\u201d (see paragraph 128 above).",

While that is true, the Court agrees with the Supreme Court that this information alone does not suffice to explain why those four particular candidates were removed from the list, or why the other four particular candidates were added.

Similarly, amongst the eighteen candidates who had not been recommended by the Committee, there were those \u2013 including a female candidate \u2013 who had scored higher in judicial experience than some of the four eventually chosen by the Minister.

Following such examination, the Supreme Court had found that, as a matter of domestic law, A.E.\u2019s status as a lawfully appointed judge had been unaffected by the procedural flaws identified and that, therefore, the Court of Appeal did not lack competence to act as a \u201ctribunal\u201d by virtue of A.E.\u2019s presence on its bench. It was essential in this regard not to confuse the legal effects of the procedural flaw in question regarding the other candidates with the legal effects of the same flaw on the status of A.E. as a judge or on the applicant\u2019s case.

In reaching these findings, the Supreme Court seems to have placed a great deal of emphasis on the mere fact that the appointments had become official upon signature by the President and that from that point onwards, there was no reason to doubt that the fifteen Court of Appeal judges, all of whom had been found to be legally qualified for the post by the Evaluation Committee, would perform their tasks independently and in accordance with the law.",

This understanding in fact finds support in the Government\u2019s submissions: it appears from their statement that, although, in theory, the Icelandic courts had the power to verify the lawfulness of judicial appointments and to quash the judgments in which unlawfully appointed judges had participated, procedural breaches of the type encountered in the present case would, in practice, only result in an award of damages to the unsuccessful candidates. There had thus \u201cnot been a case in the past half-century which suggested that the flaws in question would or could lead to the invalidation of a judicial appointment\u201d (see the Government\u2019s remarks in paragraph\u00a0187 above).",

The Court finds that this practice poses problems for two main reasons. It considers in the first place that it undermines the significant role played by the judiciary in maintaining the checks and balances inherent in the separation of powers. It notes secondly that, having regard to the significance and the implications of the breaches in question \u2013 as discussed above \u2013, and to the fundamentally important role played by the judiciary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law, the effects of such breaches may not justifiably be limited to the individual candidates who have been wronged by nonappointment, but necessarily concern the general public. The Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a law-governed State, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties (see, for instance, Morice v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a029369/10, \u00a7 128 ECHR 2015; Baka, cited above, \u00a7 164; and Denisov v.

It notes in this connection that as a result of the proceedings brought by two of the unsuccessful candidates in June\u00a02017 (very shortly after the signing of the appointment letters by the President), the irregularities in the appointment procedure were established by the Supreme Court as early as 19 December 2017, barely two weeks prior to the date on which the fifteen selected candidates even took office. Furthermore, the applicant in the present case requested the withdrawal of A.E. on 2\u00a0February 2018, that is only one month after she had begun serving, and the final judgment of the Supreme Court in his case was rendered on 24\u00a0May 2018, less than four months later. In other words, the appointment of A.E. and the other three candidates in question was contested at the national level immediately after the finalisation of the appointment procedure and the irregularities that vitiated their appointment had been established even before they took office. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the Government cannot reasonably rely on the principles of legal certainty or the security of judicial tenure to argue against a violation of the right to a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d on the present facts.",

The Government have claimed in this regard that the irregularities had occurred long before Judge A.E. had sat in the applicant\u2019s case, had no connection with his case and carried no implications for the independence or impartiality of A.E. (see paragraph 188 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion, the requisite \u201cproximity\u201d between the irregularities at issue and the applicant\u2019s case was attained when, and only when, the irregularly appointed judge, A.E., sat on the bench of the Court of Appeal which heard his case. The Court notes that the applicant presumably had not had any legal interest, or standing, to contest A.E.\u2019s appointment at an earlier stage. Moreover, the question whether the irregularities at issue had any actual implications for A.E.\u2019s independence or impartiality, this being at the centre of the Supreme Court\u2019s examination of the applicant\u2019s case, did not as such have a direct bearing on the assessment of his separate complaint under the \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d requirement, as already noted in paragraph 280 above.",

The Court notes that there were further legal guarantees in place to remedy the breach committed by the Minister, such as the procedure before Parliament and the ultimate safeguard of judicial review of the procedure before domestic courts; however, as discussed above, all those safeguards proved ineffective, and the discretion used by the Minister to depart from the Evaluation Committee\u2019s assessment remained unfettered.",

In this general context, the process of appointing judges is said necessarily to constitute an \u201cinherent element of the concept of \u2018establishment\u2019 of a court or tribunal \u2018by law\u2019, and an interpretation to the contrary would defy the purpose of the relevant requirement\u201d. This inherent element is confirmed by a considerable degree of consensus among the States surveyed. Yet, in the eyes of the Court, Article 6 of the Convention \u201csolely\u201d imposes \u201cthat the relevant domestic law on judicial appointments is couched in unequivocal terms, to the extent possible, so as not to allow arbitrary interferences in the appointment process, including by the executive\u201d. This unquestionably vague statement is insufficient in view of the Council of Europe\u2019s principle that judicial appointments must result from a decision of a body composed by at least a majority of judges, a fundamental guarantee of judicial independence that has been set out by the Committee of Ministers and reiterated by the Consultative Council of European Judges (CCJE), the Venice Commission and GRECO. The omission of the Council of Europe\u2019s position is all the more curious in view of the reference to the GRECO report on Iceland and to the relevant Committee of Ministers and CCJE documents. As confirmed unanimously by these authorities, the rationale of this principle is that it lays the ground for an effective guarantee of judicial independence and separation of powers, by conferring on a majority of judges the ultimate power to take a merit-based decision on who enters the judiciary and how judges progress in their careers, while at the same time making it possible for lay persons as representatives of civil society to participate in this process and consequently avoiding the prevalence of a corporatist mentality. Without any justification, the Court refrains from confirming the above-mentioned Council of Europe principle and its rationale, which is absolutely pertinent in the present case, and even accepts systems as being Convention compatible where the executive has \u201cdecisive influence\u201d on judicial appointments \u201cas is the case in many States Parties, where the restraints on executive powers by legal culture and other accountability mechanisms, coupled with a long-standing practice of selecting highly qualified candidates with an independent state of mind, serve to preserve the independence and legitimacy of the judiciary\u201d. One is left to wonder which legal culture and which accountability mechanisms the Court is thinking of. If these vague references were not dangerous enough, the Court places the guarantee of judicial independence totally in the hands of the executive when it correlates the maintenance of \u201cthe independence and legitimacy of the judiciary\u201d with \u201ca long-standing practice of selecting highly qualified candidates with an independent state of mind\u201d, whatever this may mean. The Grand Chamber\u2019s argument of legitimation by tradition is akin to an ex post facto sociological analysis, but is certainly not a valid legal line of argumentation.",

Although it proposes an essentialist reading of the Convention (\u201conly those breaches that relate to the fundamental rules of the procedure for appointing judges \u2013 that is, breaches that affect the essence of the right to a \u2018tribunal established by law\u2019 \u2013 are likely to result in a violation of that right\u201d), it immediately abandons it in favour of a consequentialist approach, ultimately focusing on whether \u201ca breach of the applicable national rules on the appointment of judges created a real risk that the other organs of Government, in particular the executive, [could exercise] undue discretion undermining the integrity of the appointment process to an extent not envisaged by the national rules in force at the material time\u201d. The message of the judgment reflects the circumstance that the Court looks at this case with the benefit of hindsight, from the perspective of the irregularities in the procedure whereby a certain judge (Judge A.E.) was appointed to office and their clearly negative consequences for the legitimacy of the Court of Appeal as an institution, regardless of their connection to or implication for the applicant\u2019s case. For the Court, the decisive vantage-point from which to approach this case is that of the \u201ceffects\u201d on the \u201cgeneral public\u201d of the unlawful conduct of the Minister of Justice in the appointment of Judge A.E. and of the connivance of the majority of parliamentarians. Indeed, this judgment represents, as was its aim, a verdict on the integrity of the Icelandic judicial system as a whole, even including the Supreme Court, whose \u201csettled practice\u201d of \u201crestraint\u201d and \u201cresignation\u201d has not been spared from criticism.",

This consideration is hardly compatible with the acknowledgment that \u201c[t]here may indeed be circumstances where a judicial appointment procedure that is seemingly in compliance with the relevant domestic rules nevertheless produces results that are incompatible with the object and purpose of that Convention right\u201d. Even more importantly, the Court takes for granted the compatibility of the Icelandic legal framework with the Convention. Thus the Court does not problematise, as it should have done, the role played by the Evaluation Committee, which is tasked with assessing the qualifications of the candidates and determining those most qualified for the post, being composed of five members appointed by the Minister of Justice, under sections 11 and 12 of the new Judiciary Act no. 50/2016 (L\u00f6g\u00a0um\u00a0d\u00f3mst\u00f3la). While the initial, merely advisory role, of the Committee was indeed problematic, the subsequent attribution of power to issue binding recommendations for judicial appointments to courts at all three levels is no less questionable, because the law does allow the Minister to deviate from the Committee\u2019s assessment, although the use of such discretion is subject to the control of Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Government themselves acknowledge that \u201cneither the law nor its Explanatory Notes contain instructions on how the Minister should prepare a proposal to Parliament when deviating from the opinion of the Evaluation Committee, leaving a wide margin of discretion for the Minister in this matter\u201d. In straightforward language, the Icelandic legal framework allows for a Minister of Justice backed by a political majority in Parliament to circumvent the merit-based decision of the Evaluation Committee. Against this legal background, a case like the present one was bound to arise sooner or later. Even assuming that the spirit of the law sought to limit the politisation of the judicial appointment process, as the Government argued, the very letter of the law invited politicians to undermine that spirit.",

The appointment of a judge to a court in accordance with the relevant eligibility criteria is undoubtedly part of the essence of this right. This is also supported by the fact that a significant number of Contracting Parties consider that the requirement of a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d covers the legal procedure for the appointment of judges and allows or even imposes the reopening of the proceedings in the event of a judgment being adopted by a judge who has been unlawfully appointed to office.",

The problem is that the Court does not provide that clear answer either.",

Like the Chamber, and contrary to the Government, the Grand Chamber is of the view that the violation of the right to a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d does not require a separate examination as to whether the breach of that principle had had the effect of rendering the proceedings overall unfair. It is important to note that under existing case-law, the finding of a violation of the right to a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d, the right to an independent judge, or the right to an impartial judge, has never required a separate analysis of the fairness of the proceedings as a whole. This line of case-law is fully respected by the present judgment, and rightly so. By ignoring the Government\u2019s repeated invitation to proceed to an assessment of the overall fairness of the applicant\u2019s trial, the Court implicitly acknowledges the absolute nature of the defects in the appointment of Judge A.E., who was a member of the court hearing the applicant\u2019s case. Yet the Court misses the opportunity to explicitly affirm that absolute procedural defects in the appointment of a judge, such as those which occurred in the present case, do not allow for any holistic, harmless-error analysis based on factors such as the passing of time or the defendant\u2019s procedural conduct.",

The applicant\u2019s position regarding the reopening of his criminal proceedings during or subsequent to the oral hearing is therefore irrelevant, since a defendant\u2019s acquiescence to a violation of the essence of a Convention right is of no legal value. What matters is that the respondent State should draw all the necessary conclusions from the absolute nature of the procedural defects identified by the Court, and should do so in a three-step manner: firstly, by reopening the applicant\u2019s domestic trial; secondly, by preventing violations of the same nature in cases pending before domestic courts; and thirdly by rectifying all judgments raising similar problems which have become final.

The Court wants to have its cake and eat it, by finding on the one hand that the irregularities in question were of \u201csuch gravity that they undermined the very essence of the right to be tried before a tribunal established in accordance with the law\u201d, therefore justifying the reproach against the Minister for her unlawful conduct in the appointment of Judge A.E., against the majority of the parliamentarians for their connivance with the Minister and against the Supreme Court for its inertia in the applicant\u2019s case, whilst on the other hand limiting the impact of this judgment in the domestic legal order as much as possible by not imposing reopening and thus not guaranteeing the possibility of a fair judgment, by a court established by law, to the applicant and to all defendants in similar cases.

The Grand Chamber has sought to refine and clarify the meaning of the concept of \u201ca tribunal established by law\u201d and to analyse its relationship with the requirements of independence and impartiality under Article 6 \u00a7 1 in order to provide an interpretation of that concept which \u201cbest reflect(s) its purpose and ... ensure(s) that the protection it offers is truly effective\u201d (see paragraph\u00a0218 of the judgment). The right to a tribunal established by law is elevated to a stand-alone right under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (paragraph 231) and treated as \u201ca distinct Article 6 safeguard\u201d (paragraph\u00a0280), albeit that the basis of and need for this characterisation are not fully explained. Nor, in our view, have its consequences been sufficiently considered. In order to accommodate the principles of legal certainty, res judicata and the irremovability of judges, the Grand Chamber finds that only the gravest of breaches of the judicial appointment rules would amount to a violation of the right to a tribunal established by law (paragraphs 236-41). The majority\u2019s finding of a violation is based, firstly, on the nature of the now stand-alone right to a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d and, secondly, on the participation in the applicant\u2019s appeal of a judge \u201cwhose appointment procedure was vitiated by grave irregularities that impaired the very essence of that right\u201d (paragraph 289).",

Thus the finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is unanimous. However, our approach to the three inter-related requirements in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention \u2013 \u201cestablished by law\u201d, \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201cimpartiality\u201d \u2013 differs from that of our colleagues, as does our reason for finding a violation. In our view, there was no need to transform the first requirement into a stand-alone right in order to find a violation in this case; nor was it necessary to \u201csupercharge\u201d the different defects in the appointment procedure in order to ensure that they met the threshold test of the Grand Chamber\u2019s own making. It was sufficient in this case for the Grand Chamber to find that a series of defects, of variable importance and gravity, which occurred when establishing a new appellate court for which the Icelandic legislature had provided a clear appointment procedure, and in the context of heightened awareness of the various forms which \u201crule of law\u201d problems may take in different European States, violates the Article 6 \u00a7 1 \u201cestablished by law\u201d requirement. In addition, we consider that, having declared in paragraph\u00a0210 of the judgment that the Grand Chamber\u2019s task was to determine the consequences of breaches of domestic law on judicial appointments in terms of Article 6 \u00a7 1, it has failed to do just that. The judgment risks sowing confusion rather than clarity with the new test summarised above and, moreover, the Court\u2019s failure to examine whether the panel which heard the applicant\u2019s appeal was in fact, in his case, independent and impartial should give rise to considerable concern. In the individual case of the applicant, it is through this examination of his second complaint that the consequences of any appointment irregularities should have been assessed.",

It found that it could uphold the applicant\u2019s claim only if the judge was not a lawful holder of judicial power, thus if the flaws in the appointment process had entailed the nullity (\u201cmarkleysa\u201d) of that appointment. Referring to its previous judgment in relation to the shortlisted candidates whose names had been removed, as mentioned above, it repeated that in spite of the flaws in the procedure at the level of the Minister of Justice, they did not entail such a nullity. It stressed in that context, inter alia, that all the judges so appointed were qualified to hold judicial office in the light of their professional experience and legal knowledge. This had not been contested by the applicant. Furthermore, the Supreme Court reiterated that recourse to a single vote in Parliament was a \u201cdefect of no significance\u201d. Taking also into account the fact that all the new judges had been appointed to office by letters signed by the President of Iceland, there were insufficient reasons to doubt that the applicant had enjoyed a fair trial before independent and impartial judges.

Examples from different Council of Europe member States (e.g. Austria, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom) demonstrate that the unlawful or irregular appointment of judges does not automatically lead to the annulment of the judgments in which they have taken part. Although such systems also consider the right to a lawfully established tribunal as an essential guarantee for a fair trial, they do not provide for unconditional protection against a decision by a judge who has been appointed following a flawed procedure. An irregularity in the appointment of a judge will only undermine the lawful establishment of a court in a narrow set of circumstances. A high threshold is set and it will not be met in cases of flaws of a purely technical nature which were incapable of having had any influence on the appointment decision itself. In some countries, regard will be had to whether the irregular appointment of a judge was material to the proceedings, and also to the damage that would be caused to each party if the hearing of the case were to be nullified. This protects the judge\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed irremovability against unwarranted attacks and the validity of the trial from immaterial flaws in the judicial appointment procedure.

Pending before this Court are numerous Article 6 cases in which questions arise relating to the existence or absence of the objective guarantees necessary to safeguard the independence and impartiality of judges. In Brussels, questions relating to compliance by certain European Union (EU) member States with their EU law obligations under, inter alia, Articles 2 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) are pending, and concrete manifestations of a member State\u2019s failure to so comply in the judicial sphere have been a running theme in cases before the CJEU for several years now.

Take, for example, the preliminary ruling of the CJEU in a 2019 case known as A.K., where it examined whether the new Disciplinary Chamber of the Polish Supreme Court was independent (see the extract in paragraph 138 of the Grand Chamber judgment). The CJEU explained when a court could be considered to lack the independence and impartiality required by Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. As regards the circumstances in which the members of a tribunal were appointed, executive involvement in the appointment procedure was clearly stated to be unproblematic, however, reflecting established Strasbourg case-law: \u201cif, once appointed, they [would be] free from influence or pressure when carrying out their role\u201d. Furthermore, turning to the substantive conditions and detailed procedural rules governing the adoption of appointment decisions, the CJEU held that it was necessary to ensure that they could not give rise to reasonable doubt, in the minds of individuals, \u201cas to the imperviousness of the judges concerned to external factors and as to their neutrality with respect to the interests before them\u201d. With all due respect, it is difficult to see much difference between the reasoning of the Icelandic Supreme Court, which led it to conclude in concreto that A.E. clearly did not lack the requisite independence to sit in the three-judge panel hearing the applicant\u2019s appeal, and that of the CJEU.",

Council of the EU \u2013 this is a case which at first sight might be read as lending support to the majority\u2019s approach. On closer inspection, however, we consider that it does not. The background to the case was similar to that of the applicant in the present case. The Council, when constituting the members of the European Civil Service Tribunal (ECST), had used a list of candidates established to appoint two judges in order to appoint a third one. The participation of the latter in Mr Simpson\u2019s case was challenged. In relation to the consequences of this appointment irregularity \u2013 a question identical to that before the Grand Chamber \u2013 the General Court of the EU held that as the constitution of the ECST was improper, the judgment under appeal automatically had to be set aside in its entirety. The judge at issue could not \u201cbe regarded as a lawful judge\u201d. In that case the Court of Justice held, however, that the General Court had erred in law. The impugned appointment irregularity was not of such a kind or of such gravity as to create a real risk that the Council had made unjustified use of its powers, undermining the integrity of the outcome of the appointment process and thus giving rise to a reasonable doubt in the minds of individuals as to the independence and impartiality of the judge whose appointment had been challenged. There had been no infringement of a fundamental rule in relation to judges which was intended to protect their independence. The CJEU did not reject the logic of the Chamber\u2019s departure in \u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0sson, but in our view clearly sought to work around it. In particular, it relied on the principle of legal certainty, which it regarded as necessary to ensure the stability of the judicial system, in order to avoid any automaticity in terms of consequences (the setting aside of a judicial decision in which the impugned judge had participated) which the new departure in this Court\u2019s case-law risked \u2013 and now risks \u2013 entailing.",

The judgment \u2013 known as LM or Celmer \u2013 originated in a preliminary reference from the Irish High Court, which asked whether it could execute a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) issued by the Polish courts in relation to an individual accused of drug trafficking. The applicant, who was the subject of the EAW, had argued that since Poland, and its courts, had departed so completely from the common values of the rule of law, he ran a real risk in his individual case, if surrendered, of a breach of his right to an independent tribunal. The CJEU enjoined the referring court, and courts confronted with the same problem in other EU member States, to carry out a two-stage process when deciding whether to execute an EAW in such circumstances: first assessing systemic or generalised deficiencies with regard to the independence of courts in the issuing member State and then ascertaining, specifically and precisely, whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the individual concerned will run such a risk if he is surrendered to that State. The latter assessment in concreto of the alleged risk of a fair trial breach must have regard to the individual\u2019s personal situation, as well as to \u201cthe nature of the offence for which he is being prosecuted\u201d. We are aware that regarding an EU member State such as Poland, where questions in relation to the independence of its judiciary have arisen following a series of sustained legislative changes, it is now being asked whether there is a need for the second stage of the CJEU assessment just described. On this view, the deficiencies in an individual case could be regarded as established once systemic deficiencies reach a certain level. However, given that the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the present case derives from a series of shortcomings, of variable importance and gravity, albeit ones which were allowed to occur in a specially designed judicial appointment procedure, we consider that the present case is clearly far removed from the Polish context which is the subject of the bulk of the CJEU cases.",

We have no difficulty concurring with the majority in finding a series of flaws in the manner in which the Minister departed from the list proposed by the EC and proceeded to propose a different list to Parliament. Those flaws were identified by the Icelandic Supreme Court in its judgments of 19\u00a0December 2017, awarding damages to candidates whose names had been shortlisted but removed (see paragraphs 68-73 of the present judgment). According to that Supreme Court judgment, the Minister of Justice was entitled to propose her own candidates to Parliament, but her proposal had to be based on an independent investigation of all the elements necessary to substantiate it, in accordance with the well-established rules of administrative procedure. She consequently had to ensure that her own investigation and assessment were based on expert knowledge, on a par with that of the EC, and that the instructions concerning the evaluation procedure as set out under the applicable rules on the work of the EC \u2013 rules that had been put in place by the Ministry of Justice to guide that work \u2013 were taken into account in her assessment. The Minister should, at the very least, have compared the competencies of the four candidates that she had added to the list with the four that she had removed. Depending on the outcome of such a comparison, the Minister should then have given due reasons for her decision to seek Parliament\u2019s approval for her proposal to depart from the EC\u2019s selection. Only in this manner could Parliament have sufficiently played its role in the process and taken a sufficiently informed position on the Minister\u2019s assessment. The inadequate character of the investigation conducted by the Minister of Justice prevented her from reaching a different decision on the competencies of the candidates from that previously reached by the EC on the basis of the same data (paragraphs 72-73 of the judgment). The Minister\u2019s conduct was all the more regrettable as she must have been aware of the slippery slope on which she was embarking, having been warned by her in-house legal advisers (paragraphs 35 et seq. of the judgment).",

It should be added that criticism of the rigidity of the criteria chosen and applied by the EC, as well as of the insufficient importance accorded to judicial experience, was echoed by several domestic stakeholders and bodies at the time. Furthermore, the appointment system has subsequently been changed so that evaluation committees propose more candidates than the number of judicial posts (as explained in the respondent Government\u2019s submissions at paragraph\u00a0190 of the judgment). This represents \u2013 it should be noted \u2013 the very margin which the Minister had requested in relation to the Court of Appeal appointments. Moreover, the difference between candidate 15 (the last to be retained) and A.E., no. 18, was 0.205 (5.48-5.275/10) points = 2.05%. With such a narrow margin between them, it is almost impossible to speak of a difference in merit. Moreover, the greater reliance placed by the Minister on two criteria, even if she did not follow them entirely and consistently, does not seem totally unreasonable. Four men were replaced by two women and two men, and among the newly retained candidates, each had more \u2013 indeed much more \u2013 judicial experience. The judge whose impartiality and independence was impugned in the applicant\u2019s case, A.E., had a score of 8.5 in this respect, whereas the four removed candidates had only obtained between 0.5 and 5.3 points.

As stated succinctly in paragraph\u00a0295 of the judgment and explained above, the majority decided that there was no need to examine the applicant\u2019s second complaint in relation to the alleged lack of independence of the Court of Appeal panel which heard his case. As the complaints stem from the same underlying problem \u2013 an irregular judicial appointment procedure \u2013 the finding of a violation in relation to one requirement (\u201cestablished by law\u201d) dispensed with the need to examine the other complaint (an allegedly unfair trial due to the lack of judicial independence). In other words, the consequence of the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in relation to the first requirement was, automatically but implicitly, the unfairness of the applicant\u2019s trial. At its most extreme \u2013 as expressed explicitly or implicitly in the separate opinions of Judge Serghides and Judge Pinto de Albuquerque \u2013 the applicant was not tried by a properly constituted court and thus there was no \u201cjudgment\u201d as such, in his regard.",

In each case, it is necessary to ascertain whether the violation of legal requirements in the appointment procedure has impaired the independence and objective impartiality of the judge in the impugned trial whose fairness has been challenged. Evidence of such an approach is scattered throughout the Grand Chamber judgment itself; take the position of the Polish Commissioner for Human Rights: \u201cinstances of flagrant violation had to be fundamental in nature and form an integral part of the appointment process\u201d (paragraph\u00a0197 of the judgment, emphasis added). Then in paragraph 234 of the judgment, for example, the Grand Chamber stresses that it must \u201csystematically enquire whether the alleged irregularity in a given case was of such gravity as to ... compromise the independence of the court in question\u201d. In addition, it is clearly stated that departure from the principle of legal certainty is justified only \u201cwhen made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character, such as fundamental defects and miscarriages of justice\u201d (paragraph 238 of the judgment).",

In other words, she fulfilled the requirements set by the new Judiciary Act. This was not contested by the applicant. She had scored lower in the EC\u2019s evaluation because she had no attorney, teaching or academic experience and because the EC had decided to downplay the importance of prior judicial experience. Once she was appointed as a Court of Appeal judge by the President of Iceland, all the constitutional and legal guarantees for, and obligations incumbent on, members of the judiciary applied to her. She held office for an indefinite term, was not bound to follow any instructions from the executive and could not be removed from office except by a judicial decision.

Under the head of Article 46 of the Convention, the judgment reiterates the general principle that the respondent State has a legal obligation to choose, \u201csubject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress as far as possible the effects\u201d (paragraph\u00a0311 of the judgment). It acknowledges that, in certain special circumstances, the Court has found it useful to indicate to a respondent State the type of measures that might be taken to put an end to an \u2013 often systemic \u2013 situation (paragraph 312). The judgment then relies entirely on the statement made at the Grand Chamber hearing by the applicant\u2019s representative, who, when asked whether his client sought the reopening of his case, responded in the negative. No heed is paid to the fact that he eventually retracted this statement, the reason being that there was insufficient justification to explain the change in the applicant\u2019s position (paragraph\u00a0313). The judgment lastly observes that it falls to the respondent State to take any general measures, as appropriate, in order to resolve the problems that have led to the Court\u2019s findings and to prevent similar violations from taking place in the future. It adds that this does not mean that the Icelandic State would be obliged, under the Convention, to reopen all similar cases that have since become res judicata (paragraph\u00a0314).",

For the reasons outlined above, it is that question which we consider to be central. There are striking examples in Europe today of legal systems where appointments are strictly in conformity with domestic law but where the law itself may be the problem, as it appears to be aimed, usually after a process of gradual or rapid amendment, at cementing executive control over the judiciary, thus fettering and undermining its independence. As a matter of fact, we note that on a general level the Icelandic authorities have already acknowledged and remedied the imperfections in the impugned judicial appointment procedure. After the Chamber judgment the Court of Appeal operated with only eleven of the fifteen appointed judges; four additional judges were temporarily appointed then a fresh call for judges was made and eventually new judges, including A.E., were appointed after a regular procedure (see paragraphs\u00a099-100 of the judgment).",

This consequence is not something that the Court, having held that there is no tribunal established by law, can overlook or consider unnecessary to examine. It should have decided the issue by stating the obvious and rejecting these complaints, in the manner that I propose.",

When there is no \u201ctribunal\u201d, as in the present case because of the absence of a tribunal established by law, there is no noun and thus no object to which the adjectives \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cimpartial\u201d can correspond, with the result that these adjectives become devoid of object and existence. It is crucial to note that all the requirements of the right to a fair trial specified by Article 6 \u00a7 1 are indispensable, and without them the said right cannot be secured. However, the only free-standing requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 is that there must be a lawful tribunal. This requirement is a central feature of a fair trial as it refers to the very essence of the relevant right. The other requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1, such as the independence or impartiality of the tribunal, or that the hearing should take place within a reasonable time, all pre-suppose the fulfilment of the central demand, namely that the tribunal must have been established by law. In other words, the \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201cimpartiality\u201d requirements are intrinsic and inseparable qualities related to the very existence of \u201ca tribunal established by law\u201d. It is impossible to examine the qualities of a tribunal that does not exist, just as it is impossible to examine the qualities of a nonexistent person or building. Therefore, any hope that a tribunal is independent and impartial will hinge on the fact that it is a tribunal established by law in the first place. The former qualities are dependent on the latter and cannot be left in a vacuum.",

And what is more, it failed to do so even though it had rightly acknowledged that the very essence of the right in question had been undermined (see paragraph\u00a0295 of the judgment).",
