However, Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to keep the Court informed of his complaint before his position in connection with the impugned matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, the Court considers that it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Keenan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a027229/95, 22\u00a0May 1998).",

That includes a breach of the right to defend himself in person and of the principle of equality of arms (see Dobrowolski v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a017842/02, 7 March 2006).

The manner in which Article 6 is applied to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see Ekbatani v.\u00a0Sweden, judgment of 26 May 1988, Series A no.\u00a0134, \u00a7\u00a027, and Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056). Proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, despite the fact that the appellant is not given the opportunity to be heard in person by the appeal or cassation court, provided that a public hearing is held at first instance (see, among other authorities, Monnell and Morris, cited above, p.\u00a022, \u00a7\u00a058, as regards the issue of leave to appeal, and Sutter v.\u00a0Switzerland, judgment of 22\u00a0February 1984, Series A no.\u00a074, p.\u00a013, \u00a7\u00a030, as regards the court of cassation).",

In order to decide this question, regard must be had, among other considerations, to the specific features of the proceedings in question and to the manner in which the applicant\u2019s interests were actually presented and protected before the appellate court, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it (see Belziuk v. Poland, referred to above, \u00a7\u00a037, Hermi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a018114/02, \u00a7\u00a060, ECHR 2006...). Where an appellate court has to examine a case as to the facts and the law and make a full assessment of the issue of guilt or innocence, it cannot determine the issue without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused for the purpose of proving that he did not commit the act allegedly constituting a criminal offence (see Dondarini v.\u00a0San Marino, no.\u00a050545/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 6\u00a0July 2004). The wider concept of a fair trial also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The latter means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party (see, among other authorities, Brandstetter v.\u00a0Austria, 28\u00a0August 1991, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066 and 67, Series A no.\u00a0211).",

However, such a waiver must, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance (see Poitrimol v.\u00a0, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a031, Series A no.\u00a0277A). Furthermore, in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial, Article\u00a06 of the Convention imposes on every national court an obligation to check whether the defendant has been informed of the date of the hearing and of the steps to be taken in order to take part (see, mutatis mutandis, Somogyi v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a067972/01, \u00a7\u00a072, ECHR 2004-IV, and Hermi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a076).",
