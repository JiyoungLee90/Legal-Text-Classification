The case originated in an application (no. 7709/06) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Slovenian nationals, Ms Boža Plut and Mr Aleksander Bičanič Plut (“the applicants”), on 8 February 2006.
The applicants were represented by Ms M. Verstovšek, a lawyer practising in Celje. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 27 April 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants are mother and son. They were born in 1959 and 1994, respectively, and live in Primskovo.
On 27 October 1998 the mother (hereinafter referred to as “the applicant”) instituted a labour dispute against her former employer before the Ljubljana Labour and  seeking the payment of wages.
Between 19 June 2002 and 12 July 2002 the court held two hearings. A hearing scheduled for 18 October 2002 was postponed on the request of the applicant. She requested a postponement for a period of six months.
On 30 July 2004 the applicant received a notice for a hearing scheduled on 14 September 2004.
On 14 September 2004 the court held a hearing and issued a decision on suspension of proceedings, because both parties failed to attend. The court found that in the absence of a request for a hearing or any other procedural step within four months the proceedings would be terminated.
On 25 October 2005 the court held a hearing. It appears that there was either a request for a hearing or a submission lodged so the proceedings could continue.
On 28 March 2006 the court held a hearing and delivered a judgment, rejecting the applicant’s request. She appealed.
On 21 September 2006 the Higher Labour and  rejected the appeal. She lodged an appeal on points of law.
On 9 January 2007 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal.
