The Government drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that the defendant in the domestic proceedings was an individual and that the judgment could not be enforced due to the authorities\u2019 failure to determine his whereabouts. They proposed paying the applicant EUR 1,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and costs and expenses and argued that this amount would constitute sufficient just satisfaction in the present case. They relied on the case of Grivneac v.

The Court considers that the primary purpose of the civil defamation proceedings brought by the applicant against G.T. was to repair his tarnished reputation and that the payment of non-pecuniary damage by the latter was only a subsidiary and ensuing consequence of the court\u2019s finding the impugned statement defamatory.

The same principle was later reiterated in the Moldovan leading case concerning non-enforcement of final judgments (see Prodan v. Moldova, no. 49806/99, \u00a7 70, ECHR\u00a02004III (extracts)).

Moldova, cited above, and Lupacescu and Others v.\u00a0Moldova, nos. 3417/02, 5994/02, 28365/02, 5742/03, 8693/03, 31976/03, 13681/03 and 32759/03, 21 March 2006). In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant has complied with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 6 above) by obtaining an enforcement warrant and requesting a bailiff to enforce it. On the other hand, the Court was not presented with any evidence that the enforcement authorities took any steps to have the judgment enforced. The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s submission that defendant G.T., who was during the period of non-enforcement a Member of Parliament, Governor of the Gagauzia region and a member of the central Government of Moldova, could not be located by the enforcement authorities. Therefore, the Court finds that the failure to enforce the judgment of 12 June 2001 constitutes a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",
