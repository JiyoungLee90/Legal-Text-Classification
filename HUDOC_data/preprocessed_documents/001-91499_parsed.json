I also urged the Turkish-Cypriot authorities to release without delay all those who had been detained. On 24 July, the President of the Security Council announced that he had conveyed to the representatives of all the parties, on behalf of the members of the Council, the Council\u2019s deep concern at the tense situation created by the incidents of 19 July. He also stressed the need strictly to respect the UN buffer zone and appealed for the immediate release of all persons still detained. He asked all concerned to show maximum restraint and to take urgent steps that would bring about a relaxation of tension and contribute to the creation of an atmosphere favourable to the negotiations.\u201d ",

It does not see any reason to depart, in the instant case, from that finding, which is not in any way inconsistent with the view adopted by the international community regarding the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d or the fact that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus remains the sole legitimate government of Cyprus (see Cyprus v.

Whilst this provision does not specify that the relevant information should be given in writing or translated in written form for a foreign defendant, it does point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the \u201caccusation\u201d to the defendant. An indictment plays a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of its service that the defendant is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him or her. A defendant not familiar with the language used by the court may be at a practical disadvantage if the indictment is not translated into a language which he or she understands (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7 89, 1 March 2006; Kamasinski v.\u00a0Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 79, Series A no. 168; and Taba\u00ef v.\u00a0France (dec.), no. 73805/01, 17 February 2004).",

This means that an accused who cannot understand or speak the language used in court has the right to the free assistance of an interpreter for the translation or interpretation of all those documents or statements in the proceedings instituted against him or her which it is necessary for him or her to understand or to have rendered into the court\u2019s language in order to have the benefit of a fair trial (see Luedicke, Belkacem and Ko\u00e7 v.

This suggests that oral linguistic assistance may satisfy the requirements of the Convention (see Husain v. Italy (dec.), no. 18913/03, 24 February 2005). The fact remains, however, that the interpretation assistance provided should be such as to enable the defendant to have knowledge of the case against him or her and to defend himself or herself, notably by being able to put before the court his or her version of the events (see G\u00fcng\u00f6r v.

The Court sees no reason to depart from these findings, which were based on the UN Secretary General\u2019s report, on a video film and on photographs submitted by the respondent Government before the Commission. It emphasises that in his report, the UN Secretary General stated that the demonstrators had \u201cforced their way into the UN buffer zone in the Ayios Kassianos area of Nicosia\u201d, that they had broken \u201cthrough a wire barrier maintained by UNFICYP and destroyed an UNFICYP observation post\u201d before breaking \u201cthrough the line formed by UNFICYP soldiers\u201d and entering \u201ca former school complex\u201d (see paragraph 21 above).",

In this respect, the Court notes that it does not have at its disposal any element capable of casting doubt upon the statements given by some witnesses at trial according to which the area where the accused had entered was \u201cTRNC\u201d territory (see paragraph 24 (iv) above). In the Court\u2019s view, the intervention of the Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces was not due to the political nature of the demonstration but was provoked by its violent character and by the violation of the \u201cTRNC\u201d borders by some of the demonstrators.",

The Court held that effective remedies were available within the \u201cTRNC\u201d legal system in respect of three complaints only: the complaint of interferences by private persons with the rights of Greek-Cypriots living in Northern Cyprus under Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (\u00a7 324); the complaint relating to the treatment of Turkish-Cypriots living in Northern Cyprus, who were political opponents of the \u201cTRNC\u201d regime; and the complaint relating to the treatment of the Gypsy community living in Northern Cyprus (\u00a7 383). In the case of the first of these complaints, the respondent Government had produced evidence in support of their contention that court remedies were available and highlighted the successful claims brought by a number of Greek-Cypriot litigants. In the case of the latter two complaints, the Court observed that the applicant Government had not succeeded in refuting the respondent Government\u2019s submissions in the proceedings before the Commission that remedies were available to aggrieved individuals within the \u201cTRNC\u201d legal system.",
