The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative.

The corresponding provision of the Code was directed towards all citizens rather than towards a group possessing a special status. The reference to the \u201cminor\u201d nature of the acts does not, in itself, exclude its classification as \u201ccriminal\u201d in the autonomous sense of the Convention, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the Engel criteria, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, \u00a7 104). Finally, the Court considers that the primary aims in establishing the offence in question were punishment and deterrence, which are recognised as characteristic features of criminal penalties (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 105).",

The Court observes that Article 158 of the Code of Administrative Offences provided for fifteen days\u2019 imprisonment as the maximum penalty and that the applicant was eventually sentenced to serve three days\u2019 deprivation of liberty. As the Court has confirmed on many occasions, in a society subscribing to the rule of law, where the penalty liable to be and actually imposed on an applicant involves the loss of liberty, there is a presumption that the charges against the applicant are \u201ccriminal\u201d, a presumption which can be rebutted entirely exceptionally, and only if the deprivation of liberty cannot be considered \u201cappreciably detrimental\u201d given their nature, duration or manner of execution (see Engel and Others, \u00a7 82, and Ezeh and Connors, \u00a7 126, both cited above).

In that case Mr\u00a0Gradinger had been criminally convicted of causing death by negligence and also fined in administrative proceedings for driving under the influence of alcohol. The Court found that although the designation, nature and purpose of the two offences were different, there had been a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 in so far as both decisions had been based on the same conduct by the applicant (see Gradinger, cited above, \u00a7 55).",

That approach was developed by the Court in the case of Oliveira (cited above), in which the applicant had been convicted first of failing to control her vehicle and subsequently of negligently causing physical injury. Her car had veered onto the other side of the road, hitting one car and then colliding with a second, whose driver had sustained serious injuries. The Court found that the facts of the case were a typical example of a single act constituting various offences, whereas Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 only prohibited people from being tried twice for the same offence. In the Court\u2019s view, although it would have been more consistent with the principle of the proper administration of justice if the sentence in respect of both offences had been passed by the same court in a single set of proceedings, the fact that two sets of proceedings were at issue in the case in question was not decisive. The fact that separate offences, even where they were all part of a single criminal act, were tried by different courts did not give rise to a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, especially where the penalties were not cumulative (see Oliveira, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 25-29). In the subsequent case of G\u00f6ktan the Court also held that there had been no violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 because the same criminal conduct of which the applicant had been convicted constituted two separate offences: a crime of dealing in illegally imported drugs and a customs offence of failing to pay the customs fine (see G\u00f6ktan, cited above, \u00a7 50). This approach was also employed in the cases of Gauthier v. France ((dec.), no. 61178/00, 24 June 2003) and \u00d6ng\u00fcn v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 15737/02, 10 October 2006).",

Austria (no. 37950/97, 29 May 2001), the Court confirmed that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 tolerated prosecution for several offences arising out of a single criminal act (concours id\u00e9al d\u2019infractions). However, since it would be incompatible with this provision if an applicant could be tried or punished again for offences which were merely \u201cnominally different\u201d, the Court held that it should additionally examine whether or not such offences had the same \u201cessential elements\u201d. As in Mr Fischer\u2019s case the administrative offence of drunken driving and the crime of causing death by negligence while \u201callowing himself to be intoxicated\u201d had the same \u201cessential elements\u201d, the Court found a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. It also pointed out that had the two offences for which the person concerned was prosecuted only overlapped slightly, there would have been no reason to hold that the defendant could not be prosecuted for each of them in turn. The same approach was followed in the case of W.F. v. Austria (no. 38275/97, 30 May 2002) and Sailer v. Austria (no.\u00a038237/97, 6 June 2002), both of which were based on a similar set of circumstances.",

It is not the Court\u2019s task to decide whether each of these elements was properly substantiated because, as it has been noted above, a conviction in the second proceedings is not a required element in order for the guarantee of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to apply, it being sufficient for the applicant to have been liable to be tried and/or to have actually been tried on these charges.",

Thus, the facts in the two sets of proceedings differed in only one element, namely the threat of violence, which had not been mentioned in the first proceedings. Accordingly, the Court finds that the criminal charge under Article 213 \u00a7 2 (b) embraced the facts of the offence under Article 158 of the Code of Administrative Offences in their entirety and that, conversely, the offence of \u201cminor disorderly acts\u201d did not contain any elements not contained in the offence of \u201cdisorderly acts\u201d. The facts of the two offences must therefore be regarded as substantially the same for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. As the Court has emphasised above, the facts of the two offences serve as its sole point of comparison, and the Government\u2019s argument that they were distinct on account of the seriousness of the penalty they entailed is therefore of no relevance for its inquiry.",

According to the Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 7, which itself refers back to the European Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments, a \u201cdecision is final \u2018if, according to the traditional expression, it has acquired the force of res judicata. This is the case when it is irrevocable, that is to say when no further ordinary remedies are available or when the parties have exhausted such remedies or have permitted the time-limit to expire without availing themselves of them\u2019\u201d. This approach is well entrenched in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for example, Nikitin v. Russia, no. 50178/99, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2004VIII, and Horciag v.

Although these remedies represent a continuation of the first set of proceedings, the \u201cfinal\u201d nature of the decision does not depend on their being used. It is important to point out that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 does not preclude the reopening of the proceedings, as stated clearly by the second paragraph of Article 4.",

Thus, in the Zigarella case (cited above) the domestic authorities conducted two sets of proceedings against the applicant concurrently.
