Therefore, while not limitless, the bounds of acceptable criticism geared toward him were wider than in relation to a private individual. It is true that he did not lay himself open to public scrutiny and needed to enjoy confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation when on duty (see Janowski, cited above, \u00a7 33; and, mutatis mutandis, Steur v. the , no. 39657/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040 and 41, ECHR 2003XI). However, the need to ensure that civil servants enjoy public confidence in such conditions can justify an interference with the freedom of expression only where there is a real threat in this respect. The applicant\u2019s remark obviously did not pose such a threat and did not hinder Mr S. in the performance of his official duties (see, mutatis mutandis, Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2003XII). In this connection, it should also be borne in mind that, unlike the situation obtaining in Janowski, where two municipal guards had been insulted in the street, while performing their policing duties, in front of numerous bystanders (see Janowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 34), the applicant\u2019s remark was made in front of a limited audience, at a meeting held behind closed doors. Thus, no press or other form of publicity was involved (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikula v. , no. 31611/96, \u00a7 52 in limine, ECHR 2002II; Yankov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 139 and 141; and, as an example to the contrary, Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2004XI). The negative impact, if any, of the applicant\u2019s words on Mr S.\u2019s reputation was therefore quite limited.",

It should also be noted that the applicant apparently uttered the remark formed on the basis of material which he offered to produce in corroboration (see paragraph 10 above).",

Latvia, no. 57829/00, 27\u00a0May 2004; and Steel and Morris v. the , no. 68416/01, ECHR 2005...). It is true that the possibility of recurring to criminal proceedings in order to protect a person\u2019s reputation or pursue another legitimate aim under paragraph 2 of Article 10 cannot be seen as automatically contravening that provision, as in certain grave cases \u2013 for instance in the case of speech inciting to violence \u2013 that may prove to be a proportionate response. However, the assessment of the proportionality of an interference with the rights protected thereby will in many cases depend on whether the authorities could have resorted to means other than a criminal penalty, such as civil and disciplinary remedies (see Lehideux and Isorni v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VII, p. 2886, \u00a7 51 in fine and p. 2887, \u00a7 57; and, mutatis mutandis, Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v.  [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7\u00a0115, ECHR 2004XI). The Court further notes that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were instituted on the insistence of Mr\u00a0S.\u2019s superior, the ProsecutorGeneral, who reacted on the spot, characterising the applicant\u2019s remark as a \u201ccrime\u201d immediately after it had been uttered, and shortly after that instructing the Sofia City Prosecutor\u2019s Office to open a preliminary inquiry against the applicant (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Mr S. did not participate as a party to them and did not make a claim for nonpecuniary damages against the applicant, as he could have done (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above; and also Fuentes Bobo, cited above, \u00a7 48 in fine). In this connection, the Court notes that later the relevant provisions of the Bulgarian Criminal Code were amended and at present provide that insult is privately prosecutable in all cases without exception (see paragraph 30 above and, mutatis mutandis, Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7 115 in fine).",

Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 48, 29 February 2000; and, as an example to the contrary, De Diego Nafr\u00eda v. Spain, no. 46833/99, \u00a7 41, 14\u00a0March 2002). Against this background, the reaction of the Prosecutor-General \u2013 who was Mr S.\u2019s hierarchical superior \u2013, the resulting criminal proceedings against the applicant, and his conviction seem as a disproportionate response to the incident in issue. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the dominant position which those in power occupy makes it necessary for them to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified criticisms of their adversaries (see, mutatis mutandis, Castells v.\u00a0Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, pp. 2324, \u00a7 46; and Ceylan v.

The applicant\u2019s resulting sentence \u2013 a fine and a public reprimand \u2013, while being in the lower range of the possible penalties, was still a sentence under criminal law, registered in the applicant\u2019s criminal record (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v.
