The Court agrees with the Government that the case was factually complex and involved complicated medical issues. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the complexity of the instant case alone cannot justify the complete duration of almost seven years for one level of jurisdiction. Moreover, the delays in the proceedings were much less linked to the complexity of the subject-matter than, for example, to the way in which the  attempted to find an expert for the third expert opinion. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the principal responsibility for delay due to expert opinions rests ultimately with the State (see, for example, Dojs v. Poland, no. 47402/99, \u00a7 38, 2\u00a0November 2004). Finally, the Court finds that even if some delays are attributable to the applicant, the latter\u2019s conduct cannot be considered to have decisively contributed to the total length of the proceedings. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court therefore considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",
