This question has been answered in the affirmative by the eminent courts referred to above. This finding that the functions discharged by that officer are compatible with the provisions of the Convention cannot subsequently be called in question on the sole ground that, once the investigation has been completed, the District Attorney assumes the role of prosecuting authority. The status of this officer at the time of and in relation to the decision to arrest remains the same, and the arrest, initially regarded as being lawful, cannot subsequently become unlawful on this sole ground. Furthermore, it is only natural that the District Attorney, as the investigating authority and acting within his powers, should draw up an indictment after the investigation has been completed if he considers that he possesses sufficient evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt. Nor can it readily be seen what the accused would gain if the indictment had to be drawn up by an officer other than the District Attorney who, at the beginning of the investigation, had ordered his arrest. In other words, as far as Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention is concerned, the fact that the officer who ordered the arrest is the same as the officer who drew up the indictment is not decisive.\"",

However, it did so only in order to reply to an argument, put forward by the applicant and by the minority of the Commission, that such a combination of functions jeopardised the independence of a District Attorney. Ultimately, without however having expressed a view on this argument in the abstract, the Court dismissed it because, in the case under examination, the District Attorney had not acted as prosecuting authority. It was only in subsequent judgments, delivered in a very different context - they concerned military justice in the Netherlands and Belgium -, that the Court found that the combination of functions - whether it actually occurred or was merely theoretically possible - would affect the independence of the judicial officer called upon to decide whether the detention of an accused person should be continued.",
