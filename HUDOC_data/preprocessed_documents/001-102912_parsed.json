The Court reiterates that it can take into account only those periods when the case was actually pending before the courts, thus excluding from calculation those periods between the adoption of the final and binding judgments and their revocation in the course of the extraordinary proceedings (see Markin v. Russia (dec.), no. 59502/00, 16 September 2004, and Pavlyulynets v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 70767/01, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 6 September 2005). The Court notes that the judgment of 24 January 2001 became res judicata on 24 April 2001, when it was upheld by the court of appeal. The Court further observes that it was only by virtue of the introduction of the new transitional remedy on 21\u00a0June 2001 that the applicant was able to challenge the decisions of the lower courts. In such circumstances, the recourse to the Supreme Court to challenge proceedings which had been brought to an end by a final decision must be seen as akin to a request to reopen those proceedings by means of the extraordinary transitional remedy provided for by the Law of 21 June 2001 (see Prystavska v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 21287/02, ECHR 2002X). Therefore, the period from 24 April 2001 to 28\u00a0February 2002 cannot be taken into account. The proceedings ended on 5\u00a0November 2008.
