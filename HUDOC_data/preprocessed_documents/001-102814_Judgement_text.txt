Article 55
“...Everyone is guaranteed the right to challenge in court the decisions, actions or omissions of bodies of State power, bodies of local self-government, officials and officers...”
The relevant provisions of the Code provide as follows
Article 205. Grounds for nullification of the proceedings
“1.  A court shall, by its ruling, nullify the proceedings, if:
...
7) a legal person that was a party to the proceedings has been liquidated.”
In 2005 the Bailiffs' Service was restructured under Decree No. 320 of the Cabinet of Ministers of 23 April 2005 and the Act of Parliament of 23 June 2005 “on introducing amendments to the State Bailiffs' Service Act and the Enforcement Proceedings Act”. The above government decree specified that new bailiffs' services were to be created in place of the bailiffs' departments of the Ministry of Justice.
In implementing this restructuring, the Ministry of Justice issued Order No 1482 of 19 August 2005, and this was followed by orders of the regional departments of justice. The Zaporizhzhya Regional Department of Justice issued such an order on 25 August 2005 (Order No. 521/15). Under the orders the bailiffs' departments were liquidated without legal successors and the new bailiffs' services were created in their stead as new legal persons.
