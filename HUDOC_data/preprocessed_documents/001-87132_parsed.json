Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise.

The authorities had found no grounds to support the assertion that the applicant had been subjected to racially motivated persecution, and had therefore decided that he was not a refugee within the meaning of the relevant legislation. The Court does not see any basis to question these conclusions.

Throughout the applicant\u2019s detention, the Russian law-enforcement system was unable to identify the competent body responsible for authorisation of his detention, to point to the applicable legal provisions and to determine the time-limits of such detention. For example, on 26 May and 3 June 2004 the Kuybyshevskiy district court forwarded the applicant\u2019s complaint about his illegal detention to the  prosecutor\u2019s office. On 25 May 2004 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office admitted in a letter to the applicant\u2019s lawyer that the \u201cquestion of extending the detention of a person detained [for the purposes of extradition] is not dealt with by the Russian legislation\u201d. On 12 July 2004 the Smolninskiy district court informed the applicant that he should contact the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office for all matters concerning his detention pending extradition. On 18 August 2004 the Dzerzhinskiy district court expressed the view that the provisions of the CCP were inapplicable in the applicant\u2019s case, and advised him to appeal the actions of the officials concerned in civil proceedings (see paragraphs 47-61 above). On 16\u00a0February 2005 the Kalininskiy district court ruled that the case should be transferred to the Kuybyshevskiy district court. Finally, on 14 March 2005 the Kuybyshevskiy district court found that no provisions existed in the Russian legislation governing the extension of detention of persons in the applicant\u2019s situation. He was released with direct reference to Article 5 of the Convention (see paragraph 84 above).",

While the Government referred to the interim measure indicated by the Court under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, this argument cannot be employed as a justification for the indefinite detention of persons without resolving their legal status. In the present case it does not appear that the applicant\u2019s detention was in fact justified by the pending extradition proceedings, in the absence of any such decision taken to date. This finding is exacerbated by the Court\u2019s conclusion above in relation to Article 3 that no proper evaluation of the applicant\u2019s allegations under Article 3 has taken place in the meantime (see, a contrario, Chahal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117).

Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, \u00a7 43, ECHR 1999-VIII). It is apparent from the material submitted that the applicant incurred legal costs and expenses in connection with the proceedings relating to determination of his refugee status and while trying to obtain judicial review of his detention pending extradition. The Court also notes that the case was relatively complex; however, it doubts that it required legal work in the amount claimed by the applicant, especially in view of the applicant\u2019s limited submissions after the case had been declared admissible. Having regard to the materials in its possession, the Court awards the applicant EUR\u00a09,000 in costs and expenses, less the EUR\u00a0701 received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe.",
