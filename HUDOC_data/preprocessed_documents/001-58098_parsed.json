His parents, his two brothers (one of whom is French and the other the father of two French children) and his two sisters (one of whom is French and the other the wife of a French national) live there. He is the father of three minor children born in France in 1982, 1983 and 1984, who have French nationality, and has kept in touch with them since he was deported. On 14\u00a0May 1986 he married their mother and it does not appear from the file that any separation or divorce proceedings have subsequently been brought (see paragraphs\u00a07\u20139 above). Consequently, the Court is in no doubt that the permanent exclusion order amounted to interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life.",
