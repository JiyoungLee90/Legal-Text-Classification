In addition to restating all of his complaints made previously to the electoral commissions, he also complained of specific instances of discrepancies and inconsistencies in the PEC protocols which served as a basis for compiling the election results in the constituency as a whole. In particular, he noted a significant discrepancy in the PEC protocol for Polling Station no.\u00a011, in which certain numbers did not add up correctly. As a result, more than 700 blank ballots out of more than 1,000 blank ballots originally issued to the PEC appeared to be \u201cmissing\u201d (the protocol indicated that 313 persons had voted in that polling station, but only eleven of the remaining blank ballots were indicated as \u201cunused\u201d and formally \u201ccancelled\u201d, with no explanation as to what happened to the remaining more than 700 blank ballots). The same was the case with the PEC protocol for Polling Station no.\u00a013, where more than 600 blank ballots were unaccounted for. Similar discrepancies were also allegedly found in PEC protocols for five other polling stations. The applicant claimed that these \u201cmissing\u201d blank ballots had been sneaked out and illegally used for ballot-box stuffing in favour of Z.O. in various other polling stations.",

In addition, decisions on the results of elections must also not take too long, especially where the political climate is tense. This means both that the time limits for appeals must be very short and that the appeal body must make its ruling as quickly as possible. Time limits must, however, be long enough to make an appeal possible, to guarantee the exercise of rights of defence and a reflected decision. A time limit of three to five days at first instance (both for lodging appeals and making rulings) seems reasonable for decisions to be taken before the elections.

Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V). The Court further emphasises that the domestic remedies must be \u201ceffective\u201d in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 158, ECHR 2000-XI). The Court is not persuaded by the Government's arguments. The Government failed to provide explanation as to how a complaint to the domestic courts concerning the method of composition of electoral commissions, made during the electoral process, could provide the applicant with adequate and timely redress. Within the framework of the appeal system for election-related complaints, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court were competent (at least theoretically under the domestic law) to hear appeals against decisions of electoral commissions concerning a wide variety of electoral matters. However, it appears that the relevant courts had no competence to alter the method of composition of electoral commissions, which was prescribed in detail by the Electoral Code, and especially so in the midst of the electoral process. The Government have not suggested any other form of redress that could have possibly been provided by the domestic courts and that could be considered adequate. For these reasons, the Government's objection must be dismissed.",

However, the Court has established that it guarantees individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 2 March 1987, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046-51, Series A no. 113). The Court has consistently highlighted the importance of democratic principles underlying the interpretation and application of the Convention and emphasised that the rights guaranteed under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations of an effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law (ibid., \u00a7 47; see also Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2005IX).",

It is, however, for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with. In particular, it has to satisfy itself, among other things, that the conditions in which individual rights are exercised in the course of the electoral process do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7 52, and Gitonas and Others v.\u00a0Greece, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV). Such conditions must not thwart the free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature \u2013 in other words, they must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see Hirst (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 62).",

Latvia, the Court stated that the right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would only be illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires that the eligibility procedure contain sufficient safeguards to prevent arbitrary decisions (see Podkolzina\u00a0v. Latvia, no.\u00a046726/99, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2002-II). Although originally stated in connection with the conditions on eligibility to stand for election, the principle requiring prevention of arbitrariness is equally relevant in other situations where the effectiveness of individual electoral rights is at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Kovach v. Ukraine, no. 39424/02, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02008...).",

The Court cannot accept this argument. In order to arrive at the conclusion proposed by the Government, it is first necessary to separately assess the seriousness and magnitude of the alleged election irregularity prior to determining its effect on the overall outcome of the election.

Nevertheless, the ConEC appeared to have relied exclusively on the statements of PEC officials in deciding to dismiss the applicant's complaint, without explaining why these statements were considered to be more reliable than the much more detailed and factspecific evidence presented by the applicant. In fact, no reason was offered by the ConEC in support of its finding that the applicant's claims were \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d.

For the same practical reasons, the States may find it inexpedient to require these authorities to abide by a set of very strict procedural safeguards or to deliver very detailed decisions. Nevertheless, these considerations may not serve to undermine the effectiveness of the appeal procedure, and it must be ensured that a genuine effort is made to address the substance of arguable individual complaints concerning electoral irregularities and that the relevant decisions are sufficiently reasoned.
