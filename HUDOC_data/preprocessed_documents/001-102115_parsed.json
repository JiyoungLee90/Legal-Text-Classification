This meant, inter alia, that it had to be \u201chighly probable\u201d, and not merely \u201cprobable\u201d that a certain factor in the working environment could cause a person\u2019s injuries and, thereby, be considered as having harmful effects. The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires (see the Government Bill 1992/93:30, pp.\u00a020 and 36) state that this implies that the responsible authorities have to consider more extensively than previously whether the exposure to a harmful factor at work has been of such an extent, intensity and duration that from this it can be concluded that the existence of harmfulness is highly probable. Furthermore, the collected knowledge must indicate with a considerable degree of probability that a factor in the environment is harmful. The view that a certain factor is very likely to cause an injury has to be relatively generally accepted. This is the case where substantial knowledge exists, within medical or other science, that a certain factor has such harmful effects. If there is a lack of such support, such as when, for example, there are profound differences in expert opinions, this requirement cannot be considered as fulfilled. Thus, the opinion of a specific researcher or medical doctor should not constitute a sufficient basis for a positive decision on the issue of harmful effects.",

Secondly, an oral hearing may be needed to clarify the positions taken by the parties in the case and perhaps eliminate unnecessary or meaningless points of dispute. In the latter case, the procedure is typically of a preparatory nature.

The question of whether a hearing is necessary should primarily be assessed in the light of the existing investigation of the case, but it should also be possible to accord significance to other factors, for example, if the case is very important for the party and a hearing would give him a better understanding of the import of the decision to be given in the case.

It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases. For example, the Court has recognised that disputes concerning benefits under social-security schemes are generally rather technical, often involving numerous figures, and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 263; Salomonsson v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038; Lundevall v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7 38; and D\u00f6ry v.

Thus, leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, although the appellant was not given the opportunity to be heard in person by the appeal or cassation court.

Sweden, 21 February 1990, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a064 and 66, Series A no. 171A; and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). The applicant had already expressly requested an oral hearing at what, in the Court\u2019s view, was the most appropriate stage of the proceedings - at first instance before the  - and the court had rejected that request on 25 May 1998. It cannot thus be said that the applicant would have waived his right to an oral hearing on 29 June 1999 as such request had already been decided by the County Administrative Court for more than a year earlier. On this account alone the present case is more striking than those of the aforementioned Salomonsson and Lundevall judgments, where an oral hearing was not requested until the appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal, and where the Court nevertheless found a violation.",

According to the interpretation made by the Swedish courts, these two grounds for refusing a request to hold an oral hearing were alternative, not cumulative (see paragraph 32 above). Thus, there is an apparent discrepancy between the Convention case-law, according to which in principle an oral hearing must be held unless there are exceptional reasons, and the standard applied by the national courts which reverses the order of the principle. The Court considers that the respondent State should take appropriate measures to ensure that it is the Convention standard that applies.",

On the contrary, it is not inconceivable that the doctors could have fleshed out at an oral hearing the various observations they had made in the relevant medical records, and could have given their opinion on the implications for the issues raised before the relevant courts.
