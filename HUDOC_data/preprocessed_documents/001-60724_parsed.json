In any event, cable networks were already broadcasting a large number of specialised programmes. Such programmes were very common in  and in the , yet no research had proved that democratic debate had been disrupted in these countries. In  in 1997 there were an average of forty-five television and fifty FM radio programmes of various types, thus bringing about integration and a communication culture resulting from the existing media taken as a whole. Nor could it be said that Car TV AG aimed primarily at entertaining the viewer. The application for a licence made it clear that the programme would have been based on a strictly journalistic and pluralistic approach, and would also have provided information on such matters as environmental issues.",

Furthermore, the programme would have duly taken account of the specific linguistic and political situation in : for instance, in addition to other measures to ensure pluralism, it was planned to set up a French-language programme. The government had discriminated against the applicant when approving a licence for Top TV, a channel exclusively devoted to weather reporting, and when stating that other channels were already dealing with automobile issues.

In the present case, the request of Car TV AG did not comply with the requirements set out in section 3(1) of the RTA, which specifically aimed at offering a common basis for information not limited to a particular group of viewers.

Moreover, it contained information on motorised mobility which was already part of the licence granted by the Federal Council to the Swiss Radio and Television Company. Clearly, the Federal Council did not say that automobile questions were not worthy of television coverage. The Government referred to the Commission's decision in Hins and Hugenholtz v. the Netherlands, which referred to \u201cthe aim of pluralism pursued in the Dutch broadcast system and policy\u201d (no. 25987/94, Commission decision of 8 March 1996, DR 84-A, p. 146). Although the Federal Council did not refer to the limited number of broadcasting frequencies, it was a fact that, even on cable television, such frequencies were limited. It was conceivable that the Federal Council would have decided to reserve such a licence for a future broadcasting programme, such as Star TV, which better complied with the cultural requirements for such a programme.",

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the need for an interference, although that margin goes hand in hand with European supervision, whose extent will vary according to the circumstances. In cases such as the present one, where there has been an interference with the exercise of the rights and freedoms guaranteed in paragraph 1 of Article 10, the supervision must be strict because of the importance \u2013 frequently stressed by the Court \u2013 of the rights in question. The necessity for any interference must be convincingly established (see among other authorities, Tele 1 Privatfernsehgesellschaft mbH v. Austria, no. 32240/96, \u00a7 34, 21 September 2000, and Radio ABC v. Austria, judgment of 20 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI, p. 2198, \u00a7 30).",
