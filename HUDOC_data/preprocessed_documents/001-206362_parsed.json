The Court reiterates that a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7\u00a071, ECHR 2006V). The claim on reasonable length of proceedings has a separate standing even in the event of a favourable outcome of the domestic civil proceedings (see Politikin v. Poland, no.\u00a068930/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a020, 25 and 27 April 2004) or the acquittal of criminal charges (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, no. 7324/02, \u00a7\u00a044, 4 April 2006). Accordingly, in the absence of any acknowledgement of the alleged violation of the right to a reasonable time of proceedings and redress on that account, the applicant may still claim to be a victim under this head.",

The Court notes that in the instant case the length of the administrative proceedings which had direct relevance to the applicant\u2019s civil rights exceeded eight years and eight\u00a0months at three levels of jurisdiction. Throughout this lengthy period, there was no substantial delay on the part of the applicant. On the contrary, the Government have not provided any reasonable explanation for the excessive length of the proceedings which the administrative courts eventually terminated for lack of jurisdiction (see paragraph 10 above). Moreover, the administrative proceedings stayed the civil action which had previously been initiated by the applicant\u2019s family in the civil courts and which was determined even later, after the termination of the administrative proceedings (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). Assessing the duration of both sets of proceedings in their entirety, the Court finds that the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement has not been met in the present case.",
