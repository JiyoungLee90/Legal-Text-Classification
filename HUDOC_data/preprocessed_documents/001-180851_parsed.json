The applicant and his representative acknowledged that he had sought contact with that teenager, but maintained that the purpose of it had not been that of harassment; rather, it had been an attempt to establish friendship (paragraphs 17-18 above). The Court has no doubt that sexual harassment constitutes behaviour warranting the utmost concern and appropriate prompt actions on the part of the domestic authorities, but the available material provides little to no grounds for classifying the applicant\u2019s conduct as such. The police report labelling unspecified actions as \u201charassment\u201d did not indicate whether the intervention by the police had been triggered by any complaint about the applicant\u2019s behaviours (see paragraph 8 above). Neither the ambulance report nor the record of the joint examination in the Hospital referring to \u201csexual harassment\u201d provided a detailed account of any relevant events, specific behaviour or utterances. At the same time the certificates issued by the local police station clearly stated that the applicant had committed no criminal or administrative offence (see paragraph 22 above). Under these circumstances the courts should not have confined themselves to a reiteration of the above allegations, but should have engaged in independent scrutiny of whether the applicant indeed posed any real danger to anyone. The fact that the applicant, in pursuit of his desires, travelled to another district of the city could hardly be considered as an indication of him being a danger to himself.",
