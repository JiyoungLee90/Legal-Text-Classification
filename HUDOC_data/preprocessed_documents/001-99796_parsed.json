In particular, the Court observes that neither of the court orders to which the applicant referred, set any time-limit for his detention (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above). Under the provisions governing the general terms of detention (Article 108 of the CCP), the time-limit for detention pending investigation was fixed at two months. A judge could extend that period up to six months. Further extensions could only be granted by a judge if the person was charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences. However, upon the expiry of the maximum initial detention period of two months (Article 109 \u00a7 1 of the CCP), no extension was granted by a court in the present case. The applicant was detained pending extradition from 31 October 2007 until 23 April 2010 that is for almost two and half years based on the last court order of 30 January 2008. During that period no requests for extension of his detention were lodged.
