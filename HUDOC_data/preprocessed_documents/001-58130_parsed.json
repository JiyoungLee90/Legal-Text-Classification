Her social relations had been reduced to occasional contacts with her family living in France. Having spent the first eighteen years of her life in Algeria, the applicant had, the Government said, created an independent social life and formed personal relationships. When she was deported to Algeria in 1987, she re-established those links by living with members of her family. On her return to France at the age of 38 the family ties with her mother and her brothers and sisters had been loose and she could not put them forward in the context of the instant case to secure recognition of her rights under Article 8. The only tangible link with France was the one with her son, born in 1990. But the question whether the applicant had a family life had to be considered in the light of the position at the date of the permanent exclusion order, 11 July 1985 (see the Bouchelkia v. France judgment of 29\u00a0January\u00a01997 and the El Bouja\u00efdi v. France judgment of 26\u00a0September\u00a01997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions \n1997-I, p. 63, \u00a7 41, and 1997-VI, p. \u2026, \u00a7 33). It had to be recognised that in 1985 the applicant was not married nor was she yet the mother of Karim. The decision to exclude her from the territory therefore did not infringe the right that was guaranteed her by Article 8. At all events, there was nothing to prevent Mrs Dalia from taking her son \u2013 who had dual nationality \u2013 to Algeria. ",

Applying this rule of procedure \u2013 which has a legitimate aim \u2013 to the applicant cannot in itself entail a breach of Article 8. In support of her application to have the exclusion order lifted, Mrs Dalia relied mainly on the fact that she was the mother of a French child.

In the Court\u2019s view, this situation, which was created at a time when she was excluded from French territory, cannot therefore be decisive. ",
