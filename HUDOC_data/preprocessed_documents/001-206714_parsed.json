The court considered the applicant to have a high and very serious level of culpability. The victim was the then 13year-old daughter of his extramarital partner and the offences had been committed over a relatively long period of ten months. The District Court was of the opinion that the applicant had disregarded the victim\u2019s right to sexual self-determination without hesitation and had committed acts against the young daughter of his \u201csexual partner at the time\u201d with complete disregard for the child\u2019s development. By taking advantage of his position of authority, he had abused her trust in the most shameful way to satisfy his inferior sexual inclinations. In doing so, he had not shied away from using psychological and physical violence and threats when pursuing his inappropriate goals. As a result of these terrible experiences, the victim developed serious psychological problems, from which she still suffers to date.",
