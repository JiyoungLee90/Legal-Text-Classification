Of course, the fact does not escape us that, in certain cases at least, the reactions of [the prosecutor] were to some extent occasioned by the attitude of the appellant's lawyer. This, however, is not a justification. The unpleasant atmosphere of confrontation and tension which was created without reason between the lawyers, at specific phases of the proceedings, did not, in our judgment, deprive the appellant of a trial that was fair from all points of view. The , with its patience, occasional interventions and its indications, mainly to [the prosecutor], restored the requisite calm to the entire proceedings and secured for the defence every possible opportunity to present its case in full.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the Supreme Court observed that it had not been convinced of the validity of any of the grounds raised by the applicant challenging the findings of the  (see paragraph 30 above). In view of the above, the Court considers that there was no need for the Supreme Court to enter into a detailed examination of these grounds.",

It was stated that it was impossible to go through the 3,820 typed pages of the transcript during the time given. The Supreme Court granted the adjournments so defence lawyer would not feel in any way embarrassed or pressed into commencing the hearing, although the grounds of appeal were well settled and filed with the appropriate Registry within the 10 day limit provided by the Rules. The requested adjournments set back the commencement of the appeal for a whole year. It may thus be noted that the time lost on account of the adjournments \u201ccompensates\u201d in a way the one year period inactivity on account of the delay of the preparation of the transcript. Another important element to be taken into account is the fact that the requested adjournments were not in any event necessary as the lawyer who defended the applicant before the  was the same who appeared at the appeal. He was therefore fully conversant with the facts and the evidence and moreover he had, as the record shows, always the benefit of a junior advocate sitting with him during the trial who must have taken notes throughout.",

FRG (1981)), civil status (Sylvester v.

So the urgency factor necessitating a more rigorous standard to be applied when the accused is in detention (Abdoella v. the Netherlands (1992)), was not as high or demanding as would have been otherwise. Moreover the lengthening of the case, as recognised by the Supreme Court in its appeal judgment, was to some extent attributable to the way the defence was conducted. One may stress here that the applicant had on two occasions voluntarily confessed the crime in written statements which were subsequently, as was his constitutional right, challenged but were nevertheless upheld by the  and sustained on appeal. Despite also the existence of strong DNA scientific evidence implicating the applicant into having sexual contact with the complainant, who was under age, this was also challenged.",

The lengthening of proceedings was presented as only a side effect of the above.

The overall period of 5 years and 3 months, at two levels of jurisdiction, should be in fact 4 years and 3 months allowing for the one year delay solely attributed to the defence. The frustration attributed to the protracted length of the proceedings, in assessing damages, was a theoretical one, as one should recognise that there is a frustration element inherent in any criminal case, especially of his nature. There would have indeed been frustration if the applicant was subsequently acquitted which was not the case, as he was found guilty as charged, making him a convicted felon, hardly in need of any compensation.",
