The situation escalated, the police were called and the incident, which subsequently involved also A.'s grown-up children, led to A.'s arrest.

Nor was B.'s conviction of a kind that would have justified revealing her identity. The applicants, therefore, had had no right to reveal B.'s name or to publish her picture. As to the intent, the District Court found that invasion of private life was punishable only if intent could be shown.

It found that, according to the preparatory works and the national and the Court's case-law, the facts mentioned in the articles were of a kind to which the protection of private life typically applied. The Supreme Court had already found in 2002 that B. was not a public figure, and the fact that she was a friend of such a person and that she had been involved in the incident that subsequently led to the dismissal of A. from his post as National Conciliator did not justify revealing her identity. However, since the convictions of A. and B. were closely linked in this case, B.'s name and conviction could lawfully have been mentioned. Nevertheless, the publishing of a big picture of B. was not necessary and therefore invaded her privacy. As to the intent, the omissions of the second applicant could not be regarded as proving his intent to invade B.'s privacy and, consequently, the charges against him were dismissed. He was also exonerated from paying B. non-pecuniary damages as well as her costs and expenses. The non-pecuniary damages payable by the applicant company were lowered to EUR 5,000.

As B. in the present case had been sentenced to a fine, this sentence had not as such reduced the protection of her privacy. This interpretation was also in line with the Court's case-law (see, for example, Z\u00a0v. , 25 February 1997, \u00a7 99, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I, and P4 Radio Hele Norge ASA v.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 \u00a7 2, which must, however, be strictly construed. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, for example, Lingens v. , 8 July 1986, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 103, and Nilsen and Johnsen v.

In this connection, the Court notes that, when assessing the cases stemming from the incident of 4\u00a0December 1996, the national courts also reached different conclusions as to whether B. could be considered as having waived her right to privacy when choosing to become involved with a public figure and in being a party to the incident, leading also to her conviction (see Tuomela and others v.

In general, the reasoning in the District Court's and the 's judgments in the present case is quite extensive. As far as the reasoning concerns the restrictions on freedom of expression, the courts stated in very detailed manner that the facts mentioned in the article were those to which the protection of private life typically applied, and took into account the incident and B.'s conviction as well as the fact that her position in society was not such that the exception for public figures normally applied to her.
