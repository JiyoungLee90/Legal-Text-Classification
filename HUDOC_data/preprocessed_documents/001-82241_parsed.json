In this regard, they explained that the \u201cUkrainianisation\u201d of the given names of individuals belonging to the two other nations of the Eastern Slavic group (i.e. Russians and Belarussians) represented an old and stable practice. In the three nations, every given name of Christian origin was considered to be one and the same, and typing differences (\u201cDmytro/Dmitriy\u201d)\u00a0had always been perceived as a matter of pure form. In other words, this given name had taken on its own phonetic form \u2013 a sort of local variation \u2013 in each Slavic language, which explained the difference in pronunciation and written form. This tradition also concerned the given names of famous individuals: thus, Tsar Peter the Great (Piotr in Russian) was called Petro in Ukrainian; Catherine II (Yekaterina) was transcribed as Kateryna; Mikhail Gorbatchev and Vladimir Ulyanov became Mykhaylo and Volodymyr when they were mentioned in a Ukrainian text. A similar practice existed in , where a Ukrainian named Dmytro would always be called Dmitriy. Finally, the Government emphasised that the applicant had reported no practical inconvenience arising from the situation of which he complained. The impugned interference was therefore in no way disproportionate to the aims pursued.",

This could pose problems, especially in the Crimea, where the majority of the population was Russian-speaking and where anti-Ukrainian sentiment still existed. In particular, the applicant insisted that, by imposing the \u201cUkrainianised\u201d form of his given name as its principal form, the Ukrainian authorities had infringed his rights under section 12 of the Ukrainian National Minorities Act.",

In such cases, even if a proper noun is adapted to the host country's language, it nonetheless retains its foreign sound, unique to the language of origin. Its holder's ethnic and national identity is therefore not affected. Thus, in , one would always understand that Piotr Illich Tcha\u00efkovski is Russian or of Russian origin, whatever the method used to transcribe his name.",

In this respect, the Court notes that, in , the internal passport (which is the standard identity document) contains two main pages; one is drawn up into Ukrainian, the other in Russian. On these two pages, the holder's given name and surname are entered, respectively, in accordance with the spelling system of both languages. In addition, forenames and surnames in Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian \u2013 three languages which belong to the Eastern Slavic language group \u2013 are not only transliterated in Ukrainian, but are always entered in both their historical and etymological versions (such as, for example, Jean \u2013 John \u2013 Giovanni \u2013 Jo\u00e3o \u2013 Ivan, etc.). Thus, there exists a whole series of doublets, in which the Ukrainian element may sometimes differ significantly from the Russian element, for example Dmitriy/Dmytro, Pavel/Pavlo, Nikolay/Mykola, Afanasiy/Opanas, Darya/Odarka, Yefim/Yukhym, Anna/Hanna and Aleksey/Oleksiy. In the context of the Eastern Slavic group, this system applies without distinction to all given names, whatever their precise origin. Thus, the given name Afanasiy, held by a citizen of Russian origin, will become Opanas on the Ukrainian page of his internal passport; and an \u201cethnic\u201d Ukrainian named Opanas would have his forename written as Afanasiy on the Russian page. However, it is usually the Ukrainian or \u201cUkrainianised\u201d version which becomes the main version, and this is the version which is used in the majority of other official documents, drawn up in Ukrainian only. The Court also bears in mind that, despite the fact that both Russian and Ukrainian are used in the internal Ukrainian passport, the two languages have a different status: Ukrainian is the only official language of the country; Russian is one of languages of the national minorities (paragraph 25 above).",

The Court notes that this procedure concerns not only the replacement of one name by another, but also any, even minor, changes in the spelling of that name. Moreover, reverting to or, as the applicant puts it, \u201crestoring\u201d a name does not involve anything more than just changing it back to its original form.
