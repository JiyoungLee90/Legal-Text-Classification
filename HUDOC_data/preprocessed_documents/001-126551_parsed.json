Since this was not the case with the house at issue it was not possible to establish two separate flats without further significant investment. In particular, it would be necessary to obtain a new building permit, which meant instituting a new set of administrative proceedings, and to carry out the necessary construction work. The expert further explained that he had never seen a use permit and therefore he had made his report as though it did not exist. In any event, the existence of a use permit would not significantly influence his findings, because it could always be obtained without any particular difficulties.

These interests involved their rights under Article 8 of the Convention and therefore, by the nature of the dispute, there was an inevitable interference by the domestic courts\u2019 decisions with the rights of one of the parties guaranteed under that provision. In such circumstances, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and was such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 (see Zehentner v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a020082/02, \u00a7 58, 16 July 2009).",

The expert report of 4 January 2010 found that partition in kind was not possible, since the house was a single unit with one entrance and a hallway leading to all the other rooms in the house (see paragraph 19 above). These findings were further elaborated by the expert at a court hearing held on 8 March 2010. The expert explained that partition in kind by establishing separate flats for the applicant and G.Z. was not possible without further significant investment, such as instituting new administrative proceedings, obtaining a new building permit, and carrying out the necessary construction work (see paragraph 22 above).",

The Vinkovci Municipal Court accepted the expert report, finding it sufficiently reasoned and convincing, and ordered partition by judicial sale. The decision of the Vinkovci Municipal Court is sufficiently reasoned and does not disclose any arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable conclusions, particularly having in mind the provisions of the relevant domestic law. They stipulate that the court shall order partition by judicial sale if partition in kind is not possible without adverse effects on the value of the property (see paragraph 37 above, sections 50 \u00a7 4 and 67 of the Property Act) and that a \u201cflat\u201d requires a separate entrance (see paragraph 38 above).",

Having in mind that the domestic authorities duly examined the applicant\u2019s objection as to the partition model, the Court sees no reason to doubt that they would have examined the applicant\u2019s argument as to whether it would be possible for her to buy another flat.
