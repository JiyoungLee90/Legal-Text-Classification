In particular, the parties do not contest that Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev was detained on 17 May 2000 at his home in Shali by a large group of armed men in camouflage uniform. The group used at least two military APCs and other vehicles, such as UAZ all-terrain vehicles, as well as the support of helicopters. It is further uncontested that five other men living in the neighbouring houses were detained at the same time and were later able to submit details of their detention. The detainees had been blindfolded, placed in two APCs and taken to a nearby location, where they had last seen Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev. At that location they were questioned by masked men in camouflage about their identity, whether they had taken part in the hostilities and what they knew about Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev (see paragraphs 14-15 above). The five men had spent the night at that location and on the following day they had been blindfolded again, put into an APC and released in a forest not far from Argun.",

On the contrary, the fact that a large group of armed men in uniform, equipped with military vehicles and helicopters, proceeded in broad daylight to apprehend several persons at their homes in a town area strongly supports the applicant's allegation that these were State servicemen. Although the exact units of the special or military forces that carried out the operation have never been established, the detainees' accounts of their detention, questioning and release support this conclusion. It appears that at first Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev's detention was not disputed, and the relatives invited a lawyer to ensure his defence in criminal proceedings. The Court also notes that information about the arrest by the security forces of Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev, who was a known public figure, was disseminated by the media, with reference to official sources (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). The domestic investigation also accepted these factual assumptions and proceeded to verify the involvement of law-enforcement bodies in Mr Alikhadzhiyev's detention. The Court therefore considers it established that on 17 May 2000 Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev was apprehended during an operation carried out in Shali by State agents.",

Russia, no.\u00a07615/02, ECHR 2006...; and Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a069480/01, ECHR 2006...). A number of international reports point to the same conclusion. The Court agrees with the applicant that, in the context of the conflict in , when a person is detained by unidentified servicemen without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention, this can be regarded as life-threatening. The absence of Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev or any news from him for over six years supports this assumption. Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor's office and the other law-enforcement authorities after the news of his detention had been communicated to them by the applicant significantly contributed to the likelihood of his disappearance, as no necessary steps were taken in the crucial first days or weeks after his detention. The authorities' behaviour in the face of the applicant's well-substantiated complaints gives rise to a strong presumption of at least acquiescence in the situation and raises strong doubts as to the objectivity of the investigation.",
