Armenia, no. 8001/07, \u00a7 86, 27\u00a0October 2016, and the references therein). Thus, the questions of personal presence, the form of the proceedings \u2013 oral or written \u2013 and legal representation are interlinked and must be analysed in the broader context of the \u201cfair trial\u201d guarantee of Article 6. The Court should establish whether the applicant, a party to the civil proceedings, had been given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations made or evidence adduced by the other party and to present his case under conditions that did not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent (ibid.). From the Convention standpoint, an applicant does not need to show that his absence from a hearing resulted in actual prejudice or affected the outcome of the proceedings, for such a requirement would deprive the guarantees of Article 6 of their substance (see Gankin and\u00a0Others v. Russia, nos. 2430/06 and 3 others, \u00a7 25, 31 May 2016). Finally, the Court reiterates that, in determining issues of fairness of proceedings for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention, the Court must consider the proceedings as a whole, including the decision of the appellate court (ibid.).",
