The case originated in an application (no. 58364/10) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Yordan Dimitrov Antonov (“the applicant”), on 29 September 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms G. Chernicherska, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms K. Radkova and Ms M. Dimova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant complained that the failure of the tax authorities for several years to pay him back unduly collected taxes, as established in two final judgments in his favour, had breached his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He further complained that he had not had an effective remedy under Article 13 in respect of the alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.1.
On 13 September 2017 the Government were given notice of the complaints under Article 13 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in the village of Okorsh, Silistra region.
In 2000-01 the tax authorities conducted a tax audit of the applicant, who at that time was the legal representative of a private agricultural association. The audit was carried out in respect of income tax and valueadded tax (“VAT”) for the periods between January 1998 and December 1998 and between February 1998 and August 1999 respectively.
On 2 March 2001 the Silistra territorial tax directorate issued a tax assessment (данъчен ревизионен акт) charging the applicant a total amount of 55,013.43 Bulgarian levs ((BGN); 28,128 euros (EUR)) in VAT and income tax, including interest.
Noting a mistake in the applicant’s tax registration, on 30 March 2001 the tax authorities issued an act for correction of an obvious factual error in the tax assessment of 2 March 2001 (акт за поправка на данъчен ревизионен акт). The taxes imposed on the applicant were not reviewed and remained unchanged.
The applicant challenged the taxes before the director of the Varna regional tax office, who on 1 June 2001 upheld the 2001 tax assessments. The applicant then sought judicial review, but on 16 December 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court (“the SAC”) discontinued the proceedings, noting that his appeal had been submitted outside the statutory time-limits for judicial review and had thus become time-barred.
On 11 April 2003, citing a breach of the tax legislation and on the basis of Article 115 of the Code of Tax Procedure 1999 (“the 1999 Code”; see paragraph 31 below), the applicant asked the director of the Varna regional tax office to set aside the 2001 tax assessments and to carry out a new tax audit. On 18 April 2003 the director refused that request. The applicant sought judicial review. In a final decision of 10 January 2004 the Varna Regional Court quashed the director’s refusal and instructed the tax authorities to carry out a fresh tax audit. The court found that the authorities had performed the 2001 audit of the applicant as an individual, but had charged him taxes in relation to the association’s activity. In the court’s view, the taxes imposed on the applicant under the 2001 tax assessments had thus been in breach of the statutory provisions.
After carrying out a new tax audit for the same period as that covered by the 2001 tax assessment (see paragraph 6 above), the tax authorities issued a fresh tax assessment on 18 May 2004, charging the applicant a total of BGN 40,729.81 (EUR 20,825) in VAT and income tax, including interest. The applicant brought judicial review proceedings against the new tax assessment. On 28 August 2006 the Varna Administrative Court quashed the 2004 tax assessment. On 29 October 2007 the SAC upheld that judgment. The courts found that the taxes charged to the applicant had not been due since the activity subjected to taxation had been carried out by the agricultural association and not by the applicant as an individual.
On unspecified dates in 2002 and 2004 the authorities instituted enforcement proceedings against the applicant, apparently on the basis of the 2001 and 2004 tax assessments, which under domestic law were directly enforceable (see paragraph 30 below). It appears that between 2003 and 2008, by auctioning a number of his personal belongings, they collected a total of BGN 42,386.71 (EUR 21,672).
On 5 and 30 November 2007 the applicant submitted two requests for a tax refund in connection with the 2001 and 2004 tax assessments. In decisions of 27 November 2007 (акт за прихващане или възстановяване) and 13 December 2007 (акт за прихващане или възстановяване) respectively the tax authorities refused to refund the sums paid by him under the 2001 and 2004 tax assessments. In their opinion, even though the courts had set aside the 2004 tax assessment, the 2001 tax assessment had remained in force. Therefore, the taxes imposed on the applicant had been collected correctly.
The applicant sought judicial review of the two decisions in two separate sets of proceedings.
In the first set of proceedings, on 28 November 2008, the SAC found that the taxes charged under the 2001 assessment had been unduly paid. The court noted that the 2001 tax assessment had been replaced by the 2004 assessment, which had been set aside by the courts on 29 October 2007 (see paragraph 10 above). It further observed that the new tax audit of the applicant had been carried out in May 2004, after the Varna Regional Court had found in January 2004 that the taxes imposed by the 2001 tax assessment had been charged in breach of the statutory rules. The SAC went on to say that even though the applicant had not sought judicial review, the subsequent tax audit resulting in the 2004 tax assessment had in fact revoked the 2001 decision. The 2004 tax assessment which charged the applicant with the same type of taxes, on the same legal grounds and for the same period as the 2001 decision had been set aside because the courts had found that the taxes had not been due by the taxpayer (see paragraph 11 above). Accordingly, the sums paid by the applicant under both the 2001 and the 2004 tax assessments had to be returned to him. The SAC thus quashed the decision of 13 December 2007 refusing to return to the applicant the sums collected under the 2001 tax assessment. The court then referred the case file back to the tax authorities, instructing them to apply the procedure for offset or refund of undue taxes set out in the Tax and Social Security Code of Procedure 2006 (“the TSSCP”).
In the second set of proceedings, on 15 December 2008, the SAC also set aside the tax authorities’ decision of 27 November 2007 refusing reimbursement of the amounts collected under the 2004 tax assessment. It noted that the quashing of the 2004 tax assessment by the courts had affected also the 2001 tax assessment. The court likewise found that the sums paid out by the applicant under both the 2001 and 2004 tax assessments had not been due and that they therefore had to be returned to him, along with the statutory interest.
Referring to the SAC’s final judgments of 28 November 2008 and 15 December 2008 and Articles 128 et seq. of the TSSCP (see paragraphs 3335 below), the applicant asked the tax authorities to reimburse the amounts paid under the 2001 and 2004 tax assessments. On 13 January 2009 and 10 February 2009 respectively, he was informed that the administrative proceedings had been stayed pending the outcome of unspecified court proceedings.
Meanwhile, on 8 January 2009, the tax authorities brought proceedings before the SAC seeking a judicial declaration that the final judgment of 28 November 2008 (see paragraph 15 above) was null and void for breach of the substantive and procedural rules. They argued, in particular, that the courts’ conclusions that the 2001 tax assessment had been replaced by the 2004 tax assessment had been wrong and in breach of the statutory provisions. The tax authorities further maintained that the 2001 tax assessment remained valid since the applicant had failed to lodge a timely appeal against it (see paragraph 9 above). The fact that the 2004 tax assessment concerned the same period and charged the same taxes to the applicant had not been relevant. In their opinion, the judgment of 28 November 2008 was therefore null and void since the SAC had in fact set aside a valid tax assessment which had not been the subject matter of the dispute.
The tax authorities’ claim was later coupled with a request for reopening of the proceedings. On 9 January 2009 the SAC found that it had no competence to deal with the claim of nullity in respect of the court judgment, which should be examined by the Varna District Court under the procedure provided for in Article 270 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 38 below).
Several months later, on 13 July 2010, the SAC also dismissed a request by the tax authorities for reopening of the proceedings, noting that the legal prerequisites for that had not been met.
Meanwhile, the claim of nullity brought by the tax authorities (see paragraph 18 above) was examined by the Varna District Court. On several occasions that court discontinued the proceedings after the tax authorities had failed to comply with its instructions to pay the statutory court fees. The proceedings ultimately ended on 14 March 2012 when the Varna District Court dismissed the tax authorities’ claim. The court checked for the presence of any of the possible grounds for nullity of judicial decisions and noted in that regard that the SAC’s judgment of 28 November 2008 had been given by a three-judge panel within the SAC’s jurisdictional competence; it had been delivered in writing and had been signed by the judicial panel; its reasons as well as the judgment’s operative part indicated clearly the court’s will. The Varna District Court’s concluded that the arguments relied upon by the tax authorities were ill-founded since they could not entail the nullity of the SAC’s final judgment of 28 November 2008. The ruling of 14 March 2002 was not appealed against and entered into force on 10 April 2012.
On an unspecified date in 2009 the tax authorities also brought proceedings in the SAC seeking a judicial declaration that the final judgment of 15 December 2008 (see paragraph 16 above) was likewise null and void. On 23 March 2009 a five-member panel of the SAC discontinued the proceedings, finding the authorities’ request inadmissible. The SAC noted that in the proceedings which resulted in the final judgment of 15 December 2008 the court had examined the case on the merits. It went on to say that judicial proceedings in administrative cases were in principle examined at two levels of court and that, having regard to the fact that the tax authorities claimed nullity on grounds that were only relevant for appeals on points of law, the request was inadmissible.
On an unspecified date in July 2009 the applicant brought proceedings in the Varna Administrative Court requesting the court to impose a financial sanction on the director of the Varna tax office under Article 304 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 for failure to comply with a final court judgment (see paragraph 37 below). The outcome of those proceedings is not known.
In March 2009 the applicant brought a claim for compensation against the tax authorities under section 1(1) of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”). He argued that he had suffered damage as a result of the authorities’ failure to comply with the SAC’s final judgments of 2008 (see paragraphs 15-16 above) and to refund him the money collected under the 2001 and 2004 tax assessments, which had been set aside by the courts.
On 29 May 2009 the Silistra Administrative Court decided to split the proceedings into four different sets of proceedings. That court noted that the applicant had in fact sought damages in relation to four separate decisions, namely the 2001 and 2004 tax assessments and the ensuing decisions of the tax authorities of 27 November 2007 and 13 December 2007 refusing his requests for a refund (see paragraph 13 above).
In final judgments delivered respectively on 28 June 2010, 12 July 2010, 4 October 2010 and 22 November 2010, the SAC dismissed all four claims. It noted that since Articles 128 et seq. of the TSSCP provided for a special procedure for offset and refund of undue taxes (see paragraphs 3335 below), the 1988 Act was not applicable.
From the documents in the case file it transpires that on several occasions between August 2010 and May 2012 the applicant requested the tax authorities to pay him back the sums unduly collected from him under the 2001 and 2004 tax assessments.
On 30 May 2012 the tax authorities issued a decision for offset and refund, ordering that the applicant be refunded BGN 42,286.71 (EUR 21,621). The money was transferred in two instalments of 7 and 8 June 2012 respectively.
On 2 July 2012 they also paid the applicant BGN 40,460.92 (EUR 20,687) in statutory interest for late payment in respect of the period between 3 May 2001 and 8 June 2012.
The 1999 Code (see paragraph 10 above), as worded until 1 January 2006, provided that an obligation established by virtue of a tax assessment was to be paid by the taxpayer of his or her own accord within fourteen days. After the expiry of that term, the tax assessment became enforceable irrespective of any subsequent judicial review proceedings brought by the taxpayer, unless its execution has been stayed by the tax authorities or the court (Article 110 of the 1999 Code). The tax assessment could be appealed against within fourteen days to the higher-ranking revenue authority, namely the director of the relevant regional tax directorate. The director’s decision was in turn amenable to judicial review at two levels of jurisdiction (Article 117 and Article 121 of the 1999 Code).
A tax assessment which had become final could be revised at the request of the taxpayer or on the tax authorities’ own initiative (Article 115 (1)) on the grounds, inter alia, that the tax obligation had been imposed in breach of the statutory provisions (Article 115 (2), subparagraph 4, of the 1999 Code). The person concerned had to submit his or her request for review along with the supporting documents to the director of the relevant regional tax directorate, who had thirty days in which to refuse or order a new tax audit. The director’s decision or tacit refusal could be challenged before the competent regional court, whose decision was final (Article 116 of the 1999 Code).
On 1 January 2006 the 1999 Code was superseded by the TSSCP (see paragraph 15 above). Articles 129-132 of the TSSCP provide that the procedure for offset and refund of unduly paid or collected taxes may be instituted at the request of the taxpayer or on the initiative of the tax authorities. The latter may carry out an audit or an inspection.
On submission of a final court judgment or a final administrative decision recognising a taxpayer’s right to be reimbursed, the tax authorities must offset or refund within thirty days any sums that have been erroneously or unduly paid or collected in taxes, including interest (Article 129 (5), sub-paragraph 1, of the TSSCP), as well as any amounts the reimbursement of which has been unlawfully refused (Article 129 (5), sub-paragraph 2, of the TSSCP).
Any unduly paid or collected sums, with the exception of compulsory social-security contributions, must be refunded along with statutory interest for late payment (Article 129 (6) of the TSSCP).
The tax authorities’ decisions to offset or refund tax, or their refusals to do so, including tacit refusals, are amenable to review under the same procedure as tax assessments (Article 129 (7) of the TSSCP). The appeal must first be lodged with the higher-ranking revenue authority, whose decision is then subject to judicial review at two levels of jurisdiction.
The relevant provisions governing the enforcement of final administrative court judgments under the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 (“the 2006 Code”) have been summarised in detail in Stoyanov and Tabakov v. Bulgaria, no. 34130/04, §§ 53-59, 26 November 2013, and Dimitar Yanakiev v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 50346/07, §§ 30-35, 31 March 2016. In particular, Article 177 (1) of the 2006 Code stipulates that judgments by the SAC setting aside an administrative decision or declaring it null and void are binding on everyone.
Article 304 of the 2006 Code provides that in cases which do not concern the enforcement of administrative or judicial decisions under Chapter V of the 2006 Code, an official who fails to fulfil an obligation arising from an enforceable judicial decision will be fined between BGN 200 and BGN 2,000 (EUR 102 and 1,022). In the event of repeated failure to act, the official is fined BGN 500 for every week of nonenforcement, unless action on his or her part is objectively impossible. The fine is imposed by the president of the administrative court and is subject to appeal before a three-member panel of the same court, whose ruling is final (Article 306).
Under the settled case-law of the domestic courts a court judgment is considered null and void if (i) it has been delivered by an unlawfully constituted panel of judges; (ii) it goes beyond the jurisdiction of the court; (iii) the ruling is not given in writing or is not signed; (iv) the court’s will cannot be inferred owing to the absolute incomprehensibility of the judgment. Failure to give reasons does not entail the nullity of the judgment (see реш. № 668 от 15.11.2010 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 1790/2009 г., I г.о, реш. № 248 от 11.06.2012 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 572/2011 г., IV г.о).
The nullity of a court judgment may be sought by lodging a request for a judicial declaration that the judgment is null and void or by way of an objection. The request is not subject to any time-limit (Article 270 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure 2007).
The relevant provisions governing State liability for unlawful acts and omissions under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”) have been summarised in Dimitar Yanakiev, cited above, §§ 36-37. In particular, persons seeking redress for damage occasioned in circumstances falling within the scope of the 1988 Act have no claim under the general law of tort, as the 1988 Act is a lex specialis and excludes the application of the general regime (реш. № 1370/1992 г. от 16.12.1992 г. по гр.д. № 1181/1992 г. на ВС, ІV г.о.; реш. от 29.07.2002 г. по гр.д. № 169/2002 г. на СГС, ГК, ІVб отд.). However, where a law provides for a different avenue of redress, the 1988 Act does not apply (section 8(2) as worded before December 2012).
The relevant provisions governing the statutory rate of interest were set out in Zaharieva v. Bulgaria ((dec.), no. 6194/06, § 42, 20 November 2012).
