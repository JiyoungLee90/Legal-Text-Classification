In any event and despite being accommodated alone in a cell, subjecting a detainee to the inconvenience of having to relieve himself in a bucket cannot be deemed warranted, except in specific situations where allowing visits to the sanitary facilities would pose concrete and serious security risks (see, mutatis mutandis, Peers, \u00a7 75, and I.I. v.

The CPT indicated in its 1995 report that the thirty-minute exercise rule, provided for in the internal regulations of the Pazardzhik Regional Investigation Service and actually posted on cell doors, was not observed (see paragraph 44 above). The Government acknowledged the fact that no possibility for exercise had existed but submitted that this had been compensated with an extended time for visiting the sanitary facilities, which had been permitted three times a day for fifteen to twenty minutes (see paragraph 101 above). The Court, however, does not consider that the lack of outdoor or out-of-cell activities can in any way be compensated with an alleged extension of the time allowed for visiting the said sanitary facilities. Moreover, it notes the applicant's claims that he had access to the sanitary facilities only twice a day for three to five minutes during which time, in addition to washing, he had to throw out the bucket he used to satisfy the needs of nature in his cell and had to pour himself drinking water (see paragraph 26 above). Thus, the Court finds that as no possibility for outdoor or out-of-cell activities had in effect been provided, the applicant would have had to spend in his cell \u2013 which had been situated in the basement \u2013 practically all of his time, except for the two or three relatively short visits per day to the sanitary facilities or the occasional taking out for questioning or to court (see Peers, \u00a7 75, and I.I. v. Bulgaria, \u00a7 74, both cited above). The Court considers that the fact that the applicant had been accommodated alone in a cell and had been confined to it for practically twenty-four hours a day during more than four months without exposure to natural light and without any possibility for physical and other out-of-cell activities must have caused him considerable suffering. The Court is of the view that, in the absence of compelling security considerations, there had not been any justification for subjecting the applicant to such limitations. In their submissions, the Government did not put forward any such considerations for assessment by the Court (see paragraphs 99-102 above).",

The CPT has set 7 sq. m per prisoner as an approximate, desirable guideline for a singleoccupancy police cell (see \u201cThe CPT Standards\u201d \u2013 CPT/Inf/E\u00a0(2002)\u00a01 - Rev. 2006, \u00a7 43), but there is no such guideline in respect of prison cells. However, the CPT has in general applied a standard of a minimum of 4 sq. m per prisoner in multiple occupancy cells (see, for example, the CPT reports on the 2002 visit to Bulgaria, CPT/Inf (2004) 21, paragraphs 82 and 87, and on the 2004 visit to Poland, CPT/Inf (2006) 11, paragraphs 87 and 111), and a minimum of 6 sq. m. per prisoner in single occupancy cells (see, for example, the CPT report on the 2004 visit to Poland, CPT/Inf (2006) 11, paragraphs 87 and 111). Separately, the Court notes that the applicant initially had access to communal sanitary facilities several times a day (see paragraph 106 above) and that later he had access to a sanitary facility in his own cell (see paragraphs 29-30 and 121 above). There was direct sunlight and the windows in the cells could be opened to allow fresh air to circulate (see paragraph 107 above). Detainees were provided with clothes, a bed with a mattress, bed linen and a locker for personal belongings. The bed linen was changed every fortnight (see paragraph 108 above). The detainees had to bathe at least once a week, had access to a washing machine and after 1999 had easier access to hot water on account of the boilers installed in each corridor (see paragraph 109 above). Detainees were provided free-of-charge with materials to wash and disinfect their clothes and living areas. Efforts were also made to exterminate any insects and rodents (see paragraphs\u00a011011 above).
