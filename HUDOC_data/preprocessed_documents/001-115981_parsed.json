This support meant that it was clear from the outset that the degree of severity required by Article 3 had not been attained.

It was the applicant\u2019s aggressive behaviour and his sexual problems that had thwarted all attempts to find a place for him outside the prison.

This state of affairs has been confirmed by the Minister of Justice in person ... The Central Prison Supervisory Council has confirmed that there is a striking lack of psychiatric treatment both for detainees admitted for that purpose and for ordinary prisoners, and that the situation is steadily deteriorating as a result of prison overcrowding ...
