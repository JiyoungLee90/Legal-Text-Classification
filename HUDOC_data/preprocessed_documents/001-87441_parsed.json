In addition, since the judgment of the Court of Cassation is to be regarded as favourable to the heirs of Hur\u015fit because they were joint owners under the ordinary regime of ownership in common, the land must be registered in the name of the defendants if it is established that it is not forest land, within the meaning of section 1 of Law no. 6831, as amended by Law no. 1744. Otherwise, since cadastral registration of State forests can only be carried out by special commissions set up for that purpose, in accordance with section 7 of Law no.\u00a06831, and seeing that it is only possible to mark out the boundaries between State forests and private forests, it must be established whether the land at issue was returned or if it falls within the scope of restitution pursuant to Law no. 5658, after having been nationalised pursuant to Law no. 4785; in the latter case, it must be listed as private forest; otherwise, it must be classified as State forest and be excluded from cadastral registration [in the name of a private individual].\u201d",

The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see Bruncrona v.\u00a0Finland, no. 41673/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a065-69, 16\u00a0November\u00a02004, and Broniowski v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7\u00a0134, ECHR 2004-V).",

Despite the applicants\u2019 objections as to the nature of the land, the domestic courts eventually declared their document of title void pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, relying on surveys which included the land as part of the forest estate. Having regard to the reasons given by the domestic courts, the Court considers that the purpose of depriving the applicants of their property, namely to protect nature and forests, falls within the scope of public interest within the meaning of the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Lazaridi v. Greece, no.\u00a031282/04, \u00a7\u00a034, 13\u00a0July 2006, and Ansay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 49908/99, 2\u00a0March 2006). It notes in this regard that while none of the Articles of the Convention is specifically designed to provide general protection of the environment as such (see Kyrtatos v. Greece, no. 41666/98, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003VI), in today\u2019s society the protection of the environment is an increasingly important consideration (see Fredin v.\u00a0Sweden (no. 1), 18\u00a0February 1991, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 192). The Court notes that it has on various occasions dealt with questions relating to environmental protection and stressed the importance of this issue (see, for example, Ta\u015fk\u0131n and Others v. Turkey, no. 46117/99, ECHR 2004X; Moreno G\u00f3mez v. Spain, no. 4143/02, ECHR 2004X; Fadeyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a055723/00, ECHR 2005IV; and Giacomelli v. Italy, no. 59909/00, ECHR 2006XII). The protection of nature and forests, and, more generally, the environment, is a cause whose defence arouses the constant and sustained interest of the public, and consequently the public authorities. Financial imperatives and even certain fundamental rights, such as ownership, should not be afforded priority over environmental protection considerations, in particular when the State has legislated in this regard (see Hamer v. Belgium, no. 21861/03, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR 2007V).",

The Court has already held in this connection that the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value normally constitutes a disproportionate interference, and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 only in exceptional circumstances (see Nastou v.\u00a0Greece (no. 2), no.\u00a016163/02, \u00a7\u00a033, 15\u00a0July\u00a02005; Jahn and Others v.\u00a0Germany [GC], nos.\u00a046720/99, 72203/01 and\u00a072552/01, \u00a7 111, ECHR\u00a02005VI; The Holy Monasteries v.

In the instant case, the applicants received no compensation for the transfer of their property to the Treasury pursuant to Article\u00a0169 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution. The Court notes that the Government have not relied on any exceptional circumstance in order to justify the total lack of compensation.",
