The District Court found that on 26 November 2010 the applicant had been taken to the police station and questioned, along with many others, as a witness. It further established that at 11 p.m. on 29 November 2010 he had made a statement of surrender and confession, and that only after that had he been arrested and questioned as a suspect in the presence of a lawyer. The District Court therefore held that no criminal procedure rules had been broken. On 4\u00a0August 2011 the Chelyabinsk Regional Court (\u201cthe Regional Court\u201d) upheld that judgment on appeal, endorsing the reasoning of the District Court.",

The applicant was handcuffed and taken to a police station under police escort. Given the element of coercion (see, by contrast, I.I.\u00a0v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 44082/98, \u00a7 87, 9\u00a0June 2005, and Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 94, 23 February 2012), the Court considers that the applicant was deprived of his liberty (see, for example, Krupko and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a026587/07, \u00a7 36 with further references, 26\u00a0June 2014). As for the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant could later have left the police station, the Court observes the following facts. As noted above, the applicant was arrested immediately after he had allegedly threatened a taxi driver with a knife. Three hours after the applicant\u2019s arrest a criminal investigation was opened into a spate of robberies carried out against taxi drivers. At 9.30 a.m. the applicant talked to a police officer and allegedly confessed to those robberies. An investigator questioned the victims of the robberies while the applicant remained in the hall of the police station. The applicant was formally arrested and interviewed as a suspect at about 6\u00a0p.m. on the same date. Therefore, it may be concluded that the competent authorities were carrying out investigative actions within the framework of a criminal investigation into robberies against taxi drivers and may have considered the applicant to be an arrested suspect in that investigation. In such circumstances it would be unrealistic to assume that during that period he had been free to leave the police station of his free will. Given the above, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s stay in the police station during the period in question amounted to de facto deprivation of liberty (see, for example, Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, \u00a7\u00a049, 9\u00a0November 2010).",

Thus, the competent authorities were performing investigative actions within the framework of a criminal investigation into the armed robbery and may have considered the applicant to be an arrested suspect in that investigation. In such circumstances, it would be unrealistic to assume that the applicant could have refused to go to the police station or had been free to leave of his free will.

The Court notes that the crux of the applicants\u2019 complaints about their unrecorded detention concerned the alleged unavailability to them (or violation) of procedural rights which should have been available to them as to people arrested on suspicion of a criminal offence. Therefore, counting of their prison terms from the dates of the actual detention has no bearing on the availability of procedural safeguards during the applicants\u2019 unrecorded detention and, consequently, on their victim status. Finally, the Court reiterates that where lawfulness of detention is concerned, an action for damages against the State is not a remedy to exhaust because the right to have the lawfulness of detention examined by a court is different from the right to obtain compensation for any deprivation of liberty incompatible with Article 5 of the Convention (see, for instance, Ivan Kuzmin v.

In particular, Mr\u00a0Fortalnov\u2019s arrest on 18\u00a0July 2005 had been recorded in a police report of 19\u00a0July 2005.

In the case of Mr\u00a0Apayev, the Government provided a copy of a log of detainees containing an entry under no. 337, where it was noted that the applicant had been arrested at 8\u00a0p.m. on 28\u00a0December 2012 on suspicion of robbery.

These records must be publicly available, the status of the person should be formalised straight after he or she has been taken in by the authorities, and all the person\u2019s rights should be immediately and clearly explained to him or her (see Smolik, \u00a7\u00a047, and Grinenko, \u00a7 77, both cited above). In the three cases at issue, the Government did not claim, and there is nothing to suggest, that the documents relied on by them were not internal documents and were accessible to the public or the applicants themselves. Moreover, those documents neither formalised the applicants\u2019 status nor ensured that they had been informed about their rights or had had the rights available to suspects, such as the right to legal assistance or the right of access to a judge. Thus, none of the documents relied on by the Government can be considered as a proper record of the applicants\u2019 arrest as suspects.",

The Court reiterates its position that such conduct on the part of investigative authorities is incompatible with the principle of legal certainty and protection from arbitrary detention under Article 5 of the Convention (see, for instance, Grigoryev v.

In the present cases, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects three of the applicants\u2019 claims for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings (applications nos.\u00a049087/08, 5375/12 and 30658/13) as unrelated to the violations found by the Court. It rejects the claims for legal costs in two cases (applications nos.\u00a02838/14 and 7442/15) because no supporting documents had been produced. The Court considers it reasonable to award the sums claimed by one applicant (application no.\u00a07077/06) covering costs under all heads.",
