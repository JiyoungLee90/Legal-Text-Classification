The case is different in that, while not having control over the local authorities in Bender which disconnected prison no.\u00a08 from the utilities, the Moldovan authorities had full control over that prison itself and the detainees there throughout the relevant period. They could have taken measures in the prison itself to cope with the effects of the disconnection from the utilities or they could have transferred the prisoners to other prisons at any time. By choosing to continue to detain the applicants in prison no. 8 without immediate action taken to ensure basic conditions of detention, the Moldovan authorities knowingly exposed them to the conditions which prevailed there after the disconnection from all utilities. In addition to the above-mentioned positive obligations, it was therefore also the direct responsibility of the Moldovan authorities to prevent or redress the alleged violation of the applicants\u2019 rights in that prison.",

It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim\u2019s behaviour (Mur\u0161i\u0107 v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2016).

However, even assuming that such a waiver might be possible, the circumstances of the present case do not permit the conclusion that there has been any valid waiver. Indeed, the applicants were deprived of their liberty, and thus within the power of the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, M.S. v. Belgium, no. 50012/08, \u00a7 124, 31 January 2012). As the Court has held with respect to the waiver of certain procedural rights, a waiver must be of the applicant\u2019s own free will and must be established in an unequivocal manner and attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see, among others, Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a010249/03, \u00a7 135, 17 September 2009). However, the Government did not clarify the nature of the guarantees which would assure a free decision by the applicants.",
