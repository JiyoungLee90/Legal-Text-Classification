In such cases the Court has consistently found violations of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention (see Sakhnovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 99-109; Shumikhin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a022-23; Volkov and Adamskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 56-61; Eduard Rozhkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21-26; and Nefedov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-48).

That obligation presupposes a proactive approach on the part of the national courts and cannot be discarded in view of a defendant\u2019s failure to seek an appointment of new counsel or adjournment of the proceedings (see Shekhov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 12440/04, \u00a7 42, 19 June 2014). That obligation also did not evaporate in case of an \u201coral waiver\u201d of the right to a lawyer, as in Mr Senchishin\u2019s case (application no. 5510/13), particularly so that the Russian law, as in force at the material time, required courts to appoint legal aid counsel to an unrepresented defendant in a criminal case, unless a defendant made an explicit written waiver refusing legal assistance (see Volkov and Adamskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a023 and \u00a7 59). The Court thus finds that all applicants, save for Mr Krylov whose situation will be discussed shortly, were left without legal representation on appeal and that the national courts did not do anything to remedy that situation. It finally considers that the situation of Mr\u00a0Pavlenko (application no. 73986/11) was further exacerbated by his own absence from the appeal hearing, and thus his having been left without any representation, either in person or through legal assistance, on appeal.",

However, the lawyer had only been appointed to represent the applicant at the appeal stage and had not been involved in the case before. The applicant was not present at the appeal hearing and from the material at hand the Court is unable to conclude that he had had been afforded an opportunity to consult his newly assigned representative, to build up the defence strategy which could have, to certain extent, remedied his own absence from the appeal hearing. In these circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that Mr Krylov was also denied effective legal representation on appeal in his criminal case.",
