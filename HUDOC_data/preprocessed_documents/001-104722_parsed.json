Since in the instant case the totality of the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention was calculated towards a fine, it precluded the possibility of subsequently bringing an effective claim for compensation for the same period of pretrial detention (see paragraph 16 above) and, it follows, for the breach of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a04.",

However, it notes that according to domestic practice such crediting is clearly meant to be of a\u00a0nonfinancial character, the more so if the period of pretrial detention is calculated towards a penalty of deprivation or limitation of liberty. Moreover, a court credits a period of deprivation of liberty without making any assessment of the legality of the pretrial detention. Accordingly, the Court considers that the fact that the total period of the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention was automatically credited towards another penalty imposed in respect of an unrelated offence cannot be considered compliant with the enforceable right to compensation contained in Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a05 of the Convention.",
