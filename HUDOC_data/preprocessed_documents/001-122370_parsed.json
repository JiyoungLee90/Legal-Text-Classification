Soldier A was the team leader of the unit with command of the soldiers on the ground. Soldier H was in radio contact with the soldiers on the ground and, on receiving a report of the shooting, he dispatched Soldiers G and I to the scene. The scene was handed over at approximately 12.30 to the RUC and Soldiers A-I returned to base. Later that day (10\u00a0October 1990), members of the RUC questioned the soldiers, who were accompanied by Soldier L, from Army Legal Services. Soldier A was the first to fire a shot and he fired twenty rounds. Soldier B fired seventeen rounds, Soldier C fired nineteen rounds and Soldier D fired sixteen rounds, the last two of which were directed at Mr Grew while he was on the ground as the soldier believed Mr Grew had attempted to grab his gun. Soldiers E and F had been close by and did not discharge their weapons. Soldiers A-F believed that they had been under fire, although no shots had been fired at them. Soldier J (involved in pre-deployment training for such specialist military units) and Soldier K (the officer commanding of the unit) were involved in the planning and control of the operation.",

Those circumstances included instances where a significant proportion of the procedural steps had taken place after the Convention had come into force. Accordingly, the Supreme Court found that, as a matter of international obligation, the present inquest had to comply with Article 2 as far as this was possible under domestic law. Parliament was presumed to have intended that there would be a domestic-law requirement to mirror the international requirement and the HRA which came into effect on 2 October 2000 was to be interpreted by reference to this presumed intention.

One must sympathise with any coroner called on to deal with a contentious inquest of this nature which has become by its nature and background extremely adversarial. The problems are compounded by the fact that the [PSNI] which would normally be expected to assist a coroner in non contentious cases is itself a party which stands accused of wrong doing. It is not apparent that entirely satisfactory arrangements exist to enable the PSNI to dispassionately perform its functions of assisting the coroner when it has its own interests to further and protect. If nothing else, it is clear from this matter that Northern Ireland coronial law and practice requires a focused and clear review to ensure the avoidance of the procedural difficulties that have arisen in this inquest. What is also clear is that the proliferation of satellite litigation is extremely unsatisfactory and diverts attention from the main issues to be decided and contributes to delay.\u201d",

The investigation was inadequate in that it focused disproportionately on whether civilians in the vicinity were responsible for the weapons and this was supported by the evidence of Soldier L at the inquest. While the briefing notes of soldiers before and after the shooting as well as radio logs of communications between the shooting soldiers and headquarters had existed and were under RUC control, the RUC officers investigating the incident were not provided with those notes and logs and, as confirmed by witnesses at the inquest, a significant body of documents (including these notes and logs) had since disappeared.

There was an unacceptable and endemic pattern of State delay punctuated by proceedings by the next-of-kin attempting to move the process forward. The CAJ submitted a list from the coroner\u2019s service dated July 2011 (updating the list submitted to the Supreme Court in April 2011) which listed thirty-eight cases in which inquests were either outstanding or had just finished: five of the deaths had taken place in 1971 and 1972 and only one inquest had taken place (in June 2011); eight deaths had occurred in the 1980s and while provisional dates had been set, no inquests had been held; and eighteen concerned deaths in the 1990s in respect of which only one inquest had been held. Most of the cases concerned the use of lethal force by the security forces and some concerned killings attributed to paramilitary forces. Delay since the abovementioned six judgments of this Court was, according to the CAJ, an aggravating factor and it referred to numerous public declarations of various bodies concerning reform of the Convention system which emphasised the need to execute judgments effectively and speedily. Indeed, the Government itself recognised that inquest delay had violated Article 2 (Command Paper 7524, \u201cResponding to Human Rights Judgments: Government Response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights\u2019 Thirty-First Report of Session 2007-08\u201d (January 2009).",

The need for a lower evidential test was enhanced by the fact that the law of self-defence in English law was drawn very widely, was partially subjective in its formulation and was inconsistent with the requirements of Article 2 \u00a7 2. The standard evidential test, combined with the law of selfdefence, meant that prosecutions of State officials for causing death were exceedingly rare. Moreover, the scope for review by the domestic courts of the application of the evidential test was also limited and failed to meet the strict procedural requirements of Article 2.",

Consistently, the applicant launched three judicial review actions during the inquest hearing. However, at that point the delay was such (over twenty-one years) that the High Court felt obliged to raise the threshold for leave to apply for judicial review to \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances warranting the adjournment of the inquest, the High Court on one occasion noting that there was, in any event, a post-inquest remedy. Two judicial review applications were rejected on this basis. Not unsurprisingly therefore the first applicant began another judicial review action in June 2012 after the inquest, repeating two arguments rejected by the High Court as not \u201cexceptional\u201d and raising several new procedural issues (see paragraphs 64-66 above).

In particular, the principles flowing from the judgments of this Court of 4 May 2001 were applied in domestic law, not through legislation, but through a series of complex and overlapping domestic judicial review applications. The entry into force of the HRA in 2000 brought with it further questions of relevance to coronial law and, notably, its application to investigations into pre-HRA deaths, a key issue not finally resolved until the judgment by the Supreme Court in the applicants\u2019 case of May 2011 which, indeed, overturned an earlier judgment of the House of Lords in McKerr (see paragraph 40 above). The present applicants were centrally involved in these important legal developments. Their inquest was postponed, effectively from 2002 to 2012, pending their main two judicial review actions, the legal issues clarified in those two actions were, as noted above, crucial for coronial law and practice and the findings were in their favour.",

The fact that it was necessary to postpone the applicants\u2019 inquest so frequently and for such long periods pending clarifying judicial review actions demonstrates to the Court that the inquest process itself was not structurally capable at the relevant time of providing the applicants with access to an effective investigation which would commence promptly and be conducted with due expedition (see Hugh Jordan, \u00a7 138, and McKerr, \u00a7 155, both cited above).",

To this extent, the foregoing finding of excessive investigative delay of itself entails the conclusion that the investigation was ineffective for the purposes of Article 2. There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention under its procedural aspect by reason of excessive investigative delay.

Information furnished by the coroner\u2019s service of Northern Ireland in April 2011 to the Supreme Court and in July 2011 to the CAJ (see paragraphs 41 and 116 above) is noted. The Court considers that the carrying out of investigations, including the holding of inquests into killings by the security forces in Northern Ireland, has been marked by major delays. It further considers that such delays remain a serious and pervasive problem in Northern Ireland. While the contents of the Committee of Ministers Resolution of 2008 are noted, the Committee more recently expressed its concern about investigative delay (Resolution of March 2009) as regards four of the above-cited six judgments concerning Northern Ireland (see paragraphs 86-89 above). These four judgments reflected a pattern of delay very similar to that which took place in the present case (see, in particular, McKerr and Hugh Jordan). Almost twelve years after those four judgments were delivered, the Committee of Ministers continues to supervise individual measures of execution concerning investigative delay.",

However, the Court considers that, whatever the specific modalities chosen, this must involve the State taking, as a matter of some priority, all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure, in the present case and in similar cases concerning killings by the security forces in Northern Ireland where inquests are pending, that the procedural requirements of Article 2 are complied with expeditiously.",

This premise seems to have little support in the Court\u2019s position in hundreds of other cases, where the Court held that \u201cany deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness\u201d (see, among many other authorities, Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a096-97, 4 May 2001; Anguelova v.

Turkey, 18 December 1996, Reports 1996IV, and Mente\u015f and Others v. Turkey, 28\u00a0November 1997, Reports 1997-VIII; the \u201cTurkish\u201d case-law in this regard was then developed by the Court, through reading a duty to investigate directly into Article 2, in Kaya v. Turkey, 19 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a086-87, Reports 1998-I, relying on the earlier British \u201cDeath on the Rock\u201d case of McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27\u00a0September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016163 Series A no. 324). By virtue of the operation of the burden of proof, as the Court explained in the Akdivar and Others judgment, a complaint should not be rejected by reason of the mere existence of a theoretically adequate civil remedy if the applicant could demonstrate that the remedy was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement of exhaustion. One such reason may be constituted by the failure of the domestic authorities to undertake investigations in the face of serious allegations of misconduct or infliction of harm by State agents (\u00a7\u00a068). The Court recognised that in the particular circumstances obtaining in south-east Turkey at that time,",

But it cannot and should not be excluded that, in some cases, it is clear on the evidence that the effectiveness of the available domestic remedy to look at the substantive allegations of unjustified killing by State agents has not been so adversely affected as to render the remedy ineffective. In such circumstances, it is difficult to see any reason (i) why the applicant should be dispensed from his or her normal obligation under Article 35 \u00a7 1 to exhaust an available and effective remedy in relation to that particular, namely substantive, complaint and (ii) why the national system should not be allowed by this Court to do its subsidiary task.",

On the other hand, there is the \u201csubsidiarity\u201d obligation incumbent on applicants under Article 35 \u00a7 1 to exhaust available domestic remedies, even if those remedies relate to one branch only of their claim under Article 2, namely the substantive branch. There is overlap and linkage between these two aspects of the Convention\u2019s operation, but the two are not 100% coextensive. As was intimated in Akdivar and Others, a finding of inadequate investigation and prosecution does not automatically, in a blanket fashion, render nugatory the applicant\u2019s obligation to exhaust an available and effective domestic civil remedy to recover compensation for the substantive breach of Article 2 or Article 3, as the case may be. The inadequacy of the investigation and prosecution undertaken, if any, may well be a factor, a powerful factor, pointing to ineffectiveness of the civil remedy for compensation in the circumstances, but it is not decisive in itself or in all circumstances.",

The standard of proof required to establish liability is the civil one of proof on the balance of probabilities, not the stricter criminal or Convention standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. As I understand it, the underlying logic in previous Northern Ireland cases, such as Hugh Jordan v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, 4 May 2001, is that the system of civil remedies in Northern Ireland (and indeed in the United Kingdom in general) is sufficiently well armed and strong to constitute, in principle, an effective means of establishing facts and liability and of obtaining adequate compensation, as appropriate, in relation to killings or serious ill-treatment allegedly committed by State agents. As a consequence \u2013 and this is in accord with the reasoning developed in Akdivar and Others \u2013 as regards a substantive complaint of unlawful killing under Article 2, the civil claim is in principle to be exhausted. It would have to be demonstrated, in a particular case before this Court, that the deficiencies in the process of investigation and of prosecution of perpetrators were so serious that the civil remedy was compromised to the point where it would be unreasonable to expect the applicant to exhaust it. Arguably such a situation could arise where, for example, as a result of delay key evidence had been lost or destroyed, key witnesses had died or become untraceable, and so on.",

The case file shows that the applicants are already well informed as regards the identity both of the authorities responsible for the planning of the operation and of the individual soldiers and police officers involved in the operation and then in the investigations. There is a wealth of information disclosed and available in relation to the circumstances impugned by the applicants. It cannot be said at this point that the bringing of the civil action by the applicants has been rendered ineffective in practice by reason of the alleged lack of adequate investigation and proper prosecution. As the Chamber\u2019s judgment points out, \u201c[w]hile the lapse of time would make it difficult for the civil court to piece together the evidence, any such attempt should in principle take place in a domestic court, not in an international forum\u201d. The domestic civil action brought by the applicants is capable of enabling them to obtain the same kind of finding that they are seeking in the proceedings before this Court, namely a finding of unjustified killing by the public authorities whom they hold responsible, as well as the same kind of redress, namely an award of financial compensation. As a matter of general principle, subject, where applicable, to the specificities of the procedural protection afforded by virtue of Article 2 of the Convention, this is precisely the kind of situation that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies provided for under Article 35 \u00a7 1 is meant to cover.",
