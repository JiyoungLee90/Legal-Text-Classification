Although in Latvia \u201cvictims\u201d are not granted full access to the case file while a criminal investigation is ongoing, Article 2 does not impose a duty on the investigating authorities to satisfy every request for a particular investigative measure made by a relative in the course of the investigation (Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 348, ECHR 2007II). Indeed, the Court has routinely held that the disclosure or publication of police reports and investigative materials may involve sensitive issues with possible prejudicial effects for private individuals or other investigations. It cannot therefore be regarded as an automatic requirement under Article 2 that a deceased victim\u2019s surviving next-of-kin be granted full access to the investigation as it goes along. The requisite access of the public or the victim\u2019s relatives may be provided for in other stages of the available procedures (see, among other authorities, Ramsahai, cited above, \u00a7 347 and McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a028883/95, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2001III). In any event, were the applicant to consider that Article 98 of the Criminal Procedure Law is contrary to his fundamental rights a complaint in that regard to the Constitutional Court would have provided a relevant remedy in the Latvian legal system (see Gri\u0161ankova and Gri\u0161ankovs, cited above; Liep\u0101jnieks v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a037586/06, \u00a7\u00a7 73-76, 2 November 2010; Savi\u010ds v. Latvia, no. 17892/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0113-117, 27 November 2012; Mihailovs v.

The Court does not accept this argument. It is clear from the information submitted to the Court that the investigation commenced when the Ventspils State Police arrived at the scene on the morning of 21 May 2004. Although this investigation was not initially a criminal investigation, the Court accepts that prior to 21 June 2004 there was no clear evidence that a crime had taken place.

As such, their failure to treat any individual as a suspect prior to that date cannot be in breach of the procedural aspect of Article 2 of the Convention. Nevertheless, given that A.J. was first interrogated as a suspect on 23 July 2004, the Court is surprised that forensic evidence was not seized until 9 August 2004, some two and a half weeks later, particularly in view of the importance of seizing such evidence promptly, and the time which had already elapsed since S.J. died. The Court is also concerned about the delay in conducting the autopsy. According to a forensic report dated 11\u00a0August 2004 a more precise time of death could not be established \u201cconsidering that the forensic medical examination of S.J.\u2019s body had been performed four days after it was found and that livor mortis appears within the first hour of death\u201d. Autopsies should normally be performed as soon as possible following death as the quality of the body\u2019s tissues (and thus the quality of the autopsy results) deteriorates over time. In Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v. Romania ([GC], no.\u00a047848/08, \u00a7 146, 17 July 2014) the Court found a procedural breach of Article 2 where an autopsy had not been carried out immediately in contravention of domestic law. In the present case the delay in conducting the autopsy may not have contravened domestic law, but it does appear to have prevented the exact time of death from being established. The Government have not sought to explain either the delay in carrying out the autopsy or the delay in seizing material for forensic examination and, as such, the Court finds that it detracted from the authorities\u2019 capacity to establish the facts relevant to the death, and thereby to achieve one of the purposes required by Article 2 of the Convention.",

Georgia, no. 25091/07, \u00a7\u00a0258, 26 April 2011). In cases where no responsibility for the suspicious death attaches \u2013 or appears to attach \u2013 to agents of the State, the investigation into that death may usually be conducted by the local police force without any issue arising under Article 2. However, the Court has had occasion to find a violation of the procedural aspect of Article 2 where an agent of the State was potentially responsible for a death and the subsequent investigation was carried out by direct colleagues of the person allegedly involved (Akta\u015f and Others v. Turkey, no. 19264/92, \u00a7 301, 30 January 2001). In such cases, supervision by another authority, however independent, has not been found to be a sufficient safeguard for the independence of the investigation (Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a024746/94, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2001III (extracts) and McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7 128, ECHR 2001III). For example, in Ramsahai v. the Netherlands, cited above, the Court held that the deployment of the National Police Internal Investigations Department, a task-force of special duty police officers at the disposal of the Minister of Justice, some fifteen and a half hours after a fatal shooting was unacceptable as the local police force had carried out essential parts of the investigation in their absence. The task-force\u2019s subsequent involvement did not suffice to remove the taint of the local force\u2019s lack of independence.",

In any case, even if the OCCD were sufficiently independent, it is not clear why the Ventspils State Police continued to be involved in the investigation even after A.J. had been declared a suspect. In Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, cited above, the Court held that mere supervision by an independent body was not a sufficient safeguard where the investigation was for all practical purposes conducted by police officers connected with those under investigation. Likewise, in the present case the Court does not consider that the involvement of the OCCD in the criminal investigation acted as a sufficient safeguard when the Ventspils State Police continued to be involved in the investigation (see paragraph 23 above).",
