In the indictment the public prosecutor stated that following the arrest and conviction of their leader Abdullah \u00d6calan, the PKK had set out to pursue new policies. Accordingly, at the Sixth National Conference held between 5\u00a0and 22 August 2001, it had adopted the \u201cDemocratisation and Peace Project\u201d, a new strategy which had involved undertaking non-violent activities of \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d and aimed at leaving the State and its authorities in a difficult position in the international arena. The public prosecutor submitted that such organised acts of civil disobedience agreed on by the PKK had included petitioning the State authorities for education in Kurdish, dressing up in traditional Kurdish female costume, and applying to courts or population registration offices with requests for their Kurdish identities to appear on their national identity cards. When viewed against this background, the petitions in question \n\u2013 which had been submitted to certain authorities on predetermined dates and times \u2013 could not be considered to be individual acts. They had actually been part of an organised movement which had aimed to implement the decisions adopted by the PKK and thereby undermine the authority of the State.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the specific circumstances the applicants found themselves in while in incommunicado detention in police custody made it very difficult for them to have effective recourse to the remedy under Article\u00a0128 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6calan [GC], cited above, \u00a7 70).",

In the absence of any arguments by the Government to the contrary, the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings in those cases. It follows that, even in the case of the applicants who had managed to file objections concerning their detention despite the difficulties noted above, the proceedings under Article\u00a0128 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure did not provide an effective remedy satisfying the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 4 of the Convention. The Court finds it particularly striking that when examining the objections raised by the relevant applicants against their detention, the judge at the Istanbul State Security Court did not even verify whether or not they were in police custody, which reinforces the conclusion about the ineffectiveness of this remedy on the facts of the instant case (see the judge\u2019s decision in paragraph 15 above).",

Moreover, it reiterates that a period of up to four days before first appearance before a judge may be compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see paragraph 57 above). Nevertheless, the wording of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 4 indicates that it becomes operative immediately after arrest or detention and is applicable to \u201c[e]veryone who is deprived of his liberty\u201d (see Petkov and Profirov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos. 50027/08 and 50781/09, \u00a7 67, 24\u00a0June 2014). The right to \u201ctake proceedings\u201d thus arises at that stage, with the consequence that the denial of the right to institute such proceedings \u2013 subject to reasonable practical considerations \u2013 will raise an issue under Article 5 \u00a7 4, all the more so when such a denial is in breach of domestic law. Thus, in the case of Petkov and Profirov, the Court held that Article 5 \u00a7 4 required the provision of a judicial remedy to the applicants, who were detained in police custody for less than twenty-four hours, to enable them to challenge their detention and obtain release (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a064-71).",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the applicants in the instant case, parents of elementary school pupils, used their constitutional right to file a petition to make a request regarding the education of their children. For the Court, neither the views expressed in those petitions nor the form in which they were conveyed raise doubts regarding the peaceful nature of their request. Furthermore, the fact that the applicants\u2019 peaceful request regarding the education of their children may have coincided with the aims or instructions of an illegal armed organisation did not remove that request from the scope of protection of Article 10 (see, for a similar discussion in the context of Article 220 of the new Turkish Criminal Code, G\u00fclc\u00fc, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0112, and the comments of the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner of Human Rights referred to in paragraphs 68 and 69 of that judgment). The Court stresses in this regard that in a democratic society based on the rule of law, political ideas which challenge the existing order and whose realisation is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression (see, mutatis mutandis, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2001IX), which, on the instant facts, the prosecution authorities ignored.",

They complained under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 that the Istanbul State Security Court had lacked independence and impartiality, that the authorities had failed to inform them promptly of the charges against them, that they had been denied access to a lawyer during their detention in police custody, including at the time of their questioning by the police and the public prosecutor, that their lawyer\u2019s requests to access the criminal case file during the investigation stage had been refused, and that they had not had adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence.

The precise complaint made by the applicants is thus left unanswered. Instead, the judgment finds a violation on the ground that the interference was not necessary in a democratic society (see paragraph 108 of the judgment). While the applicants complained about a purely legal issue (charges without a legal basis), the judgment examines whether, in the light of the concrete circumstances of the case, the action undertaken by the authorities could be considered proportionate to the aim pursued.

Indeed, the actions which the authorities took against the applicant in question cannot be regarded as solely comprising purely hypothetical risks of limitation of freedom of expression (see Dilipak, cited above, \u00a7 50). On the contrary, such actions are perfectly capable of creating fears leading the applicant and other members of the Kurdish minority \u2013 even those of ordinary firmness and certainly those who are risk averse \u2013 to engage in self-censorship.

The fact that in the applicant\u2019s case the investigation was dropped due to a lack of evidence, and that he himself claimed that he never wrote the petition, did not diminish its intrusive character and its abusiveness as an informal system of prior restraint. The latter in itself raises an issue under the Convention. The two issues are not mutually exclusive.
