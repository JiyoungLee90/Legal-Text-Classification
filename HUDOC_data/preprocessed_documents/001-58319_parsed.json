The basis of the High Court\u2019s judgments quashing the commitment orders in those cases was that the magistrates had a discretion vested in them to issue a warrant, but that its exercise was flawed. The Government recalled that the Court had found no violation of Article 5 of the Convention in its Benham judgment, where one of the grounds on which the warrant of commitment to prison had been set aside had been precisely that the magistrates had failed to consider all available alternatives to immediate imprisonment.",

In these circumstances it would have been appropriate for the professional stipendiary magistrate, who took the decision of 15 January 1993, to make an inquiry which could have identified the mental abilities of Mr Perks. In contradistinction to the judgement of the High Court of Justice, we, in view of the issues to be decided by the magistrate, find it difficult to give decisive weight to the lack of written evidence concerning Mr Perks\u2019 condition available to the court. An inquiry into the elements of \u201cwilful\u201d or \u201cculpable\u201d could have revealed Mr Perks\u2019 mental difficulties to the magistrate. Here we take into consideration the explanations of Joan Perks, Mr Perks\u2019 sister, Dr. Londhe and the community health consultant, Karen Lowe, describing Mr. Perks\u2019 actual situation and appearance.
