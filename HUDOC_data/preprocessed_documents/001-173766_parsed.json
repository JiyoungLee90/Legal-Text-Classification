On 19 January 2004, the first applicant had successfully entered a garage at the same time as the victim, had fired shots at him until he had run out of ammunition and then fled.

The Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, an investigator of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and a lawyer also participated in the beatings. Among his injuries were a fractured temporal bone and upper jaw. He subsequently developed epilepsy, and he suffers from disturbed sleep, flashbacks, blackouts, loss of vision, memory difficulties, headaches and tremors. On 16 May 2004, he was remanded in pre-trial detention. Upon his transfer, he did not indicate to the doctor at the prison the nature of his injuries because he was afraid and exhausted. At the request of his lawyer, a criminal case into the torture claim was initiated by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and in November 2004, the Office reported that there was no evidence of torture. On appeal, the Tbilisi District Court upheld the appeal, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court in February 2005, and the case was returned to the Public Prosecutor to reinvestigate the torture claim. ...\u201d",

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. Such an investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-IV). If this were not the case, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (ibidem). Any investigation into serious allegations of ill-treatment must be both prompt and thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what has happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or to use as the basis for their decisions. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7 183, ECHR\u00a02012).",

Consequently, it is plausible that prior to that date he was discouraged from making any complaints as he had been left alone in the hands of police officers whom he directly accused of torture and of prison staff who, in his opinion, might have had close official links with the presumed perpetrators, all the time without any meaningful assistance from the outside world (compare, for instance, with Dvalishvili v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 19634/07, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 47, 18\u00a0December 2012; Nechiporuk and\u00a0Yonkalo v.

On the other hand, the Court observes that as soon as he had a lawyer of his own choice, on 4 June 2004, the first applicant immediately informed the relevant authorities of the illtreatment he had suffered on 13 May 2004. He then repeated those complaints to the prosecution authority on 15 and 18\u00a0June, 7 September, and\u00a08 and 21\u00a0October 2004 (see paragraphs 23, 2526, 42, 46 and 48 above). In all those complaints the first applicant remained particularly consistent in describing the exact factual circumstances surrounding the incident. On each occasion he named the police officers involved in the illtreatment, including K.Ch., D.E., and D.K., and described the exact form of physical illtreatment \u2013 electric shocks and beatings on the neck with a square iron padlock. In addition, he described consistently how the police officers had threatened his wife with death and had forced him into signing the confession at gunpoint.",

Despite that early request, the authorities did not arrange the examination until three months had gone by (see paragraph 35 above). The Government did not provide an explanation for why it took the relevant State expert so long to conduct the examination and why it eventually turned out to be superficial. In particular, the Court observes that the State expert did not even take the trouble to visit the first applicant and examine him in person but limited his scrutiny to viewing two X-rays, one of the applicant\u2019s thorax and the other of one side of his head (see paragraph 35 above). In those circumstances, the Court concludes that the failure of the relevant State medical personnel to ensure that the applicant\u2019s injuries were examined and documented in a timely and adequate manner deprived the applicant of an important safeguard against a breach of Article 3 of the Convention (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Zayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a7 8586, 16\u00a0April 2015; Davitidze v.

Those medical findings were then mostly confirmed by the reports of 19 October and 15\u00a0November 2004 of two additional medical examinations of the first applicant conducted by State experts and were even endorsed by the domestic courts as proof of traces of physical abuse calling for the need to conduct an adequate investigation (see paragraph 51 above).\u00a0The Court also notes that the various relevant witnesses who had seen the first applicant either on the day of or shortly after the alleged ill-treatment, stated before the trial court that they had noticed signs of physical injury on him\u00a0(see paragraph\u00a063 above). Furthermore, the Government themselves never gave any alternative explanation to the Court for the possible origin of the signs of ill-treatment on the applicant, which makes the applicant\u2019s consistent allegations look all the more convincing. The Court also takes cognisance of the fact that the UN Special Rapporteur met a number of detained people, including the first applicant, and acknowledged, in general, that the practice of ill-treatment of suspects and accused people by law enforcement officials as a means to obtain confessions still existed in the country at the material time (see paragraphs\u00a08789 above, and compare, mutatis mutandis, with Nechiporuk and Yonkalo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0158; Tarasov v.

That particular shortcoming undoubtedly has damaging implications for both the substantive and procedural limbs of the respondent State\u2019s international obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. Secondly, the Court finds it difficult to understand why the first applicant, despite having complained of a serious criminal offence against him, was never declared a victim in the course of the ensuing criminal investigation. He thus could not benefit from the exercise of a number of major procedural rights pertaining to that status (see Article 69 of the CCP cited at paragraph 86 above), without which he was unable to participate in the investigation (see Denis Vasilyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a0126, 17\u00a0December 2009). The domestic courts acknowledged themselves in December 2004 and February 2005 that the criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment had been defective and that there was a need for another investigation. However, despite the clear instructions of the courts to carry out an adequate investigation into the allegations of illtreatment, it does not appear from the case file that any definite results have ever been reached by the investigative authorities, with the relevant criminal proceedings currently still ongoing (see paragraph 57 above).",

The domestic authorities clearly failed to conduct a thorough and prompt investigation of his complaints (see the preceding paragraph), and the Government did not even attempt to provide an alternative, plausible explanation for the origins of those traces of ill-treatment. In such circumstances, the Court, bearing in mind the authorities\u2019 obligation to account for injuries caused to persons within their control in custody (see Shlychkov v. Russia, no. 40852/05, \u00a7 68, 9 February 2016, and Ryabtsev v. Russia, no. 13642/06, \u00a7 71, 14 November 2013), finds it to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the first applicant was subjected to police brutality after his arrest on 13 May 2004 at Tbilisi police headquarters. Having regard to the specific type of illtreatment perpetrated by trained police officers with the sole aim of obtaining a confession from the first applicant \u2013 the administration of electric shocks and beating with an iron padlock \u2013 the Court considers it to be a serious abuse of the applicant\u2019s physical integrity and dignity, which thus falls to be characterised as torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention (see Pomilyayko v.

However, a risk of absconding cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of an eventual sentence and must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors (see Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, \u00a7\u00a043, Series A no. 207, and Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 181), which was not done in the decision of 10 November 2004. As to the risk of hampering the establishment of the truth, and although that risk may be a relevant element in assessing the reasonableness of a deprivation of liberty, the Court reiterates that it cannot be established on the basis of abstract statements, unsupported by any arguments (see Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and\u00a048183/99, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2003-IX (extracts)).

Notably, in order to ensure that decisions on applications for an extension of initial periods of detention were taken expeditiously under Article 163 \u00a7 2 of the CCP, the domestic courts had a statutory period of only five days for the examination of such applications (see paragraph 86 above). In view of that requirement of speed, which is moreover one of the core principles of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, the Court considers that the Tbilisi Regional Court, when examining the issue of the applicants\u2019 detention on remand on 10 November 2004, was not obliged to have ensured the previous exchange of all the parties\u2019 documents by post as that could have complicated its task of taking a decision within the statutory time-limit of five days (compare, mutatis mutandis, with a similar situation in Patsuria, cited above, \u00a7 52, and also Yavuz v. Austria (dec.), no.\u00a032800/96, 18 January 2000).

The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the unlawfulness in question and, where the violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see Allan v. the United Kingdom, no. 48539/99, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2002-IX). Furthermore, different considerations apply in respect of the use in criminal proceedings of evidence recovered by a measure found to be in breach of Article 3. The admission into the case file of statements obtained as a result of a violation of Article 3\u00a0renders the proceedings as a whole automatically unfair, in breach of Article 6 (see Harutyunyan v.\u00a0Armenia, no. 36549/03, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2007-VIII; Jalloh v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a7 99 and 105, ECHR 2006-IX, and Fidanc\u0131 v. Turkey, no.\u00a017730/07, \u00a7 34, 17 January 2012). This rule applies irrespective of the probative value of the statements and of whether their use has been decisive in securing a conviction (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0166-167 and 173, ECHR 2010, and Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, \u00a7 254, ECHR 2016). The same rule also holds true with respect to the use of real evidence obtained as a result of an act of ill-treatment which is serious enough to be described as torture (G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 173). The use in a trial of evidence obtained by torture would amount to a flagrant denial of justice not only where the victim of the treatment contrary to Article 3 is the actual defendant but also even where the person from whom the evidence had been thus extracted is a third party (see El Haski v.\u00a0Belgium, no.\u00a0649/08, \u00a7 85, 25 September 2012). The Court further reiterates that early access to a lawyer is a procedural guarantee of the privilege against self-incrimination and a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment (see, in a similar vein, Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 55, 27\u00a0November 2008, and Ibrahim, cited above, \u00a7 255).",

Those statements were eventually removed from the case file by the trial court and were not used to convict the applicants. However, that fact could not sufficiently remedy the problems of criminal proceedings which had been undermined by the use of interrogation methods prohibited under Article 3 and which had led to the first and most decisive piece of evidence for the purposes of further investigative actions being obtained (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Stanimirovi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 26088/06, \u00a7 52, 18 October 2011, and Shishkin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 18280/04, \u00a7 150-152, 7 July 2011). Indeed, prior to the formal removal of that initial confession from the case file, the investigating authorities had placed heavy reliance on it to counter the applicants\u2019 numerous attempts to build and develop their defence strategy. For instance, it was mainly on the grounds of that confession that the investigative authorities refused to undertake actions aimed at verifying the first applicant\u2019s alibi (see paragraphs\u00a028, 29, 31 and 39).",

That second confession was then directly used in the conviction as one of the major incriminating elements against both applicants (see paragraphs 75 and 76 above). Despite the fact that a public defence lawyer had already been assigned to the first applicant by that time and attended the reconstruction, it does not appear from the case file that the first applicant was ever able to consult that lawyer prior to repeating his confession. Furthermore, the fact that the first applicant was made to confirm his statements in the presence of the very same police officers whom he had accused of torture and was expected to return to Tbilisi police headquarters after the reconstruction, definitely added to his feeling of insecurity and helplessness. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the restatement of the confession during the reconstruction was equally tainted by the previous acts of torture and could not constitute a valid piece of evidence. The domestic courts should have shown the utmost care by subjecting those repeated statements to the very strict scrutiny prior to accepting them (compare with, mutatis mutandis, Harutyunyan, cited above, \u00a7 65; Hajnal v.\u00a0Serbia, no. 36937/06, \u00a7 114, 19 June 2012; Stanimirovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052, and also Nechiporuk and Yonkalo, cited above, \u00a7 265). In other words, it cannot be said that there was a break in the causal chain leading from the prohibited method of the first questioning at Tbilisi police headquarters to the reiteration by the first applicant of his confession at the scene of the crime which was then directly used to secure the conviction of the applicants and provided a base for their sentence (compare and contrast with G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 180).",

However, the Court still wishes to address the statements of the victim, the member of parliament, which were also used by the domestic courts to secure the applicants\u2019\u00a0conviction (see paragraphs 75 and 76 above). Notably, the victim identified the first applicant as the assailant during the identification parade on 13 May 2004. He then stated that he had had \u201ca private talk\u201d shortly after the identification parade, when the first applicant had reportedly confessed to him and implicated the second applicant.",

Indeed, there was a considerable difference in appearance between the first applicant and the other participants in the identification parade, a fact which was acknowledged several times by various people during the domestic proceedings and which remained uncontested by the Government in the proceedings before the Court. Both applicants raised that major argument in their defence before the domestic courts, but they provided no response to it in their decisions (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Laska and Lika v. Albania, nos. 12315/04 and\u00a017605/04, \u00a7\u00a7 65-71, 20 April 2010, and Popov v.

Lastly, the Court observes that there existed the required minimum evidence to support a reasonable suspicion that the victim, the member of parliament, had stood behind several attempts to coerce the first applicant into standing by his initial confession (see paragraphs\u00a026, 3638, 41 and 70 above). Despite the fact that the applicants had duly voiced all those serious grievances to the investigative, prosecution and judicial authorities, and even played a secret recording of an attempt to bribe the first applicant\u2019s wife to the trial court (see paragraph 71 above), the authorities remained conspicuously indifferent to what were welldocumented allegations of the victim\u2019s perverting the course of justice.",
