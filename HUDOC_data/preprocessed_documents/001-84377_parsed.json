Poland, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the 11 co-defendants, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant's detention during the period necessary to terminate the investigation, to draw up the bill of indictment and to hear evidence from the other accused. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning an organised criminal group, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high (see, G\u0142adczak, cited above, \u00a7 55).",

It cannot be overlooked that he was subsequently released from detention in July 1995 to enable him to take care of his mother and grandmother. However, he absconded and the investigation had to be suspended. Subsequently he had been sought pursuant to a wanted notice (see paragraph 8 above). This constituted an aggravating circumstance supporting the courts' decisions extending the applicant's detention on remand, as the risk of his absconding again was exceptionally high. Further, the Court notes that seven out of the eight charges against the applicant concerned crimes committed after his release from detention on remand in 1995 (see paragraph 14 above). The domestic courts cannot be reproached for harbouring grave concerns that the applicant would, if released again, go into hiding and engage in further serious criminal activity.",

In this connection, the Court observes that the proceedings were of considerable complexity, regard being had to the number of defendants, the extensive evidentiary proceedings and the implementation of special measures required in cases concerning organised crime. Nevertheless, the hearings in the applicant's case were held regularly and at short intervals. The course of the proceedings was swift and their length reasonable. The Court therefore concludes that the national authorities displayed special diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. It should not be overlooked that, while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the judges' efforts to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide both the defence and the prosecution with all necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed.",
