Thereafter, she had remained psychotic, had demonstrated signs of delusions of grandeur and had been paranoid.

In the event of the admission of a person to a closed institution pursuant to the procedure for the application of interim measures, the person himself or herself, and those close to him or her, have to be heard (Article\u00a0534 \u00a7 1 (4) of the CCP). The second sentence of Article 534 \u00a7 2 of the CCP allows for an exception from this rule to be made if the hearing may cause significant damage to the health of the person or if the person is clearly not able to express his or her will. According to the first sentence of Article 534 \u00a7 3 of the CCP, due to the potential danger resulting from a delay (the meaning of the provision indicates that reference is made to danger to the person\u2019s own life or other persons\u2019 lives, health or safety), interim measures may be applied before hearing the person himself or herself and the other persons, and before appointing a representative for him or her. According to the second sentence of Article 534 \u00a7 3 of the CCP, such [hearing and appointment] must be performed promptly thereafter. The [Supreme Court] considers that the main purpose of Article 534 \u00a7 1 (4) and the second sentence of \u00a7 534 (3) of the CCP is the need to prevent an unfounded admission of a person to a closed institution or the opportunity to decide on the termination of the admission pursuant to Article 539 \u00a7 1 of the CCP.",

Although the second sentence of Article 534 \u00a7 3 of the CCP obliges the court to promptly perform certain acts (hear the person himself or herself and the other persons named in the law, and appoint him or her a representative), the meaning of the law is that the person concerned has to be heard in the first place. Since the person concerned, as a rule, will have been admitted to the closed institution by that time, his or her whereabouts will be known to the court. If there were any objective circumstances preventing the court from hearing the person concerned herself, or if there were any circumstances mentioned in the second sentence of Article 534 \u00a7 2 of the CCP (hearing the person concerned would cause significant damage to his or her health, or he or she is clearly not able to express his or her will), pertinent reasons should have been set out in the decision. However, the aforementioned violation of the norms of procedure is not so important that it would result in quashing the ruling.

Firstly, the individual concerned must be reliably shown to be of unsound mind, that is to say, a true mental disorder must be established before a competent authority on the basis of objective medical expertise. Secondly, the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory admission. Thirdly, the validity of the extension of the period of compulsory admission depends upon the persistence of such a disorder (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, \u00a7 39, Series\u00a0A no. 33; Rakevich v. Russia, no. 58973/00, \u00a7 27, 28 October 2003; and Shtukaturov v. Russia, no. 44009/05, \u00a7 114, 27 March 2008). The national authorities have a certain margin of appreciation regarding the merits of clinical diagnoses since it is in the first place for them to evaluate the evidence in a particular case: the Court\u2019s task is to review under the Convention the decisions of those authorities (see H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a045508/99, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2004IX, and Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 40).",

The Court observes, however, that, pursuant to section 11(1)(2) of the Mental Health Act, one of the preconditions for compulsory admission was that \u201cwithout inpatient treatment, the person may endanger the life, health or safety of himself or herself or others due to [a] mental disorder\u201d (see paragraph 25 above). The Court considers such a definition sufficiently clear to describe, without excessive rigidity, the situations in which a person\u2019s compulsory admission could be ordered (see, for comparison, Rakevich, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a031-32).",

She had become violent towards her partner and had put her child\u2019s well-being in danger. Her outpatient treatment had not proved effective. The Court considers that the medical opinion and the court\u2019s decision were sufficiently detailed in the circumstances of the present case, particularly given the time-frame within which the authorities had to act, as well as the limited duration of the applicant\u2019s compulsory admission. Furthermore, the Court has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the medical opinion and is satisfied that the applicant was shown to have been a \u201cperson of unsound mind\u201d whose mental disorder warranted compulsory admission. It also notes that the assessment of the applicant\u2019s medical condition and her dangerousness were later confirmed by the forensic psychiatric opinion and other evidence gathered in the course of the criminal proceedings.",

However, in such a case, the person concerned had to be heard \u201cpromptly\u201d thereafter, as stipulated by Article 534 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 26 above). In the present case, the applicant was not heard by the judge until fifteen days after the decision concerning her compulsory admission had been made. The Supreme Court found that no reasons \u2013 for example, that hearing the applicant would have caused significant damage to her health, or that she had clearly not been able to express her will \u2013 had been given for the fifteen-day delay and concluded that Article 534 \u00a7 3 had been violated (see paragraph 24 above). The Court sees no reason to come to a different conclusion. It also notes in this context that fifteen days constituted a considerable portion of the three-month admission period \u2013 the maximum duration allowed according to the procedure for interim measures under Article 534 of the Code of Civil Procedure.",

Moreover, the report in question concerned the applicant\u2019s ability to participate in criminal proceedings against her. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the same criteria could not be applied to her eligibility to be heard in the proceedings related to her compulsory admission to the psychiatric clinic. Indeed, the applicant\u2019s mental incompetence, her inability to give evidence in court and to serve a punishment were closely linked to the reasons for her compulsory admission. To hold in such circumstances that her inability automatically extended to the proceedings concerning her compulsory admission would render her right to be heard in the latter proceedings virtually devoid of substance.",

The Court does not underestimate the importance of these matters. However, it considers that an important aspect of the applicant\u2019s complaints also related to the very procedure by which she was deprived of her liberty. It notes in this context that although the Supreme Court found that the fifteen-day delay that elapsed before the County Court heard the applicant constituted a \u201cviolation of the norms of procedure\u201d, it drew no further conclusions from that assessment and afforded the applicant no redress.",
