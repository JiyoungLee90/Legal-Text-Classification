In so doing, it referred, inter alia, to the applicant\u2019s own confession of 18\u00a0April 2011, the statements of the co-accused, S.\u0160., and the identification of the applicant by N.S., who was, in particular, deemed not to have had a personal interest in not being truthful. The witness G.T., by contrast, was seen as having had reason to exculpate the applicant in view of his connection with the applicant\u2019s future sister-in-law. The court also noted that the applicant\u2019s procedural rights had been fully respected in terms of choice of counsel and otherwise and opined that there had been no credible evidence of the applicant having been ill-treated in police custody. The court deemed it unnecessary to hear as witnesses the medical doctor who had established the applicant\u2019s condition on 19 April 2011 or his partner at the time. As regards the doctor, it considered that the injuries in question \u201ccould not be linked\u201d to the applicant\u2019s questioning on 18 April 2011, especially in view of the statements given by the witnesses in this regard denying any abuse. Moreover, the medical examination itself had only taken place belatedly. With respect to the applicant\u2019s partner, the court held that there was no need to hear her either, given the abundance of other evidence on the issue.",

At the same time, the latter proposed witness was rejected because it was deemed that there was no need to hear her, given the abundance of other evidence on the issue. The Court, however, cannot accept this reasoning because the medical doctor, if heard, might have explained whether the injuries in question could have been caused in the manner alleged by the applicant and clarified any issues regarding the time it would take for them to become visible, while the applicant\u2019s partner stated that she had seen the applicant after his release from police custody and could therefore also have potentially provided meaningful testimony.

While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, Series A no. 140; Teixeira de Castro v.

It is, therefore, not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence \u2013 for example, evidence obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law \u2013 may be admissible. The question that must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the unlawfulness in question and, where the violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000-V; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 2001-IX; and Allan v. the United Kingdom, no. 48539/99, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2002-IX).",

The Court has also recognised that an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, and in most cases this can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer, whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure that the right of an accused not to incriminate himself is respected (ibid., \u00a7\u00a054; see also Pavlenko v.

Germany, 25 September 1992, \u00a7\u00a029, Series A no.\u00a0237-B). The Court has consistently held that the national authorities must have regard to the defendant\u2019s wishes as to his or her choice of legal representation, but may override those wishes when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (see Dvorski, cited above, \u00a7 79, with further references therein). Where such grounds are lacking, a restriction on the free choice of defence counsel would entail a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 together with paragraph 3 (c) if it adversely affected the applicant\u2019s defence, regard being had to the proceedings as a whole (ibid.).",

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, \u00a7\u00a055-57, and Dvorski, \u00a7 80 \u2013 both cited above).",

In contrast to the cases involving denial of access, the more lenient requirement of \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons has been applied in situations raising the less serious issue of \u201cdenial of choice\u201d. In such cases the Court\u2019s task will be to assess whether, in the light of the proceedings as a whole, the rights of the defence have been \u201cadversely affected\u201d to such an extent as to undermine their overall fairness (see Dvorski, cited above, \u00a7 81, together with further references cited therein).",

Where no such reasons exist, the Court should proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings. It is furthermore mindful that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory and that in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond appearances and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, among many other authorities, Dvorski, cited above, \u00a7 82).",

However, the Court immediately (and, in my opinion, correctly) undercuts this dubious point by acknowledging that \u201ca waiver of the right to have one\u2019s lawyer present during a search at a point when one has still not been formally charged with anything does not amount to an unequivocal waiver in respect of one\u2019s right to have present a lawyer of one\u2019s own choosing during any subsequent questioning by the police relating to specific charges\u201d.",

The Court, sitting as a Grand Chamber, has already explained that national authorities \u2013 and particularly national courts \u2013 are obliged under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) to carefully scrutinise allegations that the appointment of a lawyer to represent a suspect influenced or led to the making of an incriminating statement by that suspect at the outset of the criminal investigation (see Dvorski\u00a0v.\u00a0Croatia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a025703/11, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2015). Once a credible allegation of police abuse has been made, a careful national court cannot possibly rely on the alleged victim\u2019s failure to object to the appointment of a lawyer in the presence of the alleged abuser unless it first investigates and dismisses that allegation. An investigation of this kind would be necessary even in the absence of a complaint involving Article\u00a03 of the Convention, such as that in the present case (see, mutatis mutandis and among other authorities, Mehmet Duman v. Turkey, no. 38740/09, \u00a7 42, 23 October 2018).",

Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 37). Of course, individuals may make implicit decisions as to their legal representation and in such cases the national authorities must rely on circumstantial evidence, including their conduct, to discern those decisions. As the Court very recently reiterated, this is true even of decisions to waive rights secured by Article 6 (see Akda\u011f v. Turkey, no. 75460/10, \u00a7 46, 17\u00a0September 2019, not yet final). However, to do so incautiously, on the basis of evidence as equivocal as the evidence in this case and in the face of a credible allegation which calls into question the voluntary nature of the applicant\u2019s conduct (contrast Akda\u011f, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46, 50-61), creates a grim possibility that rights secured by the Convention will be disregarded when individuals fall silent out of fear.",
