The letter was titled \u201cLocust funds want to take over medical practices\u201d (\u201cHeuschreckenfonds wollen Ordinationen \u00fcbernehmen\u201d). The second applicant went on to state that he had been forced to write to his colleagues for a serious reason, namely, because it had been reported in the media that the F. company planned to go into \u201cthe radiology business\u201d. He added that share-bidding companies planned to offer medical services \u2013 initially in the area of radiology, but soon enough in other areas of the profession as well  and that doctors risked becoming mere employees of such \u201clocust\u201d companies. If they would not act according to the companies\u2019 wishes, they would be dismissed. The second applicant then explained the assumed legal and organisational basis of such a plan: radiology services which were currently being provided by medical practices could, in future, also be offered by limited companies. Shares of those companies could then be bought by the F. company, and the \u201clocusts\u201d would reach their goal, namely control of the medical profession. Giving an example of a risky development, the second applicant stated that in the last 20 years, colleagues had founded laboratories which had reciprocal agreements with certain health insurance boards. Today, almost all of those laboratories were owned by the F. group, which, in turn, was owned by insurance companies, investment funds and foundations, and which employed a large number of doctors. The second applicant ended his letter by stating that he could guarantee one thing: that the doctors\u2019 professional representative body would make use of all legal and political means available to stop such a disastrous development from going ahead, to prevent that the quality of medical treatment being determined by \u201cmanagers and controllers\u201d and to ensure, inter alia, that existing medical practices were protected from the competition from \u201cinternational locust funds\u201d (\u201cinternationale Heuschreckenfonds\u201d).",

However, it dismissed the F. company\u2019s application to prohibit the applicants from calling its provision of services a \u201cdisastrous\u201d development. The Court of Appeal found that the first applicant organisation had locus standi in the injunction proceedings. The Chamber of Medical Doctors held official authority status in relation to certain areas of its work (Bereich der Hoheitsverwaltung), in addition to representing the interests of its members; it was therefore considered a legal entity under the Official Liability Act (Amtshaftungsgesetz). However, when acting as a special interest group, it represented its members\u2019 interests from a mainly economic perspective, rather than acting in its capacity as an official authority.

The domestic court found that there was a need to balance the interests involved in the present debate, reiterating that extreme opinions were only unlawful if they were excessive. As a result of that balancing exercise, the Court of Appeal found that the \u201clocust\u201d statement had to be considered a lawful criticism in the context of a public debate, and that the F. company could therefore not base its claim on Article 1330 of the Civil Code. However, the Court of Appeal classified the applicants\u2019 actions as competitive in nature. Statements of fact made in violation of the Unfair Competition Act could not be justified by the right to freedom of expression. The Court of Appeal found that Austrian law provided wideranging protection for commercial and economic interests. Those who published an opinion in an economically competitive context were obliged to exercise a higher level of diligence with regard to the facts and bases of their allegations than those who acted in the non-competitive context of a public debate of general interest. Therefore, the Court of Appeal upheld the injunction decision with regard to the statements about the \u201clocust company\u201d.",

However, the Supreme Court observed that the applicants had made their statement in the clearly economic context of competition between medical practitioners and companies which provided the same services. The applicants could have warned their members of the possible risks of cooperating with companies without overstepping the margin of acceptable criticism. However, the applicants had exceeded that limit and stated that the F. company was a \u201clocust\u201d.

It had also had the advancement of independent medical practices as an objective, and had contained a warning regarding capital ventures which allegedly threatened doctors\u2019 independence. The Commercial Court found the relevant comparisons with \u201clocusts\u201d to be statements of fact regarding both the F. company and its conduct in relation to third parties, doctors and patients.

The greater the public interest in being properly informed and the less the statement related to commercial interests, the more the statement would be protected by Article 10 of the Convention.

Therefore, the expression used had turned into a statement of fact, giving the reader the impression that the F. company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which threatened the interests of doctors and patients. In view of the specific circumstances of the case, the prohibition ruled upon by the lower courts was justified. Even though the applicants had taken part in a debate of general public interest, an untrue and damaging statement of fact was not protected by freedom of expression. Furthermore, the issuing of warnings concerning the potential risks of the provision of medical services by companies was not, as such, prohibited by the decisions of the Austrian courts; the applicants had only been required to refrain from making untrue statements of fact in respect of their competitors.",

The term \u201cgovernmental organisations\u201d, as opposed to \u201cnon\u2011governmental organisations\u201d within the meaning of Article 34, includes legal entities which participate in the exercise of governmental powers or run a public service under government control.

However, in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practices, there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies \u2013 not just for the benefit of shareholders and employees, but also for the wider economic good. Therefore, the State enjoys a margin of appreciation as to the means it provides under domestic law by which a company can challenge the truth and limit the damage of allegations which risk harming its reputation (see Steel and Morris v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2005 II). Furthermore, the Court emphasises that a wider margin of appreciation entrusted to the States is essential in the complex and fluctuating area of unfair competition (see Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG (no. 3), cited above \u00a7 30, and Jacubowski v. Germany, 23 June 1994, \u00a7 26, Series A no. 291A).",

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it. The classification of a statement as one of fact or as a value judgment is a matter which, in the first place, falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities \u2013 in particular, the courts (see, Lindon, OtchakovskyLaurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and\u00a036448/02, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2007IV). However, the Court can change this classification under its supervisory role (see Kharlamov v. Russia, no.\u00a027447/07, \u00a7 31, 8 October 2015; Pinto Pinheiro Marques v. Portugal, no.\u00a026671/09, \u00a7 43, 22 January 2015).",

They acknowledged that where a competitor, even for economic purposes, took part in a debate of public interest, freedom of expression had to hold more weight with regard to the balancing exercise. However, the term \u201clocust\u201d was almost exclusively loaded with negative meaning, which led to an unethical general vilification of a competitor. The word used gave the reader the impression that the F. company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which harmed the interests of doctors and patients. Therefore, the domestic courts judged the relevant statement to be one of fact. The statement was also likely to damage the F. company\u2019s commercial interests, and had not been proved to be true.",

For a company which offers medical services, the accusation that it acted as a \u201clocust\u201d (which, as can be seen from the context of the applicants\u2019 letter, also implied that the F. company or similar companies placed economic interests above those of its patients) was a particularly serious one which affected its reputation. Thus, even if the applicant had intended to make that statement in the context of a wider debate on an issue of public concern, he had to have a solid factual basis on which to base that allegation. In the domestic proceedings, the Austrian courts \u2013 after carefully examining the arguments put forward by the applicant \u2013 concluded that there was no such factual basis, and the applicant has likewise not provided any persuasive argument substantiating his allegations. Neither the fact that the shares in the F. company are owned by other companies limited by shares and that one of those shareholders is managed by a private-equity fund, nor the fact that financial resources for expansion are raised by debenture provides a factual basis for the unethical conduct typically associated with \u201clocust\u201d corporations. In addition, the fact that doctors are employees within the F. company does not provide a factual basis for the second applicant\u2019s allegations. The general remarks by the second applicant concerning the future impact of the growing popularity of companies providing medical services are not related to any actions on the part of the F. company; therefore, they cannot provide a factual basis for his allegations against that company.",
