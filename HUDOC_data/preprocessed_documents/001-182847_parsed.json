Finland [GC], no.\u00a073053/01, ECHR 2006XIV), it examined whether tax surcharge proceedings were \u201ccriminal\u201d within the autonomous meaning of the Article, and to this end relied on three criteria, commonly known as the \u201cEngel criteria\u201d (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7\u00a082, Series\u00a0A no. 22), to be considered in determining whether or not there was a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. However, this does not exclude a cumulative approach in cases where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia [GC], no. 14939/03, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2009, and Steininger v.\u00a0Austria, no. 21539/07, \u00a7 34, 17 April 2012).",

However, this is not decisive. As for the second criterion, the Court notes that the offence at issue, namely failure to obey the orders of an official authority, was a misdemeanour and criminal in nature. In that connection, it points out that the applicant was charged with that offence on account of having provided premises for prostitution, an act which did not constitute a separate criminal offence at the time of the events and was regulated as one by the entry into force of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237) during the course of the proceedings against the applicant. With regard to the third criterion, the Court observes that, although the administrative fine was not a substantial amount, it was punitive, as clearly stated by the B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00e7ekmece Magistrates\u2019 Court in its decision (see paragraph 15 above). In that respect, it notes that the purpose of the fine was not compensation for damage caused by the applicant but rather a measure to deter the latter from committing the offence again. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that Article\u00a06 applies under its criminal head.",

Thus, it did not belong to the category of cases that fell under Article 6 \u00a7 1 because of the application of the broad Engel criteria. The proceedings before the Magistrates\u2019 Court concerned, in my opinion, the \u201chard core of criminal law\u201d, notwithstanding the minor nature of the sanction that could be imposed.",

An oral hearing is not required, for example, \u201cwhere there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate a hearing and the courts may fairly and reasonably decide the case on the basis of the parties\u2019 submissions and other written materials\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 41, referred to in paragraph\u00a045 of the present judgment). The modest character of the fine and the degree of stigma carried by it (see paragraph 49 of the judgment) do not come into play to justify dispensing with an oral hearing in such cases.",

I assume that the applicant had already raised these arguments before the Magistrates\u2019 Court, or could have raised them before that court.
