Moreover, the domestic courts\u2019 reliance in certain cases on the assurances of the Tajik and Uzbek authorities, despite their formulation in standard terms, appears tenuous, given that similar assurances have consistently been considered unsatisfactory by the Court in the past (see, for example, Abdulkhakov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14743/11, \u00a7\u00a7 149-50, 2\u00a0October 2012, and Tadzhibayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 17724/14, \u00a7 46, 1\u00a0December 2015).",
