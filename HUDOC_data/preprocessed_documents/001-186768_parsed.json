Whilst acknowledging that, at that stage, it was not pronouncing judgment on the question of A.G.\u2019s guilt, the appellate court nevertheless noted that the evidence corroborating his guilt on the charges of murder was very scarce to support his detention pending trial. In particular, although the victims had allegedly been killed as early as 1994, their bodies had still not been found, and A.G. had been charged with their murder only in 2005. The Court of Appeal also pointed out that there was no evidence that A.G. could hide from the investigation, although these had been the grounds relied on by the prosecutor in support of A.G.\u2019s detention. On the contrary, the case material showed that, when summoned in March\u00a02006, A.G. had attended the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. His wife had also later taken his passport to the prosecutor, which, according to the Court of Appeal, showed that he had not been hiding that document. Moreover, between June 2005 and February\u00a02006\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the period which the prosecutor referred to as the period when A.G. had been hiding from the authorities\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in reality, A.G. had been working in Lithuania and receiving a salary. Similarly, although the prosecutor claimed that in the summer of 2005 A.G. had been recognised as a suspect and a national and international search in respect of him had been announced, in reality, the police had not been actively searching for A.G. This was because, during the relevant time, A.G. had taken part in an unrelated court hearing in Lithuania and had also crossed the Lithuanian State border a number of times. It was very plausible that A.G. had not even known that he was being sought by the authorities. For the Court of Appeal, there were also no grounds to hold that A.G. could hide from the authorities abroad, because he had not done so, in spite of his numerous trips to foreign countries.",

Even so, the appellate court pointed to the inconsistency in relation to the arguments for A.G.\u2019s detention. In particular, in October 2006 and in a co-accused\u2019s case, the prosecutor had asserted that all necessary actions in the criminal investigation had already been performed, and that therefore it was unlikely that that co-accused would hide from the authorities and there were no grounds for his pre-trial detention. However, in A.G.\u2019s case, in October\u00a02006 the Vilnius Regional Court had extended A.G.\u2019s detention, considering that many investigative actions had yet to be performed. For the Court of Appeal, this meant that, with regard to the collection of evidence, double standards had been applied to the two co-accused in the case, which raised doubts as to the objectivity of the criminal investigation. The Court of Appeal also considered that such actions could be seen as discrimination under the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, as was apparent from the material presented by A.G.\u2019s lawyer, a DNA examination had already been performed in the case. This fact had also been acknowledged by the prosecutor, who had also confirmed that all the main investigative actions had already been completed. The Court of Appeal thus considered that continuing A.G.\u2019s detention would be unnecessary, and would risk breaching Article 5 of the Convention.",

Although the applicant criticised the authorities\u2019 decision to later suspend those proceedings, the Court is not ready to share such a view, because the reasons to suspend the criminal investigation into R.A.\u2019s disappearance were plausible (see paragraph 12 above). The Court is also ready to accept that there were obstacles and difficulties which prevented progress in the investigation, including witnesses falsely testifying that they had seen R.A. and Z.V. alive (see paragraph\u00a010 above), all the more so since nothing in the case-file suggests that the authorities\u2019 had a reason not to trust those witnesses\u2019 statements. Furthermore, as submitted by the Government and not contested by the applicant, the search for R.A. continued afterwards, and numerous measures were employed to locate him (see paragraph\u00a013 above). Whilst it is true that the criminal proceedings regarding R.A.\u2019s disappearance were pending for a number of years, there is nothing in the facts of the case which would lead the Court to conclude that the authorities did not put appropriate efforts into investigating what happened to him.",

Be that as it may, the Court observes that the above-mentioned decision of the Court of Appeal was quashed by the Supreme Court on 5\u00a0July 2011 (see paragraph 37 above). The Court therefore considers that the explicit statutory prohibition under Article\u00a0139 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on applying remand measures in respect of a person acquitted by a court judgment that had entered into force no longer applied to A.G.\u2019s situation (see paragraph 52 above).

It is apparent that on or around the date of his conviction by the Court of Appeal, A.G. left the territory of the respondent State and has not returned since, thus making it impossible for its authorities to arrest him with a view to sentence enforcement. Although A.G. has been staying on territory outside the effective control of the respondent State, I believe that its obligations under Article 2 of the Convention do not stop at its borders. That is to say, it is my opinion that in a cross-border context as in the present case, the procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention also includes an obligation to seek cooperation from the State to which the convicted person in question has fled. While the exact scope of this obligation is yet to be defined in the Court\u2019s case-law, its basic traits are clear. For example, in Agache and Others v. Romania (no. 2712/02, 20 October 2009), the Court, in order to find a procedural violation of Article 2, took into account inter alia the fact that the authorities of the respondent State had not taken the necessary steps to secure the extradition of three of the convicted persons for an attack leading to the victim\u2019s death.",

On 28 November 2012 he signed a letter of authorisation in the Smolensk Region of the Russian Federation empowering his wife to represent his interests before Lithuanian institutions. This letter was presented to a Lithuanian court in November 2013. At least from that date on, the Lithuanian authorities were aware of his likely whereabouts. In 2017 A.G. was granted refugee status in the Russian Federation. One could reasonably have expected that, in the meantime, the Lithuanian authorities would seek extradition from their Russian counterparts. Both States are parties to the Council of Europe\u2019s European Convention on Extradition (and possibly to other bilateral or multilateral instruments in this respect) and if presented with a proper extradition request, the Russian Federation could only refuse to extradite A.G. if any of the exceptions applied to the particular situation.",

No further information was provided. Instead, the Government referred to the classified nature of information. I consider this to be insufficient for the purpose of verifying whether the respondent State has taken all steps reasonably possible in order to secure the transfer of A.G. to Lithuania. In my opinion, the examination of this case before the Court would have benefited from additional communication to the parties, offering the respondent Government an opportunity to further explain the steps they have actually taken in this respect and the applicant the possibility of commenting on that issue, should she wish to do so. Since the majority decided not to engage in this procedural act, I have taken into account the fact that at the initial communication stage the Government\u2019s attention was not specifically drawn to issues of international legal assistance.

The necessity of remand measures is determined according to the evidence known to the domestic authorities at the time when the decision quashing the acquittal is taken (5 July 2011) and not with the benefit of hindsight, on the basis of evidence disclosed to them more than two years later. The same applies to the Court. The point in time for the Court\u2019s assessment of the need for remand measures is 5 July 2011, not November 2013.",

This is a fallacious reasoning based on an argument from ignorance (argumentum ad ignorantiam), also known as a fallacy of ignorance. This logical fallacy, common in legal reasoning, draws an argument from the lack of information or contrary evidence, and therefore contradicts a basic tenet of legal reasoning according to which one should not draw conclusions from incomplete or insufficient sources of information.",

It is telling that in the majority of cases I have identified the fallacy has benefited the Government. In N.\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom an argument in favour of the Government was drawn from the uncertainty about the features of the health care available in the receiving State in the future. In Biao an argument in favour of the Government was drawn from the uncertainty that the applicants could have met the generally applicable attachment requirement in a \u201cfew years\u201d. In Ramadan an argument in favour of the Government was drawn from the lack of certainty about a future expulsion. In S\u00f5ro the national courts drew an argument against the applicant from the lack of certainty regarding his exact role as a KGB driver. Only in Chiragov was an argument drawn in favour of the applicant, from the lack of information about the military presence of forces supported by the respondent Government on a certain territory. Regardless of which party benefits from them, it is high time to put an end to such tortuous arguments in the Court\u2019s drafting practice.",

In the Grand Chamber\u2019s own words, \u201cthe concept of \u2018State secrets\u2019 has often been invoked to obstruct the search for the truth\u201d (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 39630/09, \u00a7\u00a0191, ECHR 2012). The generalisation of secret, undisclosed evidence in a human rights court is not only counterproductive, it is contra naturam. It is counterproductive because undisclosed evidence is fundamentally undermined in terms of its probative value, and it is contra naturam, because it defeats the very foundations of the right of access to effective justice, renders the principle of equality of arms meaningless and conflicts with the right to the truth. Worst of all, undisclosed evidence endangers the appearance of a fair and impartial administration of justice by the Court. In sum, undisclosed evidence is an existential threat to open and effective justice, as pointed out in the PACE Resolution 1838 (2011) on Abuse of state secrecy and national security: obstacles to parliamentary and judicial scrutiny of human rights violations.",

Where the Court does consider undisclosed evidence, within the strict confines mentioned above, this evidence should not be determinative of the case without other corroborating evidence.
