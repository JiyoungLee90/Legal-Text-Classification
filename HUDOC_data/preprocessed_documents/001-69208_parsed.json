Not every claimed risk to life therefore can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising (see Akko\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2000X).",

In this connection, the Court would point to the fact that, as detailed in the chronology submitted by the applicant \u2013 the accuracy of which has not been challenged by the Government \u2013, dozens of politicians working for HADEP and its predecessors were being kidnapped, injured and killed at around the time of H\u00fcseyin Koku\u2019s death.
