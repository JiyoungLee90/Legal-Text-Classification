The competence of the Compensation Commission was subsequently extended by two decrees adopted on 16 March 2014 and 9 March 2016 respectively. The Court notes in this connection that the Compensation Commission has now the competence to examine complaints concerning an alleged breach of an applicant\u2019s right to private and family life on account of the respective disciplinary sanctions imposed on detainees and convicted persons by the prison authorities.",
