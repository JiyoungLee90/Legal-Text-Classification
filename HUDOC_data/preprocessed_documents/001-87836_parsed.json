In this connection, the Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance, and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 18\u00a0December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2275-76, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051-52, and Akd\u0131var and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 16\u00a0September\u00a01996, Reports 1996-IV, p. 1210, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a065-67).",

He sought compensation for damage caused by the alleged ill-treatment and the refusal to punish the perpetrators. In this connection, the Court observes that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. The Court has already held on a number of occasions that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, p.\u00a01211, \u00a7\u00a069, and Aksoy, cited above, p.\u00a02276, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).",

The Court finds that since the domestic courts have examined the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaint by which he challenged the decision of the assistant prosecutor, he cannot be said to have failed to exhaust domestic remedies. The Court also notes that the Government did not argue that, in pursuing this avenue of judicial review, the applicant had removed from the courts the option of examining the relevant issues. On the contrary, the Government stressed that the applicant had availed himself of judicial protection. It is also not apparent that a challenge to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s decision through the avenue of a separate criminal procedure would have been any more successful, or would have been decided on the basis of any other issues. By raising, alongside the tort action, a complaint about the decision not to institute criminal proceedings, the applicant provided the domestic authorities with the opportunity to put right the alleged violation.

However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

It observes that the Penitentiary Institutions Act (see paragraph 37 above) and the Custody Act (see paragraph 38 above) contain an exhaustive list of situations permitting rubber truncheons to be used. The Government submitted that the force had been used to repress a collective violation of the detention regime and to force the applicant to comply with a lawful order of the facility administration. As regards the first ground, the Court observes that truncheon blows were administered selectively and mostly for individual transgression. The Court is therefore not convinced that the first ground is applicable. At the same time it agrees, and this conclusion is supported by the findings of the domestic courts, that the warders resorted to these means to put an end to the detainees\u2019 refusal to comply with their orders. However, the manner in which the domestic law regulates the use of force against detainees does not absolve  from its responsibilities under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch, cited above, \u00a7 34; and Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7\u00a064, 12 April 2007).

Thus, it follows from the report on the use of rubber truncheons (see paragraph 26 above) that inmates in cell no. 81, where the applicant was detained, banged on the cell door. After warders had entered the cell, the banging stopped but the inmates refused to leave the cell and climbed on to the upper bunks. The Court accepts that in these circumstances the officers may have needed to resort to physical force in order to take inmates out of the cell. However, the Court is not convinced that hitting a detainee with a truncheon was conducive to the desired result.",

Those documents merely mentioned that the applicant had sustained injuries as a result of the \u201cselective\u201d application of special measures. Mention of an active role by the applicant was first made in the assistant prosecutor\u2019s decision of 3\u00a0July 2001. However, there is no explanation of these significant discrepancies between the facility administration\u2019s and the assistant prosecutor\u2019s versions of events.

In this respect, the Court notes that if the Government considered these allegations untrue, it was open to them to refute them by way of, for instance, witness testimony or other evidence. Nevertheless, at no point in the proceedings before the Court did the Government challenge that aspect of the applicant\u2019s factual submissions. Furthermore, the Court finds that medical evidence, recording injuries to the applicant\u2019s feet, supports his submission that warders continued hitting him while he was lying on the floor.

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering.

The beatings did not stop even after he had fallen on the floor. The punitive violence to which the warders deliberately resorted was intended to arouse in the applicant feelings of fear and humiliation and to break his physical or moral resistance. The purpose of that treatment was to debase the applicant and drive him into submission. In addition, the Court finds that the injuries which the applicant sustained establish the existence of serious physical pain and intense mental suffering. Moreover, they resulted in long-term damage to his health (see paragraph 28 above).

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. An obligation to investigate \u201cis not an obligation of result, but of means\u201d: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant\u2019s account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on.

Firstly, no evaluation was carried out with respect to the quantity and nature of the applicant\u2019s injuries in the view of the different versions of what had occurred during the relevant incident. In delivering his decision of 3 July 2001, the assistant prosecutor limited himself to the three medical reports which listed injuries sustained by the applicant. The Court reiterates in this connection that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. , nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a055 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X).

In particular, the Court notes that the assistant prosecutor\u2019s inquiry included excerpts from the testimonies given by several inmates allegedly present at the scene who stated that they had not seen the beatings. The Court finds it peculiar that the investigator had been unable to identify inmates who had been eyewitnesses to the beatings and who could have provided relevant information on the incident. It is further apparent from the decision of 3 July 2001 that the assistant prosecutor based his conclusions mainly on the testimonies given by the warders involved in the incident. Although the excerpt of the applicant\u2019s testimony was included in the decision of 3 July 2001, the investigator did not consider his testimony to be credible, apparently, because it reflected a personal opinion and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant. However, the assistant prosecutor\u2019s inquiry did accept as such the credibility of the warders\u2019 testimonies, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics and have been aimed at damaging the applicant\u2019s credibility. In the Court\u2019s view, the prosecution inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies, as those given by the applicant were deemed to be subjective, but not those given by the warders. However, the credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution inquiry had also sought to establish whether the warders were liable on disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v. , no.\u00a046317/99, \u00a7\u00a099, 23\u00a0February 2006).",

At no point during the inquiry did he endeavour to analyse the degree of force used by the warders and whether it was necessary and proportionate in the circumstances. Without subjecting the warders\u2019 testimonies to doubt, the investigator held that the warders had lawfully assaulted the applicant to put an end to his disruptive behaviour. In doing so, he disregarded a number of other factors \u2013 that medical evidence supported the applicant\u2019s allegations that the violence against him had continued after he had capitulated, that the beating had been wilful, and so on, all of which were material to the determination of whether the act complained of amounted to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.",

On this point, the Court reiterates that the waiver of a right guaranteed by the Convention, in so far as permissible, must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Bocos-Cuesta v. the Netherlands, no. 54789/00, \u00a7 65, 10 November 2005). In the instant case, the Court notes that as it appears from the court record the District Court did not ask the applicant or his lawyer whether they agreed to the reading out of the depositions. It merely mentioned that Mr I.\u2019s absence was for a good reason and proceeded to the reading out (see paragraph 17 above). It does not seem that the applicant or his lawyer was cautioned of the necessity of insisting on Mr I.\u2019s presence. The Government did not indicate any domestic legal provision which required an accused to explicitly ask for a presence of a witness testifying against him. There is also no indication that both the applicant and his counsel stated that they had no objections to the reading out (see, by contrast, Vozhigov v. , no. 5953/02, \u00a7\u00a057, 26\u00a0April 2007 and Andandonskiy v. , no.\u00a024015/02, \u00a7\u00a054, 28\u00a0September 2006). Furthermore, in their appeal statements lodged before the , they complained that Mr I.\u2019s absence had infringed the applicant\u2019s rights of a defendant (see paragraph 22 above). The  did not reject that complaint on the basis that the applicant had not asked for Mr I.\u2019s presence, but assessed and accepted as correct the reasons given by the District Court for its decision to read out Mr I.\u2019s depositions (see paragraph 23 above). Thus, the Court cannot find that the applicant may be regarded as having waived his rights under Article 6 as to the opportunity to examine the witness against him (see Bonev v. , no.\u00a060018/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 8 June 2006, with further references, and Bocos-Cuesta, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066).",

However, the use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him or her either when the statements were made or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Sa\u00efdi v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 56, \u00a7 43, and A.M. v. Italy, no. 37019/97, \u00a7 25, ECHR 1999-IX). In the event that the witnesses cannot be examined and that this is due to the fact that they are missing, the authorities must make a reasonable effort to secure their presence (see Artner v. Austria, judgment of 28 August 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0242A, p. 10, \u00a7\u00a021 in fine; Delta v. France, judgment of 19 December 1990, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0191A, p. 16, \u00a7 37; and Rachdad v. France, no. 71846/01, \u00a7 25, 13\u00a0November 2003). Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see, among other authorities, Bricmont\u00a0v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 7\u00a0July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, \u00a7\u00a089). The Court is only exercising its supervisory role. Finally, the conviction must not rest solely or decisively on the depositions of a witness whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined either during the investigation or at trial (see Artner, p. 10, \u00a7 22; Delta, p. 16, \u00a7 37, both cited above; Isgr\u00f2 v. Italy, judgment of 19\u00a0February 1991, Series A no.\u00a0194-A, p. 13, \u00a7 35 in fine; Solakov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 47023/99, \u00a7 57 in fine, ECHR 2001-X; and Rachdad, cited above, \u00a7 23 in fine).",

It is also true that the applicant admitted to having been present at the crime scene with the intention of beating  up and that the courts relied on that admission, but under Russian law a conviction cannot rest solely on the admission of the accused (see paragraph 42 above). The Court is not convinced that the applicant\u2019s avowal that he had intended to beat the victim up amounted to an admission that he had wanted to rob him too (see, mutatis mutandis, Bonev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043).",

Furthermore, the witnesses were unable to identify those men (see paragraph 18 above).\u00a0As regards the confessions, the Court notes that the co-defendants retracted them at the trial, alleging coercion on the part of the investigator. Leaving aside the investigation techniques and the alleged interrogation of the co-defendants in a state of drug intoxication, the Court reiterates that a higher degree of scrutiny should be applied to assessment of statements by co-defendants, because the position in which the accomplices find themselves while testifying is different from that of ordinary witnesses. They do not testify under oath, that is, without any affirmation of the truth of their statements which could have rendered them punishable for perjury for wilfully making untrue statements. In particular, in the case of M. H. v. the United Kingdom (no. 28572/95, Commission decision of 17 January 1997) a test was developed for the purpose of determining whether the admissibility of a guilty plea of a co-accused as evidence at the applicant\u2019s trial had rendered the proceedings unfair. For the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention to be respected on account of the admissibility of a guilty plea from a co-accused, such a plea should only be admitted to establish the fact of a commission of a crime by a pleading person, and not the applicant, and a judge should make it clear to the jury that the guilty plea by itself did not prove that the applicant was involved in that crime.",

While the Court is not unmindful of the domestic courts\u2019 obligation to secure the proper conduct of the trial and avoid undue delays in the criminal proceedings, it does not consider that a five-day stay in the proceedings for the purpose of obtaining Mr I.\u2019s testimony at the trial, in which the applicant stood accused of a very serious offence and was risking a long term of imprisonment, would have constituted an insuperable hindrance to the expediency of the proceedings at hand (see Artner, cited above, p.\u00a010, \u00a7\u00a021; Berisha v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 42965/98, 4 May 2000; and Haas v.

In this connection, the Court recalls that as a general rule the requirements of paragraphs 3 (d) and 1 of Article 6 will be satisfied if the defendant was given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him at a certain stage of the proceedings (see, among other authorities, Isgr\u00f2 v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 19\u00a0February 1991, Series A no. 194-A, p. 12, \u00a7 34, and Luc\u00e0 v. Italy, no. 33354/96, \u00a7\u00a7 40-43, ECHR 2001-II). The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant had a confrontation interview with  on 2\u00a0November 2000. However, it considers that the rights of the defence were not respected for the following reasons. At that interview  stated that four men in balaclava masks had attempted to rob him. He did not identify the applicant as an attacker, merely noting that he was of the same height as one of the perpetrators, and did not provide any further details pertaining to the crime or offenders which could have pointed to the applicant\u2019s participation in the robbery. Therefore, the Court does not find it peculiar that the applicant did not ask any questions and did not dispute Mr I.\u2019s submissions (see paragraph 11 above). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the domestic courts based the applicant\u2019s conviction on the depositions made on 23\u00a0April and 8\u00a0May 2001, when Mr I. had amended his previous statements, had identified the applicant as an attacker and had described his role in the robbery (see paragraph 17 above). The applicant was neither provided with an opportunity to follow the manner in which  was interrogated by the investigator on those occasions nor he was then or later provided with an opportunity to have questions put to Mr I. Furthermore, as Mr I.\u2019s statements to the investigator were not recorded on video, neither the applicant nor the judges were able to observe his demeanour under questioning and thus form their own impression of his reliability (see, a contrario, Accardi and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 30598/02, ECHR 2005-...). The Court does not doubt that the domestic courts undertook a careful examination of Mr I.\u2019s statements and gave the applicant an opportunity to contest them at the trial, but this can scarcely be regarded as a proper substitute for a personal observation of the leading witness giving oral evidence (see Bocos-Cuesta, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071).",
