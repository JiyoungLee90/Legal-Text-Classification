In addition to the restriction on public access to the court hearing, which gives ground for the court to hold a hearing or a part thereof in camera (Article 12 \u00a7 1 (3) of the CCrP), and the special rules for hearing witnesses who are minors (the same applies to victims), according to which a victim who is under fourteen years of age must be heard in the presence of a child protection official, social worker or psychologist (first sentence of Article 290 \u00a7\u00a02 of the CCrP), the law also provides for the possibility of a witness who is a minor not attending court in person. Under Article 287 \u00a7 5 of the CCrP the court may allow, at the request of a party or on its own initiative, a remote hearing to be conducted under the procedure provided for in Article 69 of the CCrP (and also to use a screen separating the victim from the accused). Pursuant to Article 69 \u00a7 1 of the CCrP one of the grounds for conducting a remote hearing is the need to protect the victim. When applying that measure a victim can be heard by means of a technical solution as a result of which the participants in the proceeding, see and hear the witness giving evidence outside the court by live coverage, and may question the witness through the [court] (Article 69 \u00a7 2 (1) of the CCrP). The Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court considers that by the use of the means foreseen in the Code of Criminal Procedure victims of crimes can be sufficiently protected against the impact of giving statements at a public hearing ...",

It is understandable that, in particular, attacks of a sexual nature have harmful consequences for the personality, especially for minors, and that even for purely medical reasons it may be advisable to avoid recollection of such experiences. However, in such a case the assessment of the medical condition cannot be within the discretion of a court or the Prosecutor\u2019s Office; it must be established in each particular case on the basis of, for example, an expert opinion.

There are exceptions to this principle, however. As a general rule, paragraphs 1 and\u00a03\u00a0(d) of Article\u00a06 cannot be interpreted as requiring in all cases that questions be put directly by the accused or his lawyer, whether by means of cross-examination or by any other means, but rather that the accused must be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when the witness makes his statement or at a later stage. The use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with the provisions cited above, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected (see Sa\u00efdi v. , 20 September 1993, \u00a7 43, Series A no.\u00a0261C). Even where such a statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission in evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1. At the same time, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. The Court will examine whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0118 and 147, and Aigner, cited above, \u00a7 35).",

In the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the alleged victim. Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see, for example, Aigner, cited above, \u00a7 35; A.S. v. , no. 40156/07, \u00a7 55, 28 September 2010; and S.N. v. , no. 34209/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2002V).",

Considering the need to take specific measures for the purpose of protecting victims in criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences, particularly in cases involving minors, it can be concluded that in the present case there was a good reason for the non-attendance of E. and for her pre-trial statements to be admitted in evidence (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 120, and compare Aigner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39).",

During the preliminary investigation E. was interviewed on three occasions: on 12 and 13\u00a0December 2007 and on 14\u00a0February 2008. In the meantime, on 14\u00a0January 2008, she was examined by a psychiatrist and psychologist, according to whose expert opinion attending a court hearing would be harmful to her health. It appears that the investigating authorities considered that E. was not expected to be examined at a court hearing, because at the interview on 14 February 2008 she was told by an investigator that the interview was being recorded so that they would not have to talk again about what had happened. Furthermore, another psychiatric expert opinion as to whether it was possible to use remote examination of E. \u2013 the question which was answered in the negative by the expert \u2013 was obtained on 14\u00a0April 2008. Subsequently, the prosecution did not request that E. be summoned to the court as a prosecution witness.",

The Court observes in this context that on 31 January 2008, that is before the video-recorded interview with E. took place, the applicant requested that a confrontation be held between him and E. He reiterated this request on 20 February 2008 (compare and contrast D.T. v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15, where the applicant only appears to have requested the examination of the presumed victim before the court of appeal). While it is true that it was for the investigating authorities to decide on the use of investigative measures, it is noteworthy that they did not address the applicant\u2019s requests, let alone offer any alternatives less disturbing for the victim, such as allowing the applicant\u2019s counsel to take part in the interview, or giving the defence an opportunity to indirectly put questions to E. (see, for example, A.G. v. Sweden (dec.), no.\u00a0315/09, 10 January 2012, where the applicant\u2019s defence counsel was present in an adjoining room during a police interview of the presumed victim and posed questions to her via the police inspector interviewing her). The Court reiterates in this context that paragraph 1 of Article 6 taken together with paragraph 3 requires the Contracting States to take positive steps, in particular to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him. Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see A.S.\u00a0v.\u00a0Finland, cited above, \u00a7 53, and Sadak and Others v.  (no. 1), nos.\u00a029900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2001VIII).",

Therefore, it does not appear that the applicant can be reproached for not asking for a prosecution witness to be summoned. Moreover, at a later stage of the proceedings, after the video recording of E.\u2019s pre-trial interview had been watched at the hearing, the applicant did ask for E. to be examined in court. The courts rejected this request on the merits. Thus, the Court considers that the courts\u2019 attention was sufficiently drawn to the handicaps under which the defence was labouring, and were, in principle, afforded an opportunity to remedy the situation.",

The Court considers, however, that for these very reasons it would have been essential to give the defence an opportunity to have questions put to the victim during the preliminary investigation. Moreover, as regards the possible lack of consistency in the statements of a witness, the Court considers that one of the purposes of putting questions to a witness is to test the witness testimony in order to reveal any inconsistencies \u2013 something the defence was prevented from effectively doing in the present case.",

As regards the experts, the Court notes that, unlike in the case of D.T. v. the Netherlands, in the present case the psychological and psychiatric experts who examined the child did not give an opinion on the truthfulness of her video-recorded testimony, and their opinions were given in writing without them being questioned at the court hearing. The Court also notes that the other forensic expert examinations (concerning DNA and E.\u2019s internal examination) yielded no conclusive evidence against the applicant.",

Furthermore, playing the video recording of the victim\u2019s statements at the court hearing allowed the trial court, as well as the applicant, to observe the manner in which the interview had been conducted, to assess E.\u2019s demeanour, and also to assess, at least to a certain degree, the credibility of her account. However, having regard to the importance of E.\u2019s testimony, the Court considers that the above was insufficient to secure the applicant\u2019s rights of defence (compare, for example, A.S. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66; A.L. v. Finland, no.\u00a023220/04, \u00a7 41, 27 January 2009; and F. and M. v. , no.\u00a022508/02, \u00a7 60, 17 July 2007). It remains a fact that the applicant was never given an opportunity to have questions put to the victim, despite the fact that the investigating authorities were preparing to proceed without E. being summoned to court (compare and contrast, for example, B. v. , no. 17122/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04445, 24 April 2007, and S.N. v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a049, where the defence either did not avail itself of the opportunity to have questions put to the witnesses or consented not to be present at the interview conducted during the pre-trial investigation). The Court notes that there was no strong corroborative evidence supporting E.\u2019s statements in the present case (compare Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 165). It also considers that weighing, on the one hand, the applicant\u2019s defence rights \u2013 regard also being had to the substantial prison sentence he faced \u2013 and, on the other hand, the limited impact on E. of the applicant\u2019s questions put to her in addition to the questions that the investigators had anyway put to her during the preliminary investigation, the Court is unable to see that if the investigating authorities had paid due attention to the applicant\u2019s defence rights there would have been any significant additional damage to the child. The Court once more emphasises in this context that the above is not to be understood that the authorities were obliged to carry out a confrontation between E. and the applicant or to ensure E.\u2019s cross-examination at a court hearing. Rather, what is at issue in a case like the present one is whether it was possible to put questions to the witness, for example through the defendant\u2019s lawyer, police investigator or psychologist in an environment under the control of the investigating authorities and in a manner that would not need to substantially differ from the interview which was in any event carried out by these authorities.",

The approach chosen by the majority in Vronchenko seems to be inconsistent with previous case-law. It is true that the judgment sets out an accurate description of the relevant case-law, with an emphasis on the body of principles developed by the Grand Chamber in the case of AlKhawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 26766/05 and\u00a022228/06, ECHR 2011). It is noteworthy, however, that most of the cases relating to criminal proceedings resulting from sexual offences against minors, highlighted in the judgment, pre-date the Grand Chamber case.",

In the very recent case of  ((dec.), no.\u00a025307/10, 2 April 2013), a Chamber of the Third Section found that, although the applicant had been unable to put questions to the victim and although the victim\u2019s evidence had been decisive for the finding of guilt, there had been sufficient counterbalancing measures present to ensure that the applicant had a fair trial.

The applicant, charged with sexual abuse of his nine-year-old stepdaughter E., complained that he had not had a fair trial since he could not put questions to the victim, on whose testimony during the pre-trial proceedings his conviction had mainly been based. As the Court notes, however, E. was interviewed three times during the preliminary investigation. On 12 and on 13 December 2007 she was interviewed by a police investigator in the presence of a psychologist and a social worker respectively. On 14 January 2008 the stepdaughter was again interviewed by two police investigators in the presence of a social worker. This interview was video recorded. On the same day she was further examined by a psychiatrist and psychologist, who gave an expert opinion according to which attending a court hearing would cause her psychological trauma and damage her health, and in a stressful situation her statements might not be consistent. Reference was also made to E.\u2019s young age, personality type and emotional state, and to her medical history and more particularly the fact that she had been diagnosed with epilepsy.",

Although the Convention in question has not been ratified by Estonia, the national authorities acted in conformity with the essence of Articles 35 (Interviews with the child) and 36 (Criminal court proceedings) of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (for the text see paragraph 41 of the judgment). It is also to be noted that the protection to be afforded to the victim in this case was of particular importance given the fact that the stepdaughter was not supported by her mother.",

Moreover, the video was made available to the defence, which had the possibility to bring up any issues regarding the credibility of E\u2019s statement. The County Court also heard several witnesses concerning the events in question, including A.K. (a psychologist who worked at the school attended by E.), G.I. (a teacher) and T.S. (a psychologist at a children\u2019s refuge), M.M. from the child protection service and K.G., who had carried out an internal examination of E.

With regard to the complaint that the defence had had no opportunity to put questions to E., the Court of Appeal noted that: \u201cDuring the preliminary investigation, when the [applicant] was interviewed as a suspect, he was presented and familiarised with the written record of victim [E.\u2019s] interview. Neither the accused nor his lawyer made any requests ... In the indictment drawn up by the prosecutor and sent to the lawyer, the accused and the court a list of persons called to the court by the prosecutor was set out; the victim [E.] who was a minor, was not named ... Nor was [E.] named in the list [of witnesses called by the lawyer and the accused] ...\u201d (emphasis added). Looking at the background to the careful scrutiny of the evidence by the Court of Appeal, and viewing the fairness of the proceedings as a whole, we believe that the counterbalancing measures taken were sufficient and that the applicant was afforded the protection of his rights safeguarded by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d).",
