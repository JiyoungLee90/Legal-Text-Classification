The Court takes note of the seriousness of the offence attributed to the applicant and the severity of the possible punishment. However, it reiterates that the issue of whether a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in the abstract. Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a0110, ECHR\u00a02000-XI). In the instant case, the Court notes the lack of such reasoning in the domestic court's decisions to prolong the applicant's remand in custody and stresses that, even after the applicant's escape and re-incarceration in 1997, no mention was made of the risk of him absconding again. In the Court's view, although, in general, the expression \u201cthe state of the evidence\u201d may be a relevant factor for the existence and persistence of serious indications of guilt, in the present case it nevertheless, alone, cannot justify the length of the detention of which the applicant complains (see Letellier v. France, judgment of 26\u00a0June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 43; Tomasi v. France, judgment of 27\u00a0August 1992, Series A no. 241-A; Mansur v.
