It recalls that the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as an extended delay in enforcement (see Gizzatova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 5124/03, \u00a7\u00a028, 13 January 2005; Metaxas v. , no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 27 May 2004). In this respect, the Court observes that the applicant did not substantiate his claim in respect of pecuniary damage. At the same time, the Government indicated the sum of RUR 3,026.24 as an appropriate adjustment of the judgment debt with the view to the period of non-enforcement. Having regard to the materials in its possession and the fact that the domestic authorities are better placed and equipped for assessment and application of a method of calculation of inflation losses, the Court awards the applicant RUR 3,026 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",
