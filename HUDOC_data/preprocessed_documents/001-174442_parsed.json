One such principle established in the case-law is that detention will be \u201carbitrary\u201d where, despite complying with the letter of domestic law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see, for example, Bozano v.\u00a0France, p.\u00a023 \u00a7 54 18\u00a0December 1986, Series A no. 111, and \u010conka v.

In considering any such challenge, the domestic courts were required to consider the reasonableness of each individual period of detention based entirely on the particular circumstances of that case, applying a test similar to \u2013 indeed, modelled on \u2013 that required by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) in the context of \u201carbitrariness\u201d \u2013 the Hardial Singh test (see paragraph 44 above).",

As noted above, the applicant was assessed as suitable for immigration detention under the relevant policies. The Court notes that when reviewing those decisions, the domestic courts took into account the fact that in November 2010 the applicant\u2019s mental health was assessed under the Mental Health Act and he was found to be unsuitable for detention under that Act (as a mental health patient) and not to require compulsory mental health treatment. The applicant has not provided any reasons which would make it appropriate for this Court now to find that the domestic authorities should have come to different conclusions.",

First, it observes that pursuant to the Secretary of State\u2019s published policy on immigration detention, \u201cwherever possible, alternatives to detention should be used\u201d (see V.M., cited above, \u00a7 95). The domestic courts concluded that he was detained lawfully under that provision, taking into account the fact that the applicant was a repeat offender who had failed to comply with the conditions of his stay and previously absconded, and did not have close ties in the United Kingdom which might mitigate the risk of him absconding again. Similar conclusions can be found in the decisions rejecting the applicant\u2019s bail application (see paragraph 19 above). The applicant withdrew a later bail application in November 2010 (see paragraph\u00a028 above). Secondly, the Court notes that limited \u2013 if any \u2013 alternatives to detention were available in the present case. Reporting requirements were generally not considered to be an effective safeguard against a risk of absconding, and electronic tagging was not recommended (see V.M., cited above, \u00a7\u00a095).",

In this connection, the Court notes that when the medical evidence in question was not submitted, the Secretary of State imposed a deadline of 31 August 2010 on the applicant\u2019s representatives to provide it. Moreover, that deadline was not met, and it appears that the medical evidence was initially submitted on 22\u00a0November 2010 but then withdrawn and a new and apparently definitive medical report submitted on 18 January 2011 (see paragraphs 25, 29, and 31 above).

Moreover, for the period of just over four months after the deadline for that expert report expired and until the final report was ultimately provided, the Court considers there was a heightened need for the government to process and, ultimately, decide the claim diligently and speedily given the amount of time that the applicant had already been in detention (see J.N., cited above, \u00a7 105).",

Malta, no. 24340/08, \u00a7 71, 27\u00a0July 2010). Accordingly, in the context of the present case, the Court considers that the necessity to ensure the effectiveness of the available procedural safeguards meant that there was a particular need for the authorities to act with appropriate due diligence in managing the decision making process and following up the deadline ultimately imposed. The Court has already highlighted the difficult balance that the Government was faced with in the circumstances but it notes that by failing to ensure a timeous decision in the applicant\u2019s asylum claim, the domestic authorities also prevented the applicant from challenging that decision sooner before the asylum and immigration tribunals. In this respect, the Court recalls that those tribunals would have been able to examine his asylum claim fully on the merits including any supporting evidence he wished to submit at that stage.",

However, as the Government accepted in their submissions, making reference to the Magna Carta 1215 and the Bill of Rights 1688, the right to liberty is of ancient origin and, even as a matter of domestic law, the burden is on the person who has detained another person to show that he had lawful authority to detain. Therefore it was clear that even if the applicant\u2019s actions were contradictory, the responsibility lay with the Secretary of State to ensure that the detention was (and remained) lawful. In this connection the Court recalls that the applicant was vulnerable and detained for over two and a half years in the context of a legal framework that did not impose time limits on his immigration detention.

Moreover, that failure occurred largely because the authorities were allowing the applicant time to make the fullest possible asylum claim, and there is nothing to indicate that they would not have decided his claim sooner and ended his immigration detention sooner, had he produced that evidence earlier as requested. The Court also notes in this connection that the applicant withdrew an application for bail (see paragraph 77 above), thereby depriving the domestic courts of the possibility to consider his release during the relevant period.",
