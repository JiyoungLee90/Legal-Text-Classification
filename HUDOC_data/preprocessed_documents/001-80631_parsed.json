In view of this, on 12 April 1996 the Bulgarian Ministry of Justice sent a letter rogatory to the Russian authorities, asking them to serve a copy of the petition on the two defendants. It seems that the letter rogatory was executed in respect of one of the defendants on an unspecified date prior to November 1998. However, it remained unexecuted in respect of the other defendant. Between 1996 and 1999 the Bulgarian Ministry of Justice sent nine reminders to the Russian authorities and twice asked the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for assistance.

There was also a gap of almost six years between the time when the applicant lodged his petition for review (11 April 1995) and the time when the Supreme Court of Cassation held a hearing (28 February 2001). This delay was exclusively due to problems with the serving of copies of the petition for review and the summoning of two defendants residing in . It is true that the Bulgarian authorities, who did not remain idle and several times urged the Russian authorities to execute the letter rogatory (see paragraph 15 above), cannot be held accountable for the latter's failure to do so (see W\u0142och v. , no. 27785/95, \u00a7\u00a7 14951, ECHR 2000XI). However, the Court cannot overlook the facts that because of this problem the proceedings grinded to a halt for almost six years (see, mutatis mutandis, Ikanga v. , no. 32675/96, \u00a7 20 in fine, 2 August 2000) and that the Bulgarian courts were not powerless in the face of this apparent deadlock. These courts could have \u2013 and, indeed, apparently eventually did \u2013 applied Article 44 of the CCP and deemed that the defendants who were no longer legally represented and had left Bulgaria without specifying a domestic address for the service of process were duly served by the putting of the process in the case file (see paragraphs 17, 18, 20 and 26 above). The Court sees no reason why this was not done earlier. In particular, there is no indication that the application of Article 44 of the CCP was deferred because of the failure of the domestic courts to warn, as required by paragraph 2 of that provision, the defendants of the consequences of their not having supplied an address for the service of process in Bulgaria. The Court accordingly concludes that the resulting delay was, at least in part, attributable to the authorities.",

It follows that Article 13 is applicable. It notes that in several cases (see Djangozov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, \u00a7 51, 8 July 2004, Rachevi v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a047877/99, \u00a7 65, 23 September 2004; and Dimitrov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a047829/99, \u00a7 77, 23 September 2004) it found that until July 1999 \u2013 more than seven years after the commencement of the proceedings at issue \u2013 Bulgarian law did not provide any remedies against the excessive length of civil proceedings. The Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether a \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d under Article 217a of the CCP, enacted in July 1999 (see paragraph 27 above), is an effective remedy in principle. Even assuming that it is one \u2013 which is quite doubtful in the particular circumstances of the present case \u2013, any decision given under this provision that might have speeded up the examination of the case could not have made up for the delays which had occurred prior to its introduction and had already had a significant impact on the overall duration of the proceedings (see Djangozov, \u00a7 52; Rachevi, \u00a7 67; and Dimitrov, \u00a7 78, all cited above). The Court also notes that under Bulgarian law there exists no possibility to obtain compensation for excessively lengthy civil proceedings (see Djangozov, \u00a7 58; Rachevi, \u00a7 103; and Dimitrov, \u00a7 82, all cited above). The Government's averment that the applicant could have filed a tort action and be awarded such compensation was not supported by any example of a litigant having successfully mounted such proceedings (see Rachevi, cited above, \u00a7 64).",
