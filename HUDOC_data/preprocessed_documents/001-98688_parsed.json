The nature of the ongoing or recent occupation of a particular property is usually the most significant element in the determination of the existence of a \u201chome\u201d in cases before this Court. However, where \u201chome\u201d is claimed in respect of property in which there has never been any, or hardly any, occupation by the applicant or where there has been no occupation for some considerable time, it may be that the links to that property are so attenuated as to cease to raise any, or any separate, issue under Article 8. Furthermore, while an applicant does not necessarily have to be the owner of the \u201chome\u201d for the purposes of Article 8, it may nonetheless be relevant in such cases of claims to \u201chomes\u201d from the past that he or she can make no claim to any legal rights of occupation or that such time has elapsed that there can be no realistic expectation of taking up, or resuming, occupation in the absence of such rights. Nor can the term \u201chome\u201d be interpreted as synonymous with the notion of \u201cfamily roots\u201d, which is a vague and emotive concept (see Demopoulos and Others, cited above, \u00a7 135).",

For almost her entire life, the applicant has been living elsewhere. The fact that she might inherit a share in the title of that property in the future is a hypothetical and speculative element, not a concrete tie in existence at this moment in time.

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 42, Reports 1996-III).",

The Court therefore concluded that when, as in the Foka case, an act of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities was in compliance with laws in force within the territory of northern , it should in principle be regarded as having a legal basis in domestic law for the purposes of the Convention. It does not see any reason to depart, in the instant case, from that finding, which is not in any way inconsistent with the view adopted by the international community regarding the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d or the fact that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus remains the sole legitimate government of Cyprus (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 61 and 90).",

Taking part in an unlawful assembly is an offence under section 71 of the Cypriot Criminal Code and is punishable by up to one year\u2019s imprisonment (see paragraph 28 above).

The Court further notes that according to Chapter 155, section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a police officer may, without warrant, arrest any person who commits in his presence any offence punishable with imprisonment or who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty (see paragraph 31 above \u2013 see also Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 61, and Chrysostomos and Papachrysostomou, Commission\u2019s report, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0147).",

Moreover, an interpreter was present during the court hearing on 22 July 1989 and the statement made by the applicant at the trial (see paragraph\u00a026 (v) above) indicates that she understood that she was accused of having illegally crossed a border. The Court therefore finds that the reasons for the applicant\u2019s arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview and during the court\u2019s hearings (see, mutatis mutandis, Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 65).",

In this respect, the Court notes that it does not have at its disposal any element capable of casting doubt upon the statements given by some witnesses at trial according to which the area where the accused had entered was \u201cTRNC\u201d territory (see paragraph 26 (iii) above). In the Court\u2019s view, the intervention of the Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces was not due to the political nature of the demonstration but was provoked by its violent character and by the violation of the \u201cTRNC\u201d borders by some of the demonstrators (see Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 110).",

As she had been put on show before a tribunal which had ignored the most basic concepts of justice, the applicant had to be considered to have been absolved from the obligation to try any domestic remedy. It would be wholly unrealistic to suggest that she should have stayed in northern  in order to engage in a legal struggle. In any event, as far as the reference made by  to existing domestic remedies in the \u201cTRNC\u201d could be interpreted as an objection of inadmissibility for non-exhaustion, this objection had been raised after the application was declared admissible.",
