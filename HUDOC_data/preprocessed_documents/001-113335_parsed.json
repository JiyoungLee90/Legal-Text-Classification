Indeed, this Court has handled many cases in which\u00a0the underlying facts\u00a0reflected corruption on the part of underpaid Government authorities. I can accept that the Trade Union of the Police wished to\u00a0convey the following message: if the Government fails to provide police personnel with an adequate living standard, and if the police continue to perceive themselves as underpaid, then there is a real danger that ultimately\u00a0some policemen may be susceptible to offers of additional or alternative income.
