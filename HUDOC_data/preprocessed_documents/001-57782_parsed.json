Germany judgments of 29 May 1986 (Series A no. 99, p. 13, para. 29, and no. 100, p. 23, para. 63) the Court found that there existed great diversity in the legislation and case-law of the member States of the Council of Europe as regards the juridical nature of the entitlement to insurance benefits under social security schemes. It accordingly concluded that there was no common standard pointing to a uniform European notion in this regard.",

Firstly, the right claimed was not of a personal and pecuniary nature, as the service relationship between the State and Mr Francesco Lombardo had been of a public law nature. Nor was it connected with a contract of employment, as the appointment of a public servant originated in a unilateral act on the part of the authorities which was subject to special legislation. Moreover, the sickness insurance scheme which the applicant was covered by had no affinities with a private insurance scheme, since the  had assumed the responsibility of regulating its framework and overseeing its operation.",

In performing this obligation the State is not using discretionary powers and may be compared, in this respect, with an employer who is a party to a contract of employment governed by private law. Consequently, the right of a carabiniere to receive an \"enhanced ordinary pension\" if he fulfils the necessary conditions of injury and disability is to be regarded as a \"civil right\" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), which is therefore applicable in the present case.",
