Thus, the strict approach taken by the law, and by the public authorities in its application, served to prevent disorder and to protect morals in society at large. In addition, the Government submitted that this restrictive approach was also important in order to prevent conflicts on the subject arising amongst relatives. Moreover, cemeteries and burial places should not be regarded as temporary repositories for the deceased\u2019s remains or ashes. In other words, it could be said that what was at stake was the right of the living to be assured that, after death, their remains would be treated with respect.
