France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III). Thus, in principle, where domestic proceedings include an admission of the breach by the national authorities and the payment of a sum of money amounting to redress, the dual requirements established in Amuur are satisfied and the applicant can no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention (see Rechachi and Abdelhafid v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 55554/00, 10 June 2003). The Court also notes that, as a general rule, an acquitted defendant or a person against whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued cannot claim to be a victim of violations of the Convention which, according to him, took place in the course of proceedings against him (see Osmanov and Husseinov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 54178/00, 4 September 2003). However, this conclusion can only be drawn where the applicant is no longer affected at all by the proceedings in question, having been relieved of any effects to his disadvantage (see Correia de Matos v.

The Court finds that these considerations hold true in the circumstances of the present case, since the events at issue had taken place several years before, and it is clear that these statements are not based on any objective data. Furthermore, the Government were requested to provide data in respect of each day of the applicant's detention in IZ-71/1, whereas the certificates merely stated that the applicant had been provided with an individual sleeping place. The Court finds that in the circumstances of the case and given the lack of any original prison documentation, such an answer is too vague and unspecific to enable the Court to make a firm finding regarding the alleged lack of overcrowding in the facility in question. Thus, the Court takes note of these certificates, but it finds no objective reason to attach greater weight to them than to the statements made by the persons referred to by the applicant. Overall, the Court finds that the Government have not accounted properly for their failure to submit detailed information supported by copies of the original prison documentation, with the result that the Court may draw inferences from their conduct.",
