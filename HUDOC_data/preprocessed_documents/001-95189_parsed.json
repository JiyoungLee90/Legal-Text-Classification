However, the second report, drafted the next day, mentions one old bruise on the applicant\u2019s back. The Court finds not only that there is a discrepancy between these reports but also that they both lack detail and fall significantly short of the standards recommended by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), which are regularly taken into account by the Court in its examination of cases concerning ill-treatment (see, inter alia, Akko\u00e7 v.

The Court, having examined the scarce documentation contained in the case file, considers that there were serious shortcomings in the way the investigation was conducted by the prosecutor, which had repercussions on its effectiveness. Firstly, in the course of the investigation, it appears that the prosecutor never sought to obtain evidence from the applicant or the accused police officers. Secondly, the Court notes that there was no serious attempt on the part of the prosecutor to elucidate the identities of the accused police officers. In this connection, it appears that the applicant was never requested to identify the alleged perpetrators either by checking police photographs or through an identification parade. Thirdly, the prosecutor also appears to have failed to secure the testimonies of potential eyewitnesses, such as other police officers on duty that day, the persons arrested or detained together with the applicant or others present at the police station on the day of the events. In the absence of conclusive medical evidence in the case file, these testimonies would, in the Court\u2019s opinion, have provided important information capable of casting light on the origins of the injuries. Finally, the prosecutor failed to undertake any measures, such as hearing evidence from the doctors who had examined the applicant, in order to clarify the apparent contradictions between the two medical reports drafted a day apart.",
