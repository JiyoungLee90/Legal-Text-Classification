The Court has held that all health professionals owe a fundamental duty of care to the people they are asked to examine or treat.

The Court thus regrets the superficial examinations carried out by the doctors, as demonstrated by the examination of ten people in only thirteen minutes (see paragraph 13 above), the failure to use the standard medical forms and the lack of full details of the examination. It considers that, as these examinations had taken place while the applicant was being held in police custody and immediately after his release, they could have provided crucial evidence capable of dispelling any doubts about the alleged ill-treatment inflicted upon the applicant.

This right presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case will seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained by coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh, \u00a7\u00a0100, and Kolu, \u00a7 51, both cited above).
