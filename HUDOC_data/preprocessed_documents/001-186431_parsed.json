The documentary was about the agreement between V. and the law-enforcement officials, and the subsequent murder of V. and B. The applicant was named as the person who had proposed the agreement and as B.\u2019s murderer. The programme comprised, in particular, short films, in which the roles of the applicant and the other persons concerned were played by professional actors. One of those short films depicted the applicant murdering B. Furthermore, there were numerous interviews given by the investigator in charge, as well as by several officials of the Security Service.

The only specific allegation made by the applicant in that context was that he had not been hospitalised, contrary to the doctor\u2019s recommendation of 6\u00a0December 2012 (see paragraphs 51 and 71 above). In the absence of access to the applicant\u2019s medical file, the Government were not in a position to comment on that allegation. Even assuming that, as alleged by the applicant, he had not been hospitalised, the Court notes that there was no indication of any particular urgency in respect of the recommended hospitalisation of the applicant. Nor was it disputed by the applicant that he had been receiving medications following his medical examination of 6 December 2012, and he did not argue that that medicinal treatment had been deficient. Nor did the applicant allege that the state of his blood pressure had not been monitored. Moreover, the Court notes that the applicant was released on 24 January 2013. He could have undergone a complete medical check-up upon his release and could have obtained a medical opinion as to the deterioration of his health in detention, if any, as well as the quality of medical care provided for him. However, as can be seen from the case-file material (see paragraph 55 above), the applicant applied for medical treatment only two and a half months after his release in respect of long-standing health concerns. It appears that he did not complain to doctors of any deficiencies in the medical care he had received while in detention. Lastly, the applicant failed to show how his diagnosis of Baker\u2019s cysts (which was established about half a year after his release) could have been caused by the treatment he had received from the authorities (see\u00a0paragraph 56 above).",
