The case originated in an application (no. 42868/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Paweł Marzec (“the applicant”), on 17 October 2006.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Jakub Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged that his detention on remand exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.
On 10 October 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in . He is currently detained in Włocławek Prison.
On 29 September 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking, committed while acting in an organised criminal gang.
On 1 October 2003 the Bytom District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might induce witnesses to give false testimony. The court pointed out that other persons involved in the crime were still at large. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence.
Later, several other members of the same criminal gang were detained and charged in connection with the investigation against the applicant.
The applicant's appeal against the detention order, like his further appeals against decisions prolonging his detention and all his subsequent numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful. In his applications and appeal, he argued that the authorities had failed to justify his continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons. He stressed that the measure complained of should be imposed only at the initial stage of the proceedings and that his continued detention constituted in practice deprivation of liberty. He also relied on his personal circumstances, in particular on the difficult financial situation of his family.
In the course of the investigation, the applicant's detention was prolonged on 3 December 2003, 8 March 2004, 3 June 2004 and 22 September 2004. In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant's detention.
On 22 December 2004 a bill of indictment was lodged with the Katowice District Court. The applicant was charged with drug trafficking, illegal arms trading, unlawful possession of a firearm and acting in an organised criminal gang. There were fifteen defendants in the case, all charged with numerous counts of drug trafficking committed in an organised criminal gang.
On 25 August 2005 the trial court held the first hearing. It subsequently held some sixty-one hearings in the case.
During the court proceedings the authorities further prolonged the applicant's detention (on 30 December 2004, 17 March 2005, 14 June 2005, 24 August 2005, 8 March 2006, 17 August 2006, 20 December 2006 and 23 March 2007). The courts repeated the grounds previously given for his continued detention.
On 15 May 2007 the Katowice District Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted of drug trafficking, unlawful possession of a firearm and acting in an organised criminal gang and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment.
The applicant appealed against that judgment.
On 7 May 2008 the  heard the applicant's appeal. It partly quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case in respect of the charges concerning drug trafficking and acting in an organised criminal gang. The court upheld the first-instance judgment in respect of the charge concerning unlawful possession of a firearm for which the applicant had been sentenced to three years' imprisonment. It held that the applicant's detention from 29 September 2003 to 29 September 2006 should be counted towards his sentence.
The retrial started on 13 June 2008. On 30 June 2008 the  ordered that the applicant's detention should continue until 15 January 2009.
In the retrial proceedings the applicant made numerous unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against the decision of 30 June 2008 prolonging his detention.
The applicant was released on 17 February 2009. The  prohibited him from leaving the country and placed him under police supervision. The proceedings are currently pending before the .
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its prolongation, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court's judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006.
On 6 June 2007 the Committee of Ministers adopted on the Interim Resolution concerning the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in 44 cases against Poland relating to the excessive length of detention on remand (“the 2007 Resolution”). Noting that the number of cases in which the  had found similar violations was constantly increasing. It concluded that the number of the Court's judgments finding  in violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention revealed a structural problem. A more detailed rendition of the 2007 Resolution can be found in the Court's judgment given in the case of Kauczor v. Poland (see Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, § 34, 3 February 2009; not final).
On 20 June 2007 the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights released the Memorandum to the Polish Government concerning, among other issues, the use of the detention measure in , stressing that examples of cases lodged with the Court where pre-trial detention had lasted between 4 to 6 years were not uncommon. The Commissioner urged the Polish authorities to review the application and functioning of pre-trial detention in Polish law. A more detailed rendition of the relevant parts of the memorandum can be found in the above mentioned Kauczor judgment (§ 35).
