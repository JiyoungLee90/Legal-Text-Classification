It reasoned that the impugned news items had not mentioned the claimant directly: the \u201cLyubimyy Sad\u201d brand had not been in JSC RMK\u2019s exclusive use and the drinks marketed under it had also been produced by another legal entity operating in Vladivostok. The Moscow Court rejected the claimant\u2019s argument that the letter from the FCPS faxed to Regnum could not be considered a \u201creply to a request for information\u201d within the meaning of section 57(3) of the Media Act because it had not been a response to a formal request and it had been signed by Mr\u00a0K., not by Ms G. who had been mentioned in the news item of 23\u00a0November 2005 as the source of information. It found that the disseminated information had originated from the FCPS, a State agency, and thus had fallen under the exception provided for by section 57(3) of the Media Act exempting a media outlet or journalist from responsibility. Assessing the whole series of the news items published on the website between 21 November and 8 December 2005, the Moscow Court found \u201cno grave abuse by a media outlet of the right to disseminate information\u201d. It noted that the defendant had reported on 8 December 2005 that no mercury had been found in the seized drinks and thus had de facto \u201crefuted the fact of mercury detection reported earlier\u201d. The Moscow Court further noted that the removal of the news items from the website sought by the claimant could not be applied as a sanction in a defamation case under Article 152 of the Civil Code in view of a lack of legal basis. It also considered the claimant\u2019s demand for an apology groundless in view of the lack of legal basis and held that to rule otherwise would violate Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Russian Constitution guaranteeing that no one may be forced to reject his or her views and convictions.",

The editorial board of a media outlet, or its editor-in-chief, or a journalist bore no responsibility for the dissemination of untruthful statements tarnishing the honour and dignity of citizens and organisations, or harming the health and/or development of children, or representing an abuse of the freedom of mass information and/or the rights of a journalist, in particular, where such statements had formed part of the response [by State authorities] to a request for information or of the materials of press services of State authorities, organisations, institutions, enterprises, and bodies of public associations (section 57(3)) or if such information is a verbatim reproduction of official statements by officials of State bodies, organisations or public associations (section 57 (4)).",

Where untruthful tarnishing statements have been disseminated through an Internet website registered as a media outlet in accordance with the law, the domestic courts should examine defamation claims arising from such statements in accordance with the legal norms governing media outlets. Resolution no. 3 (section 9) requires courts hearing defamation claims to distinguish between statements of fact, which can be checked for their veracity, and value judgments, opinions and convictions, which are not actionable under Article 152 of the Civil Code since they are an expression of the defendant\u2019s subjective opinion and views, and cannot be checked for their veracity.",

It is subject to exceptions, which must be construed strictly, and the need for which must be established convincingly. The adjective \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 implies the existence of a \u201cpressing social need\u201d. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, which goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a \u201crestriction\u201d is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The Court\u2019s task is not to take the place of the competent national authorities, but to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This supervision is not limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith. The Court has to consider the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\u201d and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (for further details and references see Morice, cited above, \u00a7 124; B\u00e9dat v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, \u00a7 48, 29 March 2016; and Med\u017elis Islamske Zajednice Br\u010dko and Others v.

The nature and severity of the sanctions imposed are among the factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference.

In doing so, it acknowledged that, in the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public\u2019s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. At the same time, the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms, particularly the right to respect for private life, is certainly higher than that posed by the press (ibid., \u00a7133; see also Arnarson v.

The lower commercial courts dismissed the claims, but the highest commercial court hearing a cassation appeal brought by the claimant, the Federal Commercial Court of the Moscow Circuit (the \u201cCircuit Court\u201d), found against the applicant company and ordered it to pay the claimant an award of 1,000,000 roubles (28,428 euros) in compensation for nonpecuniary damage (see paragraph 32 of the judgment).",

Russia (no. 69575/10, 7 July 2020, not yet final), I have proposed in my dissenting opinion (\u00a7\u00a7 6-15) a method for resolving a conflict between a right under Article 10 and a right under Article 8, by first determining the damage or impairment that each right will potentially sustain in the conflict, and, then, by weighing in the balance the damage that each of the two rights would potentially suffer. I suggested that a victim-centred test would in essence be the same as a damage-centred test. I based my proposal on a harmonious blending of the principle of effectiveness with the principle of proportionality (see \u00a7\u00a7 9-10 of the said opinion). After finishing my opinion in Rashkin and while writing this opinion, I discovered that the use of the \u201cimpact criterion\u201d, with nuances between different authors, in resolving a conflict of rights has received considerable academic support (see, for instance, Stijn Smet, \u201cConflict Between Human Rights and ECtHR \u2013 Towards a Structural Balancing Test\u201d, in Stijn Smet and Eva Brems (eds), When Human Rights Clash at the European Court of Human Rights \u2013 Conflict or Harmony?, Oxford, 2017, 38, at p. 46 et seq., where reference is made to Robert Alexy\u2019s treatise, namely, A Theory of Constitutional Rights, Oxford, 2002, at pp. 44-48; Stijn Smet, Resolving Conflicts Between Human Rights \u2013 The Judge\u2019s Dilemma, London-New York, 2017, at pp. 144, 152-162; and Aharon Barak, Proportionality: Constitutional Rights and their Limitations, Cambridge, 2012, at p. 89 et seq.).",

In my view, the conflict of rights is in most cases resolved since only the core or very essence of one of the rights will be affected by the conflict and here the principle of effectiveness intervenes as a norm to assist in ascertaining whether and when the core of the right is affected.",

My difference in relation to the judgment is basically threefold: (a) the judgment does not follow my damage-based approach; (b) I am using the four criteria/considerations that the judgment uses with the focus on determining the extent of damage that each of the two conflicting rights would suffer if the other were to prevail; and (c) unlike the judgment, I always keep clear in my mind that the only conflict that has to be resolved is that between the two competing rights. Regarding (c) above, the following example may be given to explain what I mean. In paragraph 79 of the judgment it is stated that \u201cthe Circuit Court, finding for the claimant, did not advance any arguments as to why it had accorded more weight to the reputational interest of a commercial company than to the interest of the general public to be informed of such a serious matter as an instance of mercury poisoning through commercially distributed foods\u201d. However, in my humble opinion, the \u201cpublic interest\u201d criterion should not be used, or be perceived to be used, as a right in itself to be weighed against the claimant\u2019s right to the protection of private life under Article 8. There are not three rights to be weighed in the balance in the present case, but only two rights, namely, that of the applicant under Article 10 and that of the claimant under Article 8. In my view, the interest of the public to be informed is an element or criterion which concerns mainly the individual right to freedom of expression, because this is the means through which the public can be informed, for example, about a potential health hazard. In the present case, one can say that informing the public about such a hazard was the object and the main purpose of the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right. Thus, to prevent a right from being exercised and from fulfilling its object and main purpose would affect its very core or essence. It is to be noted here that the applicant relied on information gathered from official sources (see paragraph 72).",

In my humble view, the examination of the relevant criteria in making a fair balance test (see paragraphs 67-79) does not itself serve to resolve a conflict of rights if ultimately there is: (a) no determination or finding of the extent of damage that each right will suffer from the conflict (if the other right is to prevail), and (b) no weighing up of the two rights as regards the potential damage caused to each one. I respectfully highlight that these are omissions in the present judgment, as in that of the Circuit Court at domestic level. Neither judgment has carried out a full or appropriate balancing exercise. A fair balance test, however, by its very nature, can never be partial or lacking in some important elements. It is a process involving different steps or phases, which can either be fulfilled or not (see \u00a7\u00a06 of the joint concurring opinion of Judges El\u00f3segui and Serghides in Nadtoka v. Russia (no. 2), no.\u00a029097/08, 8 October 2019).
