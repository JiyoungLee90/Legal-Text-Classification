Accordingly, the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of the alleged violation.

The time already served by the applicant was set off against the newly imposed sentence. In this respect the Court notes that in the earlier case of Yefimenko (Yefimenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 152/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-100, 12\u00a0February 2013), it found that the reopening of the case and the retrial could not be considered to constitute appropriate and sufficient redress, given that the applicant had spent a significant period serving a prison sentence imposed by \u201ca tribunal not established by law\u201d. Nor could the automatic deduction of the time already served from the newly imposed sentence be regarded as constituting such redress. Having examined the Government\u2019s arguments, the Court finds no reason to depart from that conclusion in the present case. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant can no longer claim to be a victim of the violation alleged.",

Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, \u00a7\u00a0123, ECHR 2013). It is satisfied, accordingly, that by challenging the lawfulness of his conviction before the supervisory review court, the applicant did bring his grievances to the attention of a competent domestic authority. The Court further notes that the supervisory review court considered the applicant\u2019s complaint on the merits. The court recognised that the applicant\u2019s conviction had been rendered by \u201ca tribunal not established by law\u201d, quashed it and remitted the case to the lower court for fresh examination. Accordingly, the Court accepts that the judgment of the Supreme Court of 15\u00a0June 2005 constitutes the final decision concerning the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s conviction in the first set of criminal proceedings against him.
