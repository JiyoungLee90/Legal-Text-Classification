Tan and Others 1983, [1983] 2 All England Law Reports 12). In two cases concerning social security legislation, male to female transsexuals were considered by the National Insurance Commissioner as males for the purposes of retirement age; in the first case the person in question had only received hormone therapy, in the second he had involuntarily begun to develop female secondary characteristics at the age of 46, which developments were followed by surgery and adoption of a female social role some 13 years later (cases R (P) 1 and R (P) 2 in the 1980 Volume of National Insurance Commissioner Decisions). Lastly, in a case before an Industrial Tribunal a female to male transsexual, who had not undergone any sex change treatment, was treated as a female by the Tribunal for the purposes of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975; the person in question had sought and received employment in a position reserved for men under the Factories Act, but was dismissed after discovery of her biological sex (White v. British Sugar Corporation Ltd. [1977] Industrial Relations Law Reports p. 121).",

The developments that have taken place in consequence of these studies have been largely promoted by experts in the medical and scientific fields who have drawn attention to the considerable problems experienced by the individuals concerned and found it possible to alleviate them by means of medical and surgical treatment. The term \"transsexual\" is usually applied to those who, whilst belonging physically to one sex, feel convinced that they belong to the other; they often seek to achieve a more integrated, unambiguous identity by undergoing medical treatment and surgical operations to adapt their physical characteristics to their psychological nature. Transsexuals who have been operated upon thus form a fairly well-defined and identifiable group.",

Such a system of annotation would, according to the applicant, be similar to that existing in the case of adoptions. The applicant and the Commission pointed to the example of certain other Contracting States which have recently made provision for the possibility of having the original indication of sex altered from a given date. The Commission additionally relied on the fact that the United Kingdom, through its free national health service, had borne the costs of the surgical operations and other medical treatment which the applicant had been enabled to undergo. They considered that this medical recognition of the necessity to assist him to realise his identity must be regarded as a further argument for the legal recognition of the change in his sexual identity; failure to do so had the effect that the applicant was treated as an ambiguous being.",

The annotation now being requested would, on the other hand, establish only that the person concerned henceforth belonged to the other sex. Furthermore, the change so recorded could not mean the acquisition of all the biological characteristics of the other sex.

In practice, though, it appears necessary to produce a birth certificate in connection with a number of formalities, such as applying for a passport for the first time or enrolling at university. This has resulted - and may again result - in the applicant\u2019s having to face distressing situations which amount to an interference with his private life and thus to a breach of Article 8 (art. 8). We are of the view that this could be avoided by means of an annotation in the birth register to the effect that there had been a change in Mr. Rees\u2019s sexual identity; at the same time, it could be made possible for the applicant to obtain a short certificate which would indicate only his new sexual identity and thus make it easier to safeguard the inviolability of his private life. We recognise, moreover, that in this sphere the State has a wide margin of appreciation as regards the method to be used in order to remedy the situation in question and we do not in any way rule out the possibility that other measures might achieve the same aim. It will be remembered, for instance, that on 5 October 1982 the Commission endorsed a friendly settlement between a group of applicants and Italy (application no. 9420/81) whereby as a result of an Act recently passed in Italy, the applicants can henceforth secure rectification of their civil status.",

It may be said against this argument that the annotation in question would also certainly have legal significance even if it was not expressly provided for in law, in that it would imply that in all situations where the apparent sex was decisive (work, retirement, etc.), Mr. Rees should be treated as an individual of the male sex.",
