In cases concerning deprivation of life, if no remedies are available or if they are judged to be ineffective, the six-month time-limit in principle runs from the date of the act complained of. Special considerations may apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period may be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of these circumstances (ibid; see also Hazar and others v.  (dec.), no.\u00a062566/00, 10\u00a0January 2002).",

A milestone in this regard was the Grand Chamber judgment in Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland (no. 30210/96, 26 October 2000, ECHR 2000-XI), in which the Court emancipated Article 13 from Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention by finding that \u201cthe requirements of Article 13 are to be seen as reinforcing those of Article 6 \u00a7 1, rather than being absorbed by the general obligation imposed by that Article\u201d (\u00a7 152). Although the right to an effective remedy and the right to a speedy procedure seem to be similar at first glance, the holding in Kud\u0142a is very much justified. Indeed, it is necessary to separate two matters: one is the right to a speedy procedure as such, and the second is the possibility to effectively challenge the State\u2019s failure to guarantee that right.",

In fact, the Court has rightly stressed the vital role of Article 13 in disappearance cases in its past case-law, including in the new leading case of El-Masri v. the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (no. 39630/09, [GC], 13 December 2012, \u00a7\u00a7 256 and 257). Precisely because of the pre-eminent importance of the possibility for the disappeared person\u2019s relatives to be able to effectively challenge the State\u2019s responsibility, the Court has frequently found an additional violation of Article\u00a013 in such cases (see, for example, Er and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a023016/04, 31 July 2012, \u00a7\u00a7 110\u2013113; Ipek v. Turkey, no. 25760/94, 17\u00a0February 2004, ECHR 2004-II (extracts), \u00a7 198; Togcu v. Turkey, no.\u00a027601/95, 31 May 2005, \u00a7\u00a7 137\u2013140; and Alikhadzhiyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a068007/01, 5 July 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 93 and 94). The Court\u2019s case-law, however, is not consistent in this regard (see, for example, Varnava and Others v.\u00a0, nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90..., [GC], 18 September 2009, \u00a7\u00a0211). Where no State responsibility has been established, the Court usually does not find it necessary to examine the merits of a complaint under Article 13 separately, and therefore does not find a breach of that provision (see Movsayevy v. Russia, no. 20303/07, 14 June 2011, \u00a7 107).",

Under Article 13, the applicants complained that they had not had an effective remedy by which they could obtain an investigation into the disappearances and seek compensation (\u00a7 73).

Though these cases did not concern disappearances, the similarity of the Kalinkin judgment with the Court\u2019s reasoning in Kud\u0142a v. Poland (cited above) is apparent. The Kalinkin judgment might indicate an emerging practice of the Court regarding the consideration of violations of Article\u00a013 for the purpose of determining non-pecuniary damages.",
