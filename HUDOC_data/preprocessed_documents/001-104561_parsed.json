The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child. In cases concerning the enforcement of decisions in the sphere of family law, the Court has repeatedly found that what is decisive is whether the national authorities have taken all necessary steps to facilitate the execution, in so far as can reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of each case (see, among other authorities, Hokkanen v.

However, notwithstanding the Centre\u2019s instructions, it emerges that the applicant continued\u00a0going to the premises of the local social care centre on Fridays as scheduled by the court access order, therefore missing four meetings in Belgrade, on account of her fear of meeting her daughter only in the presence of the respondent, and insisting on meeting her in Loznica.

Secondly, breaches should only be found where lengthy periods of inactivity that are clearly imputable to the State can be detected. Thirdly, the applicant has to show that he or she made some effort to have the allegedly delayed proceedings accelerated, thereby expressing an interest in having the proceedings conducted more speedily. Fourthly, the applicant has to show that he or she did not contribute significantly to the alleged delay by his or her own behaviour.",

One of the main factors causing delays in such proceedings are expert assessments and reports that need to be made in order to assess what is in the best interest of the child, but several such reports were produced within the framework of the present case. However, in this case the complexities were mostly of a procedural nature, as shortly after the main proceedings had been instituted, the parties requested interim measures for the award of a right of access and temporary custody respectively. The proceedings ended on 14 February 2007 with the order of the District Court in  giving limited access rights to the applicant. The respondent\u2019s request for interim custody was granted on 6\u00a0June 2007 by the District Court. In addition, issues concerning the enforcement of the interim access order arose (see paragraphs 47-65). Furthermore, the applicant initiated two additional sets of proceedings against the respondent, namely one for deprivation of his parental rights on 4 December 2006 and another one for an interim injunction against domestic violence on 11 September 2007. It would seem that these proceedings are still pending. Thus, in this case we have a complicated situation of various proceedings overlapping with each other, adding considerably to the overall complexity of the custody and maintenance proceedings and causing further delays.",

This assessment overlooks the fact that the applicant at the same time had initiated various other sets of proceedings against the respondent which, as stated above, unavoidably contributed to the overall delay. In addition, I note that, as stated in paragraph 34, the alleged behaviour of the applicant contributed to a delay in producing the necessary expert opinions, and that the applicant subsequently submitted objections to the expert reports. While this of course is the applicant\u2019s procedural right it unavoidably causes further delays (see paragraphs 40 and 41). Furthermore, I would add that a hearing scheduled for 8 July 2009 was adjourned because the applicant had appointed a lawyer who needed some time to study the case file (see paragraph 36). This same lawyer then asked for an adjournment of the hearing scheduled for 30 September 2009 (see paragraph 37). Later, the hearing scheduled for 11 November 2009 was adjourned because of the strike by the Bar Association, of which the applicant\u2019s lawyer was presumably a member. Thus, I believe the majority clearly underestimate the applicant\u2019s and her lawyer\u2019s contribution to the overall delay in the proceedings.",
