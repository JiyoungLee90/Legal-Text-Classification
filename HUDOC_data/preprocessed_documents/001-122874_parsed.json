The CD-ROM shows several phases of the demonstrations which took place in Diyarbak\u0131r on 29 March 2006, and contains images of the period before and after the launching of the tear-gas grenade which injured the applicant\u2019s head. It also shows that most of the demonstrators were teenagers, some of them with their faces covered, who were throwing stones. Moreover, it is clear that the event took place on a very busy boulevard. Some sequences show the applicant among the demonstrators, although it cannot be clearly ascertained that he was taking part in the demonstration. In the course of the events it can be seen that the applicant has been hit by a tear-gas grenade. Although it is impossible to make out exactly how the police officer fired the tear-gas grenade, it would appear from its impact that it was a direct, flat-trajectory shot (that is, it had been fired horizontally, or else at an angle of under 45o), rather than a high-angle shot (where the launcher is aimed as high as possible so that the tear-gas grenades explode in the air and break up before falling back to earth, thus preventing injuries to demonstrators in the event of an impact).",

In the Court\u2019s view, regardless of whether or not the applicant had been participating actively in the demonstration, such an approach would appear clearly insufficient in the light of the applicant\u2019s contention that he was directly hit on the nose by a grenade, especially since the event took place on a boulevard with many passers-by (see paragraph 22 above), who thus risked becoming the potential targets of such a launch.",

The Government ought to have conducted the requisite investigations to ascertain how the grenade had been shot, preferably with the help of an expert. Since the Government have failed to produce evidence to refute the applicant\u2019s contentions, the Court accepts that the shot was direct and followed a flat trajectory. In the Court\u2019s view, firing a tear-gas grenade along a direct, flat trajectory by means of a launcher cannot be regarded as an appropriate police action as it could potentially cause serious, or indeed fatal injuries, whereas a high-angle shot would generally constitute the appropriate approach, since it prevents people from being injured or killed in the event of an impact.",
