They explained that a decision had been taken at the Cabinet of Ministers\u2019 meeting of 2\u00a0February 2005 to remedy the applicant\u2019s complaint directly by offering her a permanent residence permit. In view of these measures, the Government considered that the matter giving rise to the case had been resolved and the application should be struck out of the Court\u2019s list of cases in accordance with Article 37 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention. In that connection, the Government referred in particular to the cases of Pan\u010denko v.  (dec.), no. 40772/98, 28 October 1999, and Mikheyeva v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a050029/99, 12 September 2002, in which the Court had held that the regularisation of the applicants\u2019 stay sufficed for them no longer to be able to claim to be victims of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",

It is true that, in its judgment in Pisano v.\u00a0Italy ([GC] (striking out), no. 36732/97, 24 October 2002), the Court examined this question separately from the question of the application of Article 37 \u00a7 1 (b), ruling that the applicant could continue to claim the status of \u201cvictim\u201d, while going on to decide that the matter had been resolved (loc. cit., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03839). However, the present application concerns the removal of a foreign national and her illegal residence within the national territory; in cases of this type, where the applicant\u2019s stay was regularised during the course of the Court\u2019s examination of the application, the Court has generally considered whether it should continue its examination under Article 34 of the Convention by reference precisely to the notion of \u201cvictim\u201d (see, for example, the Pan\u010denko and Mikheyeva decisions, cited above; see also Maaouia v.\u00a0France (dec.), no. 39652/98, ECHR 1999II; Aristimu\u00f1o Mendizabal v.\u00a0France, (dec.), no. 51431/99, 21 June 2005; and Yildiz v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), no. 40932/02, 13 October 2005). The Court considers that in the instant case the Government\u2019s objection should be examined under Articles 34 and 37 taken together, as a finding that the applicant has lost her \u201cvictim\u201d status within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention would prompt the Court to conclude that the matter has been resolved within the meaning of Article\u00a037 \u00a7 1 (b).",

Furthermore, in relation to Article 34, the Court has always held that, as a general rule, a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not sufficient to deprive him of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the alleged breach of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Amuur v.\u00a0France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, p.\u00a0846, \u00a7\u00a036; Dalban v.\u00a0 [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 1999VI; Labita v.

In Pan\u010denko and Mikheyeva, the complaints were similar to that of Mrs Shevanova, but the length of the applicants\u2019 illegal residence in the country was appreciably shorter (almost three years in the case of Mrs Pan\u010denko and approximately six years in the case of Mrs Mikheyeva).

The Latvian authorities should therefore take account of Article 8 of the Convention, which guaranteed the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her private and family life and constituted a reason for not deporting her. Secondly, the applicant challenged the Government\u2019s argument that her registration of a residence in Russia had automatically cancelled out \u2013 or \u201crendered invalid\u201d \u2013 her residence registration in . On the contrary, her residence permit had been valid until 9 April 1998, when the Directorate had removed her name from the register of residents and issued an order for her deportation; hence, her residence in  had been perfectly legal until then.

Neither did that omission on her part prevent her from applying for a residence permit after the deadline set by the abovementioned provision.

Accordingly, the applicant is no longer under any real threat of removal from .

The Court observes that this solution would allow the applicant to remain in  on a legal and permanent basis; that in turn would enable her to lead a normal social life and maintain normal ties with her son and any other persons close to her. The applicant could therefore exercise freely her right to respect for her private and family life as interpreted in the Court\u2019s case-law.",

Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15-16, \u00a7 33, and Soering v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 34, \u00a7\u00a087). Furthermore, while the chief object of Article 8, which deals with the right to respect for one\u2019s private and family life, is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life (see, for example, G\u00fcl v. Switzerland, judgment of 19 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, pp. 174175, \u00a7 38; Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2000I; and Mehemi v. France (no. 2), no. 53470/99, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2003IV). In other words, it is not enough for the host State to refrain from deporting the person concerned; it must also, by means of positive measures if necessary, afford him or her the opportunity to exercise the rights in question without interference. As the Court has observed above, all the measures taken by the Government do not wipe out the long period of uncertainty and insecurity undergone by the applicant in .",

A law which confers a measure of discretion is not in itself incompatible with this requirement, provided that the scope of any such discretion and the manner of its exercise are defined with sufficient precision, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrariness. The level of precision required depends, however, on the sphere concerned: in relation to rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention, the law must be couched in clear terms in order to indicate to all concerned in what circumstances and under what conditions the public authorities are entitled to interfere with these rights (see, among many other authorities, Lavents v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 58442/00, \u00a7\u00a0135, 28 November 2002).",

Section 35 of the same Act, meanwhile, stated that no residence permit would be issued to persons who had been deported from  in the previous five years or who had knowingly provided false information with a view to obtaining a residence permit. In the light of the principles outlined above, the Court considers that these provisions were couched in sufficiently clear terms for anyone concerned to foresee, with a reasonable degree of certainty, the likely legal consequences of the conduct contemplated therein (see, for example, Eriksson v. Sweden, judgment of 22\u00a0June 1989, Series A no. 156, p. 24, \u00a7\u00a059, and Vogt v. Germany, judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, p. 25, \u00a7\u00a048).

Being in possession of two passports, she performed a number of fraudulent actions, having a false stamp placed in the first passport, which had been officially reported as no longer valid, and using that passport to obtain a residence registration in  and Russian citizenship. She also concealed the fact of her Russian citizenship in her dealings with the immigration authorities, leading them to believe that her legal status remained unchanged. The Court observes in particular that, as a Russian citizen, the applicant could have regularised her stay in  by applying for a residence permit under section 23(1) of the Aliens Act, but did not do so. On the contrary, instead of taking this lawful approach she chose to act in a fraudulent manner which she herself concedes to have been illegal.",

Expulsion of the person concerned from the country would seem to be the most logical penalty, in view of the specific nature of the rights in question. In many cases, sentencing the offender to a prison term or payment of a fine and not deporting him or her would be tantamount to saying that the sentence imposed dispensed the person concerned from the obligation to comply with the law.

It added that, in its view, the applicant\u2019s remaining in  was not the only means by which her son could develop family life with her. While acknowledging that \u201cit may well be that ... the second applicant would prefer to maintain his ties with his mother in \u201d, the Court, on the basis of all these factual elements, decided not to recognise the existence of \u201cfamily life\u201d.",

Where the domestic legislation provides for several different types, the Court must analyse the legal and practical implications of issuing a particular permit. If it allows the holder to reside within the territory of the host country and to exercise freely there the rights secured by Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the granting of such a permit represents in principle a sufficient measure to meet the requirements of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Mehemi v. France (no. 2), no.\u00a053470/99, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2003-IV). In such cases, the Court is not competent to rule on whether the individual concerned should be granted one particular legal status rather than another, that choice being a matter for the domestic authorities alone.",

As the Court observed at the very beginning of its reasoning, \u201csuch a delay is undoubtedly inordinate and is, as a general rule, to be regarded as exceeding the \u2018reasonable time\u2019 referred to in Article 6 \u00a7 1\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 80); this, then, was a case in which it was clear from the outset that a violation would be found. There are certainly many other cases of this type \u2013 relating, for instance, to allegations of torture or ill-treatment \u2013 in which the finding of a serious violation of the Convention is more or less a foregone conclusion (see, among many other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, ECHR 1999V). In such cases it is not unreasonable to assert that, in view of the nature and seriousness of the alleged violations, the Government should first acknowledge that the person\u2019s fundamental rights were violated.

Mrs Aristimu\u00f1o Mendizabal complained of a situation of uncertainty created by the fact that, despite the existence of Community legislation entitling her to reside in  permanently, she had been obliged to seek temporary regularisation of her stay every three months over a fourteen-year period.

Such a solution would also have been fair from the applicant\u2019s point of view since, had the Court struck out the application, it would have been able to reimburse her costs and expenses under Rule\u00a044\u00a0\u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court (see Pisano v.
