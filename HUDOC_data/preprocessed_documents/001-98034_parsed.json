The Government argued that since the matters discussed in disciplinary proceedings are as a rule subject to official secrecy, the exclusion of the general public from the oral hearing was justified. The Court is not persuaded by this argument. The Court has accepted in the past that the requirement to hold a public hearing is not absolute and that it is consistent with Article 6 \u00a7 1 for a State to designate an entire class of cases as an exception to the general rule of public hearings (see B. and P. v. the , nos. 36337/97 and 35974/97, \u00a7\u00a039 ECHR\u00a02001III, and Osinger v. Austria, no. 54645/00, \u00a7 47, 24\u00a0March\u00a02005). However, the justification under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of such an exclusion of the general public from a hearing in certain classes of cases is not the issue here, as hearings before the Administrative Court are in principle public (see Zumtobel v. Austria, 21 September 1993, \u00a7 20, Series\u00a0A no. 268A).
