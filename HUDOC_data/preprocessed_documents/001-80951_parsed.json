The defendant Agency should therefore have been aware of that decision before the appeal proceedings.

They pointed out that in the case of Pravednaya v. Russia (no. 69529/01, 18\u00a0November 2004) the Court had regarded a judicial award of that type as being the applicant's \u201cpossession\u201d and made an order for the initial judgment in the applicant's favour to be restored and the pension paid to the applicant in the amount originally determined. However, in the Government's view, such an approach created confusion. If the sum awarded by the court was a \u201cpossession\u201d of the pensioner, it should not be affected by future rises in the pension rates. Therefore, in the Pravednaya case the applicant would have to return the money she had already received from the Pension Fund by virtue of the recent changes in the legislation on State pensions. They concluded that in order to avoid such a situation the Court should not regard the amounts of pension awarded by the domestic courts as the claimants' \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and that therefore this provision was inapplicable in the present case.",

In this respect the Government also stressed that the Agency had lodged the application for a review of the judgment of 13 April 2000 within the statutory time-limit of three months after the delivery of the decision of the Supreme Court of 24 April 2000 which constituted the newly discovered circumstance in the applicant's case.
