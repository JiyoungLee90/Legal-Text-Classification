France, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 29, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V; S.W., cited above, \u00a7\u00a035; and Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42, Series A no. 260A). In any system of law, including criminal law, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for clarification of dubious points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a wellentrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.\u00a0Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR\u00a02001II).",

Swiss law explicitly acknowledged this principle, and the Court affirmed that this rule was also required by the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.

In particular, and again in principle, the Contracting States may, under certain conditions, penalise a simple or objective fact as such, irrespective of whether it results from criminal intent or negligence. Examples of such offences may be found in the laws of the Contracting States (see Salabiaku v. France, 7 October 1988, Series A no.\u00a0141, \u00a7 27). The same principle was affirmed in Janosevic v.

It must be concluded that Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 is applicable. It remains to be seen whether this situation is covered by the first or the second rule set out in that provision. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 comprises three distinct rules: the first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property; the second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; and the third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, inter alia, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not, however, \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7\u00a037, Series\u00a0A no. 98, and Iatridis v.

France ([dec.], no. 28078/95, ECHR 2001VII) and Air Canada v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 5 May 1995, Series\u00a0A no. 316A), in which the confiscation was ordered after the defendants\u2019 conviction in respect of property which was the instrumentum sceleris and was in the possession of third persons. In connection with the proceeds of a criminal activity (productum sceleris), the Court observes that it has considered a case in which the confiscation followed the applicant\u2019s conviction (see Phillips v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a041087/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09-18, ECHR 2001-VII) and cases in which confiscation had been ordered independently of the existence of any criminal proceedings because the applicant\u2019s property had been assumed to be of unlawful origin (see Riela and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 52439/99, 4 September 2001; Arcuri and Others v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no. 52024/99, 5 July 2001; and Raimondo v.\u00a0Italy, 22\u00a0February 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0281-A, \u00a7\u00a029) or to be used for unlawful activities (see Butler v. the United Kingdom (dec.) no. 41661/98, 27 June 2002). In the first case cited above, the Court held that the confiscation constituted a penalty within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Phillips, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051, and, mutatis mutandis, Welch v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 9\u00a0February 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0307-A, \u00a7\u00a035), whereas in the other cases it considered that the aim had been to control the use of property.",

The FATF has suggested that the States adopt similar measures to those laid down in the Vienna and Palermo Conventions, including legislation, to enable their competent authorities to confiscate laundered assets, the proceeds of money laundering or predicate offences, and the instruments used in or intended for the commission of such offences, or assets of corresponding value, without prejudice to the right of bona fide third parties. The FATF considers that States should envisage adopting measures to allow confiscation of such proceeds or instruments without a prior conviction or to require the presumed perpetrator of the offence to demonstrate the lawful origin of the assets alleged to be liable to confiscation, in so far as such a requirement complies with the principles of their domestic legislation.

The national legislation is unclear because sections 19 and 20 of Law no. 47 of 1985 do not mention confiscation as a criminal sanction, unlike Article 44 of the Building Code (DPR no. 380 of 2011), which reworded the said sections.

The same cannot be said of its alleged \u201cpenal\u201d and \u201cpunitive\u201d nature. It is not enough, in order to justify this \u201cpunitive\u201d aim, simply to consider the percentage of undeveloped plots of land confiscated, even less so the total area of land confiscated. The actual severity of a criminal sanction can only confirm its criminal nature; it cannot replace it. The \u201cpunitive\u201d nature of the confiscation cannot depend on its actual severity.

In order to obviate the problem of \u201cmislabelling\u201d, which is recurrent in this field, we should remember the wise words of Celsius: scire leges non hoc est: verba earum tenere, sed vim ac potestatem (knowing the law means comprehending the spirit and force rather than the letter thereof).",

In modern criminal law, a penalty cannot be revoked under a retroactive administrative decision. The separation of powers principle would proscribe this. If the administrative authorities can validate the land development subsequent to a final judicial confiscation decision and revoke the latter measure, one must conclude that the criminal court making that decision does not have the last say regarding the lawfulness of the development plan. Confiscation as laid down in section 19 of Law no. 47 of 1985 is, precisely, a provisional and interim measure designed to guard against the danger of real-estate operations incompatible with legal and administrative provisions pending a final decision by the relevant administrative authority on the lawfulness of the development in question. In other words, the criminal court provisionally replaces the administrative authorities (in funzione di supplenza) in their role as guarantor of the public interest in the spatial planning and environmental protection field. This conclusion is confirmed by other important aspects of the statutory rules: criminal proceedings have no suspensive effect on administrative proceedings, and the administrative authorities can even prevent the issuing of a confiscation order by the criminal court before it becomes res judicata if it authorises the development operation ex post facto or modifies the local development plan in such a way that the developed land is classified as building land. Furthermore, it can validate buildings constructed without permission if they comply with current town planning regulations at the time of the decision on the application for validation, even if they were incompatible with the regulations in force at the time of construction of the unlawful development. All these aspects of the legal regime inevitably lead to the conclusion that confiscation on grounds of unlawful land development is administrative in nature and does not depend on verification of the existence at the material time of the objective (actus reus) and subjective (mens rea) conditions for applying \u201cpenalties\u201d, even where the confiscation is imposed by a criminal court following criminal proceedings. The constitutional concept of the \u201csocial\u00a0function of ownership\u201d (funzione sociale della propriet\u00e0) is not unconnected to the way in which administrative confiscation is regulated.",

In the absence of a fresh land development plan and the said favourable opinion, the court of first instance ruled the development plan unlawful on grounds of breach of the ministerial decree of 1 August 1985. This charge was upheld neither by the Bari Court of Appeal in its judgment of 22\u00a0January 2001 nor by the Court of Cassation in its judgment of 10 December 2004, but it was upheld by the Bari Court of Appeal in its judgment of 5 May 2003 and by the Court of Cassation in its judgment of 17 May 2002. Lastly, in its judgment of 23 March 2006, the Bari Court of Appeal held that the variant constituted a fresh land development plan and was therefore unlawful. In conclusion, it ordered the confiscation of the buildings and the developed and undeveloped land. The Court of Cassation upheld this approach in its judgment of 11 June 2008. In themselves, the far-reaching divergences among the various domestic judicial authorities highlight the dubious character of the interpretation finally adopted as regards the nature of the land development agreement concluded in August 1994 and of the resultant building permits, and therefore of the criminal offence with which the applicant was charged. Moreover, the municipality of Cassano delle Murge declared the buildings constructed by the applicant before 30 September 2004 in conformity with landscape legislation, and the Soprintendenza per i Beni Ambientali even concluded, after a site inspection, that the \u201cbuilding operation had not caused any specific damage to the integrity of the wooded area\u201d.
