The Court thus holds that the applicant had an enforceable right and legitimate expectation to have his property rights restored in some form.

The applicant did not respond to the authorities\u2019 letter of November 2014 (see paragraph 21 above), but that did not absolve the Government from their duty to complete the restitution process in the applicant\u2019s case, since the applicant had clearly expressed his wish to restore his property rights by obtaining a plot of land of equal value (see paragraphs 11 and 19 above). In these circumstances the Court does not see any grounds for finding that the applicant was responsible, in whole or in part, for the fact that his property rights to the remaining plot had not yet been restored.",
