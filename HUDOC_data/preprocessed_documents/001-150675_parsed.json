In particular, the court held that the District Court\u2019s refusal to recognise the applicant as a bona fide buyer had not been based on sufficient grounds. Furthermore, having recognised the Moscow Housing Department as the owner of the flat and having found that the flat had left the City of Moscow\u2019s possession without the latter\u2019s intention to divest itself of it, the District Court had not taken into consideration that the flat exchange had not stripped the owner of its title, and that the subsequent transfer of the flat to Mr\u00a0S. under the privatisation scheme had taken place with the participation of the Moscow Housing Department. Therefore, in violation of the principle of equality of arms the District Court had failed to examine why, in transferring the title to the flat to Mr S. on 10\u00a0September 2004, the Moscow Housing Department had failed to check the circumstances under which Mr S. had acquired the right to own the flat. The court further noted in this connection that by 10\u00a0September 2004 Mr P. had no longer been registered as living in the flat, as the information on his death had already been available.",

Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a matter of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities accordingly enjoy a certain margin of appreciation (see, among many authorities, Edwards v. Malta, no.\u00a017647/04, \u00a7\u00a064, 24\u00a0October 2006).

It was also within the State\u2019s exclusive competence to legalise the transfer of the title to the flat through a registration procedure specifically aimed at providing extra security to the title holder. With so many regulatory authorities having granted clearance to Mr S.\u2019s title, it was not for the applicant, or any other third-party buyer of the flat, to assume the risk of ownership being revoked on account of defects which should have been eliminated in procedures specially designed to do so. The authorities\u2019 oversight could therefore not justify subsequent retribution against the applicant (see Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079).",

Consequently, with due regard to its findings in the instant case, and in particular having noted the absence of a competing third-party interest or other obstacle to the restitution of the applicant\u2019s ownership, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore the applicant\u2019s title to the flat and to reverse the order for her eviction. Thus, the applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which she would have been had there not been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).",
