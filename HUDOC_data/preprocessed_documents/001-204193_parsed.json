A home will usually be the place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area within reasonable limits. Breaches of the right to respect of the home are not confined to concrete breaches such as unauthorised entry into a person\u2019s home, but may also include those that are diffuse, such as noise, emissions, smells or other similar forms of interference. A person\u2019s right to respect for his home may have been seriously breached if he has been prevented from enjoying the amenities of his home (see Koceniak v. Poland (dec.), 1733/06, \u00a7\u00a7 55, 5758, 17 June 2014 (with further references)).",

In particular, it is not enough for an applicant to claim that a particular place or property is a \u201chome\u201d; he or she must show that they enjoy concrete and persisting links with the property concerned (see, for example, Gillow v. the United Kingdom, 24\u00a0November 1986, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 109).",

Those statements were not refuted by the applicants. Moreover, they have never claimed the contrary throughout the proceedings before this Court. Although it is true that the second applicant in his correspondence with the Court indicated the apartment in question as his permanent address and that in 2007 - 2008 certain letters of the State authorities were posted to that address, this fact alone, in the Court\u2019s view, is not sufficient to prove the second applicant\u2019s actual residence in the apartment in question.
