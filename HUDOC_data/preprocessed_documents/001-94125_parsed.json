The Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government\u2019s preliminary objections in cases similar to the present application (see, Ko\u015fti and Others v. Turkey, no. 74321/01, \u00a7\u00a7 18-24, 3\u00a0May 2007). It finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from this jurisprudence.

The Court reiterates that, where no domestic remedy is available, the six months time-limit contained in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in principle runs from the date of the act complained of in the application (Ar\u0131 and \u015een v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 33746/02, \u00a723, 2 October 2007). In the present case, the criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending and he is still in detention on remand. Furthermore, as explained above, there are no effective remedies which the applicant can use to challenge his prolonged detention pending trial (see, Ko\u015fti, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21-25). The Court therefore accepts that the application has been brought within the six months time-limit. As a result, it rejects the Government\u2019s second objection.",
