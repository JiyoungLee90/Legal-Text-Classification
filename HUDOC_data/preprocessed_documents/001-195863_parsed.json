While Article 6 affords a procedural safeguard, namely the \u201cright to a court\u201d in the determination of one\u2019s \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d, Article 8 serves the wider purpose of ensuring proper respect for, inter alia, family life. The difference between the purpose pursued by the respective safeguards afforded by Articles 6 and 8 may, in the light of the particular circumstances, justify the examination of the same set of facts under both Articles (see Sylvester v. Austria, nos.\u00a036812/97 and 40104/98, \u00a7 76, 24 April 2003). Where the complaints raised by the applicant are essentially directed against the merits of the decision, the Court may find it more appropriate to examine them under Article 8 (see, for example, R.S. v. Poland, no.\u00a063777/09, \u00a7\u00a040, 21 July 2015; Karrer v. Romania, no.\u00a016965/10, \u00a7\u00a7 25-26, 21 February 2012; and L\u00f3pez Gui\u00f3 v.

Croatia, no. 22643/14, \u00a7\u00a7 42-25, 55-67, 12 March 2015; see also H.N. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90-95; Hoholm, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 39, 45-53; and Deak v.

While it is beyond dispute that such proceedings do not determine parental custody and other issues that fall to be resolved by the courts of a person\u2019s country of habitual residence, they do, nonetheless, determine an important dispute as to whether there has been a wrongful removal or retention of a child, and whether there are any obstacles to the child\u2019s return (see Hoholm, cited above, \u00a7 47). In other words, those proceedings resolve a dispute over the right to secure the prompt return of a child wrongfully removed from his or her country of habitual residence. Such a right emanates from the Hague Convention, and Latvia, as a Contracting State to that Convention, has set up the procedural framework necessary to have that right enforced through its domestic courts. The Court sees no reason to question that the Latvian courts, when deciding on S.I.E.A.\u2019s request for the return of his daughter, determined a dispute over a right which was, at least on arguable grounds, recognised under domestic law. It follows that the Government\u2019s objection as to the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention must be dismissed.",

Like the domestic courts, the Court dismisses the applicant\u2019s contention that she had only intended to authorise A.R. to act for her, as the written authorisation was clearly issued with respect to I.M. as well. Furthermore, I.M. submitted an order formally certifying her capacity to act as an advocate at that stage of the proceedings, and proceeded to represent the applicant. She did not, however, argue that owing to alleged personal experiences capable of constituting an exception to the child\u2019s immediate return, the applicant would need to be heard in person. Accordingly, the Court considers that the grounds on which the first\u00a0instance court proceeded to hear the case in the applicant\u2019s absence (see paragraph 17 above) were sufficient at that stage of the proceedings (contrast Selmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a067259/14, \u00a7\u00a7 39-42, 9 February 2017, where the court of first and only instance held no hearing, without giving any reasons).",

Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2007II). The Riga Regional Court responded to the arguments put before it and considered that the case could be adequately dealt with in written proceedings (see paragraph 29 above). The Court agrees with the domestic court\u2019s assessment that the applicant failed to formulate any circumstances that would need to be assessed at an oral hearing and thereby failed to sufficiently substantiate her application. The Court is also mindful of the fact that the applicant did not provide convincing justification for her absence from the first-instance court\u2019s hearing (see paragraph\u00a023 above). Accordingly, the decision of the Riga Regional Court to dispense with an oral hearing cannot be regarded as unjustified (contrast Ad\u017ei\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a055-67, where no hearing was held at any level of jurisdiction, despite the fact that the applicant\u2019s appeal was allowed precisely because of the absence of a hearing).",

In addition, the Court notes that in the present case, the ancillary-complaint procedure had to be used to appeal against the merits of the return order (see paragraphs 50-51 above). Thus, the issue before the Riga Regional Court did not concern an ancillary procedural question, but the assessment of the merits of the dispute in the appeal.",

In that regard the present case should be distinguished from cases where parties have been required to consult the case file at the court\u2019s registry on their own initiative in order to learn about relevant submissions (see G\u00f6\u00e7 v.

Accordingly, S.I.E.A.\u2019s representative was notified of the applicant\u2019s ancillary complaint and about her additional submissions providing him with a possibility to prepare a reply (see paragraph 27 above). In contrast, the system notifications about S.I.E.A.\u2019s submissions were sent to I.M., who was no longer authorised to represent the applicant. Accordingly, the applicant, who herself had no access to the judicial system of electronic services, received no information about S.I.E.A.\u2019s submissions of 17\u00a0October 2017 and had no opportunity to respond to his arguments. In that respect, the Government argued that the failure to notify the applicant personally had been due to her omission to inform the domestic courts about the withdrawal of the authorisation she had given in respect of her representation. The applicant, in turn, submitted that in accordance with the domestic rules concerning representation, she had represented herself before the Riga Regional Court, and therefore all notifications and documents should have been sent to her personally.",

In view of that, the Court takes into account the domestic requirement of the compulsory filing of orders and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that requirement (see paragraphs 56-57 and 60-62 above). Considering the approach followed by the Supreme Court, the Court finds merit in the applicant\u2019s argument that I.M.\u2019s representation before the Riga Regional Court was not formalised in accordance with the domestic law requirements and hence could not be regarded as valid. While the Civil Procedure Law does provide that the domestic courts should be notified of authorisation being withdrawn, given the domestic case-law (see, in particular, paragraphs 61 and 62 above), the Court cannot conclude that, in the absence of such notification, a person would be presumed to be represented by the same advocate at different levels of jurisdiction. Moreover, the Court observes that the Riga Regional Court corresponded with the applicant personally, despite the domestic law requirement that all documents and notifications be sent to a person\u2019s representative when such a representative has been appointed (see paragraphs 24 and 58 above).",

Both a refusal to take account of objections to the return capable of falling within the scope of Articles 12, 13 and 20 of the Hague Convention and insufficient reasoning in the ruling dismissing such objections would be contrary to the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention and also to the aim and purpose of the Hague Convention. Due consideration of such allegations, demonstrated by reasoning of the domestic courts that is not automatic and stereotyped, but sufficiently detailed in the light of the exceptions set out in the Hague Convention, which must be interpreted strictly (see Maumousseau and Washington, cited above, \u00a7 73), is necessary.

Before concluding that the conditions of Article 13 of the Hague Convention were not met, the domestic courts detailed the evidence before them and carried out an assessment of the likelihood of violence on the part of S.I.E.A.

Not attaching decisive weight to psychiatric or other medical examinations put forward by a party, particularly when the evidence is contradictory, is compatible with the margin of appreciation given to the domestic courts (compare B.\u00a0v.\u00a0Belgium, no.\u00a04320/11, \u00a7 72, 10\u00a0July 2012, and M.R. and L.R. v.

While the Court finds the appeal court\u2019s failure to directly address that particular piece of evidence regrettable, it does not regard that omission alone as capable of leading to a finding of a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to family life. The Riga Regional Court did state that the finding on the lack of a risk of physical or psychological harm was based on the evidence in its entirety (see paragraph 32 above). Furthermore, the courts\u2019 conclusion on the lack of violence was, inter alia, based on the analysis of psychiatric reports and other evidence attesting to the supposed consequences of the alleged incident, including the information provided by the Latvian custodial authority (see paragraph 20 above).
