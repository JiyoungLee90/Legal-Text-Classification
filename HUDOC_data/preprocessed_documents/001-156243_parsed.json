The decisions indicated among other things that the family, who were originally from Kosovo, \u201chad not furnished evidence of their stay\u201d in Kosovo after staying in France nor any certificates regarding any medical treatment or care in respect of the pregnancy, or concerning the child or the father. Considering that France was a country which respected human rights, had democratic institutions, had ratified the Convention and the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees, and was bound to implement the directives of the European Union on asylum and that if a return were to raise a problem under Article 3 of the Convention, the family could always lodge an application with the Court for interim measures, the Aliens Office considered that the Belgian authorities did not have to use the sovereignty clause provided for in Article\u00a03(2) of the Dublin II Regulation.",

They argued that the decisions, with the reasons given therein, had not provided them with the examination required by Article 13 taken together with Article\u00a03 of the Convention (M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, \u00a7 336, ECHR 2011) of their fears regarding a return to Serbia and of their health problems. Firstly, the reasoning was erroneous and incomplete (error as to their nationality, identifying them as Kosovars instead of Serbs, failure to mention their return to Serbia and their Roma origin). Secondly, they could not be blamed for having failed to provide, during their Dublin interview, documents certifying their health problems and their movements to date or for not having substantiated their fears regarding a transfer to France. Like all Dublin asylum-seekers at that time, when they had attended those interviews they had not been assisted by a lawyer or informed of the documents that they should bring and no document had been requested of them. As they had expressed their fears, the Belgian authorities should have asked the appropriate questions and requested the relevant documents in order to ensure that their return did not infringe their fundamental rights. The applicants also argued that France should not have been determined as the State responsible for examining their asylum applications. Under Article 16(3) of the Dublin II Regulation, the obligations regarding the determination of the State responsible ceased where the third-country national had left the territory of the Member States for at least three months. That was precisely the position the applicants had been in on account of their return to Serbia from May 2010 to March 2011 as certified by the documents subsequently sent to the Aliens Office (see paragraph 20 above). Lastly, they submitted that the Belgian authorities should have used the sovereignty clause or the humanitarian clause both on account of their special vulnerability and of the notoriously difficult situation of the Roma minority in Serbia and of the conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers in France.",

With regard to the level of the physical reception conditions, the CJEU said that this must be sufficient to ensure a dignified standard of living and adequate for the health of applicants and capable of ensuring their subsistence (\u00a7 40). Furthermore, the Member States were required to adjust the reception conditions to the situation of persons having specific needs. The financial allowances also had to be sufficient to preserve family unity and the best interests of the child (\u00a7 41). The CJEU specified that where a Member State provided these conditions in the form of financial allowances, those allowances had to be sufficient to enable them to obtain housing, if necessary, on the private rental market (\u00a7\u00a042).

The persistent failure to accommodate these minors shows, in particular, that the Government has not taken the necessary and appropriate measures to guarantee the minors in question the care and assistance they need and to protect them from negligence, violence or exploitation, thereby posing a serious threat to the enjoyment of their most basic rights, such as the rights to life, to psychological and physical integrity and to respect for human dignity. Similarly, the fact that at least 461 unaccompanied foreign minors were not accommodated in 2011 and the problems posed by inappropriate accommodation in hotels lead the Committee to the conclusion that the Government failed to take sufficient measures to guarantee non-asylum seeking, unaccompanied foreign minors the care and assistance they need, thereby exposing a large number of children and young persons to serious risks for their lives and health.",

With regard to the urgent procedure, it is not disputed that if the applicants had applied to the President of the Brussels Employment Tribunal under the urgent procedure, in addition to the practical difficulties of appointing a lawyer and complying with the relevant time-limits, they would have had to wait approximately ten days at the material time to obtain an order. Moreover, and in any event, the decisions examined by the Court (see paragraphs 95-96 above) show that at the relevant time the case-law of the employment tribunals was still inconsistent regarding acknowledgment of the right of reception of families who were \u201cillegally resident\u201d and subject to the Dublin procedure.

The Court considers that the applicants were thus victims of treatment which failed to respect their dignity and that this situation undoubtedly aroused in them feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of inducing desperation. It finds that such living conditions, combined with the lack of any prospects of their situation improving, attained the level of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention and amounted to degrading treatment.",

Article 2 of the Convention may imply in certain well-defined circumstances a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual from another individual or, in particular circumstances, from himself. However, such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities, bearing in mind in particular the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources. Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see, among other authorities, Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, ECHR 2001III; De Donder and De Clippel v.

As they were a family, they could not be detained; thus they did not have access to the procedure for requesting a stay of execution of the removal measure on grounds of extreme urgency. Admittedly, they did request a stay of the measure, but they did so under the \u201cordinary\u201d procedure that did not have the effect of suspending the order to leave the country. In accordance with Fedasil\u2019s policy, in such a case material assistance was not maintained pending a decision of the Aliens Appeals Board. As they had had no practical possibility of waiting for the outcome of the Dublin procedure, the applicants had been compelled to leave Belgium, which had rendered their appeal devoid of any purpose. The applicants also complained about the limits of the review of lawfulness on an application to have a decision set aside, since the Aliens Appeals Board confined itself to examining points of law, and not the facts, on the basis of an assessment at the time the transfer decision was taken and not at the time of the court\u2019s decision, contrary to the Court\u2019s rulings in Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands (no. 1948/04, \u00a7 136, 11 January 2007), M.S.S. v.

Nor is there any basis for assuming that the applicants, in the specific circumstances of this case, would not be provided with the guarantees of Article 3 and 13 of the Convention were they returned to France. The mere fact that the applicants\u2019 request for asylum in France had been rejected cannot in itself justify an assumption that the applicants would not be protected by Article 3 and Article 13 in France. On the contrary, it can be assumed that the applicants could have requested a reassessment of their asylum request in France on the basis of relevant new facts.

The general background information is, in my view, not even enough to allege that there are \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d or \u201can arguable complaint\u201d. This inevitably depends on an assessment of the applicants\u2019 individual circumstances. Having regard to the specific circumstances of the case, including the nature of the information provided by the applicants to the Belgian authorities and their rejected asylum request in France, I find it questionable that there is a basis for alleging that there are \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d or an \u201carguable complaint\u201d; however, having regard to the reasons set out above, I do not find it necessary to take a final position on that question.",

My main concern is the Court\u2019s finding of a violation of Article 13 taken in conjunction with Article 3. In my view, the Court\u2019s finding may have significant and negative consequences for the proper functioning of the cooperation between EU Member States regarding the processing of requests for asylum, including the return of asylum-seekers to the first asylum country in accordance with the relevant EU legislation. In practice, the judgment may be understood as imposing an obligation on EU Member States not only to assess whether an asylum-seeker may be returned to another EU Member State as the first asylum country, but also to assess and address the alleged risk of ill-treatment in the country of origin, even when there is no basis for criticising the proper functioning of the asylum procedure or the conditions of reception for asylum-seekers in the EU Member State which is the first asylum country.",
