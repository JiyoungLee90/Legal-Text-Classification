In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. The Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Dichand and Others v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a029271/95, \u00a7 38, 26 February 2002, with further references).",

The statement which gave rise to the defamation action was made by the applicant during a live television debate in which he and an official from the Moscow Department of the Ministry of Justice took part. The discussion revolved around the move by the Ministry of Justice to have Ms A., legal counsel for Mr Khodorkovskiy, disbarred. Mr Khodorkovskiy \u2013 formerly one of the wealthiest individuals in Russia and a controlling shareholder of a major oil company (see Khodorkovskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no. 5829/04, \u00a7 7, 31\u00a0May 2011) \u2013 had at that time been imprisoned in a  remand centre. The criminal proceedings against him and the strategy of his defence were matters of intense public and media attention. The request to have a member of his defence team disbarred must have sparked a further wave of public interest. However, there is nothing in the text of the Moscow City Court\u2019s judgment to suggest that the City Court performed a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiffs\u2019 reputation and the Convention standard, which requires very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on debates on questions of public interest (see Godlevskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a014888/03, \u00a7 41, 23 October 2008, and Krasulya v. Russia, no. 12365/03, \u00a7\u00a038, 22\u00a0February 2007). The Court finds that the domestic court failed to recognise that the present case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of the reputation (see Dyundin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 37406/03, \u00a7 33, 14\u00a0October 2008).",

Admittedly, the special status of lawyers gives them a central position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts, and such a position explains the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the Bar. However, as the Court has repeatedly emphasised, lawyers are entitled to freedom of expression too and they have the right to comment in public on the administration of justice provided that their criticism does not overstep certain bounds (see Kyprianou v.  [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7\u00a7 173-174, ECHR 2005XIII; Amihalachioaie v.\u00a0, no. 60115/00, \u00a7 27, ECHR 2004III; and Nikula v. , no.\u00a031611/96, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002II, with further references). The Court does not find persuasive the Government\u2019s argument that by reason of his legal background and position of authority, the applicant should have shown particular meticulousness in his choice of words. Firstly, he was speaking for the benefit of a lay audience of television viewers, rather than to a legal forum. The word \u201csearch\u201d is common and acceptable in everyday language to describe adequately the essence of the procedure to which Ms A. was subjected. In those circumstances, the applicant could not be held accountable for his choice of words to the same standard of precision as could be expected of him when delivering a speech before a court of law or making written submissions to the same. Secondly, the format of the discussion between the applicant and a State official was designed to encourage an exchange of views or even an argument, in such a way that the opinions expressed would counterbalance each other and the debate would hold the viewers\u2019 attention. The presenter fed questions to the participants, some of which hinted at the existing tension in the relationship between the Ministry of Justice and the Moscow Bar. As the discussion was broadcast live, the applicant was unable to reformulate or refine his words before they were made public. Further, the other participant to the debate was a representative of the Ministry of Justice. As he was given the floor after the applicant (see paragraph 14 above), he could have dispelled any allegation which he considered to be untrue and presented his own version of the incident, which however he chose not to do (compare Filatenko v. , no.\u00a073219/01, \u00a7 41, 6\u00a0December 2007, and G\u00fcnd\u00fcz v.

Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism. Those principles also apply in the sphere of television and radio broadcasting (see Godlevskiy, cited above, \u00a7 44; Filatenko, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Dyuldin and Kislov v. Russia, no.\u00a025968/02, \u00a7 44, 31 July 2007). It is an uncontested fact in the instant case that neither the individual plaintiffs \u2013 two prison warders \u2013 nor the suing legal entity \u2013 a  remand centre \u2013 had been named in the applicant\u2019s speech. The City Court accepted, nevertheless, that all of them were entitled to sue in defamation because the applicant\u2019s intervention had been preceded by some footage showing the remand centre building. The Government also added that the prison warders had been identifiable because their names had been publicised by other media. Those reasons do not appear sufficient to the Court. The discussion was broadcast live and the applicant could not have been aware of any footage that the editor had chosen to use as an introduction to the debate. The Government\u2019s contention that the names of Mr B. and Mr F. had entered the public domain was not substantiated with any material from the printed or visual media, whereas the applicant produced a selection of newspaper articles, all of which referred to them as \u201cprison officers\u201d, without giving their name or rank. In any event, the extent of the applicant\u2019s liability in defamation must not go beyond his own words and he may not be held responsible for statements or allegations made by others, be it a television editor or journalists. The fact remains that there was nothing in the applicant\u2019s statement to permit identification of the plaintiffs whom he described impersonally as \u201cmen\u201d, without mentioning their names or employer. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to adduce sufficient reasons for establishing an objective link between the statement in question and the individual claimants in the defamation action.",

Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2004XI; Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2001II, and De Haes and Gijsels v.\u00a0Belgium, 24 February 1997, \u00a7 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I). The applicant said that counsel A. had not attempted to take out any material from her client and that there had accordingly been no reason to subject her to a search. He added that the search had been carried out by men who had \u201crummaged\u201d about her body. The Moscow City Court in its judgment, and subsequently the Government in their submissions to the Court, did not take issue with the word \u201crummaged\u201d used by the applicant, but insisted that the statement was defamatory because it implied a breach of law committed by the prison warders.",

Against that background, the Court found that Ms A.\u2019s note \u201c[had been] to all intents and purposes privileged material, that the authorities had [had] no reasonable cause to believe that the lawyer-client privilege was being abused, and that the note [had been] obtained from Ms\u00a0A. deliberately and in an arbitrary fashion\u201d (see Khodorkovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 199-201). Similar findings were contained in the Moscow Bar Council\u2019s decision rejecting a request by the Ministry of Justice for the disbarment of Ms A. (see paragraph 18 above).

The Court notes at the outset that the presence of a woman appears to be a conjecture resulting from a signature on the inspection report which could be read as either a male (\u201cL-vich\u201d) or a female (\u201cL-va\u201d) last name. In fact, no woman by the name of L-va or any other name was ever mentioned in the domestic proceedings, whereas the male warder L-vich was called to testify and appeared before the District Court. Mr L-vich confirmed in the witness stand that he had been in the office where Ms A. and warders B. and F. had been present, that he had removed a document from Ms A. and that he had signed the inspection report (see paragraph 16 above).",

Firstly, as it has observed above, subtle nuances of legal terminology would not be significant for a lay audience of television viewers. Secondly, the thrust of the applicant\u2019s invective was directed at the male warders who had taken it upon themselves to examine the female counsel\u2019s clothing. This constituted a departure from the requirements of the domestic law, which explicitly provided that both a personal inspection and a body search should be carried out by persons of the same sex and in the presence of two attesting witnesses (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Lastly, the Court observes that the personal inspection report indicated that the warders had examined not just the belongings but also the clothing of Ms A. She stated in the defamation proceedings that they had removed from her the printed media that she had been clutching to her chest (see paragraph 17 above). Even though the word \u201crummage\u201d appears somewhat exaggerated, the Court does not consider that the applicant went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism, as he was seeking a way to convey his indignation at the actions by the male warders.

Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7 114, ECHR 2004XI). This effect, which works to the detriment of society as a whole, is likewise a factor which concerns the proportionality of, and thus the justification for, the sanctions imposed on the applicant, who, as the Court has held above, was entitled to bring the matter at issue to the public\u2019s attention. Although the penalty of 20 Russian roubles was negligible in pecuniary terms, the institution of defamation proceedings against the President of the Moscow City Bar in the context of the present case was capable of having a chilling effect on his freedom of expression. In any event, the sanction was not justified in the light of the factors set out above (compare Axel Springer AG v.  [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7 109, 7\u00a0February 2012).",
