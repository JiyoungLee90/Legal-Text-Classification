The case originated in an application (no. 53716/17) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Sergey Sergeyevich Olkhovskiy (“the applicant”), on 10 July 2017.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 7 November 2017 notice of the complaint concerning the annulment of the applicant’s title to real property was given to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 2012 and lives in Kaliningrad.
A flat measuring 33.9 sq. m and located at 22-189 Prospekt Pobedy, Kaliningrad, belonged to the Town of Kaliningrad. B. resided in the flat under a social tenancy agreement.
On 21 August 2008 the municipality transferred the title to the flat to B. under a privatisation scheme. On 16 October 2008 B. died. It appears that no information as regards the privatisation agreement and B.’s title to the flat was entered into the Unified State Register of Immovable Property (Единый государственный реестр прав на недвижимое имущество и сделок с ним).
On an unspecified date the title to the flat was transferred to Chob. on the basis of a court judgment of 7 November 2011. The State registration authorities entered the relevant information into the State Register.
On an unspecified date Chob. sold the flat to Chub. The transaction and the transfer of the title to Chub. were registered in the State Register.
On 3 February 2012 Chub. sold the flat to the applicant and his father. According to the purchase contract, the total value of the flat was 900,000 Russian roubles (RUB). The value of the applicant’s share in the flat was RUB 700,000.
On 13 February 2012 the applicant’s title to the flat was registered in the State Register. The applicant became the owner of two thirds of the flat. The applicant and his parents moved into the flat and resided there.
On an unspecified date an investigation was opened in respect of Chub.’s acquisition of the flat, which it was alleged had been fraudulent. It was established that Chub. had forged the court judgment recognising Chob.’s title to the flat.
On 12 January 2015 Leningradskiy District Court of Kaliningrad found Chub. guilty of fraud and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment.
On an unspecified date the municipality brought a civil action against the applicant and his father, seeking the restitution of the title to the flat.
On 15 July 2016 the Tsentralniy District Court of Kaliningrad granted the municipality’s claims in full. The court considered that the title to the flat had not been transferred to B. and that the municipality had always been the lawful owner of the flat. It ruled that the municipality had lost the title to the flat “against its will” and, as a matter of law, it could reclaim the flat from its bona fide owners.
On 9 November 2016 the Kaliningrad Regional Court upheld the judgment of 15 July 2016, in substance, on appeal.
On 8 February 2017 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal against the judgments of 15 July and 9 November 2016.
On 29 May 2018 the Tsentralniy District Court of Kaliningrad granted claims brought by the municipality against the applicant and ordered his eviction.
On 29 August 2018 the Regional Court upheld the judgment of 29 May 2018 on appeal.
