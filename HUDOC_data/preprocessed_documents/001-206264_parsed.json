Leading scientists \u2013 including Dr V. Ginzburg, a Nobel laureate and astrophysicist, and Dr S. Kapitsa, a physicist \u2013 discussed the preliminary specifications drafted by the applicant. The scientists concluded that those specifications did not contain any State secrets. All data included in the preliminary specifications had been published a long time ago and were known to the specialists of all countries dealing with space studies. During the seminar the scientists also noted that the expert examinations of the preliminary specifications drafted by the applicant had been performed by people who had no specific expertise in the relevant subject area. For instance, the scientists observed that the same people had prepared expert reports in both the applicant\u2019s case, which had concerned the electrisation of space mechanisms, and another similar case regarding the movement of an object in a gas cavern in water. The scientists considered that experts who were not competent had made erroneous findings which had then become the basis of the applicant\u2019s conviction.",

The applicant referred to the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling no. 8-\u041f of 27\u00a0March 1996 (see paragraph 70 above), whereby it had found the requirement for a defendant\u2019s representative to apply for security clearance unconstitutional, because that would imply the need for the representative to pass the verification procedure carried out by the FSB and thus, to a certain extent, make the defendant dependent on the FSB. The same logic was even more relevant in respect of jurors, as a judge should be free from undue pressure and comply only with the law. Thus, the presiding judge in the applicant\u2019s case should have granted his application to have jurors with security clearance removed from his case.

As the applicant was accused of treason for having disclosed a State secret, the case against him was investigated by the FSB. As is apparent from Russian law (see paragraph 69 above), the Russian Constitutional Court\u2019s decision (see paragraph 70 above) and the parties\u2019 submissions, people with security clearance, which is necessary for holding certain jobs, have to pass a special verification procedure carried out by the FSB. Furthermore, as is also apparent from Russian law (ibid.) and is evidenced by the applicant\u2019s case, the FSB continues to monitor people with security clearance and their compliance with the obligation not to disclose State secrets. The Court considers that having security clearance does not automatically imply the lack of impartiality. However, taking into account that the applicant had been indicted by the FSB for treason for having disclosed a State secret, his fear that jurors with security clearance might, at least to some extent, be influenced by partial considerations, appears sufficiently serious to have warranted a concrete examination by the presiding judge.",

The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s complaints in that regard were dismissed on the following basis. As possession of security clearance is not one of the grounds which generally disqualify somebody from jury service under Russian law (see paragraphs 64-65 above), the judge considered that the fact that some jurors had security clearance could not affect their impartiality (see paragraphs 35, 56 and 89 above). Consequently, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s objections to jurors with security clearance participating in his particular case, a case which concerned the alleged disclosure of a State secret, were dismissed in general terms without considering the nature and the subject matter of the trial and on purely formal grounds; those grounds were that the applicable legislation did not provide for security clearance being a reason to generally disqualify somebody from jury service. Thus, the national courts failed to take sufficient steps to check that the trial court had been established as an impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention and did not offer sufficient guarantees to dispel any doubts in this regard (see, by contrast, Gregory v. the United Kingdom, 25\u00a0February 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 48-49, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I).",

The trial court held that it was not necessary to question the experts at the hearing, because their reports were clear and the court did not require any clarification or additional information from them (see paragraph 39 above).

The appeal court dismissed that argument, generally asserting that the experts had the proper expertise and referring to the need for an expert assessment to determine whether the information had constituted a State secret (see paragraph 56 above). The Court thus finds that the applicant clearly indicated to the national courts that he wished to have the expert witnesses examined before the court in order to challenge their credibility and conclusions (see, mutatis mutandis, Hanu v.

Instead, the presiding judge decided that it was unnecessary to hear the experts in person because their written opinions were clear and he did not require any clarification or additional information from them. The Court notes that, even if there were no major inconsistencies in the reports, questioning the experts might have revealed possible conflicts of interests, the insufficiency of the material at their disposal, or flaws in the methods of examination (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, \u00a7 714, 25 July 2013).",

Furthermore, according to the applicant\u2019s submissions, which were not denied by the Government, the experts had no relevant or sufficient expertise in the relevant area of physics (see paragraphs 45-49 above). Lastly, on several occasions the applicant attempted to bring to the national courts\u2019 attention the alternative opinions of leading scientists who supported his position that the information divulged did not contain any State secrets (see paragraphs 15 and 44 above). Leaving aside the admissibility of those alternative opinions, it is only natural that the applicant had doubts about the conclusions of the prosecution\u2019s experts and sought an opportunity to cross-examine them.",
