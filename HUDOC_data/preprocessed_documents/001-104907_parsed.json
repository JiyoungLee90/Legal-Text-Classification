The  found that the Regional Court\u2019s assessment that the applicant had repeatedly committed serious offences was not arbitrary as the latter had been sentenced to one term of eight years\u2019 imprisonment and another of eight years and six months. The expert report, which was of recent date, was sufficiently substantiated. In so far as the applicant had been refused relaxations in the conditions of his detention, the Constitutional Court noted that the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had not based their decision to order preventive detention globally on the fact that the applicant had failed to prove that he was no longer dangerous in the course of such relaxations. If the prison authorities refused to grant the applicant relaxations in the conditions of his detention in the future, the applicant had to raise this issue with the competent lower courts first. In view of the courts\u2019 assessment that the applicant was likely to commit further serious offences if released, their finding that the interest in public safety prevailed over the applicant\u2019s right to liberty had been proportionate.",

It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see, among other authorities, Cardot v.

Thus, there has been a sufficient causal connection between his conviction and the deprivation of liberty. Both the order for the applicant\u2019s preventive detention by the sentencing Aachen Regional Court in November 2001 and the decision of the Bochum Regional Court, responsible for the execution of sentences, of July 2007, confirmed on appeal, not to release the applicant, were based on the same grounds, namely to prevent the applicant from committing further serious drug offences, similar to those he had previously committed, on release. There is nothing to indicate that the assessment, that the applicant was likely to reoffend in that manner, which the domestic courts had reached after having consulted a psychiatric and psychotherapeutic expert on that point, was unreasonable in terms of the objectives of the initial preventive detention order by the sentencing court.",

The Court takes note, in this connection, of the reversal of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law concerning preventive detention in its leading judgment of 4 May 2011 (see paragraphs 28\u201331 above). It welcomes the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s approach of interpreting the provisions of the Basic Law also in the light of the Convention and this Court\u2019s case-law, which demonstrates that court\u2019s continuing commitment to the protection of fundamental rights not only on national, but also on European level.",

It understands that the applicant\u2019s preventive detention, when reviewed in the future, will be prolonged only subject to the strict test of proportionality as set out in the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment (see paragraph 30 above). It notes, however, that the applicant\u2019s preventive detention here at issue was ordered and executed on the basis of a previous version of Article 66 of the Criminal Code. In any event, Article 66 of the Criminal Code in its version in force since 27 December 2003 was not declared void with retrospective effect, but remained applicable and thus a valid legal basis under domestic law, in particular, for the time preceding the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s preventive detention at issue for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) is not called into question.",
