It could have been argued that the ruling of the Appellate Board of the Commercial Court of Moscow of 19 February 2001 was procedural and did not determine (at least definitely) civil rights and obligations. Indeed, without entering into the merits, it quashed the first-instance judgment and terminated the proceedings on the ground that the prosecutor's office did not have standing to bring proceedings. In such a situation the guarantees of Article 6 would begin to apply from the point when the case was accepted for supervisory review by the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia on 16 October 2001, as this was the instance which ruled finally on the merits of the case. Indeed, the Presidium quashed the decision of 19 February 2001 and reinstated the first-instance judgment of 21 December 2000.",

However, the decision it attacked, namely that of 19\u00a0February 2001, did not create any \u201clegal certainty\u201d under the first paragraph of Article 6. Therefore, the quashing of that decision by way of supervisory review on 16 October 2001 did not interfere with the applicant company's \u201cright to a court\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1, in contrast to many other Russian cases concerning the functioning of the supervisory review system (see, as a classic authority, the case of Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051 et seq., ECHR 2003-IX). Against this background, there would not have been any reason to conclude that the proceedings against the applicant company were \u201cunfair\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.",
