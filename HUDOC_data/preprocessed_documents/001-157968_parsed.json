Ukraine, no.\u00a042310/04, \u00a7 148, 21 April 2011). However, this task is especially complicated by the need to assess evidence calling for expert knowledge in various medical fields. In this connection the Court emphasises that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role, and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000). The Court further reiterates that it is not its task to rule on matters lying exclusively within the field of expertise of medical specialists and to establish whether the applicant in fact required such treatment during the relevant period (see E.A. v. Russia, no. 44187/04, \u00a7 57, 23 May 2013) and whether the choice of treatment methods appropriately reflected the applicant\u2019s needs (see Ukhan, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Okhrimenko v. Ukraine, no. 53896/07, \u00a7\u00a071, 15\u00a0October 2009).
