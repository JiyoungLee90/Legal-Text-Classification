Turkey, no.\u00a022492/93, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000-III, and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no.\u00a022535/93, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2000-III). This lack of accountability is evidenced in the present case by the fact that none of the gendarmes working in Kulp where the applicant\u2019s son was detained has been questioned by the Kulp Prosecutor despite the latter\u2019s conclusion that the applicant\u2019s allegation of her son having been detained by gendarmes was corroborated by the statements of a number of other detainees (see paragraph 53 above).",

Noting that the authorities have not provided any explanation as to what occurred following Mehdi Akdeniz\u2019s detention, and that they do not rely on any ground of justification in respect of any use of lethal force by their agents, it follows that liability for his death is attributable to the respondent Government (Timurtas, \u00a7 86, Orhan, \u00a7 331, and \u00c7i\u00e7ek, \u00a7 147, all cited above).",

What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances.

It has stressed in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control, Article 5 requires them to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (Kurt, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 122-125; see also \u0130pek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0187-191 and the authorities cited therein).",

His detention there was not logged in the relevant custody records and there exists no official trace of his subsequent whereabouts or fate. In the view of the Court, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of holding data recording such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see judgments of Kurt, \u00a7 125; Timurta\u015f, \u00a7 105; \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, \u00a7\u00a0105; \u00c7i\u00e7ek, \u00a7 165, and Orhan, \u00a7 371, cited above).",
