The management of this unprecedented environmental crisis required the utmost care, expertise, information and interpretational skills. The pollutant at issue was a mixture of crude oil and various petroleum products and, according to its estimations, there were between 500 and 2,000 tonnes of such material above groundwater. Technical limitations prevented the determination of the source of the leak with absolute certainty. However, the interpretation of the available data suggested that pollution of such great magnitude could only have been caused over a long period by a facility with a high capacity of petroleum refining and storage in the vicinity, which pointed to the T\u00fcpra\u015f Refinery (a conclusion which was challenged by T\u00fcpra\u015f and TPAO representatives). The report also stressed, however, the absence of conclusive evidence to back up this assumption.

The Civil Court held in its decision that both the original claims and the subsequent request to increase those original claims had been brought within the one-year time-limit set out in Article 60 \u00a7 1 of the former Code of Obligations, bearing in mind that the relevant time-limit would only start running when both the damage and the tortfeasor responsible for that damage became known to the victim.

The Court of Cassation held in this connection that the explosion at issue had taken place on 3 May 2004 and that, soon after that date, some of the property owners in Toptanc\u0131lar Sitesi had brought compensation claims against T\u00fcpra\u015f. Since the applicant was also a property owner in Toptanc\u0131lar Sitesi, he should have formed an opinion regarding the responsibility of T\u00fcpra\u015f for the explosion on the date of its occurrence. The Court of Cassation stated that venturing a guess as to the identity of the tortfeasor, within the bounds of possibility, was sufficient to bring an action; it was not necessary to have the tortfeasor established with certainty. The applicant\u2019s claim that he had brought the action subsequent to the establishment of the tortfeasor as T\u00fcpra\u015f in a case brought earlier by other property owners could not stop the running of the time-limit from the date of the explosion. The Court of Cassation further stated that although criminal proceedings had also been brought against T\u00fcpra\u015f executives in connection with the explosion in question, the longer prescription period applicable to the criminal offence at issue could not apply to the civil compensation claim brought against T\u00fcpra\u015f within the meaning of Article 60 \u00a7 2 of the former Code of Obligations. That was because, where a civil claim brought against a company for offences committed by its employees was concerned, the longer time-limit provided in the Criminal Code applied in the civil proceedings only for offences under Article 465 of the Criminal Code. Since the charges brought against the T\u00fcpra\u015f executives did not concern one of the offences under Article 465, the civil claim against T\u00fcpra\u015f should have been brought within the aforementioned one-year time-limit.",

The applicant submitted examples from the case-law of the Court of Cassation and the doctrine to support his claim. Bearing in mind the technical difficulties encountered, even by experts, in identifying the source of the leak in the instant case, the responsibility of T\u00fcpra\u015f for the explosion had been far from certain for a long time after the incident, and he could not have been expected to bring a case in such circumstances on the basis of mere speculation. The applicant stressed in this connection that although the report issued by the technical commission on 14\u00a0June 2004 had indicated that the leak had probably originated from T\u00fcpra\u015f, that report had been deemed unsatisfactory, and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office had therefore established new commissions to investigate the source and circumstances of the leak (see paragraphs 18 and 22 above). In its subsequent report dated 11 October 2004, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Commission had stated that it ultimately fell on the courts of law to establish, with certainty, who was responsible for the explosion (see paragraph 19 above).",

The applicant, for his part, submitted, both to the Court of Cassation and subsequently to the Strasbourg Court, some examples of the case-law of the Joint Civil Chambers of the Court of Cassation and the legal doctrine to support his argument that mere suspicions as to the identity of the wrongdoer would not trigger the one-year time-limit in question. The Court has also discovered proprio motu that the Joint Civil Chambers of the Court of Cassation delivered a number of judgments in 2012 and afterwards, in which it verified that merely being in a position to learn the identity of the wrongdoer was not sufficient to start the time-limit (see paragraph\u00a065 above).",

Numerous commissions were, therefore, established and studies were conducted by experts in the field in order to shed light on the circumstances of the explosion and determine who was responsible for it. Those experts acknowledged that the explosion of 3\u00a0May 2004 had been a highly complex phenomenon, and the technical limitations encountered prevented rapid progress in establishing the circumstances surrounding it, including the identity of the entity responsible. They also stated that it ultimately fell on a court of law to determine, with certainty, responsibility for the explosion. Even the expert reports obtained subsequently during the criminal proceedings indicated that there was no sufficient evidence to determine conclusively that T\u00fcpra\u015f was responsible for the incident (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). Moreover, the expert report dated 3\u00a0March 2006, that ultimately determined the responsibility of T\u00fcpra\u015f for the incident, had been based on highly technical considerations which a layman could not be expected to make (see paragraph 43 above).

The Court notes that in the view of the 4th\u00a0Chamber of the Court of Cassation, the time-limit at issue had started running on the date of the explosion. However, having regard to the nature of the explosion, the uncertainty of the cause of the damage, the complexity of the matter, as well as the various reports on the issue, the Court finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the Court of Cassation. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the Court of Cassation\u2019s interpretation and application of the relevant timelimit rule, whereby the applicant was required to institute proceedings at a moment when he could not realistically have sufficient knowledge of the cause of the damage or the identity of those responsible, seems very formalistic, bearing particularly in mind the possible practical and financial implications of such requirement for the applicant. The Court stresses in this connection that contrary to the arguments of the Court of Cassation and the Government (see paragraphs 53 and 89 above), the victims who initiated compensation proceedings within one year of the explosion did not bring those actions against T\u00fcpra\u015f alone, but against both possible tortfeasors (see paragraph 42 above).",

The nature and the scope of the positive obligations vary depending on the circumstances. However, as a general rule, the State must ensure that property rights are sufficiently protected by law and that adequate remedies are provided whereby the victim of an interference can seek to vindicate his rights, including, where appropriate, by claiming damages in respect of any loss sustained (see Blumberga v. Latvia, no. 70930/01, \u00a7 67, 14 October 2008). The measures which the State can be required to take in such a context can therefore be preventive or remedial (see Kotov v.

The Court has already stated, in the context of Articles\u00a02 and 8 of the Convention, that the positive obligations resulting from dangerous industrial activities require the State to regulate such activities and put adequate safeguards in place to protect the right to life and physical integrity against dangers that may arise from such activities (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, and Brincat and Others v.
