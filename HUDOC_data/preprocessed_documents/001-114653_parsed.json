The court noted that the Anyk\u0161\u010diai Facility had not challenged the applicant\u2019s claim that while detained, he had had to relieve himself in a bucket at night. The court considered that fact degrading. The court also found it established that the applicant had been held in a cell without a sink, and that his cell had had no natural light or adequate ventilation, which had had a negative effect on his mental health (suk\u0117l\u0117 neigiamus i\u0161gyvenimus). On these points the court found that certain domestic regulations on hygiene standards in detention facilities - providing that cells should have natural light and that detainees should be able to use a toilet in conditions that were not degrading - had been breached. The court conceded that degrading conditions of detention could in theory amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. With regard to the applicant\u2019s case, the court held that the conditions in which he had been held had \u201capproached the threshold of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention\u201d. Nevertheless, the applicant had been held for only a short time, he was 44\u00a0years of age and there was no evidence that the conditions at the detention facility had affected his [physical] health. Nor was there any indication that the detention facility administration had intended to humiliate the applicant. Certain hardships, such as a lack of privacy, were to be considered unavoidable for those who were deprived of their liberty. In the light of the above-mentioned considerations, the  held that, in the applicant\u2019s case, the minimum level of severity within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention had not been reached.",

It also noted that the applicant had instituted court proceedings for damages nine months after the end of his detention in the police facility, by which time the effects of the negative experience would have diminished to a certain extent. Emphasising that in the instant case there had been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention, as well as the fact that the poor detention conditions were a result of limited financial resources, the  rejected in its entirety the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary compensation for the \nnon-pecuniary damage he had sustained.",

During the 2008 visit, the delegation observed very good material conditions in that establishment. The authorities informed the delegation at the outset of the visit that major renovation had also been carried out in police detention centres at  and Panev\u0117\u017eys. Indeed, when visited by the delegation, the latter establishment was found to offer good detention conditions.

In addition, the domestic courts had not found that the conditions in the facility were unsanitary in general.

The Government have argued that the instant case was similar to that of Karalevi\u010dius (cited above), where the applicant had spent only six days in detention and the Court had found that short duration of relevance when finding that the unsatisfactory conditions of his detention had not attained the minimum level of severity to fall within the ambit of Article 3 of the Convention. Whilst acknowledging that the two cases appear similar as regards the duration of the detention, the Court nonetheless notes that the particular elements characterising the conditions of detention are different. In particular, in Karalevi\u010dius the applicant complained about the absence of windows and a stroll yard at the Kaunas Central Police Department Remand Prison. In the instant case, however, the applicant has laid emphasis on the allegedly degrading treatment that consisted of the necessity to relieve himself in a bucket at night, sometimes in the presence of another inmate, and the lack of adequate ventilation, alongside a complaint about inappropriate lighting. For the Court, a lack of appropriate toilet facilities, combined with limited ventilation, appear to be factors that affected his situation in a way that was more severe than in Karalevi\u010dius. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s argument must be dismissed.",

Of the seven days that he spent in the Anyk\u0161\u010diai Facility, the applicant shared his cell with another inmate for three days. As has been acknowledged by the administration of the remand facility (see paragraph\u00a07 above) and established by the Ombudsman and the Supreme Administrative Court, at night the applicant had to use a bucket toilet in the presence of another inmate and be present while the bucket toilet was being used by his cellmate (see paragraphs 11 and 15 above). This fact had in essence been acknowledged by the Government, which stipulated that \u201ccontainers for the satisfaction of physiological needs had been provided in the cells as an additional tool only\u201d. Furthermore, even though the Government suggested that the inmates could knock on the cell door to ask the guard to take them to the toilet, the Court finds that this measure merely left the inmates at the discretion of the guard. In addition, such practice appears to have been in contradiction with the Lithuanian legislation itself (see paragraphs\u00a020 and\u00a021 above). Finally, the situation the applicant was in did not meet Council of Europe standards to the effect that prisoners should have ready access to sanitary facilities that are hygienic and respect privacy (point\u00a019.3 of the European Prison Rules; see paragraph 22 above).",

Furthermore, the national courts placed great emphasis on the fact that the applicant was a healthy man of 44, detained for a very short period of seven days. They also had regard to the fact that there had been no intention on the part of the authorities to humiliate or debase the applicant. In my opinion such facts, established by the national courts, are of crucial importance and must be taken into account also in the light of the case-law of the Court when awarding just satisfaction to applicants in Article 3 cases (see Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2001VII).",

However, in my opinion, in determining the amount of the award, the above-mentioned criteria should have been taken into account and therefore the award for non-pecuniary damage should have been significantly reduced in this case.",

Lithuania (dec.), no. 51392/07, 14 December 2010).
