This resulted in nullifying the legal effects of those judicial acts, although formally they still remained in force. The Court finds, therefore, that the decision of the Civil Court of Appeal of 15 September 2006 as upheld by the Court of Cassation on 2 March 2007 set at naught an entire judicial process which had ended in judicial decisions that were \u201cirreversible\u201d and thus res judicata and which moreover had been executed (see, mutatis mutandis, Brum\u0103rescu, cited above, \u00a7 62). Nothing suggests that there were any circumstances of a substantial and compelling character justifying the re-examination of a matter which had previously been determined in final and binding judicial decisions. In view of the foregoing, the Court concludes that, by granting the claim lodged by the Mayor of Yerevan, the courts infringed the principle of legal certainty.",

The subsequent re-examination of the question of whether the first applicant had title in respect of the land, by the Civil Court of Appeal in its decision of 15\u00a0September 2006, deprived him of this possession and amounted to an interference with his right to property as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 (see Brum\u0103rescu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70 and 74).
