The investigations were opened on 13 February and 20 February 2001, one month after the applicants\u2019 relatives were detained. This delay in itself was liable to affect the investigation of a crime such as abduction in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the days immediately after the event. It also appears that within the following weeks the applicants and some of their neighbours were questioned and the scene of the crime was inspected. The applicants were granted victim status in March 2001. However, it appears that after that, a number of crucial steps were delayed and were eventually taken only after the communication of the complaint to the respondent Government, or not at all. For example, the decision to join the proceedings in two cases concerning the same events in the same place and on the same day was taken only in September 2005 (see paragraph 59 above). These delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",
