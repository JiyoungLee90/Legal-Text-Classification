.  The case originated in an application (no. 41158/09) against Montenegro lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Montenegrin national, Mr Veseljko Koprivica (“the applicant”), on 31 July 2009.
In a judgment delivered on 22 November 2011 (“the principal judgment”), the Court held that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression was not “necessary in a democratic society” as the award of damages and costs in the domestic proceedings against the applicant (7,667.50 euros (EUR) in total) was disproportionate to the legitimate aim served. The Court therefore found a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (Koprivica v. Montenegro, no. 41158/09, §§ 74-75).
Under Article 41 of the Convention the applicant sought just satisfaction of EUR 7,667.50 in respect of pecuniary damage, EUR 5,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, and EUR 593 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.
Since the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicant to submit, within three months from the date on which the principal judgment became final, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., § 79, and point 3 of the operative provisions).
.  On 18 May and 10 July 2012 the applicant and the Government each filed observations, in view of which the Court decided to adjourn the proceedings in respect of the application of Article 41 of the Convention case for six months, after which the parties were invited to provide the Court with further observations on the matter and a factual up-date.
.  On 14 May and 26 July 2013 the Court received the information requested from the parties, following which the proceedings in respect of Article 41 of the Convention were adjourned for additional six months.
.  On 7 April and 14 May 2014 both parties had submitted additional information. Finally, on 26 November 2014 the applicant filed subsequently requested factual up-date.
The parties submitted that, following a request by the applicant, on 5 April 2013 the Court of First Instance in Podgorica had quashed its judgment of 17 May 2004, which judgment had been found by the Court to be in violation of Article 10 of the Convention, and had re-opened the civil proceedings.
On 18 October 1013 the Court of First Instance rendered its judgment establishing that the plaintiff’s claim against the applicant had been withdrawn and ordered the plaintiff to pay EUR 2,505 to the applicant for legal costs. On 2 July 2014 the High Court in Bijelo Polje upheld this decision and reduced the legal costs due to the applicant to EUR 2,175.
The applicant, in addition, submitted that he had effectively paid the plaintiff EUR 1,133.31 in compliance with the judgment found to be contrary to Article 10 of the Convention. The Government did not contest this.
