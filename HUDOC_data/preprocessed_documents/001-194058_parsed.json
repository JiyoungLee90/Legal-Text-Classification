A restrictive or technical approach in this area is therefore to be avoided and the key consideration in such cases is that any serious issues concerning respect for a child\u2019s rights should be examined (see Hromadka and Hromadkova v.

K. had then been released and returned home. Accordingly, the domestic authorities had admitted the existence of the violation and eliminated its consequences. Referring to the provisions of domestic law and domestic practice (see paragraphs 22-32 and 38-40 above), the Government also submitted that it had been open to the applicant, acting in the interests of K., and as of her coming of age to K. herself, to sue the State for damages resulting from their unlawful decision to place her in the closed educational institution. However, neither of them had used that legal avenue, and thus had not afforded the domestic authorities an opportunity to eliminate the damage caused to K. by way of an award of compensation for non-pecuniary damage. In such circumstances, the Government concluded that the applicant\u2019s complaint alleging a violation of K.\u2019s rights under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(d) and 5 of the Convention was inadmissible due to her loss of victim status.",

He referred, in particular, to the absence of either a criminal or an administrative case in respect of K., the lack of clarity as to the procedure followed by the District Court when taking the decision of 18\u00a0February 2008 on K.\u2019s placement, and the uncertainty of K.\u2019s procedural status. Article 1070\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Civil Code provided for compensation for unlawful criminal conviction or prosecution, the unlawful application of a preventive measure and an unlawful administrative penalty, whereas K. had been neither the accused in any criminal proceedings, nor a party to any administrative proceedings. The Minors Act did not contain any provisions on compensation for damage caused by illegal placement of minors in closed educational institutions, either. Nor did the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Dagestan of 7\u00a0August 2008 contain any mention of K.\u2019s right to compensation.

In the present case, however, although the Supreme Court of the Republic of Dagestan acknowledged the unlawfulness of the order to place the applicant\u2019s daughter in a closed educational institution by quashing the relevant decision of the Kirovskiy District Court of Makhachkala of 18\u00a0February 2008, by the time the quashing took place, on 7\u00a0August 2008, the applicant\u2019s daughter had already spent almost six months in the institution and was not released until 30 September 2008.

The substance of the issue was therefore brought before the domestic authorities, and they addressed it accordingly by finding the disputed measure unlawful (see paragraph 18 above). The Court further notes that where lawfulness of detention is concerned, an action for damages against the State is not a remedy to exhaust in Russia because the right to have the lawfulness of detention examined by a court is separate from the right to obtain compensation for any deprivation of liberty incompatible with Article 5 of the Convention (see Fortalnov and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a07077/06 and 12\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a066, 26 June 2018; Ivan Kuzmin v. Russia, no.\u00a030271/03, \u00a7\u00a079, 25\u00a0November 2010; and Moskovets v.

However, neither of the abovementioned cases leading to the strict liability of the State covers the unlawful placement of a minor in a closed educational institution.
