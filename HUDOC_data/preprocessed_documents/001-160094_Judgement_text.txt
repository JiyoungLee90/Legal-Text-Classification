The case originated in an application (no. 24738/11) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Andriy Maryanovych Vasyunets (“the applicant”), on 7 April 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr B. Fokiy, a lawyer practising in Chernivtsi. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, most recently Mr B. Babin, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 18 December 2014 the complaint concerning the effectiveness of the investigation into the death of the applicant’s daughter was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Kalush.
On 4 November 2006 the applicant’s daughter, Ms S.V., born in 1997, and two other individuals, Ms L.M. and Ms V.K., stayed overnight at a private house. On the morning of 5 November 2006 S.V., L.M. and V.K. were found dead in the room where they had been sleeping.
On an unspecified date after the incident a committee composed of five employees of the gas company conducted an inquiry into the incident and drew up a report (“the internal inquiry report”). According to the report, gas company employees visited the scene on the morning of 5 November 2006 and observed that the room where the accident had occurred had a window with a vent for ventilation, but that it was closed at the time of examination. All the gas equipment in the house was in good working order and the heater’s flue had adequate draught. The report went on to note that on the night of the incident Mrs M.T. had turned on the gas heater in the room where S.V., L.M. and V.K. were sleeping, closed the door and left the room and the gas heater unsupervised. The committee took the view that the incident had been caused by a strong wind on the night of the incident and M.T.’s failure to check the heater.
Between 14 November 2006 and 24 May 2012 the prosecutor’s office refused eleven times to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the death. All those decisions were overruled by supervising prosecutors or the courts as being premature owing to the incompleteness of the investigation and the need to conduct additional investigative measures.
.  On 25 January 2013, following the entry into force in November 2012 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 11 below), a criminal investigation was initiated into the actions of the employees of the gas company on suspicion of neglect of official duties in connection with the death of the applicant’s daughter. An entry to that effect was made in the Unified Register of Pre-Trial Investigations.
Thereafter the police twice discontinued the criminal investigation, on 21 December 2013 and on 15 December 2014, for lack of corpus delicti in the actions of the gas company’s employees. Those decisions were overruled on 3 February 2014 and 19 August 2015 respectively.
.  The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 concerning pre-investigation enquiries can be found in the judgment in the case of Kaverzin v. Ukraine (no. 23893/03, § 45, 15 May 2012).
The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 was repealed on 19 November 2012 when the new Code of Criminal Procedure of 2012 (“the new Code”) came into force. The new Code abolished the stage of preinvestigation enquiries. Instead, Article 214 of the new Code provides that once a prosecutor or an investigator has received any information about an alleged offence, he or she must create an entry in the Unified Register of Pre-Trial Investigations within twenty-four hours. The creation of such an entry in the Register means that a pre-trial investigation has been opened.
