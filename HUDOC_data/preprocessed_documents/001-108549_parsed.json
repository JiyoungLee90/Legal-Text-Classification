The right to presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of a fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph\u00a01 (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7\u00a035, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0308). It prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d is guilty before he has been so proved according to law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 62) but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to consider the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 41; Daktaras v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-43, ECHR 2000-X; and Butkevi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a048297/99, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR 2002-II).",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see B\u00f6hmer v. Germany, no.\u00a037568/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 56, 3 October 2002, and Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v. Slovakia, no.\u00a065559/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 and 89, 27\u00a0February 2007). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Karaka\u015f and Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak v. , no. 43925/985, \u00a7\u00a051, 28\u00a0June 2005).",

The expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d does not only necessitate compliance with domestic law, but also relates to the quality of that law. The domestic law must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure to individuals the minimum degree of protection to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (see Sergey Volosyuk v.

The Court notes that the applicable provision of the domestic law does not oblige the competent authority to adopt a formal decision on the request, give reasons for such a decision or provide a copy thereof to the detainee concerned. Nor does that provision lay down a specific remedy enabling the detainee to contest the action or omission by the relevant authority. It appears therefore that due to the lack of these important procedural safeguards the applicant\u2019s requests for a correspondence permit could remain unanswered or refused for no valid reason. The lack of the abovementioned guarantees is all the more disconcerting given that the domestic law, as a general rule, prohibits correspondence and obliges pre-trial detainees to seek a permit as an exception thereto, rather than respecting, in principle, a detainee\u2019s right to correspondence and ensuring that any interference therewith is provided by and is in accordance with law.",
