However, despite the fact that this document had been admitted to the court file at first instance, the Sofia City Court held in its final judgment delivered on appeal that a copy of the policy itself had not been produced, thus completely disregarding an important piece of available evidence. On that basis the court rejected the applicants\u2019 claim that, following their father\u2019s death, the insurance company owed them a compensation payment in accordance with the insurance policy. The Court observes that it has not been argued or demonstrated in any way that, before reaching that conclusion, the Sofia City Court had raised with the applicants the question whether the insurance policy had been produced so as to give them an opportunity to comment.
