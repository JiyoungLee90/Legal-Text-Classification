Therefore, the Court concludes that the final judgments rendered in the applicants\u2019 favour continue to represent a claim for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, while the prolonged failure of the Serbian authorities to enforce those judgments cannot be seen as being in accordance with the domestic law.",
