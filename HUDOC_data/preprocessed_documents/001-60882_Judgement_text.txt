The case originated in an application (no. 39505/98) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, W.M. (“the applicant”), on 27 August 1997.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The applicant was not represented before the Court. The President of the Chamber acceded to the applicant’s request not to have his name disclosed (Rule 47 § 3 of the Rules of Court).
The applicant alleged that his right to a “hearing within a reasonable time” had not been respected.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 23 October 2001 the Court declared the application admissible.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.
On 18 May 1992 the applicant filed with the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) an action in which he sought the eviction of a tenant from an apartment situated in a house belonging to him. In addition, the applicant requested that the tenant pay overdue rent and be also evicted from the basement of the building.
Having held two hearings, on 9 October 1992 and 5 February 1993, the District Court delivered its judgment on 11 February 1993. It ruled that the tenant should pay the overdue rent and be evicted from the basement, but dismissed the action for eviction from the apartment.
The applicant and the defendant appealed against that judgment. A hearing scheduled for 19 October 1993 was adjourned because of an illness of the judge rapporteur.
On 26 November 1993 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment and remitted the case for re-examination.
From 26 November 1993 to 27 November 1995 no hearing was held. From 27 November 1995 to 3 June 1998 the Warsaw District Court scheduled nineteen hearings, two of which were adjourned.
On 3 and 17 June 1998 respectively the court adjourned the delivery of its judgment. On 1 July 1998 the court decided to re-open the examination of the case and ordered an expert opinion.
On 6 July 1998 the court rejected the applicant’s complaint against its decision of 17 June 1998.
On 25 January 1999 a summons for a hearing was served on the applicant, but, as the hearing was supposed to take place on 29 January 1999, he requested that it be rescheduled.
On 23 June 1999 the court adjourned the delivery of its judgment until 7 July 1999. On 2 August 1999 the court delivered a partial judgment (wyrok częściowy). It ordered the eviction of the defendant from the basement and dismissed the claim concerning the eviction from the apartment.
On 23 and 26 November 1999 respectively the applicant and the defendant lodged their appeals.
On 21 June 2000 the applicant informed the District Court that the defendant had died. He also requested that the defendant’s widow join the proceedings as a defendant.
On 20 October 2000 the Regional Court held a hearing. No parties appeared. The court stayed the proceedings due to the defendant’s death.
On 3 November 2000 the Regional Court ordered the applicant to submit information about all legal successors of the deceased defendant. On 14 November 2000 the applicant submitted the information.
On 5 December 2000 the Regional Court held a hearing and resumed the proceedings. The court adjourned the hearing until 28 December 2000 at the request of the defendant’s widow.
On 28 December 2000 the Regional Court held a hearing and set aside the contested partial judgment of the District Court. It discontinued the proceedings in respect of the eviction of the defendant due to his death. It also considered that the proceedings in respect of the applicant’s claim for overdue rent could be continued with the participation of the heirs of the defendant.
The decision of the Regional Court was served on the applicant on 12 March 2001.
On 19 March 2001 the applicant requested the District Court that the proceedings be reopened.
It appears that the proceedings are pending before the District Court in respect of the claim for overdue rent.
