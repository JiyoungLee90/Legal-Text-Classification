He submitted that if the practice of grouping complaints and awaiting the outcome of other proceedings were to become established, the Federal Constitutional Court would constantly be able to delay proceedings at will. According to the applicant, the Government could not argue that it was reasonable and appropriate for the applicant to wait for the Federal Constitutional Court to decide on the pilot case, as the pilot case itself had already been pending for an excessive amount of time, namely since 1994. Instead of first deciding on one case before deciding on the other, the Federal Constitutional Court should have joined the cases and decided on them together.",
