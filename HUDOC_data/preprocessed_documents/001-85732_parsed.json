Moreover, only one provision of the ANRTI Regulations had been applied, whereas it was necessary to examine the case in a broader light and to apply all the relevant legislation. Finally, ANRTI\u2019s decision of 6 October 2003 contravened its decision of 17\u00a0September 2003. Judge Visterniceanu considered that the Supreme Court should have quashed the judgment of the first-instance court and remitted the case for a fresh re-examination.",

In so far as these submissions are to be interpreted as meaning that ANRTI\u2019s decision of 6 October 2003 did not interfere with the possessions of the applicant company for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court is unable to accept this view. The Court notes in the first place that before 6\u00a0October 2003 the applicant company had been operating unhindered. Moreover, it is clear from the parties\u2019 submissions that ANRTI was well aware long before 6 October 2003 of the applicant company\u2019s failure to request a modification of the address in the text of its licences. ANRTI was informed by the applicant company about the change of address in May 2003 (see paragraph 10 above) and the latter even requested a new licence with the new address in it. For unknown reasons, ANRTI did not consider it necessary to invalidate the applicant company\u2019s existing licences at that time and even issued it with a new one. Moreover, the Government implicitly admitted that ANRTI was well aware of the situation by submitting that in July 2003 it had drawn the applicant company\u2019s attention to the irregularity and urged it to remedy it (see paragraph 55 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but note that ANRTI\u2019s decision of 6\u00a0October 2003 had the immediate and intended effect of preventing the applicant company from continuing to operate its business and of terminating its existing licences. The fact that the domestic authorities decided to attribute retroactive effect to ANRTI\u2019s decision of 6\u00a0October 2003 does not change that. Accordingly, the Court considers that ANRTI\u2019s decision of 6 October 2003 had an effect identical to a termination of valid licences and thus constituted an interference with the applicant company\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions for the purposes of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1.",

Without underestimating the importance of State control in the field of Internet communications, the Court cannot but note that the Government were only able to cite theoretical and abstract negative consequences of the applicant company\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirement. They could not indicate any concrete detriment caused by the applicant company\u2019s omission to have its address modified in the text of its licences. Indeed, it is common ground that ANRTI was well aware of the applicant company\u2019s change of address and it had no difficulty in contacting Megadat.com SRL on 24\u00a0September 2003 (see paragraph 12 above). Moreover, it is similarly undisputed that the applicant company kept its old address and any attempt to contact it at that address would have certainly been successful. Immediately after changing its address, the applicant company informed the State Registration Chamber and the Tax Authorities (see paragraph 9 above). Accordingly, the applicant company could not be suspected of any intention to evade taxation in connection with its failure to notify its change of address to ANRTI. Nor had it been shown that any of the applicant company\u2019s clients had problems in contacting the company due to the change of address. It is also important to note that the applicant company did in fact inform ANRTI about its change of address in May 2003 and even requested a third licence using its new address. For reasons which ANRTI did not spell out at the time, the new licence was issued with the old address on it.",

It points out that ANRTI had been apprised of the change of address in May 2003, at the time of the applicant company\u2019s application for a third licence. Without giving reasons, ANRTI failed to take note of the change of address and issued the applicant company with a new licence indicating the old address in it.

In these circumstances it can only be concluded that the applicant company, by submitting an application for the amendment of its licences within the time-limit, could reasonably expect that it would not incur any prejudice. Despite the encouragement given by it to the applicant company, ANRTI invalidated the applicant company\u2019s licences on 6 October 2003 (see, mutatis mutandis, Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.

After setting the date of the first hearing, the Court of Appeal acceded to ANRTI\u2019s request to speed up the proceedings and advanced the hearing by two weeks (see paragraph 21 above). Not only did the Court of Appeal decide the case in the applicant company\u2019s absence, but it failed to provide reasons for dismissing the latter\u2019s request for adjournment.

The minutes do not contain reference to irregularities such as failure to present annual reports. Moreover, this submission was made for the first time by the Government in the proceedings before the Court, and must therefore be treated with caution, especially in the absence of any form of substantiation (see, mutatis mutandis, Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, \u00a7 82, 4 October 2005). No such submissions appear to have been made by ANRTI during the domestic proceedings despite the applicant company\u2019s clear and explicit contention about alleged discriminatory treatment (see paragraph 24 above). Regrettably, the Supreme Court of Justice disregarded the applicant company\u2019s complaints about discrimination, apparently treating them as irrelevant.",
