The \u201caquarium\u201d was approximately two metres long and 0.80 metres wide and did not have a bed, chair, toilet or sink. It was intended for periods of detention not longer than three hours. Cell no. 9 was located below floor level and did not have windows. There was no ventilation. The electric light was always on, although it was so weak that it was difficult to distinguish the faces of the co-detainees. The cell was approximately seven metres long and three metres wide and there were six detainees in it. The cell was not equipped with a toilet but instead had a big bucket in a corner which was not separated from the rest of the cell. There was no sink and the detainees had to keep water in plastic bottles which they were allowed to refill once in a while outside the cell. There were no beds, but only a brick shelf a little higher than the floor on which four people could sleep. The cell was not provided with any bedding and the applicant alleged that he was only able to sleep for one hour per day. The cell was infested with insects, with the result that the applicant was covered with painful bites, some of which later became wounds. The applicant sent the Court photographs showing the bites on his body. The food was insufficient and of very poor quality. The detainees were fed only once a day from dirty plates and the applicant was permanently hungry. His relatives were not allowed to bring him food because he would not confess to the charges against him. The applicant was unable to have any contact with his relatives and the outside world. He did not have any paper, pen or envelopes. The room was not provided with a radio or television and due to the lack of natural light the applicant never knew what time of day it was.",

Referring to the Government\u2019s decision of 2003, the applicant argued that it concerned the refurbishment of prisons for convicted prisoners, but not of detention centres.
