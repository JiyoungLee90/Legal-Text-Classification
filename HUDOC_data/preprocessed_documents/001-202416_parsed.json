The applicant cohabited with his partner for approximately seventeen years, and his youngest daughter was one of five children born as a result of that relationship. Prior to his partner\u2019s death the applicant had no formally recognised parental status in respect of the children. Whilst his paternity was eventually recognised in respect of the four other children and he received formal parental status and thus full parental authority in respect of them, the domestic authorities refused to recognise his paternity in respect of his youngest daughter, with reference to the fact that by that moment she had been adopted. They also refused to revoke the adoption order, with reference to the absence of the formal grounds under the relevant national law to do so.",

The court concluded that Ms\u00a0N.S. and Mr\u00a0S.S. satisfied all the statutory conditions to be adoptive parents, and that there were no circumstances under the relevant provisions of the Russian Family Code which would rule out the possibility of them becoming adoptive parents. The court thus granted them a full adoption order in respect of D., and ordered that the girl\u2019s first name be changed, as requested by the adoptive parents, and that her surname be changed to reflect their surname.

D. had already suffered irreparable harm on account of her mother\u2019s death, which had been exacerbated by the rupture of her ties with her natural family. He also pointed out that the European Court of Human Rights had repeatedly stated that a child\u2019s ties with his or her family must be maintained; the fact that the girl had been adopted by third parties and had been living with them for some time should not be regarded as an insurmountable obstacle to the reunification of the applicant\u2019s family.

By refusing to revoke the adoption order, the domestic courts had disregarded a number of basic principles of family law, such as a child\u2019s right to know his or her parents, enjoy their care and live with them (Article 54 of the Russian Family Code), and the right of parents to have priority as regards bringing up their children (Article 63 of the Russian Family Code), and other similar principles. Moreover, the courts had disregarded the fact that the adoption had been granted in breach of the relevant domestic law (see paragraph 85 above) and that the relevant proceedings had been tainted with procedural unfairness, since neither he nor any of D.\u2019s relatives had been involved in those proceedings. The domestic courts\u2019 interpretation of the notion of \u201cthe best interests of the child\u201d had thus not been foreseeable and had been arbitrary; moreover, they had failed to assess the interests of the applicant and his other children in having D. in their family, and had failed to fairly balance the interests of all the parties involved in the proceedings for revocation of the adoption order.",

A child\u2019s interests dictate that the child\u2019s ties with his or her family must be maintained, except in cases where the family has proved to be particularly unfit and this may harm the child\u2019s health and development (see, for instance, K.B. and Others v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a036216/13, \u00a7 143, 14 March 2017).

Germany, no.\u00a074969/01, \u00a7 48, 26\u00a0February 2004); everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to \u201crebuild\u201d the family (see Kacper Nowakowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a032407/13, \u00a7 75, 10 January 2017).",

However, the domestic courts refused to recognise his paternity in law, stating, in essence, that such recognition would be devoid of any legal meaning, as it would not entail revocation of D.\u2019s adoption, given that recognition of paternity was not listed in the formal grounds in Article 141 of the Russian Family Code for revoking an adoption order in respect of a child (see paragraphs 38 and 46 above). Furthermore, the courts found that there were no grounds in the abovementioned legal provision to revoke D.\u2019s adoption order, as there had been no guilty conduct on the part of her adoptive parents in respect of her; nor were there any other formal grounds to do so under that Article (see paragraphs 39-40 above).

In addition, the courts referred to the fact that by the time the first-instance judgment had been adopted, the child had been living with the family of her adoptive parents for eighteen months, and she had developed close emotional ties with them (see paragraph 41 above).",

At the same time, in assessing the quality of the decision-making process, the Court must also see whether the conclusions of the domestic authorities were based on adequate evidence (see N.P. v.\u00a0the\u00a0Republic of Moldova, cited above, \u00a7 69; compare also Strand Lobben and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0220 and 225).",

Furthermore, they never questioned the applicant\u2019s ability to raise and educate his children. It was never alleged or established by the domestic courts that the family had ever attracted the attention of social or childcare authorities prior to Ms O.M.\u2019s death, or that while living with their natural family the children had ever showed a lack of adequate developmental and educational progress, been neglected, or had their health or life put at risk. In fact, in a separate set of proceedings, the national authorities found no obstacles to the recognition of the applicant\u2019s paternity in respect of his other four children and their return to his care (see paragraphs 25-26 above). The only reason for their refusal to formally recognise the applicant\u2019s paternity in respect of D. was, in essence, the fact that she had already been adopted by third parties by the time they considered that question, and there were no formal grounds under the relevant legal provision to revoke the adoption order. In particular, \u201ca court\u2019s establishment of the fact that a child was descended from a particular person\u201d did not constitute grounds under that provision for revoking the adoption order, and no other grounds such as guilty conduct by the foster parents in respect of D. could be found (see paragraph 46 above).",

In particular, as the Court has noted above, the applicant did not participate in the adoption proceedings before the first-instance court, and thus was objectively precluded from raising this point in those proceedings (see paragraph\u00a0117 above). Furthermore, in the proceedings under examination, that argument was rejected as irrelevant, without being scrutinised (see paragraph\u00a042 above).",

Indeed, effective respect for family life requires that future relations between parent and child be determined in the light of all the relevant considerations, and not by the mere passage of time (as a recent authority, see V.D. and Others v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 116). Moreover, where the authorities are responsible for a situation of family breakdown, they may not refer to the absence of bonds between the parents and the child when taking decisions regarding the child\u2019s adoption (compare Pontes, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092 and 99, and Strand Lobben and Others, \u00a7 208, all cited above).",

The domestic courts did not elaborate on their argument regarding the applicant\u2019s lack of official employment, therefore it is unclear whether they suggested that he was unable to support his family financially.
