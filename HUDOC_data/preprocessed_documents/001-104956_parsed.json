The EU has put forward 15 conditions that it says the Government needs to promise to meet within the next six months. These include: ensuring that the 17th amendment to the constitution, which requires that appointments to public positions be impartial and reflect the country\u2019s ethnic and religious mix, is enforced; repealing parts of the Prevention of Terrorism Act that are incompatible with Sri Lanka\u2019s covenants on political and human rights; reforming the criminal code to allow suspects immediate access to a lawyer on arrest; and allowing journalists to carry out their professional duties without harassment. However, the Government has rebuffed the EU, stressing that the issues that it has raised are internal political matters that should not be linked to trade. The EU is not the only international body currently putting pressure on the government.  has also rejected the UN\u2019s appointment of a three-member panel to examine possible human rights violations during the island\u2019s civil war.

All returnees are still interviewed, photographed and wet fingerprinted. The main objective of these interviews is to establish if the returnee has a criminal record, or if they are wanted or suspected of committing any criminal offences by the police. The photographs are stored on a standalone computer in the CID office at the airport. The fingerprints remain amongst paper records also in the CID office at the airport. Checks are initiated with local police, but returnees are released to a friend or relative, whom CID refers to as a surety. This surety must provide evidence of who they are, and must sign for the returnee. They are not required to lodge any money with CID. The main CID offices at , which are housed on the ground floor adjacent to the DIE embarkation control, are currently undergoing a complete refurbishment funded by the Australian government.

In general, young male Tamils originating from the north and east of the country were most at risk of being detained following cordon and search operations, with the presence of the risk factors set out above increasing that risk. Those without employment or legitimate purpose for being in  were also likely to be seen as suspect. The same report also noted that most sources agreed that there had been few, if any, abductions or disappearances since June 2009. There was not a great deal of available information about the profile of Tamils targeted for abduction, although it appeared that people linked to the media might be more vulnerable. Police did not generally carry out effective investigations. It\u00a0went on to note that most sources agreed that there had not been any significant reduction in the number of checkpoints in Colombo, whose stated purpose remained to detect and prevent terrorist activity. In general those most likely to be questioned were young Tamils from the north and east; those without ID; those not resident or employed in ; and those recently returned from the West. However, most sources said that arrests at checkpoints were rare and none had been reported since June\u00a02009. It was reportedly fairly likely that someone would be stopped at a checkpoint en route from the airport to  city. Finally, it clarified that people who wished to live in  but did not originate from there were required to register with the local police station with a national ID card or full passport, and give details of planned length and purpose of stay. In\u00a0theory, whilst anyone was entitled to register to stay in , some sources suggested that young Tamil men originally from the north or east of the country could encounter difficulties and face closer scrutiny. The\u00a0presence of any of the risk factors set out above would also attract greater attention from the police.",

However, expulsion by a  may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (Saadi v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a037201/06, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2008-...). The assessment of whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces such a real risk inevitably requires that the Court assess the conditions in the receiving country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention (Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a046827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2005I).

The Court also notes that the AIT in LP considered all the relevant risk factors identified and put before it by the appellant in that case and that the AIT itself was careful to avoid the impression that these risk factors were a \u2018check list\u2019 or exhaustive.

The Court also takes note of the background evidence set out above which has been issued since TK was handed down, such as the November 2010 COI report, which details the relaxation of certain procedures at Colombo airport (see paragraph 38 above) and the July 2010 Guidelines, which state that only Tamils with particular profiles will be in need of international protection (see paragraphs 44-45 above). The Court notes in particular that the July 2010 Guidelines represent the most recent guidance issued by the UNHCR and state that, given the improved situation in Sri Lanka, group-based protection is no longer necessary and each case should be assessed on its individual merits, having regard to the risk profiles. Drawing on all these sources, the Court finds that the risk factors identified in LP and endorsed by this Court in NA. are still applicable but, given the end of hostilities, the likelihood of a Tamil returning to Colombo being the subject of adverse interest on the part of the Sri Lankan authorities has, if anything, declined (see TK, cited above).",

However, when the Secretary of State refused to treat the applicant\u2019s representations as a fresh claim on 27 August 2008, it was explicitly stated that it was not accepted that the applicant had been tortured as he claimed. The Secretary of State doubted that the applicant had been involved with the LTTE as he alleged. Thus, while the applicant\u2019s case was considered in the light of LP, this consideration was carried out on the basis that the applicant did not possess certain risk factors, such as a record as a former LTTE member, which the Adjudicator had already accepted that the applicant possessed. The Court does not therefore consider that the applicant\u2019s case was properly assessed in the light of the relevant case extant at the time. It is unfortunate, in the Court\u2019s view, that the Secretary of State did not consider the findings of the Adjudicator who had had the opportunity to see the applicant give evidence in person. In so doing, the Secretary of State does not appear to have had regard to risk factors which, it is accepted, applied to the applicant and which were of relevance to the consideration of his claim in the light of the then-recent and still relevant case-law.",

The Court is of the view that this risk factor is best construed as a specific, rather than background, factor. However, the Court also notes that, in the case of the applicant, this risk factor does not apply. The applicant did not jump bail or escape from custody but was released on the condition that he report regularly at the army camp. The Court does not consider that the duty to report following release is comparable to being subject to bail, which is granted in the context of pending criminal proceedings. The fact that the applicant was released from custody, albeit conditionally, indicates that the authorities did not have a continuing strong level of interest in him. If he were considered still to be dangerous or to have further information to divulge, he would have been kept in custody. The Court further notes that, even after reneging on his duty to report, the applicant was able to travel through  and pass various checkpoints in order to leave the country, which he did through normal channels. This ability to travel and to leave the country corroborates the finding that the applicant was no longer of such interest to the authorities that he would be re-arrested. It also indicates that no record of the applicant\u2019s detention had been kept and indeed, the Court notes that there is no evidence in this case that the applicant\u2019s detention was recorded. This differentiates this applicant from the applicant in NA. v. the , cited above, in respect of whom it was accepted that a record had been made of at least his last detention. The Court therefore finds that, although this applicant had been identified as an LTTE member, following his detention and prior to his departure from , he was not of continuing interest to the authorities.",

The general country situation is not, therefore, conducive to any increased interest in the applicant. Furthermore, the applicant has been absent from his country of origin for ten years and has not at any stage raised any suggestion that he has maintained links with the LTTE in any way. In particular, he has not sought to argue that he has been involved in fund-raising for the LTTE or has supported the organisation in any other way from the , such as might have brought him to the attention of the authorities.

On the other hand, Dr Smith at paragraphs 108-118 of his report (see paragraph 46 above) states that the applicant\u2019s scars are visible and significant and that members of the Sri Lankan security forces take a special interest in those who either arrive in Sri Lanka with visible scarring or whose scars are revealed during a strip search. He also noted that the applicant\u2019s scars on his elbows would be visible if he were to dress in normal Sri Lankan attire of a short-sleeved shirt. The scars on his legs would be visible if he were to wear shorts. The scars on his head were at present covered by his hair but would be revealed if the applicant were to go bald.
