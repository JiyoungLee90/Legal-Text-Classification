Relying on the definition of child abduction, as provided in Article 3 of the Hague Convention, the court found that K.B.V. had abducted L. from his habitual residence in France, where the parents had exercised their custody rights jointly. However, on the basis of the evidence before it, the court concluded that if L. (who was still being breastfed) were returned to France, he would be placed in uncertain circumstances, only seeing his mother every second week for a couple of hours. It emphasised that according to the applicant\u2019s own submissions, he was away from home from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. and that it would be difficult for him to look after the child during weekends. Thus, as he suggested, his sister would look after L. The court also noted that the applicant had lodged his request almost a year after L.\u2019s abduction and that although he had visited Hungary on a number of occasions, he had not been in contact with L. Thus, the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request under Article 13(b) of the Hague Convention.",

In this aspect the court found relevant that L. was only one and a half years old and if returned to France he would be deprived of all maternal care. Thus, under Article 13 of the Hague Convention, the Hungarian courts were not bound to order the child\u2019s return. The court also held that Article\u00a011 \u00a7\u00a04 of the Brussels II bis Regulation was not applicable, since no measures or arrangements were available to secure the protection of L. after his return.",

He also argued that he had contributed to the child\u2019s care and that his employment, which allowed him to provide for his family, could not be held against him. Furthermore, the decisions had failed to take into account L.\u2019s best interests, which lay in his being raised by both of his parents. He also maintained that his lack of contact with L. was due to K.B.V.\u2019s own conduct and the fact that he had not been aware of the child\u2019s place of residence until August 2014. Finally, the lower-instance courts had not respected the six-week deadline stipulated by the Brussels II\u00a0bis Regulation.",

According to its reasoning both the Brussels II bis Regulation and the Hague Convention had established the presumption that a child\u2019s interests could best be served by his immediate return to his habitual residence. However, under Article 13 of the Hague Convention this presumption could be rebutted in exceptional circumstances. It agreed with the applicant that the child\u2019s young age, his close connection to the parent living in Hungary and his Hungarian roots could not serve as a basis for the refusal to order his return to France. It nonetheless held that at the time of his abduction L. had only been two and a half months old and that a considerable time had passed without him having contact with the applicant. The reason for this was that the applicant had refused to see L. at the premises of a child protection service, as suggested by K.B.V. The K\u00faria also found it important that according to the applicant\u2019s own statements his sister would take care of L. if the child were returned to France and that, according to the decision of the French courts, K.B.V. would only have very limited contact with L. Furthermore, there was no information about any measure of protection envisaged in the event of L.\u2019s return. Thus, the K\u00faria concluded that the return of the child, who was less than two years old, to an unknown environment would cause serious psychological harm.",

However, the proceedings before the Thonon-Les-Bains tribunal de grande instance had failed to respect K.B.V.\u2019s right to a fair trial, since \u2013 owing to the fact that the applicant had given false information to the French authorities \u2013 she had not been informed of the proceedings and had not been able to be heard in person.

It also held that it had jurisdiction under Article\u00a08 (1) of the Brussels II bis Regulation, since the child\u2019s habitual residence was in Hungary. As to the interim resolution of custody rights, the Court held that the interests of the child could be best served if he remained in his habitual environment \u2013 that is to say in the company of his mother and maternal grandparents \u2013 and that removing him from Hungary would pose a risk of causing him psychological harm.",

As to the decision on the non-recognition of the judgments delivered by the French courts, it found that recognition could not be refused on the basis that K.B.V. had not been heard in person before the French courts, since the Brussels II\u00a0bis Regulation did not stipulate such an obligation and the mother could have submitted written observations. Nonetheless, the court found that the recognition of the foreign judgments could not be recognised, pursuant to Article 23(b) of the Brussels II bis Regulation, since recognition would have been contrary to the public policy of Hungary, given that the best interests of the child had only been respected in a formalistic way. According to the High Court, restricting the mother\u2019s contact with L. to two hours every second week would have caused harm to L., especially since the applicant himself had stated that L. would be looked after by his sister. The court also had regard to the forensic psychiatric opinion prepared by Dr\u00a0Gy.L.K. on 28\u00a0August 2014 and supplemented by L.K. on 6 March 2015, according to which  from a psychological point of view \u2013 the enforcement of the French courts\u2019 judgment would constitute \u201cinstitutional abuse\u201d. Furthermore, the court found that no measures were being contemplated by the applicant to ensure the protection of the child after his return to France.",

Under the Brussels II\u00a0bis Regulation, which builds on the Hague Convention and is based on the principle of mutual trust between EU member States, the competency to assess whether non-return would be in the child\u2019s best interest is distributed as follows: the State to which the child has been wrongfully removed can oppose his or her return in justified cases. However, under Article 11 \u00a7 8 of the Brussels II\u00a0bis Regulation, the State in which the child had its habitual residence prior to the wrongful removal can override a decision refusing to order that child\u2019s return, pursuant to Article 13 of the Hague Convention. If such a decision is accompanied by a certificate of enforceability, pursuant to Article 42 of the Regulation, the requested State has to enforce it. Under Article 47 of the Regulation, the law of the State of enforcement applies to any enforcement proceedings (see M.A. v. Austria, no. 4097/13, \u00a7\u00a7 112 and 114, 15\u00a0January 2015).

They contrasted the child\u2019s best interests with the existing evidence to the effect that L. had had no contact with the applicant for a considerable amount of time and that if L. were taken back to France he would be looked after by a person unknown to him in an environment also unknown to him and that he would have had only limited contact with his mother, despite his very young age.

In these proceedings the domestic courts found that although Article 21 of the Brussels II\u00a0bis Regulation provided that such a judgment is to be recognised without any special procedure, the exception under Article 23(a) of the Brussels II bis Regulation was applicable, as the French courts\u2019 judgments were contrary to the public policy of Hungary. Namely, according to the courts\u2019 reasoning, the French judgments had taken into account the child\u2019s best interests only in a purely formalistic manner (see paragraph 24 above) and had infringed fundamental rights, in particular the respect for the child\u2019s best interest (see paragraph 34 above).",
