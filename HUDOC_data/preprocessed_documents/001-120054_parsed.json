Although the Government have disputed the applicant\u2019s factual allegations in this respect they have accepted that, should duress have been proven, as a matter of Bulgarian law, this would have invaldiated the termination order. The issue of duress was thus the central issue in the proceedings before the Supreme Administative Court. This was, moreover, a question of fact and, as such, could only have been determined by the Supreme Administrative Court considering the parties\u2019 evidence.

It preferred instead to determine the application for judicial review in the applicant\u2019s favour only on the narrower question of sick leave. Thereafter, on appeal the five-member panel, which was limited to examining only the written evidence in the case, summarily quashed the judgment of the threemember panel without dealing with his complaint regarding duress. The effect of the five-member panel\u2019s decision was to quash a decision which had been favourable to the applicant without affording him any opportunity to have his principal ground of challenge against his dismissal considered. This meant that the essence of the applicant\u2019s complaint was in fact never judically examined by the Supreme Administrative Court and, thus, there was no proper judicial determination of his application for judicial review (see, for instance, Yanakiev v. , no. 40476/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a068-72, 10 August 2006).

This reflected twenty-three and a half hours\u2019 work on the proceedings before the Court (at the rate of EUR 60 per hour). He requested that EUR 102 of any award made under this head be paid directly to him (since he had already paid that sum to his lawyers) and the remainder to his legal representative. He claimed a further 360 Bulgarian levs (BGN) (EUR\u00a0153) in costs and expenses (covering postal and translation services) and asked that this sum be paid directly to him. In support of these claims he submitted a fee agreement between him and his legal representative, a time sheet, contracts for translation services and various postal receipts.",

In the present case, the Court notes that the hourly rate charged by the applicants\u2019 lawyers is comparable to those charged in recent cases against Bulgaria having a similar complexity (see, as recent authority, Finger v. , no. 37346/05, \u00a7 142, 10 May 2011 with further references therein). It can thus be regarded as reasonable. However, the Court agrees with the Government that the number of hours for which the applicant\u2019s legal representative charged appears to be excessively high. Considering this, and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,000 in costs. EUR\u00a0102 of that amount is to be paid to the applicant himself and the remainder to his legal representative.",

Under the Court\u2019s case-law, only the latter may be reimbursed as having being necessarily incurred (see United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others v.  (no. 2), no. 34960/04, \u00a7 59, 18 October 2011). Accordingly, the Court awards him BGN 135 for translation services and a further BGN 30 to cover the postal expenses he has actually incurred, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him. Converted into euros, the total sum awarded in respect of expense comes to EUR 84. This is to be paid to the applicant himself.",
