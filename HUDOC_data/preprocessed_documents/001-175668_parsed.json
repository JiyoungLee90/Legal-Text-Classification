In any event, the penalty of administrative detention could only be imposed by a court and only in exceptional circumstances, when a less intrusive penalty (such as a fine) would not be appropriate.

The Court has held in various contexts that, where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them (see, among other authorities, Giuliani and Gaggio v.

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability, but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article\u00a019 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a  has violated fundamental rights (see Nachova and Others v.

Russia, no.\u00a052783/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049-50, 11\u00a0October 2016; Aleksandr Sokolov v. Russia, no.\u00a020364/05, \u00a7\u00a066, 4 November 2010; and Smirnova v.

For its part, the Court notes that the Russian Criminal Code contained Article 149 making it a criminal offence for a public official to obstruct a public assembly, in particular with recourse to physical force; Article 286 punishing abuse of power by a public official (a statutory provision frequently used, for instance, in relation to complaints arising in the context of use of force by the police, with or without a related issue concerning deprivation of liberty, see Aleksandr\u00a0Andreyev v. Russia, no. 2281/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-45 and 47-51, 23\u00a0February 2016); Articles 127 and\u00a0301 of the Criminal Code punishing unlawful deprivation of liberty and the manifestly unlawful recourse to the arrest procedure or the procedure for detention on remand. The Court observes that the thrust of the applicants\u2019 related complaint concerns the use of force during the public event and injuries sustained at the hands of public officials (see, inter alia, Mostipan v. Russia, no.\u00a012042/09, \u00a7 38, 16 October 2014 concerning recourse to the criminal-complaint procedure for illtreatment complaints). The Court has been given no reason to rule out this procedure, thus it should be taken into account for the purposes of the six-month rule in the present case (see also paragraph 73 above).",

Under the CComP, an application for supervisory review was to be lodged within three months of the date of the last impugned judgment being issued.

Following the legislative reform in December 2008, entailing the deletion of Article\u00a030.11 which was at the heart of the 2006 constitutional decision, it is questionable whether that decision could continue to serve as a legal basis under Russian law for characterising the amended review procedure as based on the new Article 30.12 of the CAO. Be that as it may, it is noted that the review procedure remained essentially similar to the previous supervisory-review procedure under Article 30.11 of the CAO. The Court accepts that it was not immediately obvious to the applicants in 2009 that it might no longer be appropriate to rely on the 2006 constitutional ruling and the rules of the CComP (compare Smadikov, cited above). As a matter of fact, having used the \u201cordinary\u201d appeal procedure, the applicants did not then procrastinate, and promptly lodged their applications for review within the three-month time-limit mentioned in the CComP. Importantly, the Court notes the applicants\u2019 argument that their application for review was justified by the apparent divergent interpretation and application of the CAO in what seemed to be the same factual circumstances relating to the events on 7 and 10 August 2009. In view of the nearly identical trial judgments in respect of all applicants, and following the quashing of the judgments in respect of ten applicants by the District Court, the Court accepts that the remaining four applicants (who had already served their penalties of administrative detention, which were enforceable immediately following the trial judgment) could reasonably have considered that they had prospects of success in further challenging the final decisions in their own cases, including the appeal decisions issued by the same District Court.",

As such, this right covers both private \u201cassemblies\u201d and \u201cassemblies\u201d in public places, whether static or in the form of a procession; in addition, it can be exercised by individual participants and by persons organising a gathering (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v.

Article 11 of the Convention only protects the right to freedom of \u201cpeaceful\u201d assembly, a notion which does not cover a demonstration where the organisers and participants have violent intentions.

These circumstances were not subjected to any adequate scrutiny during the administrative-offence proceedings or the criminal inquiry. Nor did the parties make any specific submissions before the Court on the above matters. It cannot be said that the applicants were reproached by the domestic authorities for any specific act of violence or for having any violent intentions.\u00a0In this connection, the Court reiterates that an individual does not cease to enjoy the right to freedom of peaceful assembly as a result of sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by others in the course of a demonstration if the individual in question remains peaceful in his or her own intentions or behaviour (see Ziliberberg v.\u00a0Moldova (dec.), no.\u00a061821/00, 4 May 2004). The possibility of persons with violent intentions, not members of the organising association, joining a demonstration cannot as such take away that right (see Primov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 17391/06, \u00a7 155, 12 June 2014). Even if there is a real risk that a public demonstration might result in disorder as a result of developments outside the control of those organising it, such a demonstration does not as such fall outside the scope of Article 11 \u00a7 1, and any restriction placed thereon must be in conformity with the terms of paragraph\u00a02 of that provision (see Taranenko, cited above, \u00a7 66).",

In particular, while there are some indications of a fight on 10\u00a0August 2009 between certain protesters and security guards employed by a private company (see paragraphs 34 above), there is nothing to suggest that Mr Buzov himself participated in this fight or otherwise behaved violently. The appeal decision in respect of Mr Khripunov mentions that he \u201cgrabbed an [officer\u2019s] uniform and tried to escape\u201d (see paragraph 23 above). However, that decision contains no particular assessment of the factual allegation vis\u00e0-vis the charge of disobeying the lawful order of a public official. In the Court\u2019s view, this element is not sufficient for declaring Article 11 of the Convention inapplicable.
