The Court answers this question in the negative. While the first two periods of pre-trial detention constitute a situation where the applicant continued to be deprived of liberty pending an appeal hearing, the conviction subsequently being quashed on appeal (see, for example, Solmaz v. Turkey, no.\u00a027561/02, \u00a7\u00a7 34-37, 16 January 2007), after the second conviction became final he had been serving a prison sentence before the third period of pre-trial detention had started. In the Court\u2019s view, these circumstances had the effect of triggering the application of the six-month rule referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 in respect of the first two periods of \npre-trial detention (see Nasakin v. Russia, no. 22735/05, \u00a7\u00a083, 18 July 2013, and, mutatis mutandis, Idalov v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a05826/03, \u00a7\u00a7 127-33, 22\u00a0May 2012).",
