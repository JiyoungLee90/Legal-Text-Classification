This plan included blocking traffic routes around Taksim Square and rebuilding barracks (demolished in 1940) in order to create a shopping centre in the new premises. These barracks were to be built on the site of Gezi Park, one of the few green spaces in the centre of Istanbul. Professional bodies such as the Chamber of Architects and the Chamber of Landscape Architects brought numerous administrative proceedings in an attempt to have the project set aside. In 2012 several demonstrations were organised to protest against the planned destruction of Gezi Park. Platforms bringing together several associations, trade unions, professional bodies and political parties, including the \u201cTaksim Solidarity\u201d (Taksim Dayan\u0131\u015fma) collective, were accordingly set up to coordinate and organise the protests.",

On 31 May 2013, however, the police intervened violently to remove the persons occupying the park. There were confrontations between the police and the demonstrators. The protests then escalated in June and July and spread to several towns and cities in Turkey, taking the form of meetings and demonstrations which sometimes led to violent clashes.

Another important factor was the failure of the mainstream media to report on the initial events owing to self-censorship. The initial confrontation led to a wave of demonstrations against the government across Turkey, unprecedented both in their geographic scope and in the numbers of participants. During the initial phases of the events, participation was wide-ranging, including professional associations such as the Chambers of Architects and Engineers, Bar Associations and Medical Associations, trade unions, and many NGOs active in different sectors, such as the environment, women\u2019s rights, LGBTI rights, and human rights in general, as well as citizens\u2019 platforms and other spontaneous initiatives co-ordinating the participation of civil society. Among these, \u201cTaksim Solidarity\u201d was considered to be the most representative and had played a very prominent role during these events. Accordingly, the Commissioner\u2019s predecessor had also met representatives of this platform during the above-mentioned visit. The applicant was not part of this civil-society platform.",

We could talk about [the following topics]; before the local elections [local elections were held in Turkey on 30 March 2014], our dream is actually to see a more transparent, more participatory model of local government emerge following the Gezi events; that is, the energy that has emerged from this [the events in Gezi Park] should continue to be an element of democratic opposition or to function as a means of democratic pressure (\u201cdemokratik muhalefet unsuru olarak veya demokratik bask\u0131 arac\u0131 olarak i\u015flev g\u00f6rmeye devam etmesi\u201d)... Now, to realize these dreams or plans, we have thought of some things, to see what the new political equation will be or how political alliances could be formed, while also of course thinking a bit about certain aspects that are related to the objectives at the outset. In other words, if we start thinking about this, what model can best serve these objectives? What political actors could be useful for these objectives, and without focusing too much on names, are there a few things we could do? For example, [could we] support municipal council candidates who accept such and such requests? That is, how can we make progress in strengthening transparency within municipalities in an institutional way and civil society\u2019s control over these bodies [\u201cbelediyelerin kurumsal olarak \u015feffafla\u015fmalar\u0131na ve sivil toplumun denetimine a\u00e7\u0131k olmalar\u0131na imkan verecek bir tak\u0131m ad\u0131mlar nas\u0131l at\u0131labilir\u201d]? After all this, we will probably achieve something [.] But we can ask ourselves the question how things will go if the AKP wins the elections again.

With regard to the lawfulness of the order placing the applicant in pre-trial detention, it concluded, by ten votes to five, that there had been no violation of Article 19 of the Constitution. In so doing, the Constitution Court noted, inter alia, that numerous violent acts had been committed during the Gezi events, civilians and police officers had lost their lives, thousands of persons had been injured and several criminal investigations had been opened against the persons responsible for these acts. It considered that, by virtue of his social status and having regard to his national and international contacts, the applicant had been in a position to foresee the consequences of those events and the fact that the demonstrations in question would degenerate into violence. It considered that, taken together, the following elements - listed in the decisions relating to the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention and in the bill of indictment (see paragraphs\u00a067-69 of the judgment) - were sufficient to give rise to a strong suspicion concerning his responsibility with regard to the acts of violence committed during the Gezi events and the ultimate aim of those acts, namely the overthrow of the Government: the content of the conversation between the applicant and H.H.G. (see paragraph 51 above); the fact that the applicant had mentioned the political repercussions of the Gezi events during a telephone conversation; the fact that he had given assistance to the demonstrators by providing premises for meetings and equipment, including gas masks; the fact that he had organised meetings and taken part in them; the fact that he had provided financial backing to persons who supported these events; and the fact that he had worked to obtain public support for the Gezi events. The Constitutional Court concluded that in the light of these elements, the finding that there existed factual evidence giving rise to a strong suspicion that the alleged offence has been committed seemed neither arbitrary nor unjustified.",

They also stated that the case file was not sufficient to establish that the applicant had been involved in committing violent acts. They added that in its previous judgments in cases concerning the Gezi events, the Constitutional Court had held on several occasions that there had been a violation of the right to peaceful assembly, and had even held that the disproportionate use of force by the police, against a demonstrator who had not participated in violence, was likely to have a dissuasive effect on the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. They also criticised the fact that the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention four years after the Gezi events. In particular, they emphasised that the evidence had been gathered during the initial phase of the investigation and it did not appear from the case materials that the authorities had gathered significant new evidence in the subsequent phases of the investigation that was likely to alter its course. Two of the three also considered that the evidence in the file did not prove that offences punishable under Articles 309 and 312 of the Criminal Code had been committed. In particular, they stressed that one of the material elements constituting the alleged offences was the use of \u201cforce\u201d or \u201cviolence\u201d.",

Referring to the relevant case-law of the Constitutional Court, he stated that that court ought to have examined the items of evidence one by one, but that in the present case, it had, on the contrary, taken a holistic approach. He added that the main problem in the majority decision was, in his view, the question of the proportionality of the measure. In his opinion, the fact of placing a suspect in pre-trial detention four years after the events in question could not be considered as a proportional measure.

According to the applicant, M.P. explained that he had met members of the Security Directorate on several occasions to discuss his academic research and had replied to their questions. However, he denied having made an incriminating statement. M.P. stated that he taken an active part in the Gezi events, which, in his view, were legitimate and fair demonstrations, and that he had been injured during disproportionate police interventions. He refuted the version that these demonstrations had been directed and financed by international institutions.

Admittedly, as emphasised by the Government, the principle of subsidiarity encapsulates a norm of power distribution between the Court and the member States, with the ultimate aim of securing to every person who finds himself or herself within the jurisdiction of a State the rights and freedoms provided by the Convention. In other words, in accordance with Article\u00a01 of the Convention, it is the national authorities which are the primary guarantors of human rights, subject to the supervision of the Court. It is in the name of rapid and efficient, and thus a priori effective, protection of the rights of individuals that the principle of subsidiarity legitimises the primary responsibility of the member States. Since the system of national protection implies confidence in the national judicial authorities, who are normally better placed to intervene than the international judge, this principle thus incorporates the very idea of the effectiveness of rights, whose primary guarantors are ultimately the national authorities. It follows that where the system of national protection is incapable of responding effectively to complaints under Article 5 of the Convention, the Court may draw general or case-specific conclusions.",

The applicant argued that this allegation was based on the fact that his mobile telephone and that of H.J.B. had emitted signals from the same base receiver station. In fact, this station covered a large central district in which many hotels and his office were located. In his opinion, this element alone was therefore insufficient to substantiate the prosecution\u2019s argument, especially since, as the case file showed, his mobile phone was being tapped at the relevant time, and the investigating authorities could therefore have obtained direct evidence had such intensive contacts genuinely occurred.",

Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or discontinuing suspicions which provide the grounds for detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Murray v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October 1994, \u00a7\u00a055, Series A no. 300A).",

The fact that a suspicion is held in good faith is insufficient. The words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d mean the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence. What may be regarded as \u201creasonable\u201d will however depend upon all the circumstances (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no.\u00a0182; see also Ilgar Mammadov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 15172/13, \u00a7 88, 22 May 2014; and Rasul Jafarov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 69981/14, \u00a7\u00a7 117-118, 17 March 2016).

Consequently the respondent Government have to furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence (ibid., \u00a7 34 in fine).",

For these reasons, hearsay evidence must be supported by objective evidence. This is especially true when a decision is being made whether to prolong detention pending trial: while a suspect may validly be detained at the beginning of proceedings on the basis of statements by indirect witnesses, such statements necessarily become less relevant with the passage of time, especially where no further evidence is uncovered during the course of the investigation (see Labita v.

In addition, it appears from the case file that the restriction on access to the investigation file ordered on 20 October 2017 by the magistrate\u2019s court (see paragraph\u00a031 above) remained valid until the adoption of the bill of indictment on 4\u00a0March 2019 (see paragraph 56 above).

In addition, it cannot overlook the fact that the applicant was arrested on 18 October 2017 and that the bill of indictment in respect of some of the charges against him was filed only on 19\u00a0February 2019. This means that for sixteen months after he had been placed in detention, the applicant was held without having been charged by the prosecutor\u2019s office. As the Commissioner for Human Rights has pointed out, the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention could have a dissuasive effect on the non-governmental organisations whose activities are related to matters of public interest (see, mutatis mutandis, Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no.\u00a018030/11, \u00a7 164, 8 November 2016).

This pressure had notably included a series of specific attacks by politicians and a general political discourse targeting civil-society activists, in particular by suggesting that reporting on alleged human-rights violations perpetrated by the authorities furthered the aims of terrorist organisations and was by extension an attack on the Turkish State. According to the Commissioner, these statements frequently resulted in actions by public officials to restrict such work. For example, the police and local authorities had started to prevent NGOs, including Amnesty International, from visiting certain areas of the country following a statement by the President of the Republic in April 2016 whereby NGOs publishing reports on the human-rights situation needed to be \u201ccountered\u201d.",

In addition, it can only be noted that there is a correlation between, on the one hand, the accusations made openly against the applicant in these two public speeches and, on the other, the wording of the charges in the bill of indictment, filed about three months after the speeches in question (see, a contrario, Merabishvili, cited above, \u00a7 324, and Tchankotadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a015256/05, \u00a7 114, 21\u00a0June 2016).",

Moreover, the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s office referred in the bill of indictment to the activities of NGOs and their financing by legal means, without however indicating in what way this was relevant to the accusations it was bringing, is also such as to support that assertion. The Court is also aware of the concerns expressed by the Commissioner for Human Rights and the third-party interveners, who consider that the applicant\u2019s detention is part of a wider campaign of repression of human-rights defenders in Turkey.",

A mere suspicion on the part of the investigative authorities will not suffice. The elements satisfying the standard of reasonable suspicion must exist and must be available to an objective observer prior to a procedural act for which reasonable suspicion is required (such as a detention order or search and seizure warrant).

Furthermore, it extensively examines the bill of indictment in respect of the Gezi Park events (see paragraphs 144-150). Finally, it attaches weight to the content of the interview conducted with the applicant on 31 October 2017 (see paragraphs 143, 147, 148 and 152), as well as the fact that after the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention, the authorities did not apparently gather any important new evidence indicating that the applicant was the main instigator of the Gezi Park events (see paragraph 151).

While the content of these submissions does not alter the Court\u2019s findings in the present case, one could imagine a future scenario where the respondent Government would produce particularly convincing elements demonstrating reasonable suspicion which would otherwise not be discernible from the domestic decisions on detention. Would the Court then find that the reasonable suspicion standard has been met? The logic of the arguments in the present judgment would suggest that it should. I strongly believe it should not. Alternatively, if an applicant were to produce, in his submissions to the Court, strong evidence rebutting reasonable suspicion, would the Court hold that the applicant\u2019s detention was not Convention-compliant although reasonable suspicion had been perfectly demonstrated in the domestic court\u2019s order to detain him?

It is therefore clear that the applicant was not detained on the basis of the indictment, and that the facts and evidence set out therein could not, even in theory, satisfy the standard of reasonable suspicion for the purpose of detention. In the majority reasoning (see paragraph\u00a0137), the alleged relevance of the bill of indictment is based on the fact that the Constitutional Court, which decided on the applicant\u2019s individual application on 22\u00a0May 2019, had regard to that prosecutorial document. However, the Constitutional Court apparently conducted an autonomous assessment of the existing evidence, not relying specifically on the bill of indictment and its assertions (see paragraph 60).",

In this connection, I wish to underline that the requirement that reasonable suspicion exist prior to the procedural decision for which it is required is an important, but not the only impediment to such an approach. Specifically, prosecutorial documents are submissions by one of the parties to the criminal proceedings. As such, they cannot in themselves qualify as the findings of an objective observer, a quality that is required in examining the existence of reasonable suspicion. They can be taken into account in as much as the elements they contain have been expressly embraced by a judicial decision on detention, which must also have demonstrated an articulable link between the act allegedly committed by the suspect and the evidence submitted in support of that claim.

Similarly, emphasizing (in paragraph 151) the fact that the authorities failed to gather any new evidence during the applicant\u2019s detention creates a wrong impression that incriminating evidence against the applicant, if subsequently collected and submitted in the domestic proceedings, could substitute for the lack of initial reasonable suspicion.

In this respect, I observe that the initial decision of 1 November 2017 ordering the applicant\u2019s detention is of central importance. The subsequent decisions extending the applicant\u2019s detention mainly referred to the evidence cited in that decision, adding also a report by the Financial Crimes Investigation Committee (\u201cMASAK\u201d) \u2013 see paragraphs 38 and 42-46 of the judgment.",

The applicant does not dispute the existence of such contacts or even this support. What is in dispute between the parties is whether there exists a reasonable suspicion that the applicant assisted the organisers in their alleged attempt to overthrow the Government by force and violence, this in turn being a constitutive element of the crime proscribed by Article 312 of the Turkish Criminal Code. However, none of the detention decisions contains any evidentiary elements which could constitute an articulable link between the applicant\u2019s acts, which were largely undisputed, and an alleged attempt to overthrow the Government by violence or force. While it is questionable whether the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment could in any way substitute for the above-mentioned insufficiencies in the decisions ordering and extending the applicant\u2019s detention, inasmuch as it apparently added further arguments in respect of the alleged reasonable suspicion, I believe that those additional arguments (see paragraph 60 of the present judgment) would not warrant the conclusion by a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, that the applicant attempted to overthrow the Government by force and violence.",

It may well be that in a given case, in spite of the absence of objective elements justifying reasonable suspicion, the authorities of a respondent State continue, perhaps irrationally, to cultivate completely subjective suspicions against an individual.

Azerbaijan, no.\u00a069981/14, \u00a7\u00a0116, 17\u00a0March 2016). Furthermore, the existence of reasonable suspicion requires that the facts relied on can reasonably be considered as criminal behavior under domestic law. In the present case, as was pointed out in the judgment, \u201cThe Court must ... take into account ... the authorities\u2019 concerns relating to the large number of deaths and injuries which occurred during those events and the public unrest caused. In this regard, it notes the information supplied by the Government to the effect that four civilians and two police officers lost their lives, thousands of people were wounded and numerous acts of vandalism were committed. The Court considers that in such circumstances it is perfectly legitimate for the authorities to investigate these incidents, in order to identify the perpetrators of these violent acts and to bring them to justice\u201d (see paragraph 142 of the judgment). The applicant was suspected of being the instigator and leader of the Gezi events, which, as stated in the judgment, gradually transformed into violent demonstrations against the Government. The applicant was therefore placed in pre-trial detention on charges relating to the two offences set out in Articles\u00a0309 and 312 of the Criminal Code.",

To the extent that the approach in the present judgment is in line with the dissenting opinions of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment, it should be noted that the dissenting judges made their assessment on the basis of whether there was \u201cstrong suspicion\u201d, which is a higher standard of protection than \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d. Pursuant to Article 19 (3) of the Constitution, individuals may be detained provided that there are strong presumptions that they have committed an offence.",

In this respect, I believe that the lack of adequate reasoning in the initial decision to detain the applicant and the subsequent decisions extending his detention could be considered as the basis of finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1. Taking into account the lack of reasoning and lack of application of the proportionality standard in the context of the circumstances of the present case, the domestic courts failed to demonstrate that the applicant had instigated the violent events and thus to justify the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the related offence. In addition, by using stereotyped and formulaic reasons, they also failed to provide sufficient reasoning to justify the extension of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.",

In my view, even if the applicant was also suspected of having committed an offence under Article 309 of the Criminal Code (attempting to overthrow the constitutional order), the present judgment considers this case to be more concerned with the Gezi Park events and not, strictly speaking, a \u201cpost-15\u00a0July case\u201d, and thus puts emphasis on the duration of the Constitutional Court\u2019s review after the state of emergency was lifted.
