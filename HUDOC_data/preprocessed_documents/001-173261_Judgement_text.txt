The case originated in an application (no. 30376/13) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Ms Gordana Jurica (“the applicant”), on 11 April 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr D. Ivanić, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.
The applicant complained of lack of an effective domestic procedure to deal with her allegations of medical negligence, contrary to Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention.
On 18 December 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Zagreb.
In the period between 1987 and 1989 the applicant underwent several operations in the Zagreb Clinical Hospital Centre “Sestre Milosrdnice” (Klinički bolnički centar Sestre Milosrdnice – hereinafter “the hospital”), a public health-care institution, for a middle-ear dysfunction.
Following surgery in October 1989 the applicant’s condition deteriorated, resulting in paralysis of the left side of her face. In this connection, she underwent further treatment until July 1997, when it was found that her condition was such that she would not recover. The applicant took early retirement on grounds of disability.
On 29 January 1998 the applicant lodged a civil action against the hospital and the relevant insurance company with the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court (Općinski (građanski sud) u Zagrebu), claiming damages for alleged medical malpractice.
In September 1998 the applicant urged the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court to schedule a hearing in her case.
The parties exchanged further submissions in February and March 1999. The applicant submitted an expert report drafted by V.F., according to which her medical condition had notably deteriorated in January 1997.
The first hearing before the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court was held on 17 September 1999. Following questioning of the applicant, the hearing was adjourned until further notice.
In October 1999 and May 2000 the applicant urged the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court to speed up the proceedings.
On 27 September 2000 a hearing was held at which the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court decided to commission an expert report concerning the circumstances of the applicant’s treatment.
On 14 November 2000 experts R.T. and P.S. were commissioned to write the report.
In December 2000 P.S. produced a report in which he stated that he had found no indications of medical malpractice in the applicant’s treatment.
R.T. asked to be excluded from the proceedings on the grounds that he was employed in the hospital and that therefore an issue as to his impartiality could arise. As a result of his withdrawal, on 16 January 2001 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court commissioned a report from another expert, J.G.
In her report of 5 February 2001, J.G. found that the applicant’s condition was irreversible, but did not provide any conclusive findings as to the alleged medical negligence.
On the basis of an objection by the applicant to J.G.’s findings, on 8 March 2001 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court invited the expert to supplement her report with findings concerning the applicant’s allegations of medical malpractice.
On 9 April 2001 J.G. submitted a supplement to her report, finding that there were no indications of medical negligence in the applicant’s treatment.
In April 2001 the applicant challenged J.G.’s findings and asked the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court to question the experts at a hearing.
On 8 November 2001 a hearing was held for the questioning of the experts, who reiterated their findings. The Zagreb Municipal Civil Court found that it was necessary to commission another expert report from the University of Zagreb Medical Faculty (Medicinski fakultet Sveučilišta u Zagrebu) concerning the question whether the applicant’s condition was a result of medical negligence.
An expert report was commissioned from the University of Zagreb Medical Faculty on 14 January 2002.
The University of Zagreb Medical Faculty produced a report on 28 April 2005. It found that the applicant’s facial paralysis was a result of complications during surgery and not medical malpractice.
In response to the expert report of the University of Zagreb Medical Faculty, the applicant specified her claim, arguing that the report established a causal connection between the surgery and the deterioration of her health. She also considered that according to the principle of objective liability, the hospital was responsible. The applicant did not express any objections concerning the report.
In September and December 2006 the applicant urged the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court to schedule a hearing.
At a hearing held on 2 February 2007 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court questioned the applicant and ordered that the experts from the University of Zagreb Medical Faculty, N.Šp. and J.Šk., be questioned at the next hearing.
On 24 May 2007 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court heard evidence from N.Šp. and J.Šk. They reiterated their findings, according to which the deterioration of the applicant’s condition had been a result of complications during surgery.
A further hearing was held on 16 May 2008 at which the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court decided that K.R., the doctor who had treated the applicant, would be questioned as a witness.
A hearing on 17 October 2008 was adjourned because K.R., who at the time lived in Serbia, had not been properly summoned to appear as a witness.
At a hearing on 4 December 2008 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court questioned the applicant. It also found that K.R. had not been properly summoned.
On 22 April 2009 a hearing was held at which the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court questioned K.R., who explained the circumstances of the applicant’s operations and further treatment.
On 7 May 2009 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court commissioned another expert report from D.V. with regard to the question of a causal link between the applicant’s condition and her disability pension. In a report of 8 July 2009 the expert found that there was a direct causal link between the applicant’s condition and her retirement on grounds of disability.
At a hearing on 20 January 2010 the applicant asked that experts from another European Union State be appointed as expert witnesses in her case. The Zagreb Municipal Civil Court dismissed that request and concluded the hearing.
In a further submission of the same date the applicant challenged the impartiality of the expert witnesses from Croatia, arguing that it was clear from the negligible number of cases where medical malpractice had been established that they were biased in favour of the defendants.
On 29 January 2010 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court dismissed the applicant’s civil action, holding that in the case at issue the principle of presumed fault (presumirane krivnje) should be applied. That meant that it was for the defendants to show that the hospital had acted in accordance with professional standards and that the damage was not the result of a lack of diligence on the part of the doctor who had performed the surgery. Relying on a detailed assessment of the expert reports obtained during the proceedings, the court found that on the facts of the case, the deterioration of the applicant’s health had been a result of complications in the treatment and not of medical malpractice. It also pointed out that there was nothing putting into doubt the quality of the expert reports commissioned during the proceedings and that the applicant’s request that another expert report be commissioned from abroad would unnecessarily further prolong the proceedings and generate further expense.
On 17 March 2010 the applicant appealed against that judgment before the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) alleging, inter alia, that the medical experts who had drafted the reports had a personal and professional conflict of interest in the proceedings, as they involved allegations of malpractice against their colleagues and the experts were financially dependent on the hospital system.
On 14 September 2010 the Zagreb County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded on the grounds that there was no reason to doubt the quality and findings of the expert reports.
On 11 November 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske), reiterating her previous arguments concerning lack of impartiality on the part of the experts and the quality of the expert reports commissioned during the proceedings.
On 31 August 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts.
On 2 June 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) complaining of lack of an effective procedure before the competent civil courts to deal with her allegations of medical negligence. She also reiterated her complaints as to the lack of impartiality of the medical experts, arguing that the relevant statistics showed that it had been impossible to establish her allegations of medical negligence on the basis of the expert reports commissioned from the domestic experts.
On 26 September 2012 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant on 12 October 2012.
On 7 January 2008 the applicant complained to the Zagreb County Court about the excessive length of the proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court.
On 26 August 2008 the Zagreb County Court found a violation of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time and awarded her 11,000 Croatian kunas (HRK – approximately 1,530 euros (EUR)) in compensation. It also ordered the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court to terminate the proceedings within a further period of eight months following the service of its decision.
The decision of the Zagreb County Court was served on the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court on 22 October 2008.
The relevant domestic law concerning civil responsibility for medical negligence under the Civil Obligations Act (Zakon o obveznim odnosima) is set out in the case of Kudra v. Croatia, no. 13904/07, § 83, 18 December 2012.
In addition to the provisions on civil responsibility, the relevant domestic law provides for a comprehensive set of norms and principles on the professional responsibility of doctors for medical malpractice (see M.S. v. Croatia (no. 2), no. 75450/12, §§ 37-39, 19 February 2015, and Bilbija and Blažević v. Croatia, no. 62870/13, § 78, 12 January 2016).
Medical negligence is also a criminal offence under the Criminal Code (Kazneni zakon). Article 166 of the consolidated text of the 1993 Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia (Official Gazette no. 31/1993), incorporating the Criminal Code of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (Official Gazette nos. 25/1977; 50/1978; 25/1984; 52/1987; 43/1989; 8/1990; 9/1991; 33/1992; 39/1992; 77/92; and 91/1992) defined medical malpractice as medical treatment by the application of an obviously inadequate remedy or method of treatment, by failure to apply the relevant hygiene standards, or by generally acting carelessly and thus causing damage to health. Further amendments to the Criminal Code removed the reference to “hygiene standards” and inserted a reference to the necessity to observe the relevant professional standards in medical treatment (see Bajić v. Croatia, no. 41108/10, § 50, 13 November 2012; and Article 181 of the Criminal Code, Official Gazette nos. 125/2011, 144/2012, 56/2015 and 61/2015).
The position of court experts in civil proceedings is regulated under sections 251-262 of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 58/1993, 112/1999, 88/2001, 117/2003, 88/2005, 2/2007, 84/2008, 123/2008, 57/2011, 148/2011, 25/2013 and 89/2014).
Under section 251 of the Civil Procedure Act, as applicable at the relevant time, the commissioning of an expert report was within the competence of the court conducting the proceedings. Before commissioning an expert report, the competent court was required to hear the parties with regard to the choice of expert (section 251(2) of the Civil Procedure Act). If the particular circumstances of the case so required, the competent court was allowed to commission a report from another expert.
An expert report is principally commissioned from a permanent court expert. However, under section 252(2) of the Civil Procedure Act, a report may be commissioned from an institution (including a public institution such as a university), and if the matter at issue concerns specific and complex professional questions, the report must be primarily commissioned from a specialist institution.
The provisions on the disqualification of judges are applicable mutatis mutandis to the disqualification of experts (sections 254-255 of the Civil Procedure Act).
Under section 258 of the Civil Procedure Act court experts are required to provide their opinions objectively, impartially and to the best of their knowledge. Experts are also informed of the legal consequences of perjury.
Sections 259-261 of the Civil Procedure Act regulate the way in which an expert report is to be examined. In particular, the judge conducting the proceedings sets out the scope and aim of the expert report and directs the expert witness as to the particular issues on which he or she should give an opinion. The expert has to provide a reasoned opinion either in the form of a written report or orally at the hearing, depending on the instruction of the judge conducting the proceedings. If the expert fails to meet those requirements, he or she can be questioned again concerning the particular issues, or another expert report may be commissioned from the same or a different expert. In each case, however, the expert opinion must be subjected to adversarial argument by the parties and examination by the competent court.
In addition to the Civil Procedure Act, the position of court experts is determined by the Court Experts Ordinance (Pravilnik o stalnim sudskim vještacima), particularly as regards their appointment and general legal and professional obligations. In the course of the proceedings in the case at hand, two amendments to the Court Experts Ordinance were introduced (Official Gazette nos. 21/1998 and 88/2008, with further amendments). In so far as relevant, the amendments did not make any substantial changes to the general position of court experts.
Under the Court Experts Ordinance a court expert in a particular field may be any person possessing the appropriate professional expertise and level of education. Legal persons may be appointed as competent institutions for expertise if they have registered such a business activity in the register of companies and if they employ permanent court experts. Court experts, including institutions, are appointed by a decision of the President of the competent County Court or Commercial Court. Under the Court Experts Ordinance court experts are required to provide their opinions objectively, impartially and to the best of their knowledge.
According to the information provided by the Government, there are no official statistics concerning cases of medical negligence in Croatia. There are statistics on criminal convictions for offences affecting people’s health, but this includes a broader range of offences.
On 22 January 2004, in case no. Gzz 249/03-2, the Supreme Court explained the scope of civil responsibility for medical negligence in the following manner:
“[A] health institution is responsible for damage caused by otherwise allowed and acceptable medical treatment if there was a fault [krivnja] in the conduct of [its employees] – responsibility on the basis of the principle of fault (section 154(1) of the Civil Obligations Act).
Given that it has been established that in treating the plaintiff by administration of [the drug], the defendant acted in accordance with the rules of the medical profession, the defendant cannot be held responsible irrespective of the fact that [damage to health was caused].
Many medical treatments represent a certain risk for the patient’s health, because of the use of either drugs or various instruments. However, if such a treatment has been accepted medically, then the possibility that it could generate damage [to health] cannot make the health institution responsible on the basis of objective liability, irrespective of its fault.”
The Supreme Court followed the same approach in case no. Rev146/06-2 on 30 March 2006.
On 15 November 2007, in case no. U-III-1062/2005, the Constitutional Court dismissed a constitutional complaint against the decisions of the lower courts awarding damages for medical malpractice. The Constitutional Court accepted that in the particular circumstances of the case, given the nature of the treatment, responsibility could also be based on the principle of objective liability.
