It further notes that at the material time the administrative courts were a new judicial institution in  that had been established in 2004 with a view to the judicial review of administrative acts and actions of public authorities. The Court is also aware that at the material time the prosecution authorities had general competence to supervise prisons and to protect the rights of detained persons (see Kadi\u0137is v.  (no. 2), no.\u00a062393/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029 and 62, 4 May 2006). The entry into force of the Law of Administrative Procedure did not clarify the scope of these remedies. The Court has already found that recourse to the prosecution authorities was not an effective remedy in circumstances where they were aware of the problem of prison overcrowding but failed to act to remedy that situation (see Bazjaks, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 to 89). Similarly, in the present case the prosecutor\u2019s office was aware of the lack of personal hygiene items for detainees but did not act in any way to remedy the applicant\u2019s situation \u2013 his complaint in this connection was merely forwarded to the Prisons Administration. In view of such circumstances and clearly conflicting opinions at the national level (see also the position of the National Human Rights Office noted in paragraphs 16 and 27 above) as concerns the proper domestic remedy for the applicant\u2019s complaint, the Court will examine whether review by the administrative courts at the material time was the appropriate course of action.",

It is nevertheless the case that, in the absence of a specifically introduced remedy, the development and availability of a remedy said to exist, its scope and application must be clearly set out and confirmed or complemented by the domestic courts\u2019 case-law (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0160o\u0107 v. , no. 47863/99, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94, 9 May 2003; Apostol v.\u00a0Georgia, no.\u00a040765/02, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2006XIV; and, most recently, McFarlane v.

To meet the burden incumbent on the Government to prove the effectiveness of the newly established remedy in theory and practice, they submitted information about one ruling of the Administrative Department of the Supreme Court, namely, the decision in the St\u0101mers case. According to the information provided by the applicant, which was not contested by the Government, the ruling in the St\u0101mers case was the first decision recognising the administrative courts\u2019 competence to review detainees\u2019 complaints about the conditions of their detention and introducing for that purpose the \u201csignificant interference\u201d test. Regrettably, the Court has not been furnished with a copy of that decision or any other relevant ruling showing that conditions of detention fall within the notion of \u201cthe action of a public authority\u201d (see paragraph 25 above) to which the administrative courts\u2019 review extends. It appears that the application of this notion in practice was not uniform among the administrative courts at the material time and that this problem prompted the Supreme Court to examine the existing domestic practice (see paragraph 28 above). Furthermore, it remains uncertain which complaints would satisfy \u201cthe significant interference\u201d test as developed by the administrative courts to be accepted for review and whether that test is similar or equal to that of the \u201cminimum level of severity\u201d as developed by the Court in relation to Article 3 of the Convention. The Court would add, in this respect, that it is not for the Convention organs to cure on their own motion any shortcomings or lack of precision in the respondent Government\u2019s submissions (see Bazjaks, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0133).",

In such circumstances, the burden of proof rests on the Government to prove the contrary in the instant case. The Government\u2019s failure to present convincing evidence that would overturn the applicant\u2019s submissions, for example by submitting a full report or recommendations and conclusions made by the National Human Rights Office in 2005 concerning Valmiera Prison or any other similar report (for example, a report drawn up by the Prisons Administration, see the above-cited Bazjaks case, \u00a7\u00a0102), allows the Court to draw negative inferences. Moreover, the lack of any legal standards at the domestic level on the issue of partitioning off of toilets at the material time further supports the applicant\u2019s allegation, even more so in the light of subsequent legislative developments (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above). Taking into account the above-mentioned considerations, the Court finds it established \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the toilets in the applicant\u2019s cell were not partitioned off from the rest of the cell.",

The Court highlights in this connection that it is incumbent on the respondent Government to organise its penal system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees, which failure the Government cannot justify by the lack of resources (see Bazjaks, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0111).",
