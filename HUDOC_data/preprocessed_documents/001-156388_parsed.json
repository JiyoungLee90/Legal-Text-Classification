Moreover, any such contact, as well as its nature and extent will depend on the circumstances of each case and will ultimately be subject to the best interests of the child. Although national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, with paramount importance being attached to the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see, among others, Johansen v.

In this context, the adequacy of the steps or of the measures is to be judged by the swiftness of their implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and a parent who does not live with the child (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

They normally have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned, often at the stage when care measures are first being envisaged or immediately after their implementation. There is therefore a need to allow them a certain margin of appreciation in deciding how best to deal with the cases before them, provided it is clear that the relevant assessments are being made properly and by professionals. It is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute itself for the domestic authorities but to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken and assessments made by those authorities in the exercise of their margin of appreciation (see K. and T. v. Finland [GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7\u00a0154, ECHR 2001-VII, and R. and H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 35348/06, \u00a7 81, 31 May 2011). The scope of the review may vary depending on the nature and seriousness of the interference. Whereas, in dealing with disputes between parents regarding the custody of children, domestic authorities normally enjoy a wide margin of appreciation, a stricter scrutiny by the Court may be required where limitations on parental rights might entail the curtailment of family relations between parent and child (see, for instance, Y.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 4547/10, \u00a7 137, 13 March 2012, and M.D. and Others v.

Where a substantive Article of the Convention or its Protocols has been invoked both on its own and together with Article 14 and a separate breach has been found of the substantive Article, it is not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article 14 also, though the position is otherwise if a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and\u00a028443/95, \u00a7 89, ECHR 1999III, and Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1981, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 45).

(see paragraphs 32 and 41 above) \u2013 the first set of proceedings was focussed mainly the applicant\u2019s claim for the return of his child and the second set on the question of whether the tutelage decision was lawful and well-founded. Those matters were examined by the courts on the merits. Both sets of proceedings were therefore decisive for determining the applicant\u2019s parental rights, which fall within the ambit of \u201ccivil rights\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The fact that the applicant\u2019s claims were eventually dismissed does not retrospectively deprive them of their arguability (see, for instance, Le Calvez v. France, 29 July 1998, \u00a7 56, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998V). Consequently, the Court holds that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention applied to the impugned proceedings and that the Government\u2019s objection in this regard must be rejected.",

The Court notes that the present case involves complex and serious issues under the Convention and that the time the applicant\u2019s representative had to spend on it appears to be generally justified. It is also mindful that certain parts of the applicant\u2019s complaints were declared inadmissible. Regard being had to all these aspects of the case and to the documents in its possession, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 4,000 for costs and expenses in the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant. This sum should be paid into the applicant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s bank account.",
