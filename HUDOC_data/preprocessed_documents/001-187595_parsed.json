Nor are the domestic authorities required to provide a perfectly functioning postal system (see Zagorodnikov v. Russia, no. 66941/01, \u00a7 31, 7 June 2007). Nonetheless, the failure of the authorities to apprise a party of a hearing in such a way so as for it to have an opportunity to exercise his or her right to attend may, in certain circumstances, raise issues under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Nikoghosyan and Melkonyan v. Armenia, nos. 11724/04 and 13350/04, \u00a7 37, 6 December 2007). The Court considers that in the interests of the administration of justice a litigant should be notified of a court hearing in such a way as to not only have knowledge of the date and place of the hearing, but also to have enough time to prepare his or her case and to attend the court hearing. A formal dispatch of a notification letter without any confidence that it will reach the applicant in good time cannot be considered by the Court as proper notification (see Fridman v.

As the expert report in question was only delivered in the previous hearing from which the applicant\u2019s representative was excused, it cannot be said that a practical and effective opportunity to present her arguments were made available to the applicant. As regards the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant herself had received the expert report in question in any event (see paragraph 21 above), the Court observes that there is no indication when she exactly took out a copy of the report from the domestic court\u2019s registry since her acknowledgement of its receipt was marked on the minutes of the hearing of 10\u00a0May 2006 which is a date predating the court\u2019s decision to seek an expert report. The Court therefore considers that no conclusions can be drawn from this fact alone. What is important is that, the other party had the opportunity to submit his comments on the report while the applicant lost hers on account of the late delivery of the notice. The Court further considers that it cannot be determined whether this short-coming was remedied at the appeal stage for the generic reasons given by the Court of Cassation when they dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal did not touch upon and dismiss her specific complaint about the failure of timely notification of the impugned hearing which resulted in her losing the opportunity to make submissions to the court.",
