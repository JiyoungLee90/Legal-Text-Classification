Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court does not consider it necessary to establish whether the applicant could have reasonably been expected to learn about the decision of the Samokov municipal council of 28 March 2013, and whether she could thus have applied for its judicial review within the relevant time-limit after its publication. The Court does not perceive how the remedy indicated by the Government \u2013 judicial review of the decision at issue \u2013 could have sped up the restitution procedure and could have thus amounted to an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The applicant did not claim the particular plots in respect of which the municipal council had refused restitution, nor did her complaint before the Court concern them. The applicant\u2019s failure to have recourse to the remedy at issue did not, in principle, prevent the relevant authorities from proceeding with the restitution procedure.",

It points out that in the years following the recognition of the applicant\u2019s entitlement to restitution in February 2009 the authorities sought a solution: in particular, the Department attempted on several occasions to identify plots of land for the applicant and in 2011 presented a proposal in that regard to the Samokov municipal authorities, while in 2013 the Samokov municipal council took a decision on the matter (see paragraphs 9-10 above). However, no decision concerning the applicant\u2019s restitution entitlement was taken after that and the procedure remained in a standstill (see paragraph 11 above). The municipal council\u2019s decision at issue did not complete the procedure and further action by the Department was required \u2013 a decision to restore to the applicant the plot of 3,791 square metres (see, on the necessity of such a decision, Zikatanova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 55), as well as action to identify further available plots of land.",

Moreover, the Court points out that the Government have not contested that on numerous occasions throughout the years the applicant\u2019s son sought information on the course of the restitution proceedings, and was informed that there were no relevant developments (see paragraph 12 above).",
