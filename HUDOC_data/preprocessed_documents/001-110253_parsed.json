On 18 February 2004 the Presidency concluded that the deputy headmaster of the school had been at fault for neglecting to inform the municipality\u2019s shuttle service of the early dismissal of the classes.

According to the court, in the instant case the school authorities could not be reasonably expected to foresee that Atalay would be frozen to death on his way back home.

For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual and, if so, that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see, amongst other authorities, Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a027229/95, \u00a7\u00a7 89-92, ECHR\u00a02001III, and A. and Others v.

In this connection, the Court is particularly struck by the long period of time which elapsed between the acquittal judgment of the \u00dcmraniye Criminal Court delivered on 28 June 2006, and the decision of the Court of Cassation dated 11 November 2010. In this connection, the Court notes that, after almost four and a half years, the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the \u00dcmraniye Criminal Court, without examining the merits of the case, on the basis of a procedural reason, namely the absence of the signature of the court\u2019s clerk at one of the hearings that had been held before the first instance court. The case was accordingly remitted to the \u00dcmraniye Criminal Court, which once again acquitted the accused of the charges against them on 13 May 2011. According to the information submitted by the Parties, the proceedings are still pending before the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 18-23 above).",
