Mr Bayramkulov was examined about two weeks after his alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph\u00a018 above). Mr Fedorov underwent the examination four months after the events (see paragraph 36 above). Mr Kalinin was examined about two months following the alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph 72 above).
