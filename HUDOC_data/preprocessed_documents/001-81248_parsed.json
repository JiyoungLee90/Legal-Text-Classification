The Court has already held a number of times that in the Russian legal system, the power of a court to reverse a decision refusing institution of criminal proceedings is a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of powers by the investigating authorities (see Trubnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003). The applicant did not make use of such judicial appeal and thus denied the domestic authorities an opportunity to consider whether he had been subjected to treatment contrary to the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention and whether the prosecutor's decision was compatible with the applicant's rights as guaranteed by Article\u00a03. It follows that this complaint must be rejected pursuant to Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",
