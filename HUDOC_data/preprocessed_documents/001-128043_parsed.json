It added that the buzzing sound from the camera heard by the applicant strongly suggested that the camera was switched on and was actually recording. Otherwise, there would have been no point in hiding the camera among the clothes in the laundry basket. The hole in the laundry basket indicated that the strategy was quite refined.

Whether a recording had actually been made, however, was unclear. It was apparent, the court continued, that his motive had been to film the applicant covertly for a sexual purpose. Given that motive, it was also regarded as certain that he had not intended the applicant to find out about the filming. Nor, according to the court, had he been indifferent to the risk that she would find out about it. In assessing whether the act legally constituted sexual molestation within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article\u00a07 \u00a7 3, of the Penal Code, the Court of Appeal referred to a Supreme Court judgment (published in Nyatt jurisdiskt arkiv (NJA) 1996, p.\u00a0418) concerning a man who had covertly filmed his sleeping girlfriend while he masturbated. The man was acquitted of sexual molestation because he had not intended his girlfriend to find out about the filming. Moreover, in the said judgment the Supreme Court held that the isolated act of filming was not a crime in itself, as in Swedish law there was no general prohibition against filming an individual without his or her consent. Following that line of reasoning, and despite finding that the situation the applicant\u2019s stepfather intended to film was obviously of a sensitive nature as regards her personal integrity and that the violation was particularly serious on account of the applicant\u2019s age and relationship to her stepfather, the Court of Appeal found that he could not be held criminally responsible for the isolated act of filming the applicant without her knowledge. The court noted that the applicant had become aware of her stepfather\u2019s attempt to film her, but that this had not been covered by his intent.",

However, since no charge of that kind had been brought against the applicant\u2019s stepfather, the Court of Appeal could not examine whether he could be held responsible for such a crime.

This was so, the court continued, even in situations where the deed in question seriously violated the personal integrity of the person concerned. Apart from certain exceptional situations, the only protection available was under the criminal provisions on defamation in conjunction with Chapter 1, section 3, of the Tort Liability Act (now Chapter 2, section 3, of that Act).

The Court of Appeal found the filming to constitute molestation and the sending of some of the e-mails to amount to defamation, and awarded the ex-girlfriend damages for violation of personal integrity. The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal in respect of the alleged molestation. The Supreme Court acquitted the person of molestation and reiterated at the same time that Swedish law contained no general prohibition against covert filming. The court also noted that in cases where the covert filming did not constitute a crime, no damages could be awarded. Although the need for a strengthened legal framework in this regard had already been acknowledged in Swedish legislative work in the 1960s, the court noted further that it had so far not led to any concrete results. The court found it highly questionable whether the fact that acts of filming an individual in situations where such filming seriously violated the personal integrity of the person concerned were left wholly unpunished under Swedish law was compatible with the requirements of Article\u00a08 of the Convention. Given that finding, the court continued, it was legitimate to examine whether punishment could be imposed by interpreting otherwise non-applicable domestic provisions in a Convention-compliant manner. In that regard, the court referred to domestic case-law concerning compensation for violations of the Convention. However, the court noted, another requirement under the Convention was that no one should be punished for an act which, at the time when it was committed, did not clearly constitute a criminal offence under the law. After finding that the filming in issue did not fall under any applicable criminal provision, it was left unpunished and no damages were awarded.",

Sweden, no. 5786/08, 21\u00a0June 2012), the Chamber also considered that the complaint was to be examined under Article\u00a08 of the Convention alone. It was satisfied that, although Swedish law contained no provision relating to covert filming, laws were in place which could, at least in theory, cover acts such as the one in this case. It pointed out that the public prosecutor, when indicting the applicant\u2019s stepfather, and the District Court, when convicting him on 14 February 2006, considered that the impugned act could be covered by the provision on sexual molestation. Accordingly, although at the relevant time a similar outcome had been seen in Swedish case-law (see NJA 1996, p.\u00a0418), it was not until delivery of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment that it became clear that the act could not legally constitute sexual molestation given the applicant\u2019s stepfather\u2019s lack of the requisite intent that she find out about the filming. The Chamber also reiterated that the Court of Appeal, in its judgment acquitting him of sexual molestation, had pointed out that his acts might, at least theoretically, have constituted the crime of attempted child pornography under the Penal Code. However, since no charge of that kind had been brought by the prosecution against the applicant\u2019s stepfather, the Court of Appeal could not examine whether he could be held responsible for that crime. Lastly, the Chamber noted that civil-law remedies were available to the applicant and that she had chosen, represented by counsel, to join her claim for damages to the criminal proceedings. In those circumstances the Chamber concluded that there were no such significant flaws in Swedish legislation and practice as to amount to a breach of Sweden\u2019s positive obligations under Article\u00a08.",

Accordingly, in the applicant\u2019s view, her stepfather had been acquitted of sexual molestation on account of the construction of that provision.

In order for the film to be pornographic, her stepfather would have had to manipulate the film, inter alia, by making it appear as if the applicant was posing for him, or otherwise placing the film in a pornographic context. When the case was pending before the national courts it was not possible to speculate as to what her stepfather would have done with the film because it had been destroyed. In the applicant\u2019s view, it was therefore completely understandable that the prosecutor had not formulated or amended the indictment to include a child-pornography crime, since such a claim would not have had any prospect of success.",

For adults, no such protection existed at all. The applicant found that the failure for years to criminalise the act of covert or illicit filming amounted to a violation of Article\u00a08. She pointed out that the weak protection in this area had been known and discussed since 1966.

It sufficed to conclude that the protection for the right to respect for private life was \u2013 and still is \u2013 insufficient in the Swedish legal system and that the applicant was a victim of that deficiency. The applicant pointed out that the legislative proposal regarding covert filming had been initiated after the applicant\u2019s case had been communicated and that the ongoing legislative measures seemed to have progressed quite far, especially after the Grand Chamber had accepted her request for referral of her case, which demonstrated the urgent need for such legislative protection.",

The reason for his acquittal was therefore not the lack of a criminal-law provision covering the relevant act but the public prosecutor\u2019s inability to prove that he had the necessary intent and hence that the crime had been committed.

The Court of Appeal found it established that his motive had been to film the applicant covertly for a sexual purpose. It was thus regarded as certain that he did not intend the applicant to find out about the filming. Nor, according to the court, was he indifferent to the risk that she would find out about it. The Court of Appeal then referred to a judgment (NJA 1996, p. 418) in which the Supreme Court had held, among other things, that covert filming was not a crime in itself as in Swedish law there was no general prohibition against filming an individual without his or her consent. Following that line of reasoning, and although finding that the act in question constituted a violation of personal integrity, notably in the light of the applicant\u2019s age and relationship to her stepfather, the Court of Appeal found that he could not be held criminally responsible for the isolated act of filming the applicant without her knowledge. Even if she had indeed obtained knowledge of the filming afterwards, the court reiterated, this knowledge was not covered by her stepfather\u2019s intent. The Supreme Court refused leave to appeal on 12\u00a0December 2007.",

In other words, the victim could not be considered sexually molested unless he or she was aware of the molestation. It will be recalled that the applicant\u2019s stepfather was indeed convicted of sexual molestation under the said provision as regards the two counts of indecent behaviour against the applicant\u2019s 16-year-old cousin, namely, for having caressed her thigh and for having expressed his desire to have sex with her (see paragraph 14 above).",

According to the Supreme Court judgment of 23 October 2008 (NJA 2008, p. 946 \u2013 see paragraph 40 above) the need for a strengthened legal framework against covert filming had already been acknowledged in Swedish legislative work in the 1960s, but had not yet led to any concrete results.

The act in question violated the applicant\u2019s integrity; it was aggravated by the fact that she was a minor, that the incident took place in her home, where she was supposed to feel safe, and that the offender was her stepfather, a person whom she was entitled and expected to trust. However, as the Court has found above, neither a criminal remedy nor a civil remedy existed under Swedish law that could enable the applicant to obtain effective protection against the said violation of her personal integrity in the concrete circumstances of her case.",

Articles 6 and 7 \u00a7 1 of the International Labour Organisation Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (no. 182) oblige States Parties to take steps to eliminate, with the necessary penal sanctions, the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, including the use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution, for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances. The criminalisation of child pornography is also obligatory under Article\u00a020 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse and Article\u00a09 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The Council of the European Union adopted, in 2003, the Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (2004/68/JHA) according to which member States are obliged to criminalise the production, distribution, dissemination, transmission, supplying or making available, acquisition and possession of child pornography and provide for a minimum level of maximum penalties incurred for these offences. The European Parliament and the Council approved Directive 2011/93/EU of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which replaced the Council Framework Decision of 2004, but maintained the criminalisation obligation. In Europe, forty-one countries have criminalised child pornography, and in the United States both the federal law and the law of all fifty States make provision for the same offence. In view of this broad consensus and constant practice, the criminalisation of child pornography, namely, any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes, is now part of international customary law, binding on all States.",

With regard to children, the Court has established the principle that any wilful offence against the physical and moral welfare of children should be criminalised and punished with a deterrent penalty. Child pornography is certainly among these, having regard to its serious ethical censurability and to its reprehensibility under international customary and treaty law. Yet in view of the threshold of explicitness of the acts depicted and the required sexual purpose of the perpetrator, this criminal offence is subject to evidentiary problems. Thus, in order to provide full and effective protection of children, covert filming of children, with or without a sexual purpose on the part of the perpetrator, and in or outside a pornographic setting, should be criminalised. Such criminalisation is in line with the Convention guarantee of the child\u2019s right to protection of his or her image and the prevailing international prohibition of any kind of abuse or violation of the various facets of the child\u2019s personality, which includes his or her image.",

This crime is punishable both when brought to its completion and when attempted (Chapter 16, Article\u00a07, and Chapter\u00a023, Article\u00a01).

In spite of the restrictive intention of the Swedish legislature when it introduced the criminal offence of child pornography, as reflected in the relevant preparatory works, the domestic courts could, and should, have adopted an evolutive interpretation of the concept of child pornography, in order to include any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes. An evolutive interpretation of penal law is acceptable provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen. This interpretation would at the same time be in accordance with the international obligations of Sweden and the general principles of interpretation of penal law. The facts imputed to the applicant\u2019s stepfather would be sufficient to make out this offence, in its ancillary and preparatory form of attempted child pornography: the images of a 14-year-old girl undressing before taking a shower in an otherwise everyday situation certainly do fall within the concept of \u201cany representation of the sexual parts of a child\u201d and the applicant\u2019s stepfather completed all the necessary steps to obtain images of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes, which he ultimately did not obtain on account of the fortuitous circumstance that the girl discovered the hidden camera. No additional reference to pornography in the indictment was necessary, since it already included all the relevant elements of the offence of attempted child pornography, interpreted in the light of Sweden\u2019s above-mentioned international obligations. It was up to the domestic courts to change the legal characterisation of the offence and adopt an evolutive interpretation of the concept of child pornography compatible with Sweden\u2019s international obligations. The domestic courts took neither of those steps, thus leaving unpunished highly reprehensible conduct that should have been punished in the light of the international obligations of the respondent State.

The argument of unforeseeability does not stand, in so far as the Convention is part of national law and therefore the grounds for compensation deriving from the Court\u2019s case-law are predictable. The Court\u2019s interpretation of the Convention regarding grounds for compensation for breaches of Convention rights is as binding for national courts as the rest of the Court\u2019s case-law, and should therefore be implemented by the national courts whenever national law fails to provide such compensation. In addition, if damages awarded for a State\u2019s violations of the Convention are predictable, even where there are no specific provisions on civil liability in national law, as the Swedish Supreme Court correctly admits, the same applies to awards for violations perpetrated by individuals who are not State agents, such as the one in this case. In such a case, the State would be neglecting its obligations to protect Convention rights if it did not ensure a means of civil redress in circumstances where no criminal sanctions were applicable despite the ethical censurability and the reprehensibility under international customary and treaty law of the conduct. To put it positively, whenever criminal remedies are lacking for such conduct committed by individuals who are not State agents, the Contracting Parties to the Convention should nonetheless provide for civil remedies. An obligation is placed upon the State to provide for an effective civil remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d of a breach of the Convention, in accordance with Article\u00a013 in conjunction with Article\u00a08, not upon the individuals themselves.

The Grand Chamber undertook (see paragraph 89 of the judgment) to examine whether Sweden had an adequate legal framework providing the applicant with an acceptable level of protection (see paragraph\u00a091) and to assess, to this end, each of the remedies available to her (see paragraph 89). To my regret, I fail to understand the logic followed by the majority in finding and providing a legal response to these questions and for this reason I also find myself unable to agree with the conclusions reached.",

She pointed out that the \u201cweak protection in this area had been known and discussed since 1966\u201d. This, in her view, \u201csufficed to conclude that the protection for the right to respect for private life was \u2013 and still is \u2013 insufficient\u201d (see paragraphs 62-63).",

In this connection it is difficult to understand the source of the majority\u2019s dissatisfaction with the fact that \u201cnotwithstanding the ... margin of appreciation\u201d, Swedish law did not provide a criminal remedy for the effective protection of the applicant.",

In this regard the applicant insisted that \u2013 being the masters of the classification of the law \u2013 the criminal courts should have reclassified and determined her claim on other grounds. However, she never complained about the lack of such a remedy in the civil courts (see paragraph 64). I remain unconvinced that the fact that the criminal courts dismissed the applicant\u2019s civil claim for damages resulting from a crime suffices to conclude that no other civil remedy existed under Swedish law to redress the substance of her complaints (see paragraph 117).",

This conclusion only reflects the facts of the case, and does not necessarily provide a legal response to the Grand Chamber\u2019s undertaking to establish whether Swedish law, as it stood in September 2002, ensured appropriate protection of the applicant\u2019s \u201cright to respect for her private life\u201d. Indeed, it seems to me that in the absence of criteria defining the required \u201cacceptable level of protection\u201d in specific terms, a comparison between the failed and the undefined remedies will inevitably lead to dissatisfaction \u201cnotwithstanding the respondent State\u2019s margin of appreciation\u201d in this area (see paragraph 117).",
