At that time the Court noted that there was great diversity in the legislation and practice of the member States of the Council of Europe as regards the nature of the entitlement to insurance benefits under social-security schemes. Nevertheless, the development in the law that was initiated by those judgments and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance (see the Salesi v.

The most important of these lies in the fact that despite the public-law features pointed out by the Government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence; she was claiming an individual, economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a federal statute (see paragraph 35 above).",

Secondly, in the cases brought before it the  was free to review the facts and the law, and this made it more akin to an ordinary court of appeal.

I am also of the opinion that there was a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) by reason of the absence of an oral hearing in accordance with that Article (art. 6-1). The Rules of Procedure of the  provide for an oral hearing either on the application of the party or on the motion of the presiding judge. The Convention requires such a hearing unless the parties agree to waive it. The position is similar with regard to the public nature of the hearing: see Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. . No such agreement was secured from the applicant. Indeed it is not established that she was ever made aware of the possibility. I do not agree with the view of the majority of the Court (at paragraph 58 of the judgment) that because the applicant did not request an oral and public hearing she had \"unequivocally waived her right ...\". Article 6 (art. 6) throws no burden on an applicant to request a public hearing. Her civil rights were in issue. I cannot agree with the inference contained in the third sub-paragraph of paragraph 58 of the Court\u2019s judgment. The fact that a matter that is highly technical, even if this was so which is questionable, may induce the parties to agree to avoid the type of hearing envisaged by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is not a ground for denying such a hearing, particularly when the applicant had not so agreed.",

The dispute was undeniably important to the applicant and she is the party whose protection was envisaged by that provision of the Convention. The private citizen is thus enabled to pierce the bureaucratic veil or curtain. The fact that her private right was created by public law made the application of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) all the more important. That such application may be thought to be inconvenient for the \"demands of efficiency\" by the bureaucracy can scarcely be regarded as a justification for ignoring the requirements of the Article (art. 6-1).",
