In its decision, the Constitutional Court held, inter alia, that the ban laid down in sections 78-96 of the law in question applied to political parties, which were legal entities. However, those provisions, by virtue of the application of section 117, were found to be also applicable to individuals. The court considered that the prosecution of individuals for acts prohibited for political parties was in violation of the principle of legal certainty relating to crimes and penalties, as set forth in Article 38 of the Constitution. In particular, it considered that it was unclear which of the prohibitions laid out in Chapter IV of the Law could be applicable to individuals. It noted that the sanction to be applied was indiscriminate in that no distinction was made as to the status or position of a person within a political party. The Court therefore held that such provisions, which left a wide range of people engaging in political activities facing the threat of a criminal penalty, without differentiating between them, were not sufficiently foreseeable for individuals.",

He further submitted that the mere fact that certain delegates at the party meeting spoke in Kurdish could not be construed as having served the aim of creating a minority. The applicant insisted that the relevant provisions of Law no. 2820 were incompatible with the Constitution and the Treaty of Lausanne. He maintained that the content of the speeches had been within the scope of freedom of expression and that the mere fact that the party delegates had chosen to speak in a language which had been better understood by most of the participants at the meeting was not in breach of the Constitution or international treaties. In this connection, the applicant emphasised that HAKPAR was a party representing Kurds. He was of the view that the interference with his rights and freedoms resulted from a desire to prevent Kurds from using their own language and, thus, to diminish Kurdish culture and language.",

Indeed, a review of the Court\u2019s case-law shows that Article 10 of the Convention has been held to be applicable not only to the more common forms of expression, such as speeches and written texts, but also to other and less obvious media through which people sometimes choose to convey their opinions, messages, ideas and criticisms (see, in particular, Murat Vural v. Turkey, no. 9540/07, \u00a7 44, 21\u00a0October 2014, and the examples provided therein in \u00a7\u00a7 45-51). Moreover, in certain circumstances, the Convention organs have also considered that the right to freedom of expression by implication also guarantees a \u201cnegative right\u201d not to be compelled to express oneself (see, for example, K v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a016002/90, Commission Report of 13 October 1992, \u00a7 45; Strohal v.\u00a0Austria, no. 20871/92, Commission decision of 7 April 1994; and a\u00a0contrario, Gillberg v. Sweden [GC], no. 41723/06, \u00a7\u00a7 86 and 94, 3\u00a0April 2012). Thus, an assessment of whether an impugned form of conduct falls within the scope of Article 10 of the Convention should not be restrictive, but inclusive (see, Murat Vural, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

The applicant acted in this way despite warnings from a government superintendent, which, from an objective point of view, may be seen as an expressive act of defiance towards an authority representing the State. Furthermore, the Court notes that in the course of the criminal proceedings against him the applicant made it very clear that he had not used his power as chairperson to intervene when certain delegates spoke in Kurdish because of his view that Kurdish should be used in all areas of life; that those who spoke Kurdish were speaking in their mother tongue; and that he believed that it was neither legal nor ethical for him to intervene and to force people to speak in a language other than their mother tongue. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that through his particular conduct the applicant exercised his right to freedom of expression within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention (see, in the context of Article\u00a011 read in the light of Article 10, Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, \u00a7\u00a041, Series\u00a0A no. 202). That provision is thus applicable in the present case.",

However, the applicant, an active politician, continued to face the threat of a criminal sanction, entailing a prison sentence, for nearly seven years during the course of the criminal proceedings. Moreover, during the same lengthy period, he was also left in incertitude as to whether or not he ran the risk of new set of criminal proceedings being instituted against him for similar offences, that is not preventing the use of the Kurdish language in the contexts of meetings of a political party, if he was elected to act as a chairman in political party meetings. In view of the above, the Court considers that the application of the prohibition contained in section\u00a081\u00a0(c) of Law no. 2820 at the material time amounted to interference with the right to freedom of expression of such a nature that it directly affected the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.
