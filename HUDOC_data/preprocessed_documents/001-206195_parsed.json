In this respect, the Court notes that the proceedings are still pending and that the national courts have not rendered a final judgment in the applicant\u2019s case. The Court further notes that no reference to any possible redress has been made by the domestic courts and no compensation has been offered to the applicant in respect of the alleged violation of the Convention. In these circumstances, the Court remains unconvinced that the re-examination of the case and delivery of a judgment at the first-instance level could \u2013 at the moment of the examination of the present application by the Court \u2013 be considered adequate redress that may deprive the applicant of his victim status. The Government\u2019s argument on this point should therefore be dismissed (see, mutatis mutandis, Yusifova v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a025315/08, 18\u00a0December 2012).",

The Court notes in that connection that more than ten years have elapsed since the introduction of the applicant\u2019s compensation claims before the domestic courts. The Court further notes that the length of the period of inactivity, if it is attributable to the national authorities, is an element which must be taken into account in the determination of State responsibility under Article\u00a06. In Ba\u0161kien\u0117 v.
