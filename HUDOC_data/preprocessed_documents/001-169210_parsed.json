The written statement of his cellmate at the time, to which the applicant referred in this regard, is too vague and contains no information as to the nature or origin of the applicant\u2019s injuries mentioned therein (see paragraph 17 above). Moreover, for unknown reasons, the other injuries alleged by the applicant, notably his eye injury, were not mentioned in that statement. Although it is true that while in detention the applicant might have had difficulties in obtaining a medical examination by a doctor independent of the prison authorities, it was not demonstrated that the doctors who had examined him on a number of occasions after 15 October 2004 had been or could have been reluctant to register any injuries, should they have noted such injuries or if the applicant had informed the doctors of them. In this connection it should be observed that the applicant\u2019s eye problem was noted about a year after the alleged beating had taken place (see paragraph 13 above).",

On the whole, it cannot be argued that they addressed them inadequately. The applicant was examined by a number of doctors, including some from civilian medical institutions. He remained under their supervision while in Sokalska Prison. It was those doctors who were best placed to determine the applicant\u2019s treatment, and he was given the treatment prescribed. There is no evidence, and it was not persuasively argued, that the doctors had acted in bad faith, or that the treatment provided had been ineffective. Nor did the applicant demonstrate that the domestic examination of his complaints of inadequate medical treatment had been deficient (ibid.).",
