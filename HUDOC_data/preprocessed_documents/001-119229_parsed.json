A further restraining factor is that overseas voters have to vote by proxy (because it is not possible to send a ballot paper overseas reliably in the time available) which means that in order to exercise their right to vote they have to establish some form of connection with their former home.

It further agreed that the right balance between the integration into host societies and the links with the country of origin should be achieved and maintained, and charged the European Committee on Migration with examining the concrete mechanisms linked to the migratory processes at the pan-European level, with a view to identifying the legal measures that could contribute to such a balance.",

The Commission accepted that the denial of the right to vote to citizens living abroad or the placing of limits on that right constituted a restriction of the principle of universal suffrage. However, it did not consider at this stage that the principles of the European electoral heritage required the introduction of such a right, namely a right for all expatriate citizens to vote in their State of nationality which was subject to no residence qualification.

This means that the proportionality of electoral legislation (and of any limitations on voting rights) must be assessed also in light of the socio-political realities of a given country.

The Court has recognised that it is possible in an individual case that the applicant has not severed ties with his country of origin and that some of the factors indicated above are therefore inapplicable to his case.

At the same time, the emergence of new technologies and cheaper transport has enabled migrants to maintain a higher degree of contact with their State of nationality than would have been possible for most migrants forty, even thirty, years ago. This has led a number of States including the  to amend their legislation to allow for the first time non-residents to vote in national elections (see paragraphs 15 et seq. and 67 above).

As early as 1982, the Assembly recommended that the Committee of Ministers explore the possibility of harmonising member States\u2019 laws in favour of preserving the voting rights of nationals residing abroad (see paragraph 39 above). In 1999 it recommended that the Committee of Ministers invite member States to take account of their expatriates\u2019 interests in policy making and in national practices concerning the right to vote in the country of origin (see paragraph 41 above). It re-examined the matter in 2004 and, as well as reiterating the substance of its 1999 recommendation, recommended that the Committee of Ministers consider making proposals for the introduction of legally-binding measures at European level concerning relations between expatriates and their country of origin (see paragraphs 42-44 above). In a 2005 resolution, the Assembly said that \u201cdue regard\u201d had to be given to the voting rights of non-residents and that member States should take measures enabling non-residents to vote in national elections and facilitating the exercise of the right (see paragraphs 45-47 above). In a follow-up recommendation, it called on States to review existing instruments with a view to assessing the need for a Council of Europe Convention on the matter (see paragraph 48 above). Twin resolutions and recommendations in 2008 again drew attention to the question of democratic participation of non-residents in their countries of origin (see paragraph 50 above). In a 2009 resolution, the Assembly expressed regret at the failure of States to pursue harmonisation in this area and once again encouraged them to adopt policy initiatives to seek harmonisation and to offer out-of-country voting (see paragraphs 51-52 above). However, in a more recent resolution of 2012, the Assembly appears to have accepted that a condition based on residence abroad could be a justified restriction of the right to vote of nonresidents (see paragraph 54 above).",

A report endorsed by the Commission in 2004 drew attention to the growing debate regarding the exercise of voting rights by non-residents (see paragraphs 63-64 above). The Commission\u2019s 2006 report on electoral law and administration observed that overseas voting rights were not yet common in Europe (see paragraph 67 above). Its 2011 report on out-of-country voting recognised that the grant of voting rights to non-residents was a matter of State sovereignty. It did, however, list a number of arguments in favour of the grant of such rights and identified the nature and effects of restrictions imposed. Although it indicated that the fixing of a time-limit for retention of the right to vote after a national had emigrated was preferable to the complete exclusion of non-residents, it also indicated that even in the former case, it was preferable that the situation be \u201creconsidered\u201d at the expiry of the time-period rather than that the right to vote simply be lost. Having regard to the lack of uniformity in national practices, the Commission concluded that the principles of the European electoral heritage did not, at this stage, require the introduction of a right to vote for non-residents. It did, however, suggest that States adopt a positive approach to this right, in view of citizens\u2019 European mobility (see paragraphs 68-71 above).",

The differing approaches and political agendas of the various bodies concerned reveal an important disparity in preferred approaches. The material highlights that the question of voting rights for non-residents in their States of nationality must be seen within the larger context of the discussion surrounding migrants\u2019 political activities more generally. A key issue which still has to be addressed within this discussion is whether the focus should be on promoting participation in the State of origin, in the State of residence or in both. Further issues concern the modalities of the exercise by nonresidents of the right to vote, which give rise to practical and security considerations. The 2011 report by the Venice Commission made an important contribution to the debate but reached no firm conclusions as to how member States should seek to develop their laws and practices over the coming years. The challenges posed in this regard should not be underestimated.",

Of these, thirty-five States do not remove this right once a citizen has resided abroad for a certain period of time (see paragraph 74 above). Nine States appear to limit the right by reference to the duration of the citizen\u2019s stay abroad (see paragraph 75 above). While the majority in favour of an unrestricted right of access of non-residents to voting rights appears to be significant, the legislative trends are not sufficient to establish the existence of any common European approach concerning voting rights of non-residents. In particular, there is no common approach as to the extent of States\u2019 obligations to enable non-residents to exercise the right to vote (see paragraph 76 above and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 75). It therefore cannot be said that the laws and practices of member States have reached the stage where a common approach or consensus in favour of recognising an unlimited right to vote for non-residents can be identified. Although the matter may need to be kept under review in so far as attitudes in European democratic society evolve, the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State in this area still remains a wide one.",

The question of nonresidents\u2019 voting rights has been examined twice by the Home Affairs Select Committee in the past thirty years, and on both occasions a report was produced (see paragraphs 16 and 20 above). The evolution of views in this area is demonstrated by the fact that the conclusion of the most recent report in 1998 was almost diametrically opposed to the conclusion reached in the Committee\u2019s 1982 report. As a consequence of these reports and of consultation exercises, legislation was introduced in Parliament first granting a right to vote to non-residents in 1985 and subsequently, in 1989 and 2000, amending the time-period (see paragraphs 17-18 and 21 above). The question has been debated in Parliament on several occasions since 2000, in the context of amendments proposed to two draft bills on electoral law and a short debate specifically on non-residents\u2019 voting rights (see paragraphs 22-28 above). This is not to say that because a legislature debates, possibly even repeatedly, an issue and reaches a particular conclusion thereon, that conclusion is necessarily Convention compliant. It simply means that that review is taken into consideration by the Court for the purpose of deciding whether a fair balance has been struck between competing interests.

The denial of a right to vote to citizens living abroad is clearly based on the assumption that their interest in the national political life is limited and there is nothing in the present case to make this assumption unreasonable.
