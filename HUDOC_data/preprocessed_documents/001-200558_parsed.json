Following the applicants\u2019 appeal, the Court of Cassation held a hearing on 13 June 2006 and heard the submissions of the applicants\u2019 lawyer. On 7 November 2007, without responding specifically to the applicants\u2019 arguments, the higher court upheld the judgment of the Ey\u00fcp Civil Court with a minor procedural correction.",

Under section 7 of Law no. 6831, cadastral commissions decide whether an area will be categorized as a public forest or a private forest. Under the same provision, as amended by Law no. 2896, cadastral commissions are authorised to identify and mark out the shared boundaries between forests and private properties. The same law governs the way in which the cadastral commissions operate (sections 7 to 12). According to the Regulation on the application of Law no. 6831, as in force at the relevant time, concerning the areas where a previous boundary-marking exercise had been carried out, the cadastral commissions are required to first apply the reference points determined by the previous evaluation to the surface in question then update the markings and cadastral maps if necessary (section 10 of the Regulation). After the application of boundaries to the surface, they can then proceed with correction of errors and the determining of forests which had been previously left out (section 47). Finally, the cadastral commissions are required to take into account final court judgments concerning property disputes in areas where they are conducting an application exercise or carrying out a forest cadastre.",

While their complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of the Convention was strictly related to the outcome of those proceedings in so far as they resulted in the annulment of their title deed, their complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention concerned the domestic courts\u2019 alleged non-compliance with the procedural guarantees required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. When notice of their application was given to the Government, the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court does not consider, and the Government have not argued otherwise, that the applicants\u2019 grievances under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention had been mere legal submissions or arguments put forward along with their complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Indeed the applicants\u2019 complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention relate mainly to the legitimate interest of respect for the final determination of their civil rights in the impugned proceedings. While the outcome of those proceedings is closely linked to the nature of a violation alleged under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the procedural and substantive rights protected under the respective Articles are distinct from each other. The Court therefore considers that the applicants\u2019 complaints under Article 6 of the Convention need to be assessed separately. Furthermore, even assuming that the compensation proceedings which appear to be currently ongoing before the domestic courts end with a favourable outcome for the applicants, that decision alone would not in principle be sufficient to deprive them of their status as \u201cvictims\u201d for their Article 6 grievances unless the national authorities acknowledge, either expressly or in substance, and then afford redress for, the breach of the Convention. It has not been demonstrated by the Government that the compensation proceedings can afford such a redress for the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 6 of the Convention. In particular, it has not been shown that the civil courts can examine in the compensation proceedings the alleged procedural irregularities committed in the impugned proceedings or that they could afford adequate redress for the legal uncertainty suffered by the applicants.",

The subsequent cadastral evaluation exercise conducted by the authorities had not been a fresh cadastral exercise, but in fact had been the application of the boundaries established in the forest cadastral survey of 1939. In that exercise, the authorities were required to take into account the final court judgments with respect to the properties located in the cadastral area. Even though the Court of Cassation in its impugned decision of 21 March 2005 had acknowledged the authorities\u2019 failure to take into account the judgment of 13 March 1979 in their cadastral evaluation of 1985, it had nevertheless given force to the negative prescription period of ten years in the cadastral law and thus nullified the effects of the final judgment of 13 March 1979. According to the applicants, the Court of Cassation\u2019s interpretation that a negative prescription period in the case of cadastral commission decisions could trump the effects of res judicata went against the Constitution, which obliged all State authorities to abide by final court decisions in all circumstances. Such an interpretation moreover allowed the administration a back door to call into question final court decisions by establishing administrative acts which could invalidate final court decisions if negative prescription periods were missed by the concerned individuals. Finally, the applicants submitted that the results of the cadastral evaluation of 1985 as well as the subsequent annotation in the land register had never been notified to them.",

Even though the applicants were not parties to the first set of proceedings in so far as they had not been the owner of the property at that time, the Court considers that they, as successors to the property, could invoke the res judicata defence in respect of the judgment of 13 March 1979, which had been recorded in the Land Registry at the relevant time and which the applicants claimed to have relied on when they acquired the property. In that connection the Court observes that res judicata in domestic law binds not only the original parties to a dispute but their successors as well (see paragraph 38 above). Therefore, the applicants could legitimately expect that the subject-matter of the dispute in so far as it concerned the boundaries of the Belgrade Forest as established in the boundary-marking exercise of 1939 would not be subject to re-litigation by the relevant State authorities. More importantly, the judgment of 1979 was binding first and foremost on the forest administration and the Treasury, the identical plaintiffs in respect of both proceedings.

It is sufficiently clear that in the present case, unlike Brum\u0103rescu, the 1979 final judgment was not quashed. It was rendered devoid of any legal effect, because the applicants were estopped from raising the defence of res judicata in the light of the fact that they had missed the ten-year prescription period to contest the conclusions of the cadastral commission which were announced on 15 June 1988 (see, mutatis mutandis, Kehaya and Others, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 27). It cannot therefore be assumed that the applicants waived their right to rely on the judgment of 1979 to contest the cadastral commission\u2019s evaluation of 1988. In any event, the Court observes that res judicata is a matter of public order in the Turkish legal context and therefore it is not possible for a party to waive a defence of res judicata since the courts must take it into consideration on their own motion (see paragraph 38 above).",

Both situations infringe the principle of finality of judgments and the individual\u2019s legitimate expectation to protection from repeated litigation of the same matter. In the present case, the Court concludes that the domestic courts re-examined the same matter in the subsequent proceedings, namely whether the property in question could be classified as a forest on the fact that it fell inside the boundaries of the Belgrade Forest. Thus, they provided the forest administration and the Treasury with a \u201csecond chance\u201d to have the matter \u2013 which had already been decided upon in earlier contentious proceedings \u2013 determined in their favour (see, mutatis mutandis, Kehaya and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69, and Decheva and Others v.

More specifically, as a result of the domestic courts\u2019 non-recognition of the judgment of 13 March 1979 in the subsequent proceedings before the Ey\u00fcp Civil Court, the applicants have been deprived of their property. Normally, the priority under Article 41 of the Convention is restitutio in integrum, as the respondent State is expected to make all feasible reparation for the consequences of the violation in such a manner as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach (see, for example, Simonyan v.\u00a0Armenia, no. 18275/08, \u00a7 30, 7 April 2016). In similar cases where the Court found a violation of Article 6 and/or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a result of a disregarding or quashing of a final judgment recognising the applicant\u2019s title to a property, it held that the return of the property in question would put the applicant as far as possible in the situation equivalent to the one in which he would have been if there had not been a breach of the Convention (see, among others, Brleti\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 42009/10, \u00a7 55, 16\u00a0January 2014 and Kehaya and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria (just satisfaction), nos.\u00a047797/99 and 68698/01, \u00a7\u00a7 21-23, 14\u00a0June 2007).

The Court, therefore, notes that the applicants may not be given leave to have the proceedings reopened, should they choose to make such an application, on the grounds that their application has been lodged outside the ten-year timelimit provided for by section 377 of the CCP (see Aksis and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 4529/06, \u00a7 64, 30 April 2019).",

The effectiveness of this remedy has not been called into question by the applicants. It further notes that the applicants have introduced proceedings to recover such compensation and that those proceedings are currently on-going (see paragraph 32 above).
