The debtor company had operated in the highly regulated sphere of nuclear energy and conducted its construction activities in the  zone of compulsory evacuation, which is placed under strict governmental control on account of environmental and public-health considerations (see paragraph 29 above). This control even extended to the applicants\u2019 terms of employment by the company, including their salaries (see paragraph 28 above). The State prohibited the seizure of the company\u2019s property on account of possible contamination (see paragraph 21 above). Moreover, the management of the company was transferred to the Ministry of Energy as of May 1998 (see paragraph 33 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion, these elements confirm the public nature of the debtor company regardless of its formal classification under domestic law. Accordingly, the Court concludes that there are sufficient grounds to deem the State liable for Atomspetsbud\u2019s debts to the applicants in the special circumstances of the present case, despite the fact that the company was a separate legal entity.",

To construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law, which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. The execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Burdov v.
