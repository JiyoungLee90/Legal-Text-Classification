According to the records of the jury\u2019s deliberations, a majority of the members had found the applicant not guilty on the grounds that there had been discrepancies between the statements of witnesses. The applicant was not acquitted because his innocence had been proven, but because he had been given the benefit of the doubt. Thus, the suspicion against the applicant had not been dissipated. As regards the applicant\u2019s request for the taking of evidence, the Regional Court found that it was prevented from examining further evidence.

The right to compensation demands that innocence be established. However, this requirement was not met in the applicant\u2019s case. Referring to the Regional Court\u2019s decision, the Court of Appeal found that the records of the jury\u2019s deliberations clearly expressed the opinion of the members of the jury.

It found that section 2 (1) (b) as such did not violate Article\u00a06 \u00a7 2 of the Convention which, under Austrian law, has the force of constitutional law. In the light of the Sekanina v. Austria case (judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no.\u00a0266-A), it held that it was not the refusal of a claim for compensation which was contrary to the Convention, but the re-examination of the question of guilt after a final acquittal. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view only the separate re-assessment of evidence on the basis of the contents of the whole court file was likely to infringe the presumption of innocence.

They point out that the present case is not comparable to the Sekanina judgment, as the essential ground for the Court finding a violation was that the reasoning of the Linz Court of Appeal did not have a sound basis either in the acquittal judgment or in the minutes of the jury.

The Court finds that this is an artificial interpretation of the Sekanina judgment, which would moreover not be in line with the general aim of the presumption of innocence which is to protect the accused against any judicial decision or other statements by State officials amounting to an assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt without him having previously been proved guilty according to law (see the Allenet de Ribemont v. France judgment of 10\u00a0February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, \u00a7 35, with further references). The Court cannot but affirm the general rule stated in the Sekanina judgment that, following a final acquittal, even the voicing of suspicions regarding an accused\u2019s innocence is no longer admissible. The Court, thus, considers that once an acquittal has become final - be it an acquittal giving the accused the benefit of the doubt in accordance with Article 6 \u00a7 2 - the voicing of any suspicions of guilt, including those expressed in the reasons for the acquittal, is incompatible with the presumption of innocence.\u201d",
