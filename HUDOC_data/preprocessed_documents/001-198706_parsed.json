Among other reasons, this is because pre-trial questioning is primarily a process by which the prosecution gather information in preparation for the trial in order to support their case in court, whereas the tribunal conducting the trial is called upon to determine a defendant\u2019s guilt following a fair assessment of all evidence actually produced at the trial, based on the direct examination of evidence in court.

It had the advantage of hearing the oral testimony of all the above seven witnesses and observing their demeanour when cross-examined by the parties. Having made its own assessment of the evidence before it, including the requests previously lodged by some of the witnesses in question who sought not to attend the trial for fear of repercussions by the applicants\u2019 supporters (see paragraph 18 above), the Regional Court, in its free assessment of the evidence, found their pre-trial statements to be more credible. In particular, it considered that the fact that those witnesses had retracted their earlier statements was conditioned by external influences and their being exposed to psychological pressure by the applicants\u2019 supporters (see paragraph 20 above).",

The Court will therefore not question under Article 6 \u00a7 1 the national courts\u2019 assessment, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Moreira Ferreira (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 83). Furthermore, the Court has on previous occasions found that where the domestic judicial authorities are confronted by several conflicting versions of the truth offered by the same person, the final preference for a statement given at the pre-trial stage over one given in an open court does not in itself raise an issue as regards the overall fairness of the proceedings where that preference is substantiated and the statement itself was given of the person\u2019s own volition (see Camilleri v. Malta (dec.), no. 51760/99, 16 March 2000).",

The Regional Court convicted the applicants based on its discretion in assessing the entirety of evidence put before it, having provided, as noted above, reasons behind its decision.
