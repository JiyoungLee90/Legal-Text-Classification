It concluded, accordingly, that an employer could not read personal messages sent or received by an employee via computer facilities made available to him or her for work purposes, even where the employer had prohibited use of the computer for non-professional purposes (Bulletin 2001 V No. 291, p. 233). In a judgment of 17 May 2005, it specified that, \u201csave in a case of serious risk or in exceptional circumstances, an employer c[ould] only open files identified by an employee as personal and stored on the hard disk of his or her work computer in the employee\u2019s presence or after he or she had been duly called\u201d (Bulletin\u00a02005 V No.\u00a0165, p.\u00a0143). In a judgment of 18 October 2006, it added that folders and files created by an employee using the computer facilities supplied by his or her employer for work purposes were presumed to be professional documents unless the employee had identified them as personal, and the employer could therefore have access to them in the employee\u2019s absence (Bulletin 2006 V No.\u00a0308, p. 294).",

The Court observes, however, that the Court of Cassation \u2013 examining a complaint under Article 8 \u2013 had already held at the material time that, save in a case of serious risk or in exceptional circumstances, an employer could only open files identified by an employee as personal and stored on the hard disk of his or her work computer in the employee\u2019s presence or after he or she had been duly called.

In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must consider the impugned decisions in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced to justify the interference at issue are relevant and sufficient.

Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2007I), its role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, for example, Waite and Kennedy v.

It observes next that, in reaching the conclusion summarised above, the Amiens Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 14-15 above) based itself on the finding that the pornographic photographs and videos in question were stored in a file labelled \u201cfun\u201d contained in a hard disk called \u201cD:/personal data\u201d, and on the SNCF\u2019s explanation that \u201cthe \u2018D\u2019 drive [was] called \u2018D:/data\u2019 by default and [was] traditionally used by staff to store their work documents\u201d. It went on to consider that an employee could not \u201cuse a whole hard disk, which was supposed to record professional data, for private use and that \u201cin any event the generic term \u201cpersonal data\u201d could have referred to work files being processed personally by the employee and did not therefore explicitly designate elements related to private life\u201d. More specifically, the Court of Appeal found that the term \u201cfun\u201d did not clearly confer a necessarily private designation on the file, as the term [could] refer to exchanges between colleagues at work or professional documents kept by the employee as \u201cbloopers\u201d. The Court of Appeal had, furthermore, accepted the SNCF\u2019s argument that the \u201cuser\u2019s charter provided that private information should be clearly identified as such (\u2018private\u2019 option in the Outlook criteria)\u201d, and that the same applied to the \u201cmedia receiving that information (\u2018private\u2019 folder)\u201d. It also considered that the measure taken against the applicant \u2013 his dismissal from the service \u2013 was not disproportionate, given that the applicant had committed a \u201cmassive breach\u201d of the SNCF\u2019s Code of Professional Conduct and its internal rules, which provided that staff were required to use the computer facilities supplied to them for exclusively professional purposes, with the occasional private use being merely tolerated. According to the Court of Appeal, his actions were particularly serious because, as an official responsible for general surveillance, he would have been expected to be of exemplary conduct.",

Admittedly, in using the word \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than \u201cprivate\u201d, the applicant used the same word as that found in the Court of Cassation\u2019s case-law to the effect that an employer cannot, in principle, open files identified as \u201cpersonal\u201d by the employee (see paragraph 18 above). However, in terms of the Court\u2019s task of assessing the compatibility of the impugned measures with Article 8 of the Convention, that is insufficient to call into question the relevance or adequacy of the grounds on which the domestic courts based their decisions, having regard to the fact that the user\u2019s charter for use of the SNCF\u2019s information system specifically states that \u201cprivate data must be clearly identified as such (inter alia \u2018private\u2019 option in the Outlook criteria) [and that] the same is true of the media receiving that information (\u2018private\u2019 folder)\u201d. The Court also accepts that, having noted that the applicant had used a substantial amount of the storage space on his work computer to store the files in question (1,562 files representing a volume of 787 megabytes), the SNCF and the domestic courts deemed it necessary to examine his case thoroughly.",

It had added, however, that files and folders created by an employee with the computer facilities supplied by his or her employer for professional use were presumed to be professional in nature unless the employee identified them as personal, which meant that the employer could access them in the employee\u2019s absence. Accordingly, at the material time positive law, as then established, allowed the employer, within those limits, to open files stored on an employee\u2019s work computer. The Court observes, further, that the complaint that the Court of Cassation\u2019s impartiality had been affected by the fact that a former legal director of the SNCF was now an advocate-general is not substantiated as the applicant did not even claim that the advocate-general had sat on the bench examining his appeal.",
