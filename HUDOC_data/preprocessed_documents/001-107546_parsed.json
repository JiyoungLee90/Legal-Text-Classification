Thus, in the applicant\u2019s particular case, the domestic courts took into account, according to the Government, such factors as the applicant\u2019s dangerousness for society (in view of the established fact of his association with the criminal underworld) and the record of his previous breaches of prison rules.

Consequently, the authorities should have immediately arranged for the necessary susceptibility laboratory tests in order to verify the sensitivity of his mycobacterium with respect to SLDs. However, according to the applicant\u2019s medical file, the first such test took place more than a year later, on 24\u00a0September 2007 (see paragraph 61 above).

The doctor treating the applicant in prison even formally prescribed him, on 8 October 2007, a daily dose of those drugs. However, the prescribed treatment did not start immediately, apparently due to a shortage of those drugs in the country. It was only seven months later, in June 2008, that the applicant started finally receiving the SLDs (see paragraphs 29 and 63 above). The Court reiterates in this connection that when necessary medicines are unavailable the overall quality of medical assistance is called into question,\u00a0\u00a0all the more so, if, as in the present case, such a pharmaceutical shortage has directly deleterious effects on the applicant\u2019s state of health (see Pitalev v.

Thus, the Government acknowledged themselves that the DOTS+ programme, which provided for preliminary special training of doctors and nurses, had been introduced in the new prison hospital as late as April 2009 (see paragraph 65 above), that is, three months after the applicant\u2019s death. In other words, the clinicians in charge of the applicant\u2019s case could not have possessed all the necessary skills at the time of his treatment. However, it is a well-known fact, acknowledged in the present case by the prison authorities themselves, that complex medical treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis requires constant supervision by adequately trained clinicians, and taking second-line drugs without such supervision may cause more harm than good (see paragraph 66 above). Thus, the Court observes that such drugs are extremely toxic and can cause a range of serious sideeffects, including hepatitis, depression, hallucinations and other types of personality disorders, and it is consequently imperative that the clinicians monitoring the treatment be already experienced in that respect, aware of all the risk factors and undertake measures aimed at the reduction of those risks (see the Guidelines, paragraph 48 above).",

No less important is continuing communication between the clinicians and the patient during the strike, when the former verify on a daily basis the validity of the detainee\u2019s wish to abstain from taking food. It is also crucial, in the Court\u2019s opinion, to ascertain the true intention of and real reasons for the detainee\u2019s protest, and if those reasons are not purely whimsical but, on the contrary, denounce serious medical mismanagement, the competent authorities must show due diligence by immediately starting negotiations with the striker with the aim of finding a suitable arrangement, subject, of course, to the restrictions that the legitimate demands of imprisonment may impose (see, mutatis mutandis, Holomiov, cited above, \u00a7 119).",

However, the Court cannot discern from the medical file whether relevant medical specialists ever attempted to enquire if the applicant\u2019s conduct might have been conditioned by, for instance, SLD-caused mental relapses, thus necessitating the relevant psychological or psychiatric feedback. The Court further notes that the main reason of the applicant\u2019s first hunger strike in October 2008 was the authorities\u2019 unjustified refusal to conduct his additional medical examination, to which measure he had been fully entitled by the Tbilisi Court of Appeal\u2019s final and enforceable decision of 25 September 2008. Then, as regards his second hunger strike in November 2008, the main reason for it was the authorities\u2019 failure to implement the medical recommendations of 31\u00a0October-7\u00a0November 2008 by transferring him to a specialised tuberculosis hospital. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s reasons for his protest, whereby he requested something which the medical experts had prescribed him, could not be said to have been whimsical. On the contrary, it is yet another sign of the inadequacy of medical care when the prison authorities refuse to implement a qualified medical recommendation (see, for instance, S\u0142awomir Musia\u0142, cited above, \u00a7 92; Sarban v. , no. 3456/05, \u00a7 84, 4 October 2005; Holomiov, cited above, \u00a7 117; and Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 116). It should be noted in this regard that, at the material time, two civil hospitals \u2013 the National Centre for Lung Diseases and Abastumani Hospital \u2013 represented specialised medical units running the DOTS+ programme and were thus fit for treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (see paragraph 66 above). That being so, the Court considers the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to have recourse to those specialised medical facilities was reproachable (see Akhmetov v. , no.\u00a037463/04, \u00a7 81, 1\u00a0April 2010).",

Thus, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s type of tuberculosis constituted a ground for his conditional release pending treatment (see paragraphs 15, 40 and 41 above).

Thus, the Court notes that both the Tbilisi City Court and the Tbilisi Court of Appeal turned a blind eye to the exceptional gravity of the applicant\u2019s condition which, according to the qualified medical experts, was deteriorating in prison conditions, and to the consequent fact that the medical assistance dispensed in prison appeared to be incapable of fighting his tuberculosis (compare with, for instance, Mouisel v. , no. 67263/01, \u00a7\u00a040-42, ECHR\u00a02002IX). Nor did the domestic courts address the advisability of the continued detention in the light of any other legitimate considerations. Thus, whilst the Government claimed in their observations that the applicant could not have been released due to his allegedly high dangerousness for society and breach of certain prison rules, the Court notes that those particular reasons were never mentioned in the decisions of the domestic courts.

Thus, the State failed to ensure timely access to the relevant susceptibility laboratory tests, which were indispensable for early and accurate diagnosis and planning of a drug regimen necessary for effective treatment of the applicant\u2019s type of mycobacterium. Nor did the State take measures to provide the applicant with the SLDs which appeared to be capable of fighting his disease, shifting that vital aspect of effective treatment onto the applicant.\u00a0Of further concern is that, even after the applicant\u2019s family had finally obtained the necessary anti-tuberculosis drugs, the State did not ensure that the administration of those drugs occurred under the strict monitoring of specially trained clinicians. The Court notes with concern that all those omissions were due to the fact that, despite the threatening magnitude of the problem of the transmission of multi-drug resistant forms of tuberculosis and the associated high rate of mortality in Georgian prisons, which has prevailed in the country for many years, the relevant State authorities did not begin implementation of the standard general health-care measures \u2013 outlined by the WHO as far back as 1997 \u2013 until March 2008 (see paragraphs 46-48 and 65 above). This mismanagement by the State in the medical sphere, which directly resulted in or contributed to the death of the first applicant, cannot be justified, under Article 2 of the Convention, by a lack of resources (see, mutatis mutandis, Dybeku, cited above, \u00a7 50).",

None of those possibilities were employed by the respondent State.

However, the response is negative, since, as was already established above, that hospital did not possess either the necessary laboratory equipment or the second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, and, most importantly, its medical staff did not possess, at the material time, the necessary skills for the management of complex treatment of multi-drug resistant forms of tuberculosis. All those serious deficiencies of the prison hospital were or should have been known to the respondent Government, as the qualified medical experts had denounced on several occasions the adequacy of the treatment dispensed to the applicant in the penitentiary sector, noting his rapid decline and equally recommending his transfer to a hospital specialised in tuberculosis treatment (see paragraphs 13, 15, 25 and 29 above).",

In the particular circumstances, the Court considers the only possible objective impediment to the fulfilment of the measure in question could have been the absence of such a specialised establishment in  at the material time. However, referring again to its relevant findings above, the Court notes that, at the time of the indication of the interim measure of 10 November 2008, two tuberculosis hospitals in the civil sector \u2013 the National Centre for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases and Abastumani Hospital \u2013 were already running the DOTS+ programme, which necessarily implied that those hospitals possessed by that time both the required medical equipment and specially trained clinicians. Thus, it was objectively possible to place the applicant in either of these two civil tuberculosis hospitals. Indeed, it should be only natural for the State authorities, and might be even directly required under the Convention, to resort to a specialised medical facility in the civil sector, when a detainee\u2019s health condition is critical and no comparable medical assistance is available in the penitentiary sector (see, for instance, Aleksanyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 155-157, and Akhmetov, cited above, \u00a7 81).",

In particular, the waiting list of patients with tuberculosis\u00a0in need of the relevant treatment should normally be managed in order of clinical priority. In the first applicant\u2019s situation, as was clearly suggested by medical experts at domestic level, the preservation of his health and life was contingent on his placement in a specialised tuberculosis hospital (see paragraph 101 above for further cross-references).",
