He did not assume the mantle of prosecutor: he neither drew up the indictment nor represented the prosecuting authorities before the trial court (see paragraph 11 above).

Besides, the applicant does not contest this. What is more, when hearing Mr. Schiesser the District Attorney acted alone, that is without the Public Prosecutor\u2019s assistance or supervision. Since he had neither to submit to outside interference nor to consult another authority, the District Attorney exercised the personal discretion conferred on him by law.

That he would not do so was not clear \u2013 and certainly not clear to the applicant - when the District Attorney made the order that the applicant should be placed in detention on remand.

By that I mean the fonctions/powers which specifically distinguish a judge from other officials acting generally within the framework of the judicial system or of the administration of justice. In this respect, it is significant that, while the French text uses the expression \"fonctions judiciaires\" (translated literally as \"judicial functions\"), the English text speaks of \"judicial power\". It is equally significant that the task provided for in Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) entrusted, first and foremost, to a judge. The term \"judicial\" in this provision should therefore be interpreted as having a narrow meaning. The exercise of fonctions judiciaires/judicial power means the exercise of a judge\u2019s fonctions/power by an authority not invested with the formal status of a judge.",

Such functions cannot be described as involving \"judicial power\" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3). While being true for his powers as a prosecutor, this is no less valid for his investigating activities. Criminal investigation, even when performed, as it should always be, in conditions of independence and objectivity, does not involve a power which in itself confers on the person exercising it the status of a judge. It is thus not reconcilable with Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention to affirm that a District Attorney in the Canton of Z\u00fcrich exercises \"judicial power\" by reason of the fact that he acts as an investigating authority. Moreover, the position he occupies in the structure of the judicial machinery under consideration and the nature of his hierarchical dependence reinforce this conclusion.",

Nevertheless, such a combination of judicial and non-judicial power must not entail fundamental contradictions as to the nature and the purpose of the diverse powers so combined. Even if, on a broad interpretation of the expression \"officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power\", it were accepted that the function provided for in Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) may be attributed to an authority primarily exercising power other than that of a judge, what is nonetheless essential is that this other power should not be incompatible with the power of a judge. To entrust the power of decision regarding detention on remand to an authority which numbers amongst its powers that of a prosecuting authority would be contrary to the Convention. It is immaterial whether or not in a given case this authority is called on to exercise the two kinds of power. Their incompatibility is inherent in the system itself and divests the authority in question of the legal and psychological attributes of independence, objectivity and impartiality that must be possessed by the authority to which Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) entrusts the fate of a person deprived of his liberty.",
