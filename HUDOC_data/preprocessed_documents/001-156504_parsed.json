Therefore, they and their legal successors could not now complain of a breach of their human rights. Indeed, the original lease agreement had neither stipulated a low level of rent nor envisaged future increases in rent.

The Government considered that the applicants had been fully aware of the applicable future rent, especially following the reform in 2009. Thus, the applicants had not suffered an excessive and individual burden. The Government also pointed out that the reform in 2009 had provided for an increase in rents as well as other benefits, such as the possibility to terminate leases. It had also introduced changes concerning the disbursement of maintenance costs and strict controls to reduce the instances where a lease could be renewed in favour of a member of the lessee\u2019s family after the lessee\u2019s death. Of relevance to the present case was also the fact that the amendments established that a lease entered into before 1 June 1995 must terminate within twenty years from 2008. Thus, in the applicants\u2019 case their property would be free and unencumbered as of 2028 and until that time the law provided for a rent increase each year (see paragraph 27 above).

In that case, when the applicants had acquired their respective houses their rents had been set in accordance with the rent regulations applicable at the time and the applicants could not have increased the rents above the threshold set by the State. Nor were they free to terminate the rent agreements and conclude new ones with different \u2013 higher \u2013 levels of rent. The Court held that it could not be said that the applicants as landlords had implicitly waived their right to set the level of rents, as, for the Court, waiving a right necessarily presupposed that it would have been possible to exercise it. There was no waiver of a right in a situation where the person concerned had never had the option of exercising that right and thus could not waive it.

Furthermore, the applicants were unable to fix the rent \u2013 or rather to increase the rent previously established by their predecessor in title. The Court notes that, generally, increases in rent could be done through the RRB. They were, however, subject to capping, in that any increase could not go beyond 40% of the fair rent at which the premises were or could have been leased before August 1914. Indeed, in the applicants\u2019 case no increase was possible at all, because the rent originally fixed in 1971 was already beyond the capping threshold.",

Subsequently, for the year 2010 the rent amounted to EUR\u00a0990, for 2011 EUR 1,138, for 2012 EUR 1,309 and for 2013 EUR\u00a01,505. For the years 2014 onwards it would increase by 5% a year. The Court reiterates that State control over levels of rent falls into a sphere that is subject to a wide margin of appreciation by the State, and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable. Nevertheless, this may not lead to results which are manifestly unreasonable, such as amounts of rent allowing only a minimal profit (see Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7 62). While the applicants do not have an absolute right to obtain rent at market value, the Court observes that, despite the 2009 amendments, the amount of rent is significantly lower than the market value of the premises as submitted by the applicants, which was not effectively contested by the Government. However, the applicants have not argued that they were unable to make any profit. Even so, this element must be balanced against the interests at play in the present case.",

In such circumstances, both States and the Court in its supervisory role must be vigilant to ensure that measures such as the one at issue, applied automatically, do not give rise to an imbalance that imposes an excessive burden on landlords while allowing tenants of commercial property to make inflated profits.

The Court is of the view that the applicants should be awarded just satisfaction based on a reasonable amount of rent which would have provided them with more than a minimal profit (see Fleri Soler and Camilleri v. Malta (just satisfaction), no.\u00a035349/05, \u00a7 18, 17 July 2008). In assessing the pecuniary damage sustained by them, the Court has, as far as appropriate, considered the estimates provided and had regard to the information available to it on rental values in the Maltese property market during the relevant period. The Court notes that legitimate objectives in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see, inter alia, Jahn and Others v. Germany\u00a0[GC], nos.\u00a046720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2005-VI, and Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7 77). Nonetheless, the Court bears in mind that the property was not used for securing the social welfare of tenants or preventing homelessness (see Fleri Soler (just satisfaction) cited above, \u00a7\u00a018). Thus, the situation in the present case might be said to involve a degree of public interest which is significantly less marked than in other cases and which does not justify such a substantial reduction compared with the free market rental value (compare also Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077, and Ghigo v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 31122/05, \u00a7 20, 17 July 2008).",
