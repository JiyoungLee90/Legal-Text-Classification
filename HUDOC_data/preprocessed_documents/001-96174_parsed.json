It also notes that in one of the court actions which the applicant lodged subsequently he asked for the correct calculation of his pension for the same period and that the court partly allowed his claim and made a monetary award in his favour (see paragraph 19 above). The Court considers that had the judgment of 22\u00a0October 2001 been fully enforced, as argued by the Government, the applicant would have obtained the entire amount due to him for the period starting on 1 July 1993. However, the fact that a court had to make an additional award for the same period and in respect of the same pension rights in 2004 confirms that the applicant did not obtain his entire pension before the judgment of 2004. This conclusion is consistent with the letter from the debtor itself sent on 17 March 2003, according to which the Ministry did not have sufficient money in its accounts to enforce the applicant's warrant (see paragraph 14 above). Finally, the Government expressly acknowledged that enforcement of the judgment of 22 October 2001 had taken place on 23 December 2004 (see paragraph 29 above).",
