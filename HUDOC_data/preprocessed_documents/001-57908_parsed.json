However, on military premises the only publications that could be supplied were those which identified at least to some extent with the constitutional duties of the army, did not damage its reputation and did not lend column space to political parties. Even critical magazines such as the journal Hallo of the trade union youth organisation would not be banned if they respected these conditions. Der Igel, on the other hand, did not comply with them.

The fact that the VDS\u00d6 retained the possibility of sending its journal to subscribers could not offset such a handicap.

Not only had he, when taking the oath, made a protest directed at the President of the Republic, he had also lodged several complaints and circulated a petition and an open letter (see paragraph 9 above). The applicant had thus borne a large share of the responsibility for the friction existing at the time in his barracks. He was in addition a member of the Austrian communist party, whose manifesto called for the abolition of the army. By ordering him to cease distributing der Igel, the officer in question had sought to prevent him from destabilising his fellow soldiers even further.",

It shares the Government\u2019s opinion that the particular incident must be viewed in its general context. This approach does not, however, remove the necessity of first examining the content of the publication in issue. Like the Commission, the Court notes that issue no. 3/87 of der Igel was essentially devoted to articles on the conditions of national service (see paragraph 10 above). These articles were written in a critical or even satirical style and were quick to make demands or put forward proposals for reform, yet they did not call into question the duty of obedience or the purpose of service in the armed forces. Accordingly the magazine could scarcely be seen as a serious threat to military discipline. It follows that the measure in question was disproportionate to the aim pursued and infringed Article 10 (art. 10).",

Certain restrictions were undoubtedly imposed on Mr Gubi when he was ordered by an officer to stop distributing the magazine der Igel in his barracks. However, these restrictions were limited to his conduct within the barracks. They did not affect the distribution of this publication in any other way. Applying the principle of proportionality, I have, unlike the Court, found that the Austrian officer acted within the permissible boundaries of Article 10 (art. 10) in issuing the said order to Mr Gubi.",

The \"official\" distribution of the journal in question would have amounted in a way to identifying at least implicitly with the content of the magazine, which, in my view, the relevant military authorities could not be expected to do.",
