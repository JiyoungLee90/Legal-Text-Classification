The post-20 July 2006 version of the rule established a presumption that the public interest required deportation. The Secretary of State would consider all relevant factors in considering whether the presumption was outweighed in a particular case, but it would be only in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation would be outweighed in a case where it would not be contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights or the Refugee Convention to deport.

There is no specific period after which revocation will be appropriate although Annex A to Chapter 13 of the IDIs gives broad guidelines on the length of time deportation orders should remain in force after removal. Cases which will normally be appropriate for revocation three years after deportation include those of overstayers and persons who failed to observe a condition attached to their leave, persons who obtained leave by deception, and family members deported under section 3(5)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971. With regard to criminal conviction cases, the normal course of action will be to grant an application for revocation where the decision to deport was founded on a criminal conviction which is now \u201cspent\u201d under section 7(3) of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Paragraph 391 of the Rules, however, indicates that in the case of an applicant with a serious criminal record continued exclusion for a long term of years will normally be the proper course. This is expanded on in Annex A to Chapter 13 of the IDIs, which indicates that revocation would not normally be appropriate until at least 10 years after departure for those convicted of serious offences such as violence against the person, sexual offences, burglary, robbery or theft, and other offences such as forgery and drug trafficking.",

The question of which version of paragraph 364 should be applied to the applicant, however, did not go to the question of whether the decision to deport him was in accordance with the law; rather, it was a factual question as to the date of the decision and the correct rule to be applied. The AIT, having heard all of the evidence, concluded first, that the decision to deport was taken when it was served on the applicant, and secondly, that even if this was not correct, the applicant\u2019s case could still not succeed under the criteria that applied prior to the amendment of the Immigration Rules.

The term of imprisonment of four and a half years was demonstrative of the gravity of the offence. In particular, in his sentencing remarks the judge noted that the applicant was one of the ringleaders in a robbery that was terrifying for the victims. The Government submitted that although the offence committed in May 2005 was relatively minor, it demonstrated that the applicant had not been deterred from reoffending.

The conviction for robbery was particularly serious: in sentencing the applicant to four and a half years\u2019 imprisonment the judge noted that the applicant was one of the ringleaders of the operation and that the use of weapons made it a terrifying ordeal for the victims. Moreover, although the applicant submits that the majority of his offences were committed when he was between seventeen and eighteen years old, he was in fact nineteen years old when he was last convicted of burglary and twenty-two years old when he was convicted of robbery. The present case is therefore readily distinguishable from Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, \u00a7 81, 23 June 2008, where the Court found a violation of Article 8. In Maslov, the (mostly non-violent) offences were committed by the applicant when he was between fourteen and fifteen years old and could therefore be regarded as acts of juvenile delinquency.",

Nevertheless, without underestimating the disruptive effect that the applicant\u2019s deportation has had, and will continue to have, on her life, it is unlikely to have had the same impact as it would if the applicant and his daughter had been living together as a family.

Moreover, the applicant\u2019s partner was aware of his criminal record and immigration history when they decided to marry and start a family. In particular, she was aware that in 2001 the Secretary of State had advised the applicant that he was considering deportation. Although the Court has some sympathy with the applicant on account of the long and inexplicable delay in the commencement of deportation action, in the circumstances of the present case it does not accept that the delay entitled the applicant and his partner to assume that no further action would be taken. The Home Office had never indicated that it had considered his case and decided against deportation, and in April 2006, just five months before the marriage, the Home Office had announced that there would be a \u201ccrackdown\u201d following the much-publicised admission that 1023 foreign national criminals, who should have been considered for deportation or removal, had completed their prison sentences and were released without any consideration of deportation or removal action.",
