The Court takes note, in particular, of the contradictions in the available police reports: according to one of them, the applicant was released at 9.40 p.m. on that day; according to another one, he was arrested at 10.10 p.m.; whereas according to the judicial ruling mentioned above (relying on yet another police report), the applicant was arrested at 3.25 p.m. on 19 July 2007 and remained detained thereafter (see\u00a0paragraphs 10 and 14 above).",

Subsequently, his cell-mate, in a private conversation, made him confess to that murder and indicate the place where he had thrown the knife, and that conversation was reported to the police. Finally, in the evening on that day the police conducted a search at the applicant\u2019s home and seized his shirt (see paragraphs 11-13 above). Accordingly, looking beyond the appearances and the language used, and concentrating on the realities of the situation, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s administrative detention was in reality part of his detention on remand under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) as a criminal suspect in the murder case without, however, safeguarding his procedural rights as a suspect (see Kafkaris v.

The Court notes that the applicant did not have the status of a criminal suspect then. That being so, the role of the appointed lawyer was unclear. Furthermore, the participation of that lawyer was confined to an isolated questioning, whereas numerous other investigative measures were carried out without his involvement (see paragraphs 11 and 15-17 above). Lastly, but particularly importantly from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the failure to duly document the applicant\u2019s detention as being on suspicion of a criminal offence implied for him the absence of a timely judicial control (see also paragraph 40 below).",
