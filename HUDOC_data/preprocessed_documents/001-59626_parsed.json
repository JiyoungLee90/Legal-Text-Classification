The present case therefore concerns the delay in substituting for detention in prison a more lenient security measure. Accordingly, it is clearly distinguished from other cases dealt with by the Court in which a breach of Article 5 of the Convention was found because the release of an applicant had been delayed (see, for instance, Quinn v.

Although it is true that under certain circumstances transfer from one psychiatric hospital to another may result in a significant improvement in the patient\u2019s overall situation, the fact remains that such a transfer in no way alters the type of deprivation of liberty to which an applicant is subjected. The same cannot be said of replacing detention in prison with house arrest because this entails a change in the nature of the place of detention from a public institution to a private home. Unlike house arrest, detention in prison requires integration of the individual into an overall organisation, sharing of activities and resources with other inmates, and strict supervision by the authorities of the main aspects of his day-to-day life.",

Whilst I do not find the position adopted by the Court in Ashingdane very convincing and think that it may merit some reappraisal, I find it difficult to agree that there are substantial differences between Ashingdane and the present case. In my opinion it is the analogies between the two cases that are important, the differences being insignificant. The crucial point is that in both cases there was a transition from a stricter form of detention to a more liberal one. In both cases therefore the detention did not cease to be \u2013 to use the words of the Court in Ashingdane \u2013 a \u201clawful detention\u201d entailing any greater limitations than those provided for under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, pp. 2122, \u00a7 47).
