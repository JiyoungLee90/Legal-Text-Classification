The decision was very similar to that of 11 September 2003. It gave a more detailed description of the injuries established on the applicant upon his transfer to the IZ-43/1 remand centre and contained his own submissions. It further relied on statements from police officers F. and Ye. and those of investigator Zh., all of them taken almost word for word from the decision of 11 September 2003. The decision then stated that investigative actions in the applicant\u2019s respect had been carried out from 9\u00a0a.m. until 12.10 p.m., that is before his transfer to the temporary holding facility, and that, according to a medical record made in the IVS, the applicant had not made any complaints after his transfer there.

Therefore, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as a possible remedy where the prosecution has decided not to investigate the claims. The Court, however, has doubts that this remedy would have been effective in the present case. It observes that, following the applicant\u2019s complaint about beatings by the police, the district prosecutor\u2019s office carried out a certain inquiry which resulted in a decision of 11 September 2003 to dispense with criminal proceedings owing to the absence of evidence that any crime had been committed (see paragraph 12 above). This latter decision was then quashed by a supervising prosecutor, who instructed the investigating authorities to carry out an additional inquiry (see paragraph 16 above). That inquiry resulted in the decision of 1 March 2004 not to institute criminal proceedings, which was identical to that of 11 September 2003 (see paragraph 17 above).",

Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused.

While acknowledging the presence of injuries on the applicant, the authorities rejected as unfounded his allegations that they had been inflicted as a result of ill-treatment by the police. The decisions mainly relied on the statements of the police officers against whom the applicant\u2019s allegations were directed and those of the investigator in charge in the criminal case against him. They also referred to the medical records of the temporary holding facility where the applicant had been held from 26 to 28 August 2003, which apparently stated that there were no injuries on the applicant at the time of his transfer to that facility on 26 August 2003 (see paragraph 13 above). The authorities made no attempt to question an official who had examined the applicant upon his transfer to the temporary holding facility, or an official who had examined the applicant upon his transfer to the IZ-43/01 remand centre, when injuries had been found on him. Moreover, it does not appear that any attempt was made to explain the discrepancy in the medical records drawn up by the former and the latter and, in particular, to investigate whether the applicant had been subjected to any ill-treatment after his transfer to the temporary holding facility, as he alleged had happened.

It considers that such a situation may potentially be problematic, regard being had to the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant could have obtained compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage for the inhuman treatment allegedly inflicted on him only if those responsible were convicted of that criminal offence by a final and binding court decision. The Court also reiterates that it has already found a violation of Article 13 taken in conjunction with Article 3 of the Convention in a similar situation, where by operation of provisions of the domestic law, the applicant was barred from suing officials, who ill-treated him, on the ground that criminal proceedings against them had been discontinued owing to the absence of evidence that any crime had been committed (see Chember v. Russia, no.\u00a07188/03, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2008).",
