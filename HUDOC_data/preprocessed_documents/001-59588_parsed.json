Mr\u00a0Slobodn\u00edk argued that he had been summoned to the training course in Sekule by an order and that he had left it at the first opportunity after he had learned about its real purpose. He also explained that martial law had been in force at the material time and that people had been unlawfully executed or detained. Members of the Hlinka Youth had been incorporated in the armed forces by a presidential order and had fallen under military judicial and disciplinary rules.

The applicant further argued that his statement was a value judgment based on the undisputed facts that the plaintiff had been a member of the Hlinka Youth and that he had attended a terrorist training course in Sekule. It was irrelevant to what extent the plaintiff had been involved in the activities of the Hlinka Youth or for how long he had been a member of it. What mattered was that the plaintiff had voluntarily joined the organisation and that, after his alleged exclusion from the training course in Sekule, he had undertaken, as shown by the Soviet military tribunal\u2019s judgment of 19 May 1945, to provide information on the movements of Soviet troops to the headquarters of the Hlinka Youth.

A norm cannot be regarded as a \u201claw\u201d unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Whilst certainty in the law is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Rekv\u00e9nyi v. Hungary [GC], no.\u00a025390/94, \u00a7 34, ECHR 1999-III).",

It is within the national courts\u2019 discretion to consider any specific complaint of an alleged infringement and to decide on the appropriate satisfaction. In accordance with the established practice, a plaintiff in defamation proceedings has to prove that the defendant\u2019s allegations were objectively capable of affecting his or her rights under Article 11 of the Civil Code, in which case the defendant is required to produce evidence capable of proving the truth of his or her allegations if the defence is to succeed.

The Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Vogt v.

The necessity of a link between a value judgment and its supporting facts may vary from case to case according to the specific circumstances. In the present case, the Court is satisfied that the value judgment made by the applicant was based on information which was already known to the general public, both because Mr Slobodn\u00edk\u2019s political life was known, and because information about his past was disclosed, by him in his book, and in publications by the press which preceded the statement by the applicant. Nor can the Court subscribe to a restrictive definition of the term \u201cfascist past\u201d. The term is a wide one, capable of evoking in those who read it different notions as to its content and significance. One of them can be that a person participated in a fascist organisation, as a member, even if this was not coupled with specific activities propagating fascist ideals. ",

The appellate court found that Mr Slobodn\u00edk had joined that organisation because he had wanted to participate in sports activities and had not been motivated by fascist sympathies. As to the training course in Sekule, it found that Mr Slobodn\u00edk had not completed it and accepted the latter\u2019s argument that he had learned about the purpose of the course only after he had started attending it.

As the applicant had not proved that Mr Slobodn\u00edk had a fascist past within that meaning, the court of cassation found that the statement of 29\u00a0July 1992 had been an unjustified interference with his personality rights. However, the court of cassation did not exclude that the applicant\u2019s statement could be regarded as a value judgment, which would not require any proof, if it had been accompanied by reference to the facts on which the applicant had based his judgment.",

This is all the more important as he expressly referred to the philosophy of the  trials. In doing so, the applicant opened the door to all kinds of speculations about the fascist and criminal past of Mr Slobodn\u00edk even for those who had read the material concerning Mr Slobodn\u00edk\u2019s past.
