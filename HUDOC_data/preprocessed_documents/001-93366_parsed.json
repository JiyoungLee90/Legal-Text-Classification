Bulgaria, no. 57176/00, 15 January 2009; Dimitar\u00a0and\u00a0Anka\u00a0Dimitrovi v. Bulgaria, no. 56753/00 12 February 2009; and Vladimirova and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 42617/02, 26 February 2009). The Court considers that, as in those cases, the first applicant forewent the opportunity to obtain at least between 15% and 25% of the value of the property taken away from her (assessed in accordance with the relevant regulations), as that was the rate at which bonds were traded until the end of 2004. The fact that bond prices rose at the end of 2004 or that the applicable law was amended with effect as of 2007 and provided for payment of the bonds at face value cannot lead to the conclusion that the authorities would have secured adequate compensation for the first applicant. Indeed, she could not have foreseen bond prices or legislative amendments and the Court cannot speculate whether she would have waited before cashing her bonds. Furthermore, the legislation on compensation changed frequently and was not foreseeable (see Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191 and 226). As the Court ruled in Velikovi and Others, the applicants\u2019 failure to use the bonds compensation scheme must be taken into consideration under Article 41, but cannot decisively affect the outcome of the Article 1 of Protocol No.1 complaint.",
