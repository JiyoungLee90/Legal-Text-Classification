The applicant submitted that, as a matter of fact, Ms\u00a0K. had not been an ordinary private individual but a paid undercover agent of the DCS who had collaborated with the latter authority in respect of a number of other unrelated criminal cases. He emphasised the fact that Ms K. had already been a police agent by the time she had first approached him. Ms N., another protagonist in the criminal case against the applicant, had apparently been another undercover agent of the DCS, whom he had had no possibility to question in court. The applicant stated that the domestic courts had not even mentioned the fact that she had been an undercover agent, let alone giving any meaningful answer to his plea of entrapment. The applicant also suggested that Ms K. had herself become the target of pressure from the authorities \u2013 in the form of the criminal proceedings instituted against her \u2013 after she had partly testified in his favour during the trial (see paragraph 19 above).",

In this respect, the Court\u2019s examination of complaints of entrapment has developed on the basis of two tests: the substantive test and the procedural test of incitement (see, for instance, Bannikova v. Russia no.\u00a018757/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037 and\u00a051, 4\u00a0November 2010). Under the substantive test, when examining an applicant\u2019s arguable plea of entrapment, the Court will enquire, as a first step, into whether the authorities had good reasons for mounting a covert operation. In particular, they must show that they were in possession of concrete, objective and verifiable evidence showing that initial steps have been taken to commit the acts constituting the offence, and that the criminal act was already underway at the time when the police intervened (see, generally, Shannon v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 67537/01, ECHR\u00a02004-IV; Eurofinacom v. France (dec.), no. 58753/00, ECHR\u00a02004VII; and Furcht v. Germany, no.\u00a054648/09, \u00a7\u00a051, 23\u00a0October 2014). This principle rules out, in particular, any conduct that may be interpreted as inciting the applicant to commit an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, such as taking the initiative in contacting the applicant, repeating an offer despite having received an initial refusal, insistent prompting, the promise of financial gain, or appealing to the applicant\u2019s sense of compassion (compare, among other cases, Ramanauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a074420/01, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2008; Malininas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a010071/04, \u00a7\u00a037, 1 July 2008; and Vanyan v.\u00a0Russia, no. 53203/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011 and 49, 15\u00a0December 2005).",

Lithuania, no.\u00a074355/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-38, 24\u00a0June 2008). A collaborator or informant would run a significant risk of extending their role to that of agents provocateurs, in possible breach of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, if they were to take part in a policesupervised operation. It is therefore crucial in each case to establish if the criminal act was already under way at the time when the source began collaboration with the police (compare Eurofinacom and Vanyan, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-49). In assessing a plea of entrapment, it is also important to analyse whether the private individual who informed the authorities of the applicant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct might have had any ulterior motives (see Milinien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 39). The Court has found that the line between legitimate infiltration by an undercover agent and the instigation of a crime is more likely to be crossed if no clear and foreseeable procedure was set up under the domestic law for authorising and implementing undercover operations \u2013 all the more so if they were also not properly supervised. It has considered judicial supervision as the most appropriate means in cases involving covert operations (see Khudobin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 59696/00, \u00a7\u00a0135, ECHR 2006XII (extracts); Furcht, cited above, \u00a7 53; and Bannikova, also cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049 and 50). A lack of procedural safeguards in the ordering of an undercover operation generates a risk of arbitrariness and police entrapment (see Nosko and Nefedov, cited above, \u00a7 64).",

In examining the procedure followed by the domestic courts the Court has had regard to the potential outcome of a successful plea of incitement (see Bannikova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 53, with further references).\u00a0As the starting point, the Court will therefore verify whether an arguable complaint of incitement constitutes a substantive defence under domestic law, or gives grounds for the exclusion of evidence, or leads to similar consequences (see Khudobin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 133-135). Although the Court will generally leave it to the domestic authorities to decide what procedure must be followed by the judiciary when faced with a plea of incitement, it requires such a procedure to be adversarial, thorough, comprehensive and conclusive on the issue of entrapment, with the burden of proof on the relevant prosecution authority to demonstrate that there was no incitement. The scope of the domestic judicial review must include the reasons why the undercover operation was mounted, the extent of the law enforcement authorities\u2019 involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant was subjected (see, among other authorities,\u00a0Ramanauskas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070 and 71, and Bannikova, cited above, \u00a7 48). The domestic courts\u2019 duty to ensure the overall fairness of the trial requires, inter alia, that the undercover agents and other witnesses who could testify on the issue of incitement should be heard in court and be cross-examined by the defence, or at least that detailed reasons should be given for a failure to do so (compare L\u00fcdi v.\u00a0Switzerland, 15 June 1992, \u00a7\u00a049, Series A no.\u00a0238; Bulfinsky v.\u00a0Romania, no. 28823/04, \u00a7 45, 1\u00a0 June 2010; and Kuzmickaja v.\u00a0Lithuania (dec.), no. 27968/03, 10 June 2008). The Court\u2019s findings under the procedural test will become of decisive significance for the finding of whether or not impugned criminal proceedings have been conducted in breach of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (compare, for instance, Sepil v. Turkey, no. 17711/07, \u00a7 37-40, 12 November 2013, and Constantin and Stoian v.\u00a0Romania, nos. 23782/06 and 46629/06, \u00a7\u00a064, 29\u00a0September 2009).",

Thus, the Court will base its assessment on the fact \u2013 established by the domestic courts \u2013 that the applicant indeed accepted a bribe from Ms\u00a0K. in exchange for a promise to assist her in the implementation of a business plan (compare, mutatis mutandis, Matanovi\u0107 v.

In other words, the Court must ascertain whether the DCS confined itself to \u201cinvestigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner\u201d (see, for instance, Ramanauskas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67). Its ability to make a substantive finding on this point will depend, however, on whether or not the case file contains sufficient information on the undercover activities. If the substantive test is inconclusive owing to the lack of information in the file, the Court will proceed to the second step of its examination, whereby it will assess the procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined by the domestic courts in the light of the criteria set out in paragraph 46 above. Although there was no evidence that the applicant had committed any offences, in particular corruption-related ones, before the incident in question, the absence of a criminal record could not in itself, detached from the other circumstances of the case, be understood as an indication of bad faith in the law-enforcement authority\u2019s decision to mount an undercover operation against him after Ms K. had reported his alleged request for a bribe. Nor can the subsequent technical and financial backing given by the DCS to the person who had purportedly received the request for a bribe \u2013 so that the latter could record the commission of the offence \u2013 be equated with the transgression by the police of the bounds of its undercover investigative work (compare, for instance, Matanovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0138, and Milinien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 38).",

Ms K. conceded herself during the applicant\u2019s trial that when she had approached the applicant for the first time on 1 December 2005, she had already been acting under the DCS\u2019s instructions. On the other hand, however, the Court observes that, according to the official version of the events, it was not Ms K. who had proposed a bribe to the applicant. On the contrary, it was the latter who had been the first one to request a pay-off from her in the amount of USD\u00a030,000. Although, the applicant claimed before the domestic courts that he had had no intention to retain any part of the received money for his personal benefit, this allegation is no valid excuse for his taking the initiative and raising financial aspects in the conversation with Ms K. (see paragraphs 7, 17, 18, 24 and 25 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot determine with sufficient certainty, only on the basis of the materials available in the case file, that Ms K. took an active and decisive role in the creation of the stratagem that instigated the commission of the bribe offence in question.

In this regard, the Court is satisfied that the applicant basing his defence before the trial court on the grounds of alleged police entrapment was a valid course of action, as it could have resulted in the exclusion of the evidence obtained as a result of such an investigative technique (compare Matanovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0140, and Bannikova, cited above, \u00a7 56). In particular, under sections 3, 6 and 7 of the Act on Special Investigative Activity it was outlawed for an investigative technique involving the infiltration of an undercover agent to be implemented with methods based on \u201cdeceit\u201d and \u201cinducement\u201d, and a person concerned by these illicit methods of investigation was entitled to complain before a court. Furthermore, Article 111 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure directly mandated a criminal court to exclude from the relevant case file evidence obtained as a result of any \u201cillegal activity\u201d or \u201cunlawful method\u201d (see paragraphs 36-38 above). Consequently, and given that the applicant had an arguable claim of entrapment, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office should have assumed the burden of proving that there had been no incitement contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Bannikova, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

This total silence on the part the Prosecutor\u2019s Office could be explained by the objective impossibility of discharging the requisite burden of proof on account of the absence of any formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation in question (see Vanyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 47, and Khudobin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0135). Thus, the Court observes that the DCS sending Ms K., the infiltrated agent, to the applicant on an undercover mission was never ordered or supervised either by a court, which is considered by the Court\u2019s case-law as the most appropriate form of supervision in such matters, or any other independent public authority competent in criminal matters (contrast L\u00fcdi, cited above; also compare, among many other authorities, Teixeira de Castro, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Milinien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 39).

In other words, the domestic law did not provide for the adequate regulation of the conduct of such a covert operation (compare, for instance, Veselov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 23200/10 and 2 others, \u00a7 111, 2 October 2012).",

The effectiveness of the judicial review should be assessed by having due regard to the reasons contained in the domestic courts\u2019 decisions. The courts were expected to establish, after having conducted adversarial proceedings, the reasons why the undercover operation had been mounted against the applicant, the extent of the DCS\u2019s involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant had been subjected (see, for instance, Ramanauskas, cited above, \u00a7 71). However, the Court observes that the domestic courts, confronted with the applicant\u2019s wellsubstantiated allegations, did not provide any single reason in their decisions as to why those allegations ought to be dismissed (see paragraphs 27 and 33 above). The Court further notes the domestic courts\u2019 failure to secure the attendance and examination of another key witness, Ms\u00a0N., who, according to the applicant and Ms\u00a0K., was probably another undercover agent engaged by the DCS to entrap the applicant (see paragraphs 25-26 and 29-32). In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the judicial review of the allegations of entrapment was either conducted with sufficient respect for the principle of adversarial proceedings or that it established adequate reasons for dismissing the applicant\u2019s defence.",
