In discharging obligation to provide parties to civil proceedings with legal aid, when it is provided by domestic law, the State must, moreover, display diligence so as to secure to those persons the genuine and effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 6. It is also essential for the legal aid system to offer individuals substantial guarantees to protect those having recourse to it from arbitrariness (see Sia\u0142kowska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 106-107).",
