The Court reiterates its constant approach that a jurisdictional error, a serious breach of court procedure or abuses of power may, in principle, be regarded as a fundamental defect and therefore justify the quashing (see Luchkina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 3548/04, \u00a7 21, 10 April 2008). However, nothing in the respective rulings of the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic in the cases at hand enables the Court to conclude that the initial judgments were indeed quashed because these courts had ruled on the constitutionality of the federal law in excess of their jurisdiction. In none of the judgments was the alleged jurisdictional error or abuse of competence or any other procedural defect cited as a ground for the annulment of the lower courts' findings. On the contrary, it clearly follows from the wording of the supervisory-instance rulings that the sole ground for the quashing was the misinterpretation and incorrect application of the provisions of the said Federal Law by the courts. Furthermore, the respondent authority did not claim before the supervisory-review that the previous proceedings had been tarnished by a fundamental defect, such as, in particular, a jurisdictional error, serious breaches of court procedure or abuses of power (see Luchkina, cited above). Such argument was only advanced in the Government's observations. In the absence of any reference to the ground for quashing cited by the Government in the texts of the supervisory-instance rulings, the Court is unable to conclude that the quashing was caused, and even less justified by the substantive jurisdictional error by the lower courts referred to by the Government. It therefore rejects the Government's argument.",

In these circumstances, it considers that Mrs Sizintseva's non-enforcement complaint is closely linked to the supervisory review issue and should be declared admissible as well. However, having regard to its findings above concerning violation of the applicant's rights on account of the quashing of the judgments in their favour, the Court does not consider it necessary, in the circumstances of the case, to examine her complaint concerning the nonenforcement of the respective judgment separately (see Sobelin and Others, cited above).",
