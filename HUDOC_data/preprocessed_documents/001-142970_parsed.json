The Court notes that in the present case, the local court did not seek to inform the applicant of the hearing, despite his explicit request to be heard and to examine two witnesses. Furthermore, it provided no reasoning as to why the applicant\u2019s presence at the hearing was not necessary. Having regard to the nature of the issues decided in the impugned proceedings and the fact that the applicant had challenged factual aspects of his case, the latter court should have ensured that the applicant had an opportunity to question the witnesses examined before it.",
