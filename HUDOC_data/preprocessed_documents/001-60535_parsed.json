The applicant had usually complied with summonses except on the rare occasions when he had been unwell and had submitted relevant medical certificates, including a certificate drawn up by the Krak\u00f3w Forensic Medicine Institute.  There was no risk of his absconding as he had informed the prosecutor of his change of address and could not leave the country as his passport had been confiscated by virtue of a decision given in November 1991. The applicant further submitted that the amount he was accused of embezzling was so high solely as a result of the high rate of interest at a time of hyperinflation and that the amount could not be used as an argument in support of the seriousness of the offence concerned.

In particular, the case file did not contain any documents showing that there had been justified medical grounds for his absence. Even though he had informed the prosecutor of his change of address, the address he had given appeared to be false as there was a convent at that address.  Moreover, it seemed that the applicant did not live there. The court considered that in the light of the financial documents in the case file, the offence of which the applicant was suspected was serious enough to warrant detention on remand, the more so as the value of the embezzled property had been assessed without regard to the sums of statutory interest, contrary to the applicant\u2019s submissions in his appeal.",

The Court observes in this connection that under domestic law the Court of Appeal, when examining the applicant\u2019s appeal against the first-instance decision to prolong his detention, was not confined to setting out a framework within which the lower court was allowed to give the relevant decision. Its jurisdiction was much broader as it was empowered to assess itself whether the applicant\u2019s further detention was justified in the light of the particular circumstances of the case (the Toth v.\u00a0Austria judgment of 25\u00a0November 1991, Series A no.\u00a0224, p. 24, \u00a7 87, a\u00a0contrario).

Poland, application no. 33492/96,  \u00a7 87). Lastly, in the light of the reasoning adopted by the Court in the W\u0142och v.\u00a0Poland judgment, this provision should also be deemed applicable in proceedings relating to the prolongation of detention (W\u0142och v.

Belgium judgment of 30 March 1989, Series A no. 151, pp. 16-17, \u00a7 29). These requirements are derived from the right to an adversarial trial as laid down in Article 6 of the Convention, which means, in a criminal case, that both the prosecution and the defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, it follows from the wording of Article 6 \u2013 and particularly from the autonomous meaning to be given to the notion of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d \u2013 that this provision can be applied to pre-trial proceedings (see the Imbrioscia v. Switzerland judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p. 13, \u00a7 36). It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an ongoing investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to adversarial procedure. While national law may satisfy this requirement in various ways, whatever method is chosen should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment thereon (see Schops v.\u00a0Germany, no. 25116/94, 13 February 2001, \u00a7 44; Garcia Alva v. Germany, no. 23541/94, \u00a7 39; 13 February 2001; Lietzow v.\u00a0Germany, no. 24479/94, 13 February 2001, \u00a7 44). ",
