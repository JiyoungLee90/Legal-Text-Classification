The Government contended that, in keeping with this principle, the underlying grounds regarding the measure imposed on the applicant Serkan Yazar had been stated in the Supreme Military Administrative Court's judgment in the instant case. The documents submitted to that court, however, had remained unavailable to the applicant in the interest of safeguarding the secrecy of information collection methods.",

It considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument in the instant case which would require it to depart from its previous findings and which would justify the encroachment on the applicant's right to adversarial proceedings. The Court particularly notes that although in certain circumstances it may be justifiable to withhold evidence from an opposing party for public interest reasons, the Government have failed to show that such measure was strictly necessary in the instant case (see Van\u00a0Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, \u00a7 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III).",
