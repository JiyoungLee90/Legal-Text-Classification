According to them, the nuclear power plant did not meet current safety standards on account of serious and irremediable construction defects and, owing to its condition, the risk of an accident occurring was greater than usual. They also requested that in the meantime certain provisional measures be taken. The complainants also disputed the impartiality of the administrative bodies involved in the proceedings.

It followed from these reports that the condition of the power plant with regard to nuclear safety and radiation protection and also to its operation had been rated as good. It followed in particular from the annual report of 1997 that the notifiable incidents which had occurred were of minor relevance to nuclear safety. Appropriate improvements had been carried out. However, further efforts were needed in order to recognise problems in the area of human behaviour and organisational management. Since 1996, the Beznau II power plant had followed an ageing surveillance programme as a permanent task for its safety-relevant plant components. The relevant documentation examined by the HSK had not revealed any safety-relevant gaps in the maintenance programmes. Furthermore, these results indicated that no unacceptable reduction in safety-related properties was to be expected in the near future. As to the requirements in connection with the operating licence of 12 December 1994 the HSK stated that all conditions which were associated with deadlines had been complied with and some conditions had in part to be updated periodically with respect to plant documentation and analyses.",

Switzerland (judgment of 26 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV). In the present case, however, so they argued, Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable. The decision to grant NOK an operating licence for the Beznau II nuclear power plant effectively \u201cdetermined\u201d their civil rights to the protection of their property and physical integrity. The \u201ccivil\u201d character of the rights to life and physical integrity followed from the Swiss legal order. The protection of physical integrity was governed by the Civil Code and the Law of Obligations. Section 5 of the Nuclear Energy Act merely put into more concrete terms the civil right to protection in the area of the law relating to nuclear installations. Moreover, there was a serious disagreement between them and the Federal Council about the question whether the legal conditions for the granting of the operating licence were satisfied. Finally, the outcome of the dispute was directly decisive for their entitlement to protection against the activities of the nuclear power plant. The applicants referred in particular to the expert opinion of 26 November 1997 drawn up by the Institute for Applied Ecology in Darmstadt, Germany (see paragraph 18 above). This report pointed to specific safety deficiencies of the Beznau II nuclear power plant and showed, so they argued, that it did not meet the standards of pressurised water reactors in central Europe. In the applicants' submission, the Swiss authorities, in particular the Federal Council, incorrectly and negligently assessed the security standards. Furthermore, the Federal Council neither recognised nor took account of the criticism of the OSART mission concerning the serious deficiencies in the organisational structures and management at the Beznau II power plant. They further pointed out that the report of January 1999 of the International Regulatory Review Team (IRRT) (see paragraph 19 above) not only contained positive observations, but also expressed considerable criticism, for instance with regard to insufficient human resources and the lack of guidelines resulting in too vague a risk assessment, especially in the areas of fire and seismological protection. The applicants claimed that the probative value of the expert report prepared by the Institute for Applied Ecology could not simply be refuted by reference to the authority of the reports submitted by the Swiss Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (Hauptabteilung f\u00fcr die Sicherheit der Kernanlagen \u2013 \u201cHSK\u201d). They further submitted that the numerous technical safety reports and probability studies produced on the subject of nuclear fission described a large number of concrete malfunctions that could occur \u2013 and had already occurred \u2013 at various atomic power plants and thus turned the inherent risk into a reality. The applicants concluded that, both in the course of the domestic proceedings relating to the granting of the licence and with the expert report of the Institute for Applied Ecology, they had shown the connection between the extension of the operating licence and the existence of a serious, specific and immediate danger, which justified the application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

According to a press communiqu\u00e9 issued by NOK on 24 February 2000, various collaborators of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) at Sellafield producing MOX (mixed oxides of plutonium and uranium) nuclear fuel were engaged in falsification of safety data from 1996 to 1998. The British Nuclear Installations Inspectorate report released on 17\u00a0February 2000 revealed that the falsification of safety data for MOX fuel affected BNFL's clients in Japan, Germany and Switzerland. The applicants submitted that NOK had taken no safety measures at all, the Japanese authorities had refused the fuel for safety reasons and the German authorities had closed down the Unterweser reactor which had received four assemblies of MOX fuel from BNFL. In the applicants' view, this whole affair showed, once again, that the Beznau II power plant was operated with intolerable risks for the direct neighbours and that only a court could change this dangerous custom.",

As far as the procedural Convention right was concerned, it should be sufficient, they maintained, only to prove the serious nature of the risk.

According to the Government, the new expert opinion drawn up by the Institute for Applied Ecology in Darmstadt took a stand in favour of one party and could not be considered as an independent expert opinion, while the Federal Council, when making its decision of 12 December 1994, relied on serious and detailed expert opinions prepared by the Swiss Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (\u201cHSK\u201d) and the Federal Nuclear Safety Commission (Eidgen\u00f6ssische Kommission f\u00fcr die Sicherheit von Kernanlagen \u2013 \u201cKSA\u201d), both of which were independent from the company operating the nuclear power plant. Unlike the Institute for Applied Ecology in Darmstadt, these bodies had a clear knowledge of the nuclear installations in Switzerland, which gave them the particular competence to assess the questions linked to the safety of the Beznau II nuclear power plant. It followed from the reports prepared by these bodies that the standard of the Beznau II nuclear power plant was in line with the norms related to nuclear safety.

Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 20, \u00a7 44). In the words of the Court's Golder judgment, Article 6 \u00a7 1 embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see the Golder v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21\u00a0February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 18, \u00a7 36). This right to a court extends only to \u201cdisputes\u201d (\u201ccontestations\u201d in the French text) over \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law; Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not in itself guarantee any particular content for \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d in the substantive law of the Contracting States. The \u201cdispute\u201d must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise. The outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question. As the Court has consistently held, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences are not sufficient to bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play (see the following judgments: Le Compte, Van\u00a0Leuven and De Meyere cited above, pp. 21-22, \u00a7 47; Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, pp. 45-46, \u00a7 56; Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, 28 September 1995, Series A no.\u00a0327-A, p. 17, \u00a7 44; Balmer-Schafroth and Others cited above, p. 1357, \u00a7\u00a032; Le Calvez v.

At the technical level the HSK acts independently from the Federal Office of Energy and the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication (see paragraph 25 above). The KSA, on the other hand, is administratively attached to the Federal Energy Office, but reports directly to the Federal Council (see paragraph 26 above).

It followed in particular from the annual report of 1997 that the incidents which had occurred were of minor relevance to nuclear safety and appropriate improvements had been carried out. The Beznau II nuclear power plant had been progressively backfitted to address the major on-going developments in nuclear power plant safety technology. NOK had complied with the licensing conditions in connection with the operating licence of 12 December 1994 and some conditions had in part to be updated periodically with respect to plant documentation and analyses (see paragraph 16 above).",

In neither case had the applicants at any stage of the proceedings claimed to have suffered any loss, economic or other, for which they intended to seek compensation (see paragraph 12 above, and the Balmer-Schafroth and Others judgment cited above, pp. 1352 and 1357-58, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 33).

Contrary to the view of the applicants and the fifteen dissenters in the Commission (see paragraphs 38 and 41 above), it cannot be said that the new report of the Institute for Applied Ecology in the present case, any more than the expert reports adduced by the objectors in the Balmer-Schafroth and Others case, showed that at the relevant time the operation of the Beznau II power plant exposed the applicants personally to a danger that was not only serious but also specific and, above all, imminent. Neither is such a consequence shown by the unsolicited material, relating to the supply of nuclear fuel to the power plant during a subsequent period, which was submitted by the applicants after the close of the written procedure (see paragraph 8 above). The Court consequently cannot but arrive in the present case at the same conclusion on the facts as in the Balmer-Schafroth and Others case (see the extract from the Balmer-Schafroth and Others judgment quoted above at paragraph 45), namely that the connection between the Federal Council's decision and the domestic-law rights invoked by the applicants was too tenuous and remote.",

In most European countries, it is a well-established general principle of law that executive acts must be judicially reviewable by a court which is able to ensure that the law has been properly applied and the procedural rules followed. That principle was unambiguously recognised (in connection with the European Union, it is true) by the Court of Justice of the European Communities (see the Marguerite Johnston judgment of 15 May 1986, Case no. 222/84, ECR [1986] 1651, with special reference to paragraph 18). The nature of administrative decisions to grant or refuse applications for licences to operate nuclear power plants does not mean that they should be exempt from judicial review; on the contrary, the dangers presented to the environment and the population by such installations make it, if anything, more necessary for such decisions to be subject to review by an independent and impartial tribunal in adversarial proceedings aided, of course, by expert evidence.",

Nor did they deny that such rights \u2013 for example the rights to life, to physical integrity and of property \u2013 were available to the applicants in the instant case under the Swiss legal order (see paragraph 55 of the judgment). However, they considered that the proceedings before the Federal Council did not \u201cdetermine\u201d a dispute (contestation) over those rights (loc. cit.), as, in their view, the link between the Council's decision and the applicants' rights was too tenuous and remote (see paragraph 46 of the judgment). In reaching that conclusion, they referred in paragraph 51 to the finding in the Balmer-Schafroth and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 26 August 1997 (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV) and, in particular, paragraph 40 thereof, that the applicants had failed to show that the operation of the power plant had exposed them personally to a danger that was not only serious but also specific and, above all, imminent. The majority added (see paragraph 48 of the judgment) that the applicants' arguments had to be sufficiently tenable.",

To our minds, it was for the domestic courts to assess whether the applicants had established a sufficiently close link between the operation of the power plant and their rights, in particular to life and to physical integrity. By substituting its own (judicial) assessment for that of a non-existent domestic court, we consider that our Court has effectively reversed the subsidiarity principle on which its case-law is largely based. It has in effect acted as a court of first instance; yet paragraph 51 of the judgment, for instance, shows the extent to which the analysis which the Court had to carry out was of a technical nature. By allowing a governmental body to act as both judge and party, it has not taken the principle of the rule of law expressed in the Preamble to the Convention to its logical conclusion. It is obviously prudent to avoid an actio popularis. It is in our view, however, preferable for the national courts who are better placed, rather than the European Court, to decide whether appeals such as the applicants' amount to that type of action.",
