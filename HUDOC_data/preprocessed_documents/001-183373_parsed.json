The Court notes that the essence of the applicant\u2019s claim is not that the State should have refrained from acting but rather that it should have taken steps to ensure adequate measures, in the context of a paternity dispute, to resolve with certainty the question of his relationship with the child (see Tsvetelin Petkov v.

The first two are when a child is born in wedlock (see Andrle (dec.), no.\u00a038633/08, 22 January 2013), and when paternity of a child born out of wedlock has been established by a joint declaration by the parents (see K\u0148\u00e1kal, cited above). In such cases, the Court has already observed that applicants can institute proceedings to deny paternity. However, the present case must be distinguished from K\u0148\u00e1kal and Andrle as it concerns the third presumption, which is when paternity of a child born out of wedlock is established by a judicial declaration, which has been considered by the domestic authorities as a non-rebuttable presumption and res judicata regardless of new evidence (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above). Thus, just as in Paul\u00edk, the applicant could not institute proceedings to deny paternity, even though he had presented new biological evidence (see, a contrario, Darmo\u0144 v. Poland (dec.), no. 7802/05, 17 November 2009, and Klocek v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 20674/07, 27 April 2010) which was not known to him at the time of the original paternity proceedings (see Paul\u00edk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045).",

The Court also notes developments in Czech law in the sphere of paternity. In particular, the new civil code is favourable to biological reality prevailing over legal fiction (see paragraph 21 above), for example by providing the presumed father direct access to the courts in cases of the first and second presumptions of paternity (see Andrle, cited above). However, those developments did not benefit the applicant.",

However, the applicant did not benefit from this domestic case-law, as the Czech Constitutional Court appears not to have to take into account not only its own jurisprudence (see paragraphs\u00a024-29 above), but also the Court\u2019s judgment in Paul\u00edk, which concerned a different member state but addressed an identical situation and the application of substantially the same rules (see Paul\u00edk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02338). The Constitutional Court could have decided the case in line with the Court\u2019s case-law and on the basis of its own jurisprudence, even in the absence of legislative changes (see Top\u010di\u0107-Rosenberg v. Croatia, no.\u00a019391/11, \u00a7 48, 14 November 2013; Habulinec and Filipovi\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.), no.\u00a051166/10, \u00a7 30, 4 June 2013).",

The general interest in protecting her rights at this stage has therefore lost much of its importance compared to when she was a child. Furthermore, Z. agreed to the DNA test and said that she had no objection to the applicant\u2019s disclaiming paternity and apparently did not consider the applicant as her father (see Paul\u00edk, cited above, \u00a7 46, and contrast Darmon, cited above). It therefore appears that the lack of a procedure for bringing the legal position into line with the biological reality is inconsistent with the wishes of those concerned and does not in fact benefit anyone (see Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27\u00a0October 1994, Series A no. 297-C, p. 58, \u00a7 40).",

By contrast, it is not, in principle, the Court\u2019s role to pronounce itself on whether the domestic constitutional organs have properly interpreted and applied domestic constitutional law, including whether the constitutional court has erred, as a matter of domestic constitutional law, in adopting a particular position in the impugned judgment. The Contracting States are required to ensure compliance with the Convention in accordance with their domestic constitutional order and the division of competences laid down therein. Whether one or other domestic organ was, in terms of the domestic constitutional order, under a duty to, and as a matter of domestic constitutional law able to ensure compliance with obligations arising from the Convention in a given context is not a matter to be determined by this Court.",

That being so, save in the event of evident arbitrariness, it is not for the Court to question the interpretation of the domestic law by the competent national courts (see, inter alia, K\u00e1roly Nagy v.

The Court is competent for supervising whether the High Contracting parties (acting through their various domestic authorities) have lived up to the requirements and standards imposed by the Convention, but that task does not, nor should it, entail an authority (or ability) to supervise whether the respective constitutional organs have properly observed their functions and responsibilities within the domestic legal order. The issue of compliance with the Convention at the domestic level is distinct from the issue of the domestic division of competences and responsibilities in this regard, such as that between the legislative and the judicial branches. The latter, in principle, remains outside the Court\u2019s remit of supervision.",

Croatia, cited by the majority in paragraph 48, does not support any contrary view. After all, the relevant passage in that case was concerned with the issue of whether the applicants had complied with the admissibility requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies. In such a context the Court, for obvious reasons, may have to examine quite closely and concretely the available system of remedies under the domestic legal order. The context in the present case, however, is entirely different, as this is a judgment on the merits of the case, thus dealing with the issue of whether the Czech Republic has complied with the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention. The internal attribution or distribution of responsibilities under the domestic legal order is not the object or focus of that determination. In so far as the judgment in Top\u010di\u0107-Rosenberg v. Croatia, also cited in the present judgment, may be read as supporting the approach adopted by the majority, we are not inclined, and certainly not bound, to follow the approach adopted by the Court in that judgment.",

Unlike a national judge well versed in the domestic legal order, this approach is also dictated by the limits of our own expertise. While some elements of domestic law may be sufficiently clear even for outsiders to understand without major difficulty, for instance where they consist of unequivocal statutory provisions, or correspond to generally recognised tenets of common legal principles, or where they consist of directly applicable EU law which is uniform in the whole of the Union, many areas of domestic law, including constitutional law and its interaction with the rest of the domestic legal order, are often complex and subtle, and it is therefore both difficult and inappropriate for outsiders such as ourselves to form or even less express an opinion thereon. While the statement at the end of paragraph 48 may or may not be correct as a matter of Czech constitutional law, as it is neither our task as members of this Court nor within our expertise to enter into those matters, we should not be expected to join in this kind of a statement, and therefore respectfully decline to do so.",
