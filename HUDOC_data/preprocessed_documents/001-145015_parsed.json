This right includes the right to compensation in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and the restoration of labour, pension, housing and other rights. The damage must be compensated for in full, irrespective of the fault of the investigator, prosecutor or court (paragraph\u00a01). Paragraph 2 confers the \u201cright to rehabilitation\u201d on defendants who have been acquitted, against whom charges have been dropped, in respect of whom proceedings have been discontinued or whose convictions have been quashed in their entirety or in part. However, no right to compensation arises where the prosecution is terminated on \u201cnon-rehabilitation\u201d grounds, such as in the case of an amnesty or where the prosecution has become time-barred (Article 133 paragraph 4). Paragraph\u00a03 provides that \u201cany individual who has been unlawfully subjected to preventive measures in criminal proceedings shall have the right to rehabilitation\u201d. In a judgment acquitting an individual a court has to mention explicitly that he has the right to \u201crehabilitation\u201d (Article\u00a0134). A claim for compensation of pecuniary damage is to be lodged with the same authority which issued the decision to acquit or the decision to terminate the criminal prosecution (Article 135 \u00a7 2), whereas any claims for monetary compensation of non-pecuniary damage are to be lodged with civil courts and examined under the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (Article\u00a0136 \u00a7 2).",

The question is whether, in the circumstances, the quashing of the original detention order by itself constituted \u201csufficient redress\u201d, i.e. whether, in the absence of any pecuniary or other compensation, the applicant may claim to have victim status in respect of the first period of detention.",

Russia, no. 38971/06, \u00a7 61, 25\u00a0October 2007). The Court has already observed that \u201cthe Russian law of tort limits strict liability for unlawful detention to specific procedural forms of deprivation of liberty which include, in particular, deprivation of liberty in criminal proceedings and administrative punishment\u201d (see Makhmudov v. Russia, no.\u00a035082/04, \u00a7\u00a0104, 26\u00a0July 2007). The unlawful detention in the present case was imposed within extradition proceedings, not as a custodial measure within a criminal case opened in Russia. The Court is aware that, in the absence of special provisions concerning detention pending extradition, the Russian courts apply mutatis mutandis provisions of the CCrP which regulate custodial measures (see, for example, Zokhidov v. Russia, no.\u00a067286/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a084101, 5 February 2013). However, it is not certain whether they would be prepared to consider \u201cunlawful detention pending extradition\u201d an equivalent of \u201cunlawful application of a preventive measure in the form of placement in custody\u201d, which undoubtedly gives rise to a strict liability.

The Court notes that the notion of \u201cfault\u201d is quite vague: it includes intentional behaviour as well as various forms of negligence. Furthermore, it is unclear whether under the law the applicant had to prove the fault of the prosecutor who issued the detention order, or the fault of the prosecution authority in general for an error committed by one of their employees. The Government did not refer to any case-law or other source of law which would demonstrate that the applicant\u2019s unlawful detention would be regarded as resulting from the \u201cfault\u201d of the authority or official involved, whatever it meant.",

The Government did not refer to other sources of law which would help in interpreting the legislative provisions at issue.

However, the Court notes that the proceedings before the court of appeal, to which the Government refer and which ended with the decision of 28 April 2011, concerned not the first period of the applicant\u2019s detention, but the second, which was authorised by the trial court on 15 April 2011. In those proceedings the courts were not called upon to examine whether or not the review of the detention order issued by the prosecutor had been done speedily: they were only supposed to establish whether or not there had been sufficient reasons for the applicant\u2019s detention pending extradition and whether the decision of 15\u00a0April 2011 had been lawful. The objection by the Government is therefore irrelevant to the question raised by the applicant and must be dismissed.",

The principle of \u201cprotection from arbitrariness\u201d is realised through more specific guarantees, both substantive and procedural. Procedural safeguards are contained primarily in \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of Article 5 and based on the philosophy of effective judicial control in matters of detention. \u201cEffectiveness\u201d of such control, in turn, has a time element: delayed judicial review of detention would not be effective. In order to determine whether judicial review has been given speedily, the Court makes an overall assessment of all relevant circumstances of each case, including the complexity of the proceedings, the conduct of the domestic authorities, the conduct of the applicant and what was at stake for the latter. Thus, the general approach to the \u201cpromptness\u201d or \u201cspeediness\u201d requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 and Article 5 \u00a7 4 respectively is therefore broadly similar to the method used in cases concerning the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (Akhadov v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 43009/10, \u00a7 24, 28\u00a0January 2014).

Once the detained person lodges an application for release, judicial review of the lawfulness of detention must follow speedily (see Rehbock v.

What is important, however, is the type of official body which authorised the detention. Where the original detention order was imposed by a court, i.e. by an independent and impartial judicial body (cf. mutatis mutandis, Huber v. Switzerland, 23 October 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 42-43, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0188, with further references) in a procedure offering appropriate guarantees of due process, and where the domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the Court is prepared to tolerate longer periods of review in the proceedings before the second instance court (see Shakurov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a055822/10, \u00a7 179, 5 June 2012). Thus, the Court has examined the speediness of the review of detention orders imposed by the firstinstance courts within criminal proceedings, that is, for the purposes of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) of the Convention, in a large number of cases concerning the Russian Federation (see, for example, Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7\u00a096, 1\u00a0June 2006 or Ignatov v.

Appeal proceedings that lasted ten, eleven and sixteen days have been found to be compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Yudayev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a040258/03, \u00a7\u00a7 84-87, 15 January 2009, and Khodorkovskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a05829/04, \u00a7 247, 31 May 2011). However, the Court considers that this case-law is not directly applicable in the present case since the original detention order was imposed by a prosecutor, and not a court.",

In the present case that period amounted to sixteen days, namely between 30 March, when an application for release was introduced by the applicant, and 15 April 2011, when it was examined and decided upon by the first-instance court.

The Court recalls that under the Russian law the absence of a written agreement on legal services does not mean that such agreement did not exist, and even where the legal fees have not yet been actually paid by the client, they remain recoverable (see Fadeyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a055723/00, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR 2005-IV). The hourly rate claimed by the applicant\u2019s lawyer in the present case appears reasonable. All of the legal costs, as presented in the timesheet, were related to the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article\u00a05 of the Convention and the amount of time spent on each task appears reasonable. On the other hand, the amount of postal expenses claimed by the applicant was not sufficiently supported by relevant documents. In these circumstances, and having regard to the complexity of the case and other relevant circumstances, as well as to the documents in its possession and its findings under Article 5, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a01,650, covering costs under all heads.",
