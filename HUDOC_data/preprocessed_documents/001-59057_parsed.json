The role of the Illkirch-Graffenstaden District Court had therefore been confined, in accordance with Article 969 of the (former) Code of Civil Procedure, to declaring the proceedings to have begun and appointing two notaries to deal with the partition. Moreover, the court in question had never formally approved the partition by notary provided for in section 235 of the Act of \n1 June 1924 because, as the terms of the notarial deed drawn up on \n24 November 1997 showed, the parties had undertaken to discontinue the proceedings for partition by the court commenced by an order of 8 July 1993. The only decision taken by the court had ultimately been to stay the proceedings by an order of 4 December 1997, which could not be regarded as a decision determining a civil dispute. In support of their submissions, the Government relied on the decision of the European Commission of Human Rights in the Gauthier v. France case (application no. 26488/95, Commission's report of 9 April 1997, unpublished), which was a somewhat similar case concerning the division of jointly owned property between spouses after their divorce; in that case the Commission had assessed the length of the proceedings from the date on which the notary had drawn up a record of matters causing difficulty. In the absence of such a record in the instant case, a court-appointed notary could not be likened to a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, because his or her duties consisted not in determining a dispute, but in dealing with the partition of an estate in so far as that partition did not give rise to any dispute.",

Although an estate is divided (at the court's request) by court-appointed notaries and any dispute between the parties in that connection must be submitted to the judge (juge-commissaire), also designated by the court (Article 837 of the Civil Code), the entire proceedings for judicial partition \u2013 which are, moreover, extremely formalistic \u2013 are conducted in the court for the place where the succession occurs and under its supervision. It is this court which gives judgment ordering partition, appoints a notary to distribute the estate and designates a judge to deal with the matter; above all, it is this court which must approve the scheme of division of the estate drawn up by the notary. In short, this court is required to determine a \u201ccontestation (dispute) over civil rights\u201d submitted to it in the form of an application for partition, in the instant case the one dated 8 January 1993. The possibility left open to the parties of resuming partition on a non-contentious basis \u2013 a possibility of which the applicant and Mr Louis Siegel availed themselves in the instant case \u2013 does not in any way detract from the jurisdiction of the court, which remains seised of the case until such time as the parties decide to discontinue the proceedings.",
