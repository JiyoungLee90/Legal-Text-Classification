They drew attention to the overcrowded premises, the uncontrolled admission of new patients, and the fact that they were held with other detainees suffering from cancer, asthma, hepatitis, venereal diseases, bronchitis, scabies, psoriasis and even tuberculosis, which diseases necessitated confinement to individual cells because several of them were transmissible. A small quantity of cream had been distributed to some of the HIV-positive detainees who were also affected with scabies. They had been advised to change their sheets and underwear every day and to wash them at high temperatures, even though the washing machine was out of order. When they had gone to fetch their medication the nurses had told them not to touch the bars through which they handed over the medicines in order to prevent the risk of infection. The administrative and medical staff had not given the detainees any official information in order to minimise the seriousness of the epidemic.",

Furthermore, the Court attaches great importance to the findings of the Ombudsman and the observations of the Justice Minister and the Prosecutor with the Court of Cassation, as well as those of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the CPT .... These findings show that the authorities\u2019 good intentions were doomed to failure in view of the situation prevailing in the psychiatric department of the Prison Hospital. In his report of 26\u00a0October 2012 the Ombudsman noted the irregular intervals at which the applicants received their treatment and the difficulty of treating them in a place where the risk of transmission of infectious diseases was very high. In a press release of 6 March 2014 the Ombudsman pointed out that the infrastructures were old and completely inappropriate, that there were insufficient medical staff and that the concentration of HIV-positive persons in one wing had created the conditions for \u201cghettoisation and stigmatisation\u201d .... For its part, the CPT stressed that the fact that detainees were HIV-positive was not a valid public health reason for isolating them.",

It holds that the applicants were \u2013 and some of them possibly still are \u2013 exposed to physical and mental suffering that went beyond the suffering inherent in imprisonment. It therefore finds that they sustained inhuman and degrading treatment and that their segregation had no objective and reasonable justification because it was not necessitated by the circumstances.
