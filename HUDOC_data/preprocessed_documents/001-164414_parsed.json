It also shows that in 2008 the applicant\u2019s remand centre did not have the capacity to allow all its prisoners wishing to practise the Catholic religion to have unlimited access to group services (see paragraph 15 above). A system of enrollment and selection operated for that purpose. At first, prisoners wishing to attend had to sign up with their supervisors. Subsequently, a list of persons approved for a particular Mass was prepared by remand centre staff with the help of a computer program. That system had been designed to select prisoners on a rotation basis, according to their classification and aimed at not mixing detainees classified as dangerous with those who did not require any special security measures (see paragraph 15 above).",

The Government\u2019s version that he was granted access to a Sunday service each time he asked for it, that is, twice in September and twice in November 2008, appears to be more credible in the light of the findings which were made by the domestic court in the course of the tort proceedings, in particular in so far as they were based on the testimony of the prison chaplain (see paragraphs 66, 67 and 28 above).",
