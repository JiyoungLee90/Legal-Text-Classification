Similarly, criminal courts at three levels subsequently took the view that the amnesty decisions in issue extended to the offences for which the applicant was prosecuted. In particular, in its decision of 20 December 2002 the Supreme Court admitted that the rather unusual phrasing of those decisions had raised difficulties as to their interpretation. However, the ordinary courts were obliged to observe the principle in dubio pro reo when interpreting and implementing a decision on amnesty (see paragraph 33 above).",

Poland, judgment of 25 March 1998, Reports\u00a01998-II, \u00a7 49). The Court accepts that the case was rather complex from the legal point of view and required a fair degree of research and preparation. However, it is not satisfied that the amount claimed was necessarily incurred in its entirety with a view to preventing the violation found. Having regard to the circumstances of the case and the documents before it, the Court awards the applicant the total sum of EUR\u00a08,000 under this head.",
