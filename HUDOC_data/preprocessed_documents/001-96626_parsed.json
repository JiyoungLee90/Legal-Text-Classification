In the instant case, apart from a newspaper article where allusions are made to the possibility that a certain Hakan Sarayl\u0131o\u011flu might have killed \u00d6nder Babat, there is no cogent evidence before the Court concerning the supposed identity of the gunman who shot and killed \u00d6nder Babat. Moreover, aside from a police superintendent\u2019s affirmation that the bullet had not ricocheted off any other target (see paragraph 14 above), there is also no evidence to conclude with certainty that \u00d6nder Babat was the ultimate target or that his killing was politically motivated. In this connection, the Court observes that, while it transpires from the case file that \u00d6nder Babat was a politically active student and had criminal proceedings pending against him, there is also no indication that he was a prominent figure or, more decisively, that he had been threatened by anyone, or had reason to believe that his life was at risk prior to his death.",

It must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Velikova v. Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2000VI, and \u00dclk\u00fc Ekinci, cited above, \u00a7 144). It further repeats that a State\u2019s procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention is not an obligation of result, but of means (see among others Gongadze v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a034056/02, \u00a7 176, ECHR 2005XI). In this connection, it is undisputed that a number of steps were taken by the investigating authorities in order to ascertain the circumstances surrounding \u00d6nder Babat\u2019s death. Moreover, the Court admits that the manner in which \u00d6nder Babat was killed \u2013 a single gun shot by an unknown perpetrator \u2013 and the place of the killing \u2013 a very popular and busy street in Istanbul \u2013 must have adversely affected the investigation into his killing and have presented the authorities with a particular difficult task in ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and of trying to establish the identity of those responsible.",

For example, the Court observes that the search for evidence at the scene of incident took place only once and at a time when the police had had no idea as to the cause of \u00d6nder Babat\u2019s collapse on the street. The next day, however, it became clear that he had been killed by a gunshot. Despite this new development, the prosecutor never asked the police to revisit the scene of the incident in order to reconstruct the events with a view to establishing where the shooter could have been positioned and, although the Court does not rule out that the scene was most likely contaminated in the meantime, at least to attempt to find additional forensic evidence, if any. More decisively, however, the prosecutor was content to hear evidence only from \u00d6nder Babat\u2019s friends and a waiter who was present at the scene of the incident. No attempts were made to secure the testimonies of locals who worked or resided on that street. Nor were any calls made to the public to come forward if they had witnessed the incident that day. Finally, the Court observes that no significant steps have been taken in the investigation since January 2005.",
