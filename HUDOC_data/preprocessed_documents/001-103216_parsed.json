Under the Convention, the Court cannot therefore deal with any application which has already been investigated or is being investigated by an international body (see Celniku v.

The term \u201canother procedure\u201d refers to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings similar to those set up by the Convention (see Lukanov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 21915/93, Commission decision of 12 January 1995, DR 80-A, p. 108). The Court must therefore determine whether the nature of the supervisory body, the procedure followed thereby and the effects of its decisions are such that Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) precludes the Court\u2019s jurisdiction (see, in respect of the \u201c1503 procedure\u201d before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Mikolenko v.
