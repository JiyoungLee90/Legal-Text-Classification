It later found that the urgency requirement had been satisfied where the alien was due to be released shortly (Conseil d'Etat, 13 November 1985, Ministry of the Interior v. Barrutiabengoa Zabarte, Rec. p. 321), then held that it was lawful to use the procedure against an alien who had been released from prison several months before the deportation order was made (Conseil d'Etat, 24\u00a0June 1988, Hamade, Rec., tables, p. 933, and 8 April 1994, Zehar, Dalloz 1994), or who had obtained early release seven months before the issue of a deportation order (Conseil d'Etat, 3 February 1995, Kaouche, requ\u00eate no. 145404, Droit administratif, May 1995, p. 10). It also accepted that the Minister could use the extreme urgency procedure where, in connection with a deportation initially commenced under the ordinary procedure, the board had expressed an opinion against deportation. The Conseil d'Etat held that practice to be lawful \"provided that the requirements of section 26 were satisfied at the time the order was made\" (Conseil d'Etat, 24 May 1993, Igart\u00faa Amondara\u00edn, Rec. p. 163).",
