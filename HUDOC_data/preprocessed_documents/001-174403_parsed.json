Moreover, where the investigation leads to charges being brought before the national courts, the positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention extend to the trial stage of the proceedings. In such cases the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must meet the requirements enshrined in Article 3.

The investigating authorities established the relevant circumstances and identified three suspects within a few months (see paragraph 9 above). The duration of the pre-trial investigation was less than eleven months (from the applicant\u2019s complaint on 17 February 2007 until the issuing of the indictment on 10\u00a0January 2008 \u2013 see paragraphs 7 and 14 above) and thus cannot be considered excessive. In addition, the applicant himself explicitly stated that he did not have any complaints concerning the pre-trial investigation (see paragraph 36 above). In those circumstances, the Court sees no reason to find that the pre-trial investigation by the domestic authorities was ineffective.",

Although it cannot be said that the courts were inactive during that period, the delay was mainly caused by re-examination of the case after it had been remitted by a higher court. The Skuodas District Court\u2019s judgment of 17 December 2009, which convicted the alleged perpetrators (see paragraph 16 above), was quashed by the higher court on the grounds that the district court had committed grave breaches of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 it had not provided sufficient reasons for the conviction but had merely copied the description of the charges from the indictment, it had not assessed all the testimony and other evidence in detail, and had not explained why some evidence had been considered reliable and some not (see paragraph 17 above). After the Skuodas District Court re-examined the case and adopted a new judgment on 5 May 2011 (see paragraph 19 above), the higher court once again quashed the judgment because of grave breaches of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 this time it held that the district court had violated the rights of the accused by de facto changing the charges against them, and that it had failed to make any findings in respect of one of the victims (see paragraph\u00a020 above). The Court sees no reason to doubt the assessment of the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court that those errors were indeed grave, and considers that they cannot be classified as being of a purely procedural nature. It reiterates that the repetition of orders for remittal within the same set of proceedings, where such orders have been given because of errors committed by the lower courts, may reveal a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Wierciszewska v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25\u00a0November 2003; Huseinovi\u0107 v.

In this particular case the Government have not provided any explanation that would lead the Court to reach a different conclusion.",

In such circumstances the Court considers that the domestic courts should have acted diligently and at a reasonable pace in order to examine the merits of the case and adopt a judgment before the prosecution became time-barred (see, mutatis mutandis, Velev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a043531/08, \u00a7 58, 16\u00a0April 2013). However, the statute of limitations eventually expired and the criminal proceedings were discontinued, without a final judgment on the merits (see paragraph 21 above). In this connection the Court reiterates that the purpose of providing effective protection against acts of ill-treatment cannot be achieved where the criminal proceedings are discontinued owing to the fact that the prosecution has become time-barred and where this has occurred, as in the present case, as a result of flaws in the actions of the relevant State authorities (see Valiulien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no.\u00a033234/07, \u00a7 85, 26\u00a0March 2013).",

However, the Court observes that the cases invoked by the Government (Calvelli and Ciglio, Vo and \u0160ilih, all mentioned above) concerned injuries caused by the negligent acts of private individuals. In contrast, in cases such as the present one, where the applicants were injured by the deliberate, violent acts of other individuals, the Court has repeatedly held that compensation awarded in civil proceedings could not be considered sufficient for the fulfilment of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article\u00a03 of the Convention, as it is aimed at awarding damages rather than identifying and punishing those responsible (see Biser Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 32662/06, \u00a7\u00a072, 10 January 2012; Dimitar Shopov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a017253/07, \u00a7 39, 16\u00a0April 2013; Aleksandr Nikonenko v.
