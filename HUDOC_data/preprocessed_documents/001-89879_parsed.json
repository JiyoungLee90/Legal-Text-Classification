In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Labita v.

The Court reiterates that, since remittal is usually ordered because of errors committed by the authorities whose decisions are appealed against, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency (see, mutatis mutandis, Kozinets v. , no.\u00a075520/01, \u00a7\u00a061, 6\u00a0December 2007).",

Furthermore, the Court is struck by the fact that the decision of 20\u00a0November 2003, by which the criminal proceedings were terminated, did not provide any explanation of the origin of the injuries.
