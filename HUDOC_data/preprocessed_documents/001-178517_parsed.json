In particular, the investigator stated that there had been a 40-minute delay before the ambulance arrived and that only one of two injections given to K.M. had been mentioned by the ambulance doctor in the visit record. Furthermore, the process of taking the patient to hospital had been slow and disorganised. The ambulance driver had not carried the patient downstairs and had not assisted in putting her in the ambulance. Instead of sitting beside K.M., whose condition was extremely critical, the doctor had chosen to sit in the driver\u2019s cab next to the driver. The investigator\u2019s conclusion was therefore that the ambulance crew had arrived after a serious delay and had not provided proper medical assistance.",

Armenia, no. 18499/08, \u00a7\u00a7 32-39, 7\u00a0July 2015). The applicant in the present case similarly claimed that he was not able to afford the services of a specially licensed advocate and the Court has no reason doubt it. The Court further notes that, while the present case does not concern a civil case like in the case of Shamoyan, the applicant was nevertheless not entitled to apply for legal aid, such possibility having been reserved only for suspects or accused in criminal cases (see paragraphs 30, 33 and 44 above). The Government did not allege that the applicant was eligible for legal aid either, but argued that he should have nevertheless tried to apply to a specially licensed advocate and sought pro bono legal services. However, an identical argument was already examined and dismissed in the case of Shamoyan (see Shamoyan, cited above, \u00a7 33). In the present case, the Government similarly failed to provide any concrete examples or evidence of cases where specially licensed advocates had agreed to provide pro bono legal services to persons willing to lodge an appeal on points of law. This argument therefore is speculative and must be similarly dismissed. It therefore appears that an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation was not an accessible remedy at the material time.",

Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09 and 2 others, \u00a7 224, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). The Court notes that, shortly after the applicant lodged his appeal on points of law, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the provision which required him to use the services of a specially licensed advocate, namely Article 404 \u00a7\u00a01 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, abolishing that requirement, since it disproportionately restricted access to the Court of Cassation (see paragraph 49 above). It is true that, according to the same decision, Article\u00a0404\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(1) remained in force and hence applicable until 31\u00a0December 2008. Nevertheless, the domestic law allowed the courts to suspend proceedings if they found that an applicable provision was incompatible with the Constitution (see paragraph 32 above).

However, if the infringement of the right to life or to personal integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence the obligation may, for instance, also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability on the part of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be imposed (see Calvelli and\u00a0Ciglio, cited above, \u00a7 51, and Z v. Poland, no. 46132/08, \u00a7 94, 13\u00a0November 2012).",

The Court observes in this regard that in the absence of formally instituted criminal proceedings the persons interviewed, including the emergency doctor and the nurse, were simply asked to give their account of the events. Moreover, even though the accounts of the events given by the emergency doctor and the nurse contradicted each other with regard to the type and amount of medical substances injected, the investigator did not make a serious attempt to clarify the discrepancies between their initial statements (see paragraphs\u00a012 and 13 above). The Court further observes that none of the medical practitioners questioned during the inquiry was later called to testify under oath in court \u2212 despite the applicant\u2019s specific request in that regard \u2212 which could have allowed the credibility of their statements to be checked. It is noteworthy that both the investigating authorities and the courts relied on the above statements of the members of the medical personnel in their decisions (see paragraphs 20 and 26 above).",

In fact, on several occasions the applicant submitted copies of relevant medical instructions and excerpts from medical literature to the investigating authority and referred to them later in court, but his arguments were never addressed. Moreover, despite the fact that the applicant\u2019s participation in the additional forensic investigation was eventually allowed by the District Prosecutor\u2019s decision of 3 March 2008, it appears that his participation was a pure formality since his arguments, supported by relevant documentary evidence, were not addressed by the panel of experts in their conclusions (see paragraphs 16 and 22 above).

Thus, according to the autopsy report, she had died from general intoxication of the organism caused by an impairment of vital brain function as a result of extensive and diffuse thrombosis of neuro-vessels. Two further forensic medical investigations were ordered \u2013 one during the initial inquiry, which resulted in forensic medical opinion no.\u00a089, and one during the additional inquiry following the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 3 March 2008, which resulted in forensic medical opinion no. 6. Although the Court was not provided with a full and accurate copy of forensic medical opinion no. 89 by the respondent Government, according to the available material this opinion stated that K.M.\u2019s medical treatment had been correct and symptom-based. It does not appear, however, that this forensic medical opinion established the cause of the general intoxication of the organism brought about by an impairment of vital brain function as a result of extensive and diffuse thrombosis of neuro-vessels which was believed to have caused K.M.\u2019s death. Furthermore, forensic medical opinion no. 6 likewise failed to definitively determine exactly what had caused the thrombosis of K.M.\u2019s neuro-vessels which brought about the impairment of vital brain function that resulted in the general intoxication of the body. At the same time, this opinion stated that it did not appear that K.M. was suffering from any congenital disorder which could possibly be linked to her death, and that in the absence of relevant medical documentation it had not been possible to determine whether she was suffering from any functional disorder which could have caused the convulsion syndrome (see paragraph 19 above). The Court observes in this regard that the investigating authority and the courts did not institute any attempts to elucidate the reasons for the deceased\u2019s critical condition which resulted in her death and found it sufficient to refer, without further reasoning, to the conclusions of forensic experts which, as already noted, merely confirmed the eventual cause of death as established by the autopsy but did not provide any explanation of why the condition had arisen in the first place. The Court further observes that the applicant and other relatives of the deceased were never questioned, either during the inquiry or the court proceedings, with a view to clarifying whether she had previously suffered from any disorders that could possibly have resulted in extensive and diffuse thrombosis of neuro-vessels. In such circumstances, the Court finds that the authorities may not be regarded as having acted with sufficient diligence and care in order to establish the cause of the death of the applicant\u2019s daughter.",

Moreover, this decision, which was later endorsed by the courts, found that K.M. had been provided with proper first aid assistance, whereas at the same time the doctor was reprimanded for poor performance of her duties following the request by the investigator. In such circumstances, it appears that the investigating authority reached inaccurate findings as regards the adequacy of emergency assistance provided to the applicant\u2019s daughter and that the courts simply endorsed these findings without further considering whether the poor performance of the ambulance crew had any crucial negative effect on the deceased\u2019s condition (see paragraphs 20, 21, 23 and 24 above).",

After all, despite the existence of the above rule, confirmed by the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 8 October 2008 declaring Article\u00a0404 \u00a7 1 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 29.1 of the Advocacy Act incompatible with Articles 18 and 19 of the Constitution in that they disproportionately restricted access to the Court of Cassation (see paragraph 49 of the present judgment), it appears that the applicant not only failed to invite the Court of Cassation to suspend or adjourn the proceedings in his case in view of the apparent incompatibility with the Constitution, until such time as that incompatibility had been remedied or the deadline set by the Constitutional Court (31 December 2008) had expired, but he also, more generally, failed to invite the Court of Cassation to take his financial situation into account. We note in this context that the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision in the applicant\u2019s case was not taken until 30\u00a0October 2008, that is, some three weeks after the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment and two months before the expiry of the deadline set by the Constitutional Court.",
