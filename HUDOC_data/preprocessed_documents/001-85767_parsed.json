In the judgment, the assize court noted that M.S. had retired from public service and the other accused were serving as police officers.\u00a0The  acquitted A.\u015e., A.\u00c7. and H.A. of the charges against them, holding that there was insufficient evidence to convict them since they had left the police station at around 7 p.m. on 15 October 1994 and since the applicant had visited Bayram Duran a number of times up until 7\u00a0p.m. on 15 October 1994. The court considered that M.S., A.A., A.K. and \u0130.U., the officers who had been on duty between 7 p.m. on 15 October 1994 and 5\u00a0a.m. on 16 October 1994, had caused Bayram\u00a0Duran\u2019s death unintentionally by beating him, for reasons that could not be determined, and convicted them. Noting that the death had occurred as a result of the officers\u2019 acts combined with a circumstance that had existed prior to the act which had not been known to the officers, namely Bayram Duran\u2019s heart condition, the court sentenced M.S., A.A., A.K. and \u0130.U. to five years\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to Articles 448 and 452 \u00a7 2 of the former Criminal Code. The court did not apply Article\u00a0243 of the former Criminal Code applicable at the time of the commission of the offence as it was unable to establish that the convicted officers had beaten Bayram Duran with a view to extracting a confession of guilt. In its judgment, the court noted that Bayram Duran had been beaten by the convicted police officers and that he had died as a result of the stress caused by this trauma. Taking into account the fact that the actual offender who had caused the trauma to Bayram\u00a0Duran\u2019s head could not be identified, the assize court reduced the police officers\u2019 prison sentences to two years and six months pursuant to Article 463 of the former Criminal Code. Having regard to the fact that the officers had committed an offence while on duty, the firstinstance court increased the sentence to three years and four months pursuant to Article\u00a0251 of the former Criminal Code. The assize court finally reduced the sentence to two years, nine months and ten days of imprisonment for each convict pursuant to Article 59 of the Criminal Code, having regard to the fact that some of the convicted police officers\u2019 statements had been of help to the authorities during the investigation and the criminal proceedings in establishing the circumstances of the case. The first-instance court held that the applicants\u2019 right to redress for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage that they had suffered should be reserved.",

While doing that, the Court should grant substantial deference to the national courts in the choice of appropriate sanctions for illtreatment and homicide by State agents.

The Court has already held that where a State agent has been charged with crimes involving illtreatment, it is of the utmost importance that criminal proceedings and sentencing are not time-barred and that measures such as the granting of an amnesty or pardon should not be permissible (see Abd\u00fclsamet\u00a0 Yaman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055). In the Court\u2019s view, suspension of the execution of the convicted police officers\u2019 prison sentences pursuant to Law\u00a0no.\u00a04616 is comparable to a partial amnesty (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, Kalan v.
