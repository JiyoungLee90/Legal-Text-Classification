It began by finding that the land-use plan, published in May 2003, was automatically enforceable provided it had not been declared null and void, and that the land occupied by the defendants was in the zone NDc, allowing in principle for the land to be equipped for camping and caravanning, but that the land had not been developed in compliance with the rules of the Town and Country Planning Code (see Article L. 443-1 of the Code). The court held that the defendants, in setting up their caravans, mobile homes and cabins on the land in the absence of a permit or a decision by the prefecture in their favour, had breached the land-use plan, and that the supply of electricity by EDF (\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France) did not confer any rights. After stressing the importance of the right to housing and its legislative and constitutional basis, the court took the view that, while the legislature and the public authorities had to use their best endeavours to guarantee this right as far as possible, it could not be granted \u201cwithout regard for legality or in breach of the applicable rules\u201d.",

The court found that it did not consider that it was breaching Article 8 of the Convention in giving a decision after responding to the defendants\u2019 submissions and that, in a State governed by the rule of law, it would be unthinkable for the enforcement of a court decision to amount to \u201cinhuman and degrading treatment\u201d.

The Court had recognised that caravans belonging to the Roma and travellers were \u201chomes\u201d, as the French Government had not disputed in Stenegry and Adam v.\u00a0France ((dec.), no.\u00a040987/05, 22 May 2007), and the issues of legal title or planning permission should be examined only in the context of Article 8\u00a0\u00a7 2. Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the ERRC took the view that, in addition to the caravans, the sheds and bungalows of the Roma and travellers, even those erected without a permit on third parties\u2019 land, also had to be regarded as possessions. That approach would enable the Court to take account of the principles of international law in the field of housing, including the principle that evictions of vulnerable groups such as the Roma and travellers should only take place if a number of conditions were met, the most important one being the provision of an alternative relocation site. Roma caravans and sheds should be subject to demolition or removal under the same conditions as \u201cordinary\u201d houses, including access to a court or administrative body which would adjudicate on the legality of the demolition taking the applicable principles into account.",

Secondly, the ERRC argued that there was no judicial remedy capable of providing them with adequate redress, namely the provision of alternative accommodation, even though this was an obligation under both the Convention and the Social Charter. The offer of alternative accommodation had to be forthcoming before the decision ordering eviction and was a precondition for the legality of that decision. The ERRC also referred to the joint public statement of 24 October 2007 of the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing ..., to the Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-Based Evictions and Displacement, and its Collective Complaints against Greece, Italy and Bulgaria before the European Committee on Social Rights (nos. 15/2003, 27/2004 and 31/2005 respectively).

The Court further observes that a significant number of the applicants have already left the site, whether temporarily or permanently, fearing that the judgment would be enforced and the fine would become payable.
