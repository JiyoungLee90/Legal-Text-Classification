In that case the Court had ordered the restoration of the initial judgment in the applicant's favour and the payment of the pension in the amount established by that judgment. However, in the Government's view, such an approach created confusion. If the sum awarded by a court was a pensioner's \u201cpossession\u201d, it should not be affected by any subsequent increase in pension rates. Therefore, in Pravednaya the applicant would have had to return the money \u201cexcessively\u201d paid to her by virtue of the later changes in the legislation on State pensions. They concluded that in order to avoid such situations the Court should not regard the pension amounts awarded by the domestic courts as the claimants' \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania, judgment of 28 October 1999, Reports 1999VII, \u00a7 61). This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Review by higher courts should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v.\u00a0Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003-IX).",

Alternatively, the finding of a violation in itself would constitute sufficient just satisfaction. As regards the claim in respect of pecuniary damage, it should be rejected because it was open to the applicants to request a re-trial, which would be the most appropriate form of redress in this case. The Government further asserted that, as regards the period from February 1998 to December 2001, the difference between the pensions calculated with a coefficient of 0.7 and the pensions actually paid would be 942.27 roubles (RUR) in respect of Mrs\u00a0Smirnitskaya, RUR\u00a01,219.66 in respect of Mrs Stolyarova and RUR 1,152.28 in respect of Mr Stolyarov.",

The Court notes that the sums calculated by the applicants were based on official certificates which confirm the amounts of the pensions actually paid and the rates of inflation. However, the sums to be awarded by the Court should not take account of the coefficient linked to the region of the applicants' residence, as that claim was not secured by the judgment of 13 August 1999, upheld on 19\u00a0October\u00a01999, having been rejected by the second-instance court (see the facts in the Smirnitskaya and Others v. Russia admissibility decision of 17\u00a0November 2005). Nor should it cover the whole periods taken by the applicants. The period relevant to the violation of Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 is indicated in paragraph 49 above. Those adjustments being made, the Court awards EUR 199 to Mrs\u00a0Smirnitskaya, EUR 247 to Mrs\u00a0Stolyarova and EUR 78 to Mr\u00a0Stolyarov in respect of pecuniary damage.",
