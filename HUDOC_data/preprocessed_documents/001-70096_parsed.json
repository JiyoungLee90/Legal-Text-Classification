Moreover, his status cannot offer guarantees against any arbitrary or unjustified deprivation of liberty (see Niedba\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48-57) as he is not endowed with the attributes of \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201cimpartiality\u201d required by Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see Schiesser v. Switzerland, judgment of 4\u00a0December 1979, Series A no. 34, pp. 12-17, \u00a7\u00a7 27-41). Furthermore, the prosecution authorities not only belong to the executive branch of the State, but they also concurrently perform investigative and prosecution functions in criminal proceedings and are party to those proceedings. The Court therefore reiterates its position as to the status of the prosecutor, who cannot be regarded as \u201can officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power\u201d and rejects the Government's arguments in this respect.",

The Court considers that the Government's explanations as to the delay in reviewing the applicant's arrest are immaterial as they presuppose that there was no automatic judicial review of detention and that such a review depends only on whether the detainee has complained to the court about the lawfulness of his or her detention (see Niedba\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 50). Even assuming that the Government's arguments as to the applicant's responsibility for the delay in lodging his complaint against his detention are justified, the Court is nevertheless of the opinion that his detention for seven days without any judicial control fell outside the strict constraints of time laid down by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 29\u00a0November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, pp. 30-35, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a055-62).",

As to the remittal of the case for additional investigation on 7\u00a0March 2000 by the Kuybyshevsky District Court of Donetsk and the subsequent quashing of that resolution by the Presidium of the Donetsk Regional Court on 5 April 2000, the Court does not consider it necessary to separate this part of the applicant's criminal trial from the remainder of the criminal proceedings in their entirety as such a separation would be artificial. From the Court's point of view, the remittal of the case for additional investigation marked a procedural step which was a precondition to a new determination of the criminal charge (see Nikitin v. Russia, no.\u00a050178/99, \u00a7\u00a058, ECHR 2004...), even though it contained no elements of a final judicial decision in a criminal case and did not constitute the final determination of the charges against the applicant, an issue that should be considered in more detail in the examination of the merits of the applicant's complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Taking into account the importance of these procedural decisions of the Kuybyshevsky District Court of Donetsk and the Presidium of the Donetsk Regional Court and their influence on the outcome of the proceedings as a whole, the Court considers that the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 must be applicable to these procedural steps.",

According to the resolution of 7 March 2000, the prosecution had failed to prove that he was guilty of an offence under Article 127 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 41 above) and consideration needed to be given to the reclassification of the offence under either Article 186-2 of the Code of Administrative Offences or Article 125 of the CC. Under Article\u00a0186-2 of the Code of Administrative Offences, the maximum sanction following his conviction would have been a fine amounting to between UAH 51 and UAH\u00a0102, not eight years' imprisonment (see paragraph 42 above). The applicant therefore concluded that the lodging of a protest against the District Court's resolution, and the subsequent resolution of 5\u00a0April 2000 by the Presidium of the Regional Court, had infringed the principle of the independence and impartiality of a tribunal as enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 1.

Higher courts' power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination.

I consider that the system in force in Ukraine (at least at the material time) could be, mutatis mutandis, compared to the cassation procedure and to such a well-known institution in a considerable number of contracting States as remittal of the case to lower courts for consideration on the merits. Following the reasoning adopted by the majority as to the applicant's doubts with respect to the impartiality of the judge of the Kuybyshevsky District Court of Donetsk (see paragraph\u00a086 of the judgment), I am afraid that more serious doubts could be raised by future applicants as to impartiality of the judges called to examine the culpability of the accused after a decision by Cassation Courts on remittal of the case for consideration on the merits. It seems to me that the conclusion that \u201cthe applicant's doubts as to the impartiality of the judge of the Kuybyshevsky District Court of Donetsk may be said to have been objectively justified\u201d is not only a far-reaching one, but could have undesired consequences for the future.",

Reading the judgment of the District Court of 6\u00a0July 2000 (see paragraph\u00a028 of the judgment), I cannot conclude that such a judgment was insufficiently reasoned. It is at least as much reasoned as lots of other judgments where the Court has considered that no problem arose under Article 6 \u00a7 1 in this respect. In the light of the considerations expressed at first paragraph above, I am not convinced that the District Court should have stated why it had originally found no evidence to convict the applicant and remitted the case for additional investigation and yet, on 6\u00a0July 2000, following the Presidium of the Donetsk Regional Court resolution of 5\u00a0April\u00a02000 (see paragraph\u00a024 of the judgment), had found the applicant guilty of interfering with voters' rights.",

It was a clear dissemination of false information with respect to an important aspect of life of the country, namely the election of its president. Even assuming that the article could be considered as contributing to a discussion of a general interest or on political issues, I am not satisfied that the applicant was acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information to the other persons (see, among many authorities, Colombani and Others v. , no. 51279/99, \u00a7\u00a065, ECHR\u00a02002V).
