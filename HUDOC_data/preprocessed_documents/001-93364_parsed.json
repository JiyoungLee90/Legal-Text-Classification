Despite this difference, the Court is of the view that the measures applied were similar and that in assessing whether in the present case the authorities struck a fair balance between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the first applicant\u2019s fundamental rights it is thus appropriate to apply the criteria developed in its judgment in Velikovi\u00a0and Others (see \u00a7\u00a7 177-192).

The Court notes that section 5(3) of the Compensation Law does not entitle persons in the first applicant\u2019s position to receive bonds as this provision only concerns persons who have lost their dwellings pursuant to section 7 of the Restitution Law (see paragraph 15 above). The Government have not provided any examples of court decisions where this provision was applied in cases such as the first applicant\u2019s and have not referred to any other provision entitling her to receive bonds.
