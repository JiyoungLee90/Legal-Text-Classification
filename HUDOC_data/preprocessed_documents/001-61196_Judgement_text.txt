The case originated in an application (no. 53341/99) against the Czech Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Czech and French national, Mr Jan Hartman, and an American national, Mr Jiři Hartman (“the applicants”), on 21 March 1996. After the death of the second applicant on 17 May 2002 the Court ruled that Mr Nicholas Perizad Hartman, his son and one of his legal heirs, had standing to continue the proceedings in his stead.
The applicants complained of the length of the recovery proceedings they had brought, of an infringement of their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions and of the lack of an remedy whereby they could secure redress.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
It was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 17 December 2002 the Chamber declared the application admissible as regards the complaints relating to the length of the proceedings and the lack of a remedy to secure redress therefor. It declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
A hearing took place in public in the , , on 11 March 2003 (Rule 59 § 3).
There appeared before the Court:
The Court heard addresses by Mr Schorm, Mr Hulík and Mr J. Hartman.
Mr Hartman asked the Chamber, among other requests, to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber. Noting that in doing so he seemed to have had in mind above all the complaints declared inadmissible by the decision of 17 December 2002 and that the Government had opposed relinquishment, the Court decided that the conditions laid down in Article 30 of the Convention had not been satisfied and that consideration of the case would accordingly continue before the Chamber.
On 31 December 1948 the applicants left the former  clandestinely. Since 1954 the first applicant has been a permanent resident of , where he was naturalised in 1968, while keeping Czechoslovak nationality. The second applicant settled in the  in 1949. On 2 April 1958 he obtained American nationality, automatically losing Czechoslovak nationality in accordance with the bilateral treaty of 1928 on naturalisation. On 9 November 1999 he acquired Czech nationality.
After the applicants had emigrated all their immovable property, namely four houses in , a detached house and adjoining land in Želízy, together with movable property in the shape of 1,200 books from the library of the famous singer Ema Destinnová (Emmy Destinn), were seized and administered by the local communist authorities. On 1 July 1955 the Klatovy People's Court (lidový soud) ordered the confiscation of this property.
After the change of regime in 1989 the applicants began to take steps to recover their former possessions.
On 17 November 1992 (9 December 1992 according to the Government) the first applicant brought proceedings in the Mělník District Court (of over) for recovery of the land in Želízy, under the Land Reform Act (Law no. 229/1991.
...
On 24 May 2000 ... the District Court gave judgment, dismissing the action brought by the first applicant to prove that he was the owner of the land in Želízy.
On 29 September 2000 the applicant appealed.
...
On 5 November 2001 the  (krajský soud) set aside the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the District Court.
...
On 22 May 2002 the District Court again dismissed the applicant's action, noting that he had not corrected its procedural defects in the time allowed.
...
On 4 September 2002 the  dismissed the applicant's appeal of 10 June 2002; the Government asserted that the case was finally concluded on 2 October 2002.
On 18 October 1995 (23 October according to the Government) the second applicant brought an action for recovery in the Mělník District Court against the current owners of the detached house and land in Želízy.
...
On 5 April 2000 the District Court gave judgment on the merits, dismissing the second applicant's action. The judgment became final on 5 July 2000.
On 17 October 1995 (25 October according to the Government) the second applicant brought an action against the Prague 7 District Office for recovery of the houses under Laws nos. 87/1991 and 119/1990.
...
At the end of the hearing on 5 March 1998 the District Court dismissed the applicant's action on the ground with that he was not a Czech national and was therefore not entitled to obtain recovery of the houses he claimed.
On 19 June 1998 the applicant appealed to the Prague Municipal Court (městský soud), arguing that the condition of Czech nationality was of negligible importance, since he had been a Czech citizen at the time when his property was confiscated.
On 9 November 1999, in accordance with Law no. 193/1999, he obtained a certificate of Czech nationality, issued by the Prague 7 District Office, and became on that date a citizen of the .
On 9 November 2000 the applicant brought a new action against the district of Prague 7 seeking recovery of half of the houses concerned.  A hearing was set down for 6 August 2002.
On 10 January 2002 the Prague Municipal Court dismissed the second applicant's appeal of 19 June 1998 against the judgment of the Prague 7 District Court. The decision concerned was thus upheld and became final on 11 February 2002.
Under Article 38-2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, everyone is entitled, inter alia, to a hearing within a reasonable time.
Section 5(1) provides that judges are required to rule impartially and fairly and without delay.
By virtue of section 6(1) it is possible to lodge complaints with the organs of the judicial system (such as presidents of courts, or the Ministry of Justice) concerning the way courts have conducted judicial proceedings, whether these concern delays, inappropriate behaviour on the part of persons invested with judicial functions or interference with the proper conduct of court proceedings. An appellant is entitled to obtain information on the measures the supervisory authority has taken in response to his appeal, but the latter does not give him a personal right to require the State to exercise its supervisory powers.
Section 18(1) provided that the State was liable for damage caused by an irregularity committed in the exercise of their official duties by persons vested with public authority.
The State incurred strict liability when the following three conditions were satisfied: quantifiable pecuniary damage; an irregularity in the official proceedings of a State authority; and a causal connection between the two.
The Government cited in their observations two cases (nos. 3 C 305/96 and 13 C 368/99) in which claimants had been awarded compensation under Law no. 58/1969 for pecuniary damage caused by over-lengthy proceedings.
Section 13 provides that the State is liable for damage caused by an irregularity in the conduct of proceedings, including non-compliance with the obligation to perform an act or give a decision within the statutory time-limit. A person who has suffered loss on account of such an irregularity is entitled to damages which section 31(2) requires to include reimbursement of the costs incurred by the claimant in respect of the proceedings in which the irregularity occurred, in so far as those costs are linked to the irregularity.
Section 82(3) provides that when the Constitutional Court upholds a constitutional appeal it must either set aside the impugned decision by a public authority or, where the infringement of a right guaranteed by the Constitution is the result of an interference other than a decision, forbid the authority concerned to continue to infringe the right and order it to re-establish the status quo if that is possible.
The Constitutional Court's case-law shows that, in order to be able to declare admissible a constitutional appeal concerning the length of proceedings, it requires the appellant to have appealed to the organs of the judicial system. Where it finds an infringement of the right guaranteed by Article 38-2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms it may order the court to put an end to the delay and expedite the proceedings (as it did in cases nos. I ÚS 313/97 and I ÚS 112/97, cited by the Government in their observations), but is not empowered to award compensation to the appellant.
In their additional observations of 18 February 2003 the Government gave a fuller account of the 's case-law on the question. In addition to the sixteen judgments mentioned in the final decision on admissibility in the case of Kuchař and Štis v. the Czech Republic (application no. 37527/97, 23 May 2000, unreported) they referred to the following judgments:
– no. III. ÚS 230/96: on 29 May 1997 the  dismissed the appeal on delays in guardianship proceedings on the ground that the appellant had contributed by his conduct to the prolongation of the proceedings.
– no. III. ÚS 70/97: on 10 July 1997 the  found that the Prague High Court (vrchní soud) had infringed with the appellant's right to have his case heard without unjustified delays. It held that such an infringement would not justify setting aside a decision which had become final unless the delays had led to the infringement of other Constitutional rights. Procedural delays alone, therefore, did not constitute grounds for setting the decision aside.
– no. III. ÚS 218/97: in this judgement of 4 December 1997 the Third Chamber of the  tried to establish a distinction between the judicial and administrative elements of judicial power by imputing the delays caused by the courts' excessive workload to the administrative element alone.
– no. Pl. ÚS 6/98: on 17 February 1998 the full court of the  decided that the right to a hearing without unjustified delays corresponded to the courts' obligation to comply with the principle of fair trial, without it being possible to draw a distinction between the various elements of judicial power.
– no. II. ÚS 342/99: on 4 April 2000 the  held that delays in proceedings concerning the award of damages could infringe the constitutional right to judicial protection. It therefore ordered the court  concerned to expedite the proceedings.
– no. IV. ÚS 599/2000: in its judgment of 22 January 2001 the  ordered the court concerned to expedite the proceedings and implement the execution it had ordered. The  held that what constituted a reasonable time could vary in accordance with the circumstances of the case and that it was for the State to see to it that there were sufficient staff to ensure compliance with the rule.
– no. IV. ÚS 379/01: in this judgment of 12 November 2001 the  held that delays in proceedings already concluded by a decision which had become final did not in themselves amount to a breach of Article 38-2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. Setting aside the impugned decision, in a situation where the  did not have any other means of protecting Constitutional rights, would be justified only if procedural delays had entailed an infringement of the principle of fair trial or other substantive rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The appellants had alleged nothing of the sort, nor had they appealed to the president of the court under the Law on courts and judges.
– no. I. ÚS 663/01: on 19 November 2002 the Constitutional Court ordered the lower court to cease to infringe an appellant's right under Article 38-2 of the Charter and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to hear his claim without delay. It reiterated that procedural delays were not justified by the courts' excessive workload and that in such situations it was essential, before lodging a constitutional appeal, to apply to the president of the court in question by lodging an appeal under the Law on courts and judges. There were however exceptions to that rule since the remedy concerned could not be insisted upon where it proved to be manifestly ineffective.
