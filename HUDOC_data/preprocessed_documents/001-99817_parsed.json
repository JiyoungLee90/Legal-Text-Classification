In the \u2018discussion\u2019 part of his report the expert emphasises that Noam\u2019s situation seems at present to be completely blocked. On the one hand, given his young age and his complete lack of recollection of his first years in Israel, including of his father, any visit to that country without his mother, even a brief visit, and even if the legal situation allowed it, would be psychologically highly traumatic, involving extreme separation-related anxiety and a major risk of severe depression. On the other hand, the possibility of the mother\u2019s return to Israel with Noam, even for a short period, is totally out of the question for the mother. In answer to the question whether Noam\u2019s return to Israel might place the child in an intolerable situation, the expert replied that it was \u2018clearly\u2019 the conditions of the child\u2019s possible return to Israel that would or would not render the situation intolerable. He observed that, likewise, it was the conditions of his continuing residence in Switzerland that would or would not render his situation there intolerable and that the maintaining of the status quo represented a long-term major psychological risk for the child, with the result that, if there were no understanding between his parents, an agreement would urgently be required between the child protection services of the States of the parents\u2019 residence in order to make up for their failure to act.",

As the right of access has been restricted by judicial decisions, what measures will be taken to ensure that the exercise of the right of access does not harm the child\u2019s physical and psychological welfare?\u2019 In its letter of 12 March 2007 the Israeli Central Authority did not really answer the questions put to it, so it is impossible to be satisfied about the interests of the child. The Central Authority merely mentioned the appellant\u2019s intentions concerning his son if his son should return to Israel without his mother, in the following terms: \u2018[I]n the event that Noam\u2019s mother refuses to return to Israel, the father will take care of the child.

Not only would such a return entail a grave risk of exposure to psychological harm, whether or not he is accompanied by his mother, it would also place him again in an intolerable situation. Firstly, the psychiatric expert observes that if the child returns to Israel with his mother, he will risk being exposed to psychological harm whose intensity cannot be assessed without knowledge of the conditions of that return. In that connection, the Guardianship Division is of the opinion that, since the child\u2019s removal to Israel, even if his mother accompanies him, may expose the child to psychological harm and since, unlike the \u2018classic scenario\u2019 envisaged by the Hague Convention, the respondent has custody of her son, she cannot reasonably be required to return to Israel. An additional factor is that the mother\u2019s return to Israel would also undermine the child\u2019s economic security, since the mother would be required to find a job there, in order to provide not only for her own needs but also for those of her son. The fact that the appellant has never provided for his child\u2019s upkeep and that he is known to earn only 300 [Swiss] francs per month cannot be disregarded when the interests of the child are taken into consideration in that context. Lastly, it must be considered that the requirement of the mother\u2019s return is disproportionate to the reason for the return: the object of the Hague Convention is to put the child back into the legal situation in which he was before he was abducted. However, the present return is requested in order to allow the appellant to exercise his right to a personal relationship, a right which is shown to have been exercised before the child\u2019s departure under the supervision of the social services in the form of two weekly meetings of two hours each. To require a mother to uproot herself in order to permit the exercise of such a restricted right of access, when the child\u2019s return certainly entails a risk of grave psychological harm, in view of the conditions of insecurity in which the return will take place, constitutes an intolerable situation for the child within the meaning of Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention.",

That element is sufficient for a finding that the condition laid down in Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), is satisfied. In addition, the information provided by the Israeli Central Authority about the arrangements envisaged in the event that the child returns without his mother are, at the very least, a matter for concern: although the appellant has, legally speaking, only a very restricted right of access, under supervision, it is envisaged, according to the information provided by the Central Authority, that the appellant will take his son home (without any guarantee that he will by then have an individual flat) and will thus have de facto custody. In that connection, the Israeli Central Authority claims that by refusing to return to Israel with her son, the respondent is implicitly acquiescing in that change of situation \u2013 a new reality of which the appellant will then seek validation by the Israeli judicial authorities. That does not correspond to the aim pursued by the Hague Convention, which provides for the immediate return of the unlawfully removed child in order to put it back in the status quo ante. Such a return cannot therefore be ordered on the basis of the Hague Convention, and it is emphasised that there is no doubt that Noam\u2019s return to Israel in such circumstances would definitely expose him to a risk of major psychological harm, owing not only to the fact that he would be abruptly separated from his mother, when she has been his principal parental reference since he was born and has been the only one to provide for his upkeep, but also to the fact that he will be just as abruptly faced with a father of whose existence he has just learnt. In the light of the foregoing, the appeal on this point must be dismissed. ...",

Thus, the Justice of the Peace of the District of Lausanne had jurisdiction, ratione loci and ratione materiae, to take the disputed protective measure. As to the merits, it is sufficient to state that, since the child has no recollection of his father, owing to the process of physiological amnesia attributable to his very young age, there are valid grounds for avoiding an abrupt reunion, as the welfare of the child requires that the resumption of a personal relationship with his father should take place calmly and gradually, after he has been properly prepared for that new situation, as may be seen from the expert\u2019s convincing submissions on that point.

In the present case it is not in dispute that the child\u2019s removal to Switzerland was wrongful, since the father retained, jointly with the respondent, the right of \u2018guardianship\u2019, which under Israeli law includes the right to decide on the child\u2019s residence.

The father, for his part, lived in a religious community where he was fed, and from his activity as a sports and art teacher he had a monthly income of only 300 [Swiss] francs. The custody of the child had been withdrawn from him on account of the atmosphere of fear that he had created at the family home. For the same reason, the Israeli courts ordered him to live separately and prohibited him from approaching the mother\u2019s flat. Before the child\u2019s removal to Switzerland he had only had a restricted right of visitation, limited to two hours twice a week, under the supervision of the Israeli social services. Concerning the conditions of a possible return of the child without his mother, according to the information provided by the Israeli Ministry of Justice on 12 March 2007, the father, who now shares a flat with one other tenant and still works in an institution for religious education, would be prepared to take care of the child. Taking into account the laconic and not very reassuring nature of this information, together with the expert\u2019s report by Dr ..., a psychiatrist, the Cantonal Court considered that a return to Israel involved a risk of psychological harm for the child and might place him in an intolerable situation, whether or not he was accompanied by his mother. The court added that, in view of the father\u2019s low income, the return to Israel of the respondent would also undermine the child\u2019s economic stability and the mother would have to find a job in order to provide for them both.",

He is of the opinion, however, that such a risk would not exist if the child\u2019s mother accompanied him to Israel, as could be reasonably expected of her. As regards that latter hypothesis, the judgment of the Cantonal Court fails to provide any evidence of such a grave risk of harm, or of any intolerable situation for the child. The expert psychiatrist failed, in particular, to address that question, simply explaining that the risk could not be assessed without ascertaining the conditions of a possible return. As to the appellant\u2019s aggressive behaviour towards the respondent, it does not appear from the Cantonal Court\u2019s judgment that the child would be threatened directly or indirectly as a result of witnessing such violence against his mother. She stated that the father had complied with the arrangements for his right of visitation and that the visits had gone well. The social worker appointed to supervise the right of visitation had described as \u2018wonderful\u2019 the father-son relationship as established just before the child\u2019s abduction by his mother. She has not claimed that the appellant breached the judicial instructions which required him not to approach her flat or to disturb and/or harass her. As to the considerations relating to the father\u2019s low income and his ties with the \u2018Lubavitch\u2019 religious community, as they stand they do not indicate a grave risk that the child would be exposed to harm within the meaning of Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention. Whilst such considerations may help to determine which of the two parents offers the best child-rearing capacities for the purpose of deciding on the attribution of the right of custody \u2013 a matter that is decided by the judicial authorities of the place of habitual residence (Article 16 of the Hague Convention) \u2013 they are not pertinent, however, for a decision about the return of a child after a wrongful abduction (see recital 4.1 above).",

The Cantonal Court judges quoted the expert psychiatrist who had referred to the \u2018judicial risks\u2019 that would be entailed in the event of a return to Israel, without any indication as to whether the respondent actually faced a prison sentence as a result of the abduction. Supposing that such a risk were proven, she could not be expected to return to Israel with the child \u2013 and that would accordingly rule out the return of [the child] in view of the major psychological harm that would be caused to him by the separation from his mother. She made no comment on that question in her reply to the Federal Court; in particular, she has not claimed that immediate imprisonment, or even any criminal sanction at all, would be imposed on her. Neither has she argued that in the event of her return to Israel it would be impossible or very difficult for her to integrate, or, in particular, to find a new job. Consequently, it cannot be said that the mother\u2019s return, and therefore that of the child, would be unbearable for economic reasons either. Therefore, as the respondent has failed to establish the existence of reasons that would objectively justify a refusal on her part to return to Israel, it must be accepted that she could reasonably be expected to return to that State of origin accompanied by the child. In these circumstances, it is of no import that the information provided by the Israeli Central Authority (see recital 4.2 above) on which the Cantonal Court based, in particular, its justification of the exception to the child\u2019s return as provided for by Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention, was deemed not very reassuring, because that information was based only on the hypothesis of the child\u2019s return without his mother.",

The Australian court considered both a custody order, which gave the father \u201creasonable access\u201d to the youngest child, and an injunction restraining both the mother and the father from removing the children from Australia. It ultimately ordered the return of the children pursuant to the Convention because their removal had violated the father\u2019s custody rights that had been created by the restraining order. Similarly, the Israeli Supreme Court found that a custody agreement between parents contained a mutual consultation clause for major changes and unusual events, which implicitly included decisions on the residence of the child (Foxman v. Foxman, Israeli Supreme Court, 1992). The court thus considered that the father had rights of custody within the meaning of the Convention.",

It is not sufficient for the parent who wrongfully removed or retained the child to state that he or she refuses to return to that State. He or she would also have to be in a situation of hardship such that he or she could not reasonably be expected to return to his or her place of prior residence to await there, with the child, the court\u2019s final decision on the granting of custody. In that context, we have in mind especially those cases in which the mother cannot be guaranteed safe or affordable accommodation outside the home of her former partner. One must further take into account those cases in which the parent who has requested the return of the child will not resume the exercise of the right of custody and will not obtain it by court order, whilst the abducting parent is clearly the child\u2019s primary carer. In such a case the child would only be taken to the State of origin to await the final attribution of the right of custody to the abducting parent, before coming back to Switzerland again with that parent. Such coming and going would ultimately only have served the purpose of bringing the case before the authorities of the former State of residence. Such a solution would be inadmissible according to the spirit and purpose of the Hague Convention, because it would be incompatible with the child\u2019s interests. But the situation would have to be beyond doubt for the Swiss court dealing with the request for return. Unless the circumstances can be established clearly, the court will have to rule that the return to the parent\u2019s State of origin is bearable and that, accordingly, the child will not be placed in an intolerable situation such as to justify a decision denying the return under Article 13, sub-paragraph (b), of the Hague Convention.",

However, such a solution should only be sought, with the resulting possibility for the competent Swiss court to order the child\u2019s return, if placement with a third party is not manifestly contrary to the child\u2019s interests. That third condition can be satisfied only if separation from the parent remaining in Switzerland is bearable for the child \u2013 which may be the case where he or she has an antagonistic relationship with that parent \u2013 and if the foster family receiving the child can provide proper guarantees as to the protection and normal upbringing of the child.

Thus, the parties, and in particular the parents, have a duty to participate in the establishment of the facts. The hearing of the parties in person by the court (section 9(1) and (2)) is therefore of great importance. The new provisions concerning the procedure and the cooperation with the competent authorities of the State of origin also play an essential role. The court must be able to verify whether, and in what manner, it is possible to ensure the child\u2019s return (section 10(2)). If it does not succeed in that task, or succeeds only partially, it will not be in a position to weigh up all the consequences that a return might have for the child. The same will be true if it does not succeed in obtaining from the local authorities any reliable assurances as to the conditions of the child\u2019s reception and protection, in particular when there is some doubt about the requesting parent\u2019s capacity to look after the child properly. In this respect, section 10 is thus directly related to the practical application of section 5.\u201d",

A return to Israel could be envisaged for the mother and for the child, given that he was still at a perfectly adaptable age (see the Chamber judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 80 and 89). As regards the risk of a criminal sanction against the mother, the Chamber found no reason to doubt the credibility of the assurances given by the Israeli authorities in that connection, having regard in particular to the efforts they had made for the mother and child before their departure for Switzerland (ibid., \u00a7 90). The Chamber further emphasised that it was in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of every child to grow up in an environment that allowed him or her to maintain regular contact with both parents (ibid., \u00a7 91).

Whilst the courts below had upheld the objection to the child\u2019s return, highlighting, in particular, the best interests of the child and the grave risk of psychological harm, and also the intolerable situation which they considered the child would face if he were returned to Israel with or without his mother, the Federal Court had quite simply rejected that approach, even though it was supported by an expert\u2019s report, and had declared that the proper solution was in fact to compel the mother, who had custody, to return to Israel with the child, failing which she would be separated from him. However, the first applicant had always declared that she would not return to Israel, not only because of the intolerable situation which had precisely led her to leave that country in June 2005, but also because to do so would mean uprooting herself and her child and would entail problems for her before the Israeli courts.

It was only from the autumn of 2003, shortly after the child\u2019s birth, that the father had, without taking into account the mother\u2019s opinion, chosen to join an ultra-orthodox religious movement, thus completely changing the rules of life adopted by the spouses at the time of their marriage. Moreover, Mr Shuruk had not denied that he belonged to the ultra-orthodox Jewish \u201cLubavitch\u201d movement, which, in the applicants\u2019 submission, was a \u201cmystical and ascetic movement\u201d of traditional Hasidic Judaism, whose members engaged in zealous proselytising. Nor had Mr\u00a0Shuruk denied having also sought to impose on his wife and child a radical way of life which, for example, required women to hide their hair and boys to be sent at the age of three to religious \u201cHeder\u201d schools. In this connection, the first applicant explained that she had no intention of cutting her son off from his roots. Since 2006 he had been attending a municipal secular nursery school one day a week and a private State-approved Jewish day-care centre where, in addition to the school curriculum of the Canton of Vaud, he was being taught the basic principles of Judaism.",

The Government admitted that it followed from a letter from the Israeli Central Authority, forwarded to the Guardianship Division by the child\u2019s father, that under Israeli criminal law a custodial sentence could be imposed for child abduction. However, guidelines issued by the Israeli State Attorney\u2019s Department provided that when the police were dealing with such a case they would transfer it to the Israeli Central Authority responsible for application of the Hague Convention, which would then make recommendations as to the solution to be applied to the case. In this connection the Government observed that, according to the relevant guidelines, criminal proceedings should be brought only in very exceptional cases. The Israeli Central Authority had indicated that in the present case it would consider directing the Israeli police to close the criminal proceedings if the first applicant proved ready to cooperate with the Israeli authorities and to respect the right of access granted to the father by the Tel Aviv Family Court, and if she did not disappear again with the child (see letter of 30 April 2007 appended to the Government\u2019s observations of 14 August 2009). In this connection the Government took the view that the Hague Convention system was based on mutual confidence between the States Parties to that instrument and that if a State should fail to comply with its assurances, it would run the risk that the other States might not cooperate with it in the fashion envisaged. The Government thus subscribed to the Chamber\u2019s view that no doubt should be cast on the credibility of the assertions in that letter and that the first applicant did not run the risk of incurring criminal sanctions (see Chamber judgment, \u00a7 90).",

Furthermore, in the event of disagreement about a child\u2019s religious education, the court granting parental authority would decide according to the best interests of the child.

The Government explained that the competent authority in the present case was the Justice of the Peace of the District of Lausanne, which had delivered the decision at first instance. On 20 August 2007 the child\u2019s father had applied to that authority through his counsel to appoint an ad hoc guardian for the child with the task of arranging Noam\u2019s departure in accordance with the decision of the Federal Court. Following this Court\u2019s decision of 27\u00a0September 2007 to indicate a stay of execution in the present case, the father had withdrawn his request on 1 October 2007. These were the reasons why, for the time being, the arrangements for the child\u2019s return had not yet been decided. The Government further observed that the Federal Court, in its judgment of 16 August 2007, had ordered the child\u2019s return on the assumption that the mother could be expected to accompany him. Moreover, primary responsibility for arranging the return lay with the first applicant, who had created the present dispute in the first place by abducting her son.

As to the State\u2019s obligation to take positive measures, Article 8 includes the right of a parent \u2013 in this case the father \u2013 to the taking of measures with a view to his or her being reunited with his or her child and an obligation on the national authorities to take such action (see, for example, Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 94). However, this obligation is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with his or her child may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparation. The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned are always important ingredients. In addition, when difficulties appear, mainly as a result of a refusal by the parent with whom the child lives to comply with the decision ordering the child\u2019s prompt return, the appropriate authorities should then impose adequate sanctions in respect of this lack of cooperation and, whilst coercive measures against children are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of manifestly unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the child lives (see Maire, cited above, \u00a7 76). Lastly, in this kind of case, the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation. Proceedings relating to the award of parental responsibility, including the enforcement of the final decision, require urgent handling as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent with whom it does not live. The Hague Convention recognises this fact because it provides for a range of measures to ensure the prompt return of children removed to or wrongfully retained in any Contracting State. Article\u00a011 of the Hague Convention requires the judicial or administrative authorities concerned to act expeditiously to ensure the return of children and any failure to act for more than six weeks may give rise to a request for explanations (see Maire, cited above, \u00a7 74).\u201d",

On 22 May 2007 that decision was confirmed in substance by the Guardianship Division of the Cantonal Court of the Canton of Vaud (see paragraph 41 above). However, on 16 August 2007, the Federal Court allowed the father\u2019s application and ordered Noam\u2019s return.

He observed in particular that neither the father nor his lawyer had ever appeared at hearings before that court and thus found that the father had lost interest in the case (see paragraph 47 above).",

As to the child\u2019s return without his mother, that would also expose him to a risk of major psychological harm (see paragraph 37 above).

It must therefore be determined whether this conclusion is compatible with Article\u00a08, that is to say whether the forced return of the child accompanied by his mother, even though she seems to have ruled out this possibility, would represent a proportionate interference with the right of each of the applicants to respect for their family life.",

Therefore the clear starting point for assessing this case is that the child should be returned to Israel in accordance with Article 12 of the Hague Convention unless the conditions for not doing so in Article 13 of that Convention are fulfilled. I also agree with what is said in paragraph 141 of the judgment that it is not the Court\u2019s task to take the place of the competent authorities in examining whether, in the event of a return, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to psychological harm within the meaning of that Article.

It cannot be interpreted in such a way that it obliges the parent or, for that matter, any other person responsible for the abduction to return to that country as well. Nor does such an obligation, to my knowledge, follow from other Swiss law. If the Hague Convention were to be applied in such a manner, the reality would be that a person could be \u201ccondemned\u201d to live outside his or her country of origin for a considerable number of years with all the complications that would entail, just because it is considered in the best interests of a child to have access to the other parent. This would in my opinion run counter to the right to respect for, inter alia, private life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention as well as the guarantees on freedom of movement as embodied in Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, Riener v. Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, 23 May 2006, and Gochev v. Bulgaria, no. 34383/03, 26 November 2009). Accordingly, I find it irrelevant for the decision to be taken under the Hague Convention to look into whether a person has pertinent motives not to live in a certain country, which is the way it was decided in this case \u2013 and furthermore I find it improper to do so as only that person himself or herself can reasonably be the judge of such matters. In this respect it is striking that the Federal Court, as well as the Chamber, found that the first applicant could reasonably be expected to return to Israel, whereas the Israeli Family Court in its decision of 27 March 2005 stated that \u201cshe had no ties in that country\u201d (paragraph 27 of the judgment).",

However, her request was rejected without any apparent consideration of her personal situation or the best interests of the child.

Accordingly the judgment could not be enforced against her personally if she refused to leave Switzerland and it is unclear whether in that case the judgment could be enforced at all, as it is based on the assumption that she accompanies the child. On the other hand, it seems to be the intention in this part of the reasoning in the judgment to put moral pressure on the first applicant to return to Israel with the second applicant. In my opinion it is at least doubtful that under certain circumstances \u2013 if at all \u2013 a court of law may be entitled to base a decision of this kind on considerations of a moral character without any basis in law. In any event, in the present case it had the unfortunate effect that it exempted the Federal Court from drawing the inevitable conclusion that the return of the child alone would not be justified under Article 13 of the Hague Convention. I do not in any way suggest that the Federal Court deliberately relied on this reasoning in order to circumvent that Article of the Convention. On the contrary, I am convinced that this was not the case, and that the decision was made with the best intentions to comply with the obligations under the Hague Convention. However, the effect was, in my opinion, that Article 13 was not properly assessed and that accordingly there would be a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the event of the enforcement of the Federal Court\u2019s judgment of 16 August 2007, irrespective of any subsequent developments in the applicants\u2019 situation.",

It cannot in any way be understood as casting doubt on the Hague Convention, which is an extremely important international instrument in the fight against child abduction. Nor has it been my intention to question the application of that Convention in this Court\u2019s case-law to date. But it is my opinion that the circumstances of this case are unique in so far as it is undisputed that it was clearly in the best interests of the second applicant to stay with his mother irrespective of her country of residence. I do not recall any other case before the Court where the return of a child was ordered in similar circumstances. Accordingly, to refuse the return of the second applicant in this particular case would in no way undermine the normal application of the Hague Convention.",

A restrictive concept of grave risks may preclude a balanced assessment. Moreover, the application of Article 13 of the Hague Convention should entail a comprehensive analysis as suggested by sub-paragraph (b) of that Article, which specifically demands the avoidance of \u201cintolerable situations\u201d resulting from the return of the child.",

The Federal Court also failed to consider the impact of the father\u2019s limited rights of access and the potential financial hardship. These are paramount considerations to be addressed in applying Article 8, even if the specific decision concerns the return of a child wrongfully removed. Of course, given the specific nature of the situation, the weight of the different factors (for example, the weight of public order in relation to dissuasion of abduction) differs from what is applicable in \u201cordinary\u201d child placement cases. National courts, having the benefit of direct contact with the persons involved, are better placed to make such assessments and must be accorded a reasonable margin of appreciation.",

The Court in particular refers to integration into the new environment (see paragraph 145) and to the seriousness of the difficulty the child and his mother are likely to encounter in the country of destination (see paragraph 146). In 2007 the child, having spent two years in Switzerland was already settled in his new environment. This was demonstrated in the domestic proceedings. The Court finds that this was so when it refers to nursery school attendance from 2006 onwards. However, this factor was disregarded by the Federal Court. The Court also finds that the pre-2007 restrictions on the father\u2019s right of access are relevant in the assessment of the risks for the child\u2019s well-being in the event of his return to Israel (see paragraphs 22 and 24.) Once again, the consideration of these factors is expressly precluded by the Federal Court\u2019s deliberately restrictive interpretation of the Hague Convention. Finally, in the view of the majority, the criminal sanctions that the mother might face in the event of her return are also a relevant risk for the child\u2019s well-being. Given that the mother is probably the only person to whom the child relates, such a risk is one that the Court finds not to be acceptable in 2010.

The reasoning of the Federal Court implies that in the absence of objective reasons the mother has a duty to return with her child. However, the uncontested legal obligation to take personal care of one\u2019s child does not entail an unconditional duty to do so at any place of residence, in total disregard of the Convention rights of the care provider. In its reasoning the Federal Court disregarded the possibility and related risk that the child might not be accompanied by his mother; the underlying assumption that the mother has to follow the child indicates a disregard of the mother\u2019s Article 8 rights, her freedom of movement and her personal autonomy.
