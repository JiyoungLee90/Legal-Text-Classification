The court decided that the detention of the applicant and his two co-accused was no longer necessary, particularly since eleven other co-accused had already been released. The court also found that the argument of severity of the possible sentence lost its importance with the lapse of time, relying on the case-law of the Court, and that detention should not amount to anticipation of the penalty of imprisonment. Similarly, it did not consider the risk of the applicant and other co-accused interfering with the course of proceedings decisive for extending the measure against them. As regards the state of health of the applicant, the court indicated that surgery was imminent and that this justified release. The court acknowledged that for a long time the prison authorities had been attempting to find a solution for the applicant, who at the same time had been telling them he was suffering pain. As a result, the situation could justify the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion on 24 October 2008 that his pre-trial detention amounted to an inhumane measure and that \u201cit would not be correct to achieve an outcome justified in the interests of justice by tolerating his suffering\u201d.",

The proceedings relating to such a request are essentially designed to secure financial reparation for damage arising from the execution of unjustified detention (see W\u0142och v.

The authorities conducting criminal proceedings against the applicant continued to extend his detention, relying repeatedly on the reasonable suspicion against him and on the complexity of the investigation as justifying his continued detention. Regard being had to the finding above, the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to give serious consideration to the applicant\u2019s state of health, except for general statements (see decision of 24\u00a0January 2007 in paragraph 13 above) or repeatedly justifying his allegedly appropriate medical care by the existence of the morphine pump, which was in fact not working (see paragraph 63 above). Accordingly, the grounds given by the domestic authorities were particularly unsatisfactory, given the serious state of the applicant\u2019s health, and could not justify the overall period of the applicant\u2019s detention.",

Whereas the main issue under Article 5 \u00a7 3 is whether the judicial authorities had properly weighed all the relevant facts and circumstances in order to decide whether or not to release the applicant on bail pending the proceedings against him (or, in the instant case, to decide whether or not to prolong his detention), the issue for the purposes of Article 3 is whether the State \u2013 represented in this case by the authorities directly responsible for his detention, that is the detention or prison authorities \u2013 had done all that was reasonably possible to alleviate the applicant\u2019s pain while in detention.",

The Polish courts cavalierly dismissed or ignored on many occasions the fact that the applicant was not only wheelchair bound but had an additional serious health problem. They repeatedly refused to properly put into the equation, for the purpose of deciding on the release or otherwise of the applicant, his overall physical condition. Even when, rather late in the day (see paragraph 25), the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal took the trouble to consider at some length the applicant\u2019s general medical condition, it wrongly equated his main health problem \u2013 which was basically the condition engendering bouts of severe pain in the applicant, with the correlative decrease in his ability to act in a way capable of frustrating the proper administration of justice in the proceedings against him \u2013 with \u201ca threat to [his] life or health\u201d. It simply missed the wood for the trees.",

The applicant, it must be remembered, arrived in the detention centres with a medical or health condition pre-existing his arrest. The Court has already had occasion to observe that Article 3 should not be construed as laying down a general obligation to release detainees on health grounds; rather it imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well-being of persons deprived of their liberty by, among others, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see, among others, Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002 IX). Moreover, the medical care that the applicant was entitled to receive while in detention was the standard level of health care available to the population generally (see Kaprykowski v. Poland, no. 23052/05, \u00a7 75, 3 February 2009), and not some form of extraordinary medical care, particularly so when his life was not at any time at risk. First (at the Warsaw Detention Centre Hospital), difficulties were encountered to obtain the morphine to fill the pump (when this was still in working order); the pump was filled with a solution to keep it in working order and the applicant was given a particular drug to alleviate the pain (see paragraph 34). After the pump broke down and it was evident that the best solution was to have a new one implanted rather than to administer painkillers in a different way, the detention centre authorities (this time of the Krak\u00f3w Detention Centre Hospital) sought to find a hospital where the implantation could take place (see paragraph 42). Several replied in the negative, but two Polish hospitals stated that they were able to replace the pump (one of the two later withdrawing the offer \u201cfor technical reasons\u201d). Why the implantation was not performed by the other hospital before the applicant\u2019s release we simply do not know. When the applicant was released, he travelled to Germany to have the pump implanted there, was put off by the cost, went back to Poland, and the implantation was effected by the  on the 13 August 2009 (almost three months to the day after his release).",

It is quite evident that the intervention necessary for the implantation of such a pump cannot be equated to a simple tooth extraction or other run of the mill intervention.",
