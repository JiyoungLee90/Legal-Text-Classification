The Court is satisfied that, while allowing the applicant to take his son abroad for summer visits, the judgment had due regard to the mother\u2019s arguments and the questions related to the applicability of the Hague Convention, but no evidence was identified to support the mother\u2019s supposition (see paragraph 8 above).",

The decisions of the Hungarian courts to the effect that the applicant\u2019s access rights as regards summer vacations should be exercised in Hungary until the child\u2019s sixteenth birthday can be seen as reflecting this principle.
