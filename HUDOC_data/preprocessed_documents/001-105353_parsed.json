When the criminal court left their claim unexamined, a decision, which under domestic law could be adopted only in exceptional circumstances (see paragraph 40 above), it advised the applicants to address their claim to the civil courts. The Court is thus satisfied that the criminal proceedings were decisive for the applicants\u2019 civil right to claim compensation (contrast Ploti\u0146a v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a016825/02, 3 June 2008; and Bl\u016bmberga v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a070930/01, \u00a7 68, 14\u00a0October 2008) and accordingly they fall within the ambit of Article 6 of the Convention. Both sets of proceedings were closely linked and the Court therefore considers that it would be inappropriate to separate them and to assess their length in isolation (see Torri v. , 1 July 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 21, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV).",

On the other hand, the Court notes that the applicants did not provide sufficient documentary evidence in support of their civil claim and that for that reason the domestic criminal courts decided to leave their claim unexamined (see paragraph\u00a017 above). In this respect, the Court recalls that it is not its role to assess the facts or evidence which have led a national court to adopt one decision, rather than another, unless there is clear evidence of arbitrariness (see Sisojeva and Others v.\u00a0 [GC], no. 60654/00, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2007II), and notes that it does not discern in the present case any arbitrariness in the decision to leave the civil claim unexamined within the criminal proceedings. In fact, the domestic judicial system provided a favourable possibility for the applicants to submit and substantiate their claim before the civil courts. Finally, the Court notes that the applicants lodged their claim with the civil courts one year after the completion of the criminal proceedings. Even if the Court does not consider this period as a part of the overall length of proceedings in the present case (see paragraph 65 above), it nevertheless considers that this period contributed to the protracted determination of the applicants\u2019 civil claim.",

Irrespective of whether or not the judgment or its operative part was read out during the hearing of 17\u00a0May\u00a02002, the first applicant was aware from that date that her claim was satisfied in the amount of LVL 10 per month. Thus, she was not put at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the respondent, because she was aware of the contents of the judgment. She also did not exercise her right to submit observations in reply to the respondent\u2019s appeal directly to the appellate court or a counter-appeal to contest the amount of the allowance. Therefore, it cannot be said that domestic authorities did not offer her a reasonable opportunity to present the case. The Court concludes that the first applicant could present her case under the same conditions as the respondent party.",

The Court stated in the case of Lavents v.\u00a0Latvia (no.\u00a058442/00, 28 November 2002) that it will keep in mind in such cases the time a person has already spent in court proceedings before the entry into force of the Convention in the country concerned. This has to be balanced against the particular circumstances of the case such as the fact that, at the time of the car accident, the second applicant was only eight years old and that the injuries were such as to require extensive medical treatment and thus financial resources which the mother did not have. In the case of Gheorghe and Maria Mihaela Dumitrescu v. Romania (no. 6373/03, 29 July 2008), the Court found that the length of proceedings for damages lasting for just over three years, in circumstance where the car accident led to paralysis of the lower limbs of a five-year-old girl, was in breach of Article 6.",

I believe that the civil claim that the applicants submitted within the criminal proceedings was of sufficient quality (see paragraph 17 of the judgment). The only difficulty was that the total amount of the claim did not correspond to the heads of damages claimed. In this respect the applicants readily admitted a possible mistake in the final calculation. It is therefore perplexing that the criminal courts left the claim unexamined, given the urgency of the matter in view of the child\u2019s state of health. I cannot agree with the majority that this fact, when compared to the many delays in the proceedings caused by the absences of the respondent and witnesses (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 16) should weigh against the applicants. Furthermore, there is nothing unusual in the fact that it took the applicants one year to lodge a civil claim (see paragraph 70), given the circumstances in which they found themselves after the car accident. The applicant, who is not a lawyer, had to attend to the needs of her daughter and mount a case in the civil courts. That is no simple matter in practice. I also note that in the civil proceedings the hearing finally took place on 10 December 2001 whereas the claim was lodged on 9 May 2001 (see paragraphs 19-20). In sum, I do not agree that the applicants\u2019 behaviour was such as to outweigh the various delays caused in this case before the national courts, taking into consideration the interests at stake, namely, compensation for physical injury following a car accident involving the second applicant, an eightyear-old child. I do not think that this was a good case in which to start pursuing a more pragmatic judicial policy as regards Article 6 \u00a7 1 complaints regarding the length of proceedings, bearing in mind that the application was lodged with the Court in 2002.",

At the relevant time there certainly existed no remedy in the Latvian legal system enabling individuals faced with delays in different types of court proceedings to speed up those proceedings. Today, there is some remedy in criminal proceedings, as provided for by section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2005. However, this will most likely not be particularly relevant or even helpful to the victims of a crime. It is therefore, and despite the outcome in this case, of great importance that the respondent State review the state of the legal mechanisms available with a view to ensuring compliance with the Article 13 requirements as articulated by the Court in Kud\u0142a v.  ([GC], no. 30210/96, ECHR 2000XI).",
