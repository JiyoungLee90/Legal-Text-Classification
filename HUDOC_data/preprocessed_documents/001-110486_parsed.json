The applicants\u2019 lawyers requested that the anonymous witnesses be found and questioned. The District Court held that the anonymous witnesses had been the victims of the crimes of which the applicants had been accused, and therefore were free to decide whether they wished to attend the hearing. It questioned seven witnesses, who stated that they did not know or did not remember anything about the case. However, two of the witnesses, Mr A.D. and Mr I.S., admitted that they had received international money transfers, and Mr A.D. specified that he had thus done the fourth applicant who had had no identity card a favour. The Public Prosecutor requested that the records of the witnesses\u2019 statements before the investigator be read out in court. However, the applicants did not give their consent and the District Court dismissed that request.",

In point 5 of the decision it held that the victim of a human trafficking offence could participate in the criminal proceedings as an anonymous witness. It held that the accused\u2019s defence rights could be subjected to reasonable restrictions, including by granting anonymity status to the testifying victim, in order to protect the latter\u2019s rights. However, a strict judicial control had to be exercised over the reasons for granting anonymity to testifying victims and over the procedures aimed at counterbalancing the restriction of the defence rights. According to the Supreme Court of Cassation, in cases of anonymous witnesses the legislation provided three procedural safeguards against the risk of manipulating the evidence in favour of the prosecution: (1) the direct contact between the judge and the anonymous witness, which guaranteed, at the very least, that such a witness indeed existed; (2) the right of the accused and his lawyer to put questions to the anonymous witness immediately after his questioning; and (3) the limited probative importance the legislation attached to anonymous testimony (see paragraph 40 above). The court made reference to the case-law of this Court and concluded that the rules of fair trial would not be breached if the above procedures were strictly complied with, and notably, if the accused has been given the opportunity to put questions to the anonymous witness immediately after the questioning of the latter.",

In that judgment the Court recalled that the guarantees in paragraph 3 (d) of Article\u00a06 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of this provision which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings. In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses. The Grand Chamber recalled in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly. Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) enshrines the principle that, before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see \u00a7 118 of Al-Khawaja and Tahery [GC], cited above).",

First, there must be a good reason for the non-attendance of a witness. Second, when a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (the\u00a0so-called \u201csole or decisive rule\u201d) (ibid., \u00a7 119). As regards the application of the latter rule, the Grand Chamber concluded that where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission as evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7 1. At the same time where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance in the case (ibid., \u00a7 147).",

The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. This principle requires not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7 127).",

However, it is prepared to accept that as victims of sexual procurement, the anonymous witnesses must have reasonably feared reprisals at the hands of their procurers. Furthermore, the applicants\u2019 objections in this respect were examined and dismissed by the District Court (see paragraph 28 above). As to the applicants\u2019 argument that they managed to discover the anonymous witnesses\u2019 identity, the Court considers it irrelevant because it does not support the applicants\u2019 thesis that the anonymity status limited their opportunity to test those testimonies.",

Immediately after the interviews, the applicants and their lawyers were given the opportunity to put questions to those witnesses and to cast doubt on the credibility of their testimony. However, they expressly refused to put questions and therefore can be considered to have waived their right to challenge these statements (see, mutatis mutandis, Zdravko Petrov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 20024/04, \u00a7 38, 23 June 2011, with further references). The\u00a0applicants, who were represented by lawyers, should have been aware that the testimony thus obtained could be used as evidence by the courts.

The domestic courts had before them a mass of other evidence, such as reports on money transfers, information from the border control database, results from the use of special surveillance measures, and statements of other witnesses, that permitted them to make a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of the anonymous witnesses\u2019 testimonies, and the applicants \u2013 to challenge or rebut them by giving evidence themselves. The courts based the applicants\u2019 conviction on a thorough analysis of all those pieces of evidence and found that they corroborated the anonymous witnesses\u2019 account of the events. It is true that even where the evidence of an absent witness has not been sole or decisive, the Court has still found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) when no good reason has been shown for the failure to have the witnesses examined (see, for example, in L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, 15\u00a0June 1992, Series A no. 238, Mild and Virtanen v. Finland, no. 39481/98 and 40227/98, 26 July 2005, Bonev v. Bulgaria, no. 60018/00, 8 June 2006; and Pello v. Estonia, no. 11423/03, 12 April 2007). This is because as a general rule witnesses should give evidence during the trial and that all reasonable efforts will be made to secure their attendance (see\u00a0AlKhawaja\u00a0and Tahery [GC], cited above, \u00a7 120). The applicants have criticised the failure of the authorities to make reasonable efforts to secure the attendance of the anonymous witnesses. However, the Court notes that the domestic courts made reasonable efforts to have those witnesses located and summoned and that their efforts cannot be dismissed as inadequate (see\u00a0paragraphs 26\u00a0and 27 above).

Therefore this opportunity was not available to the second and the fourth applicants after their release from prison.

Therefore the Government\u2019s first objection should be rejected. As to the possibility of the second and the fourth applicants claiming damages, the Court notes that such a claim could not result in the lifting of the travel bans. Furthermore, one of the prerequisites for a successful claim under the SMRDA is the establishment of the unlawfulness of the act causing the damage (see paragraphs 47-48 above). However, the domestic courts dismissed the appeals by the second and the fourth applicants against the travel bans, finding them lawful under national law (see paragraphs 35 and 37 above).
