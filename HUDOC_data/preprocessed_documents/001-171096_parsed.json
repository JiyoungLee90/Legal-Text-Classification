The Court of Appeal has established as fact that [its own] Advocate General has made several unsuccessful attempts to have the suspect \u2013 who is detained in Norway \u2013 transferred to the Netherlands so that he can exercise his right to attend the hearing in person. This finding implies that the Court of Appeal has considered the question whether it was possible for the suspect to be placed at its disposal for the purposes of the appeal but has answered it in the negative. Moreover, it does not appear likely that the applicant will return to the Netherlands shortly after the end of the criminal proceedings in Norway and will be able to appear at a further hearing. Contrary to what is argued by the drafter of the ground of appeal, the Court of Appeal therefore sufficiently examined the possibilities of mutual legal assistance. The fact that the Court of Appeal did not react in so many words to counsel\u2019s suggestion that the outcome of the Norwegian criminal proceedings should be awaited does not change this. After all, in refusing to order an adjournment the Court of Appeal is not bound to answer every detail of the argument explicitly.

In particular, where an appellate court has to examine a case as to the facts and the law and make a full assessment of the issue of guilt or innocence, it cannot determine the issue without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused for the purpose of proving that he did not commit the act allegedly constituting a criminal offence (see Hermi v.

That turned out to be impossible. By that time it had, however, been possible for the applicant\u2019s Dutch lawyer to make contact with his client.

He was the one who, because of his very conduct, was arrested in Norway. Not by chance or because of something he could not have expected, but because he was caught red-handed handling illegal drugs. He got involved in that business at a time that he was fully aware that three weeks later his presence would be required by the Court of Appeal for a rehearing of his case in Amsterdam. The Court of Appeal nonetheless adjourned it again, to see if there was any chance that he might turn up. When that proved impossible they pressed ahead with the case, acknowledging that the main rule was that the applicant should be able to be present at the hearing, but also reflecting that this was not an absolute right and that there came a time when it was necessary to weigh other interests in the balance. The Court of Appeal also took into account the fact that the applicant had been present at the beginning of the trial, had named the witnesses he wanted to have examined, and had been in contact with his Dutch lawyer.",
