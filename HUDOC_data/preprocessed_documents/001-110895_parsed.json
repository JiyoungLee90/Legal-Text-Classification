To this end, Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention affords the national authorities, primarily the courts, the opportunity to prevent or put right alleged violations of the Convention before those allegations are submitted to the Court. However, the only remedies to be exhausted are those which are effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. In particular, the remedies must be capable of providing redress in respect of applicants\u2019 complaints and of offering reasonable prospects of success (see Scoppola v.

In several other cases the Court has also found that prosecutors\u2019 refusals to start criminal investigations into similar complaints could be further appealed to the courts under the procedure envisaged by Article 236-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which in principle fulfilled the requirements of a remedy that it is necessary to exhaust under Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see Yakovenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71; Koktysh v.

The Court\u2019s findings were mainly based on the argument that under the latter procedure the domestic courts had the power to examine all relevant evidence, to overturn a prosecutor\u2019s decision and to initiate investigations. Therefore, the applicants\u2019 complaints of ill-treatment and ineffective investigation were rejected for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies, as they had failed to raise them before the courts (see Yakovenko, cited above, \u00a7 73; Koktysh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082; and Naydyon, cited above).",
