One particularly welcome outcome of these measures is the reduction of the country\u2019s prison population. At the time of the 2007 visit, the total number of prisoners stood at 8,033 (including 1,290 on remand), compared to 10,591 in 2004. This positive trend can be attributed to legislative changes in recent years, including the entry into force of a new Code of Execution of Sentences in July 2005 and the adoption of amendments to the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of conditional early releases, as well as a wider use of alternatives to imprisonment and a more selective application of remand custody by the courts.",

It finds that the applicant\u2019s first period of detention in prison no. 13 (between 26 August 2006 and 20 February 2007) is to be considered as separate from his second detention period (which started on 6 March 2008). It is true that the applicant was detained within the framework of the same criminal proceedings during both periods of his detention. Nonetheless, in view of the significant gap \u2013 in excess of a year \u2013 between the two periods of detention with which the complaints are concerned the Court cannot treat them as a part of a continuing situation as described above, even if the other conditions are met (see Haritonov v. Moldova, no. 15868/07, \u00a7 26, 5 July 2011). The applicant lodged his complaint on 29 October 2009 and there is nothing to suggest that he was in any way prevented by the authorities from complaining before that date. Consequently, in so far as it refers to his first period of detention, the applicant\u2019s complaint has been lodged more than six months after the alleged breach took place and must be declared inadmissible under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",
