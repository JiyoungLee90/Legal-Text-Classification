Likewise, section 71(1) of the same Act provides that the Constitutional Court examines only violations of the constitutional rights alleged in the constitutional complaint (see paragraph 27 above). It is evident that the applicant in his constitutional complaint did not rely on Article 7 of the Convention. Nor did he rely on Article 31 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, which is the provision that arguably corresponds to Article 7 of the Convention. Instead, he referred principally to Article 14 paragraph 2, Article 26 and Article 29 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, which are the provisions that largely correspond to Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 and Article 14 of the Convention (see paragraphs 24 and 26 above).",

If he had been obliged to do so, he should and would have been stopped by Croatian customs officials at the border crossing when entering Croatia and instructed either to pay those taxes or to return to the Czech Republic. Therefore, his failure to pay the customs debt for the alleged importation of his car had not been in breach of customs regulations and thus could not constitute an offence. Yet, he had been convicted of the customs-related administrative offence specified in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act (see paragraphs 22-23 and 29 above). That was so only because the domestic authorities had misinterpreted the term \u201cpersons resident\u201d in the Istanbul Convention as \u201cpersons having domicile\u201d, which had a different meaning in the domestic legislation. He explained that the Istanbul Convention, in its official text, did not refer to \u201cdomicile\u201d but to \u201cliving\u201d abroad and that the meaning given to certain legal terms in domestic legislation could not be relied on in interpreting the same or similar terms used in international agreements. Therefore, the fact that while living in Prague he could have, in the eyes of Croatian authorities, retained his domicile in Croatia was not relevant.

Given that at the time of the commission of the offence, that is, when the applicant had entered Croatia in his car with foreign licence plates without paying the relevant taxes, he had been a Croatian citizen and had his domicile in Croatia (see paragraph 6 above), he had not satisfied the conditions for temporary admission set forth in Article\u00a05 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention.

In fact, the Government argued, the applicant had never had the intention of de-registering his domicile. Rather, his real intention had been to continue living in Croatia, where he had accommodation and where his family lived, and to go only occasionally to the Czech Republic. He had de-registered his domicile in Croatia only to avoid paying the customs debt and escape liability for it.

The first criterion is of relative weight and serves only as a starting-point. If domestic law classifies an offence as criminal, then this will be decisive.

This follows from the fact that the fine imposed on the applicant was based on section 241(1) of the Customs Act (see\u00a0paragraph 29 above) and not on provisions of the Criminal Code; that such a fine is not entered in a person\u2019s criminal record; and that its amount does not depend on income, as in criminal law. However, since the classification of the offence under the domestic law is of relative value only, the Court must further examine the offence in question in the light of the second and third criteria mentioned above (see the preceding paragraph).",

What is more, the fine imposed on the applicant was punitive in nature as it was not intended to serve as pecuniary compensation for unpaid customs duties but as a penalty to deter reoffending. The Court finds these elements sufficient for a conclusion that the purported customs-related administrative offence was of a criminal character and thus attracted the guarantees of Article 7 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nadtochiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22, and Jussila, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

In such cases, a failure to comply with the domestic legislation could in itself entail a violation of the Convention. Accordingly, in such circumstances the Court had to have jurisdiction to decide whether the relevant provision of criminal law had been complied with as its application to an act not covered by that provision would directly result in a conflict with Article 7 of the Convention. In the Court\u2019s view, to accord it a lesser power of review would render Article 7 devoid of purpose.

This inconsistency in translation indeed makes the meaning of the term in question ambiguous as it could mean either domicile or residence, it being understood that those terms legally do not have the same meaning not only under Croatian law (see\u00a0paragraphs 31-32 above) but also in a number of countries (see the relevant Council of Europe instrument in paragraph 60 above). This ambiguity is further compounded by the fact that, from a strictly linguistic point of view, the more accurate translation into Croatian of the English term \u201cpersons resident\u201d or the French term \u201cpersonnes r\u00e9sidant\u201d appearing in the original versions of the Istanbul Convention is \u201cosobe s boravi\u0161tem\u201d (\u201cpersons having residence\u201d) rather than \u201cosobe s prebivali\u0161tem\u201d (\u201cpersons having domicile\u201d). Croatian versions or translations of international or European law instruments that refer to the same or similar terms do not provide any assistance in this matter (see paragraphs 59 and 61 above). Therefore, in the Court\u2019s view, the wording of the relevant provision, and particularly its official translation into Croatian, gives rise to uncertainty and ambiguity as to who may benefit from the exemption, more specifically whether the decisive element is domicile or residence.",

That is so because an inconsistent case-law lacks the required precision to avoid all risk of arbitrariness and enable individuals to foresee the consequences of their actions (see paragraph 93 above).",

In an even more specific context of taxation, under the same Article, the Court has also held that the lack of the required clarity and precision of the domestic law, offering divergent interpretations on an important fiscal issue, upset the requirement of the \u201cquality of law\u201d under the Convention and did not provide adequate protection against arbitrary interference by the public authorities with property rights (see Shchokin v.

As a result thereof, the applicant was, even with informed legal advice, unable to distinguish between permissible and prohibited behaviour and thus unable to foresee, with the degree of certainty required by Article 7 of the Convention, that entering Croatia in his car, while arguably having a habitual residence in the Czech Republic, would constitute an offence (see paragraphs 93 and 104-105 above). By the same token, the room left to those authorities for the interpretation and application of Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention was too wide to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 93 above).",
