Insofar as the Government\u2019s argument has been substantiated, the Court has found no indication that any claims similar to that of the applicant have been dismissed at the domestic level on account of lacking legal basis (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2007II, with further references). The Court therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s claim was, at least on arguable grounds, recognised under domestic law and the Government\u2019s preliminary objection must be dismissed.
