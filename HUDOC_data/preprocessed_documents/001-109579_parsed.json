The report stated that voting rights for Greek nationals living abroad arose out of both Article 108 and Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution. It pointed out in particular that Article 108 \u201caffords Greek expatriates a \u2018social right\u2019. This provision obliges the Greek State to take all necessary measures to maintain Greek expatriates\u2019 ties with Greece, to ensure that they have access to Greek education and to make provision, as a matter of State duty, for the social and professional advancement of Greeks working outside . Regulating the conditions for the exercise by Greek expatriates of their right to vote in Greek parliamentary elections will undeniably contribute to real ties being forged between Greek expatriates and their homeland.\u201d Moving on to the constitutional provision on this specific subject, namely Article 51 \u00a7 4, the report characterised the statute to which that Article referred as a law implementing the Constitution. Lastly, the report considered that \u201cin these times of globalisation, it is self-evident that Greek expatriates should have a decisive say in the development of their own country\u201d.",

It comprises ten members, including professors of law, political science, economics, statistics and information technology, and an expert in international relations. It produced a report dated 31 March 2009 on the above-mentioned bill. The report noted that, in the past, some legal authorities had argued that Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution imposed upon the legislature an obligation to permit expatriate Greeks to exercise the right to vote from outside . However, referring to other legal authorities and to the preparatory work for Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution, it asserted that it was an option rather than a duty for the legislature to permit the exercise of voting rights from abroad. It also took the view that the optional nature of the above-mentioned provision of the Constitution had not been affected by the 2001 constitutional revision.",

In particular, they stressed that Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution, far from imposing any obligation on the legislature, was optional in nature. Moreover, the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 recognised that Contracting States had a wide margin of appreciation when it came to organising their electoral systems. The Government added that, in accordance with Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution, voting arrangements for Greek nationals outside Greece had to be adopted by a majority of two-thirds of Parliament; this confirmed the need to secure very broad political consensus on the subject in Greece. Furthermore, it had already attempted to pass a law in 2009 on voting rights for Greek expatriates, a fact which demonstrated the political will to find a solution to the problem. In the Government\u2019s view, defining these arrangements was an extremely complex and delicate political issue. Blanket recognition of the right of expatriates to vote in parliamentary elections from their place of residence could give rise to considerable political and economic problems, not just in  but also in other member States of the Council of Europe.",

The Government also reiterated the reasons for requiring an enhanced two-thirds majority for enactment of the implementing legislation referred to in Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution, namely the need for political consensus in view of the considerable numbers of Greek citizens living abroad (some 3,700,000 persons compared with a population of 11,000,000 living in Greece).

This quotation reflected a notion of the status of citizen that primarily viewed residence on a territory as the decisive criterion but took objective account of the fact that it was not absolutely necessary for individuals to reside on the territory of a State in order for them to feel that they had vital links with that State. There was an increasing realisation that \u201cit [was] possible to live at home and far from home\u201d. This transnational approach to citizenship rendered obsolete a debate on voting rights for expatriates based solely on a territorial understanding of citizenship. The fact that electoral campaigns were now conducted principally via computer-based social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) proved that the argument of \u201cdistance\u201d between the expatriate and his or her country of origin was no longer as relevant as it had been a few years previously.",

The League observed that in most member States of the European Union which provided for electoral rights for expatriates, the usual precondition was registration on the electoral roll of the State concerned at the embassy or consulate located in the region in question. Accordingly, the only objectively reliable criterion for the granting or otherwise of \u201ca postal vote or other appropriate means\u201d would appear to be whether or not electoral rolls existed at the overseas consulate.

This Article would appear at first to differ from the other provisions of the Convention and its Protocols, as it is phrased in terms of the obligation of the High Contracting Parties to hold elections under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people rather than in terms of a particular right or freedom. However, having regard to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and the interpretation of the provision in the context of the Convention as a whole, the Court has held that it also implies individual rights, including the right to vote and the right to stand for election (ibid., \u00a7 51). It has also held that the standards to be applied for establishing compliance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 must be considered to be less stringent than those applied under Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention (see \u017ddanoka v.

Nevertheless, it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions to which the right to vote and the right to stand for election are made subject do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they meet the requirements of lawfulness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see T\u0103nase v.

For the purposes of applying Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, any electoral legislation must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, so that features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may be justified in the context of another, at least so long as the chosen system provides for conditions which will ensure the \u201cfree expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u201d (see Yumak and Sadak v.

Accordingly, the complaint does not concern the recognition of expatriates\u2019 right to vote as such, the principle of which is already recognised by Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Greek Constitution in conjunction with Article 4 of Presidential Decree no. 96/2007, but rather the conditions governing the exercise of that right. Like the Chamber, the Grand Chamber is therefore of the view that its task consists in examining whether, despite the failure to enact legislation on the conditions for exercising the right to vote, the Greek electoral system, in the instant case, nevertheless permitted \u201cthe free expression of the opinion of the people\u201d and preserved \u201cthe very essence of the ... right to vote\u201d, as required by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, \u00a7\u00a065, ECHR 1999I).

The question is, however, whether Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 goes so far as to require them to be taken. In answering that question, Article 3 should be interpreted with reference to the relevant international and comparative law (see Yumak and Sadak, cited above, \u00a7 127, and Demir and Baykara v.

Hence, Resolution 1459 (2005) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see paragraph 21 above) states that member States should take appropriate measures to facilitate the exercise of voting rights to the fullest extent possible, in particular by means of postal voting. Furthermore, in Recommendation 1714 (2005), the Parliamentary Assembly invited the Council of Europe to develop its activities aimed at improving the conditions for the effective exercise of election rights by groups facing special difficulties, including expatriates. The Venice Commission, for its part, observed that since the 1980s the recognition of external voting rights had gained ground in Europe. While it also recommended that member States facilitate the exercise of expatriates\u2019 voting rights, it did not consider that they were obliged to do so. Rather, it viewed such a move as a possibility to be considered by the legislature in each country, which had to balance the principle of universal suffrage on the one hand against the need for security of the ballot and considerations of a practical nature on the other (see, in particular, paragraph 25 above).",

However, as regards those States which do allow voting from abroad, closer examination reveals that the arrangements for the exercise of expatriates\u2019 voting rights are not uniform, but take a variety of forms. By way of example, some countries allow voting in polling stations set up abroad, and/or postal voting, proxy voting and e-voting (see paragraph 34 above). The length of residence abroad is another factor taken into consideration by member States. Some grant voting rights only to nationals temporarily resident outside the country, while in others expatriates lose the right to vote after a certain period of time (see paragraph\u00a035 above). Furthermore, some Contracting States make provision for expatriates to elect their own representatives to the national parliament, in electoral constituencies set up outside the country (see paragraph 37 above). Lastly, in the majority of member States which allow voting from abroad, persons wishing to avail themselves of this facility must register by a certain deadline on the electoral roll with the authorities in their country of origin or the diplomatic or consular authorities abroad (see paragraphs\u00a03945 above).",

The Scientific Council of Parliament, for its part, stated, in its report of 31 March 2009 on the bill concerning the exercise of the right to vote in parliamentary elections by Greek voters living abroad, that permitting the exercise of the right to vote from abroad was an option rather than a duty for the legislature, while stressing that legal opinion was not unanimous on the subject (see paragraph 19 above). In conclusion, it would appear that while Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution allows the legislature to give effect to the exercise of voting rights for expatriate Greeks from their place of residence, it does not oblige it to do so. Accordingly, and having regard to the considerations outlined above (see paragraph 75), the Court is of the view that it is not its task to indicate to the national authorities at what time and in what manner they should give effect to Article 51 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution.",
