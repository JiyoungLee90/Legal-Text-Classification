By means of criminal law, society endeavoured to safeguard its very foundations as well as the rights and interests essential for the life of the community.

After an initial period of hesitation, the Convention institutions rightly went beyond the formal concepts of \"civil rights\" and \"criminal charges\", opting instead for a more substantive approach.  At the same time, they increasingly inclined towards autonomous interpretation of these concepts.  It goes without saying that autonomous interpretation is the method best suited to multilateral conventions, and particularly rule-making instruments, such as the European Convention on Human Rights.  Nonetheless, reliance on this method of interpretation raises problems of legal hermeneutics which are far more complex than one might at first suppose.  These problems above all concern the \"value\" which should be attributed to the law of the State in question and to the legal systems of the other Contracting Parties in the endeavour to arrive - having regard to the object and purpose of the Convention - at a common understanding underlying the concepts contained in the text.

However, a careful examination of comparative law data would show that there does not nowadays exist a \"common denominator\" in the sense contemplated by the judgment: in the law of the Federal Republic of Germany - the State concerned - \"regulatory\" offences (Ordnungswidrigkeiten) clearly lie outside the realm of criminal law; the same is true of Austrian law (Verwaltungsstraftaten); and French law, Netherlands law (and possibly the legal systems of other European countries) are preparing to move in the same direction.  In my view, autonomous interpretation would call for comparative studies of a far more detailed nature than those carried out so far by the Convention institutions (I referred briefly to the methodological problem of autonomous interpretation in my separate opinion on the K\u00f6nig judgment, Series A no. 22, p. 46; see also Schlosser in Praxis des Internationalen Privat- und Verfahrensrechts 1981, p. 154 f.).

Here, we are primarily concerned only with the removal of an offence from the criminal sphere and its reclassification in another area of law, in this case administrative law.  In this sense, decriminalisation corresponds to a very widespread trend in European legal systems and one which the Council of Europe is itself encouraging.  This is not the place to describe this phenomenon fully, nor is such explanation needed to justify this dissenting opinion.  I shall merely point out that decriminalisation is something very different from a mere switch of labels.  Social changes and new attitudes, as well as technical and economic circumstances, are leading States to reassess the elements which go to make up criminal offences; thus certain comparatively minor offences, which are nowadays very common, have been removed from the criminal sphere and classified as \"regulatory\" offences.  This has important consequences which oblige us, in my view, to conclude that the nature of the offence itself has changed.  The moral verdict is no longer the same, in other words, a \"regulatory\" offence no longer carries the blame which attaches to a crime; the court's decision is not entered in a criminal record; nor do \"regulatory\" offences carry a more severe penalty in the event of recidivism, this being another feature of criminal law; investigatory measures are also limited - there may, for example, be none of those restrictions on the person's liberty which apply in criminal proceedings (neither police custody, nor detention on remand, nor the interception of communications may be ordered). The sanctions, too, are fundamentally different.  There is no imprisonment.  Chief among the possible sanctions are a warning (Verwarnung), an admonitory fine (Verwarnungsgeld) and an administrative fine (Geldbusse).  The last-named sanction also differs from the criminal fine (Geldstrafe) in so far as the person concerned, if he can prove his inability to pay, is neither obliged to do so nor imprisoned instead.  In the case of road traffic offences, a driving licence may also be suspended or withdrawn, a measure which can, but does not necessarily, constitute a sanction.  A further aspect should not be forgotten: while the limitation period for criminal offences ranges from 3 years to 30, it never exceeds 3 years for \"regulatory\" offences; in practice, it ranges from 6 months to 3 years; in the present case, which concerned a road traffic offence, it was 6 months (essentially along the same lines, see Vogler's well-documented study in Europ\u00e4ische Grundrechte-Zeitschrift 1979, p. 645 ff.).

Moreover, the subsidiary application by analogy of certain procedural rules (in this instance, as the judgment emphasises, the application of the rules of criminal procedure to \"regulatory\" offences) is not sufficient in itself to justify conclusions as to the legal nature of a given issue; many examples from comparative law could be cited in support of this.  These links are therefore not such as to erase the basic differences which exist in German law between \"regulatory\" and criminal offences.  It follows that, by reason of their nature, \"regulatory\" offences in general and traffic offences in particular - the latter being the only ones at issue in the present case - should not be regarded as criminal within the meaning of the Convention.

In the present case of a minor driving offence, the applicant faced an administrative fine of - in theory - up to DM 1,000.  In fact, he was fined DM 60 and it is highly unlikely that, in deciding his objection, the District Court could have fined him more than DM 200.

For good reasons the Court has in many cases accepted and practised an evolutive interpretation of the Convention, taking into account developments in society and in public opinion.  In the Dudgeon case, the Court held that certain sexual behaviour, formerly punishable under the criminal law in all States, should no longer be treated as criminal and punishable in a given social environment.  Social developments and evolving considerations of public policy must be taken into account also in other fields of similar relevance.  The Court and the Commission must take due notice of such developments. ",

My answer is in the affirmative.  The reasons for removing some minor offences from the field of criminal law, and for providing special sanctions and procedures for them, can hardly be considered unfounded or disguised.  And can it really be said that the object and purpose of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention require the same guarantees (including the free assistance of an interpreter) for small traffic offences and similar petty offences, guarantees which are absolutely necessary in genuine criminal cases?  I do not think so. ",
