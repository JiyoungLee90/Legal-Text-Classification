I placed the explosive device, lit the fuse with a lighter, and immediately ran home ... R.S. gave me this explosive ... F.R. was with me all the time ... he was also with me when R.S. gave me the anti-tank device ... I would like to underline that it was a slow-burning fuse which was six to seven metres long; it took a long time to burn and to detonate the device ... I would also like to note that F.R. knew that I was going to place this anti-tank device in B.P. police station. I told him that after we had obtained the device from R.S ... F.R and I agreed to a proposal by R.S. (that we place the device in front of a police station) and went towards Skopje by taxi ... I borrowed an old car from neighbour B., telling him that I wanted to drive around. He lent me the car, which was not registered, and I (with F.R.) took the device and placed it on the floor behind the driver\u2019s seat ... At 11.15 p.m. I left home and walked to this car; I took the anti-tank device ... and carried it as far as the B.P. police station, as I have described above, and then I detonated (the device). Some time after 10 pm. F.R. had called me to arrange to go and set up the device. Indeed, F.R. arrived ... and we both went to the car; we took the device together and we walked towards the B.P. police station. I was carrying the bag with the device. When I went into the police station F.R. left the scene: I do not know where he went. I went to the back of the police station and placed the device. Regarding weapons found in my house on the occasion of a search carried out by the police on 16\u00a0August 2005, I had in my possession a semi-automatic weapon with nine bullets; I do not know anything about the ten explosive items, the fuse or the detonator. I had stolen the semi-automatic weapon and the bullets... five days before the explosion in the B.P. police station... I was not carrying the weapon when I placed the device, and the phone that I had in my possession was switched off.\u201d",

When they abducted me, there were fourteen or fifteen of them ... In the forest there was a change of driver, and they hooded me and drove me far away in a different direction. We arrived in a house, where they unhooded me; it was a luxurious house. I was told to sit on a chair; uniformed people wearing masks and others in plain clothes arrived. They asked me if I knew why I had been brought there, to which I replied that I had not done anything wrong. They started insulting me ... four people started beating me with plastic bottles and a rubber tube. I stayed in the house for three days. During that time, while my hands and legs were handcuffed, I was held under water in a swimming pool. A big man was trying to force me to confess about the police station, to which I replied \u2018to confess what about the police station?\u2019. When they took me out of the pool, other people continued beating me. They ordered me to admit that I had placed the bomb in the B.P. police station. I told them that I had not done that ... they also brought a dog into the house. The dog did nothing to me. They held me under water in the pool three or four more times ... I believe that we were in Veles ... The same uniformed men, who wore masks, brought me [near the department store in Skopje, see paragraph 11 above] and told me to go home. There were other people around. I was wet and could not walk. Men in plain clothes without uniforms or masks handcuffed me and took me to K. police station. They slapped me twice and started interrogating me about the bomb in B.P. police station. I told them that I knew nothing ... They asked me if I knew R.S. and F.R., and I said that I did not know them. I stayed in K. police station from 15 August to the night of 16 August, when they brought me before the investigating judge. I note that while I was in the house in Veles I was given a blank paper which I had to sign because they had beaten me. In Veles I think I signed three blank papers and I\u2019m sure that I saw those papers in the police station changing hands between police officers. The investigating judge also showed them to me. When the judge had them they were no longer blank, but I don\u2019t remember what was written on them.

In his testimony of 19 August 2005 the applicant had made no comment as regards his alleged abduction on 12\u00a0August 2005 and interrogation in Veles. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s argument that he had been scared and confused when he had given his confession statement on 16\u00a0August 2005, the court record of his questioning of that date suggested no disorder or lack of capacity for rational perception.

The police also do not inform the suspects about their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer before they are interviewed.

There are more frequent cases of incommunicado detention of persons, namely arrest of persons and their detention at unknown locations, without their families or a lawyer being informed. The contested practice of scant police files concerning treatment with suspects became absurd, [namely there is] a complete absence of any record of persons who are arrested and held by the police. The absence of an adequate registration of detention in a police station generates other violations and impossibility to prove the overstepping by the police of their authority, especially regarding torture and inhuman treatment during arrest and [the suspects\u2019] detention in police station ...",

The prosecuting authorities took no investigative measure and did not contact the Ministry of the Interior to obtain additional information, a step which is routinely taken in similar circumstances (see Ja\u0161ar v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 69908/01, \u00a7 21, 15 February 2007; Sulejmanov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 69875/01, \u00a7\u00a028, 24\u00a0April 2008; D\u017eeladinov and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 13252/02, \u00a7 40, 10 April 2008; Trajkoski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 13191/02, \u00a7 15, 7\u00a0February\u00a02008; and El Masri, cited above, \u00a7 187). That a considerable time elapsed between the date of the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment and his submitting a criminal complaint on 7\u00a0March 2007 is not a determining factor for the applicant\u2019s complaint under this head, since in any event victims of alleged violations of their rights under Article 3 of the Convention are not required to pursue the prosecution of State agents on their own.

Nor did the applicant describe how he was kept and fed. Furthermore, his testimony of that date was inconsistent with the statements made by the applicant\u2019s mother and father in the pre-trial proceedings (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above).

In this connection the Court underlines the \u201cstriking similarity\u201d which the CPT noted in its 2004 Report (see paragraph 57 above) between two cases of alleged abduction, incommunicado detention and illtreatment by the police. The Court notes that the methods employed for the applicant\u2019s alleged abduction (that it was carried out by men wearing masks; that hoods were used; that he was placed in a car and transported to a house) were similar with those used in the two cases discussed in 2004 CPT Report, as well as regarding F.R., the co-defendant in the applicant\u2019s case, who was allegedly abducted on 14 August 2005 (see paragraph 58 above). Allegations of deprivation of liberty of a person in an extraordinary place of detention outside any judicial framework were found, admittedly under different circumstances, convincing and established beyond reasonable doubt by the Court in the El-Masri case (see, El-Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 167 and 236).",

In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which came into force on 26 June 1987, which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (Article 1 of the United Nations Convention) (see \u0130lhan v.
