Therefore, in the present case the Court\u2019s task consists of examining whether the domestic authorities took all necessary steps that could reasonably be demanded in the specific circumstances to facilitate contact between the applicant and her child. The Court finds it important to reiterate that while its case-law requires children\u2019s views to be taken into account, those views are not necessarily immutable and their objections, which must be given due weight, are not necessarily sufficient to override the parents\u2019 interests, especially in having regular contact with their child. The right of a child to express his or her own views should not be interpreted as effectively giving an unconditional veto power to children without any other factors being considered and an examination being carried out to determine their best interests; such interests normally dictate that the child\u2019s ties with its family must be maintained, except in cases where this would harm the child\u2019s health and development (ibid. \u00a7 142-143 and Raw and Others v.

Croatia, cited above, \u00a7 142). Lastly, the Court reiterates that the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the child lives and that, even if it is possible that more severe sanctions would not have changed the custodial parent\u2019s general stance towards the non-custodial parent\u2019s contact rights, this did not exempt the domestic authorities from their obligation to undertake all appropriate steps to facilitate contact (see Kuppinger v.\u00a0Germany, no. 62198/11, \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 107, 15 January 2015).",
