The weight of [the CSM] (under the system which is currently proposed, its Prosecutors\u2019 Section) is also considerably weakened, taken into account the increased power of the Minister of Justice and the limited scope of the influence that it may have on the President\u2019s position (only on legality issues).",

In that context, the Court had stressed that the Minister of Justice plays a central role in the appointment of chief prosecutors. By contrast, in an earlier decision of 2005, the Court had ruled that the role of the President in the appointment procedure of prosecutors could not be purely formal.

The Constitutional Court has the authority to interpret the Constitution in a binding manner and it is not up to the Venice Commission to contest its interpretation of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court based its decision on Article 132 (1) of the Constitution (\u201cPublic prosecutors shall carry out their activity in accordance with the principle of legality, impartiality and hierarchical control, under the authority of the Minister of Justice\u201d), in relation to Article 94 (c) of the Constitution, stating that the President has, inter\u00a0alia, \u201cto make appointments to public offices, under the terms provided by law\u201d. To strengthen the independence of the prosecution service and individual prosecutors, one key measure would therefore be to revise, in the context of a future revision of the Romanian Constitution, the provisions of Article 132 (1) of the Romanian Constitution. At the legislative level, it could be considered, as far as dismissal is concerned, to amend Law no. 303 in such a way as to give to the opinion of the [CSM] a binding force.\u201d",

Pursuant to these provisions the Constitutional Court ruled only over disputes involving public authorities. Therefore, in the current case the Constitutional Court had not examined the merits of the case against the applicant, considering that such an analysis would not have fallen within its jurisdiction (see paragraph\u00a063 above). Hence no civil rights had been addressed in the said proceedings. Accordingly, those proceedings could not be examined from the standpoint of Article 6 of the Convention.

Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest.

For instance, in Suk\u00fct v.\u00a0Turkey ((dec.), no. 59773/00, 11 September 2007), which concerned the early retirement of an army officer on disciplinary grounds, Turkish constitutional law clearly specified that the decisions of the Supreme Military Council were not subject to judicial review. The same was true for the decisions of the Turkish Supreme Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors (see Serdal Apay v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a03964/05, 11\u00a0December 2007, and Nazsiz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 22412/05, 26\u00a0May 2009, concerning respectively the appointment and the disciplinary dismissal of public prosecutors; see also \u00d6zp\u0131nar v. Turkey, no.\u00a020999/04, \u00a7\u00a030, 19 October 2010, concerning the removal from office of a judge on disciplinary grounds). In Nedeltcho Popov v. Bulgaria (no. 61360/00, \u00a7\u00a038, 22\u00a0November 2007) a provision of the Bulgarian Labour Code clearly provided that the domestic courts did not have jurisdiction to review disputes regarding dismissals from certain posts in the Council of Ministers, including the post held by the applicant (chief adviser). Although that restriction was later declared unconstitutional with no retroactive effect, the Court noted that \u201cat the time of the applicant\u2019s dismissal\u201d he had not had a right of access to a court under national law to bring an action for unfair dismissal.",

Hence, even assuming that access to court in the applicant\u2019s situation was expressly excluded by national law, applying the Eskelinen test further, the Court considers that the second condition \u2013 consisting of the existence of an objective justification for this exclusion in the State\u2019s interest \u2013 was also not fulfilled in the current case. In a legal framework where the removal from office of the chief prosecutor of the DNA was decided on by the President following a proposal by the Minister of Justice with the endorsement of the CSM, the absence of any judicial control of the legality of the decision of removal cannot be in the interest of the State. Senior members of the judiciary should enjoy \u2013 as other citizens \u2013 protection from arbitrariness from the executive power and only oversight by an independent judicial body of the legality of such a removal decision is able to render such a right effective. The Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling concerning the respective competencies of the constitutional bodies does not deprive these considerations of their pertinence.",

In their report on the status and role of prosecutors, the UNODC cited and confirmed this standard set out in the Guidelines. Also, the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers stressed that \u201cthe dismissal of prosecutors should be subject to strict requirements, which should not undermine the independent and impartial performance of their activities\u201d. As a consequence, prosecutors \u201cshould in any case have the right to challenge \u2013 including in court \u2013 all decisions concerning their career, including those resulting from disciplinary proceedings\u201d. The InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights held that, there should be a possible review of a prosecutor\u2019s dismissal decision by a higher body, which would examine the facts of the case and the law, and ensure \u201ca suitable and effective judicial recourse against possible violations of rights that [had] happened during the disciplinary process\u201d. The Commission also highlighted the importance of the right to a review in cases where dismissal \u201cmay be an implied sanction\u201d, constituting a \u201cmisuse of power to punish a justice operator for some action or decision he or she [had taken]\u201d.",

The principle of independence of the prosecution encompassed a number of components of which first and foremost was that the office of prosecutors had to be strictly separated from judicial functions, but also independent from any other State authority and thus willing to investigate and prosecute suspected crimes committed by persons acting in an official capacity. States had to ensure that prosecutors were able to perform their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment, improper interference or unjustified exposure to civil, penal or other liability. Prosecutors were entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly. According to Guideline 8 prosecutors had \u201cthe right to take part in public discussion of matters concerning the law, the administration of justice and the promotion and protection of human rights\u201d (see paragraph 92 above).

They noted that significant standards had also been developed within the system of the Council of Europe. Particularly worth mentioning here was the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers (2000)19 on the role of public prosecution in the criminal-justice system (see paragraph 90 above). The Recommendation did not advise against making the prosecution service subordinate to government. However, governmental powers should be exercised in a transparent way and in accordance with the law. Any instructions to prosecutors should have written form and be issued with adequate guarantees. Moreover, instructions not to prosecute in specific cases should not as a principle be allowed.",

In this context, the Court considers that no evidence has been brought to show that the impugned measure served the aim of protecting the rule of law or any other legitimate aim. The measure was a consequence of the previous exercise of the right to freedom of expression by the applicant, who was the highest anticorruption officeholder in the judiciary.

Russia, no. 29492/05, \u00a7 86, 26\u00a0February 2009; and Di Giovanni v. Italy, no. 51160/06, \u00a7 71, 9 July 2013). The duty of loyalty and discretion owed by the judiciary requires that the dissemination of even accurate information must be carried out with moderation and propriety (see Kudeshkina, cited above, \u00a7 93). The Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a lawgoverned State, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties (see ibid., \u00a7 86, and Morice v. France [GC], no.\u00a029369/10, \u00a7 128, ECHR 2015). At the same time the Court has also stressed that questions concerning the functioning of the justice system fall within the public interest, the debate of which generally enjoys a high degree of protection under Article 10 (see Kudeshkina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a086, and Morice, cited above, \u00a7 128). Even if an issue under debate has political implications, that is not in itself sufficient to prevent, for example, a judge from making a statement on the matter (see Wille, cited above, \u00a7 67). In a democratic system, the acts or omissions of government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislature and the judiciary but also of the media and public opinion. Issues relating to the separation of powers can involve very important matters in a democratic society, which the public has a legitimate interest in being informed about and which fall within the scope of political debate (see, mutatis mutandis, Guja, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74 and\u00a088).",

It observes in this regard that the applicant expressed her views on the legislative reforms at issue in her professional capacity as chief prosecutor of the DNA. The applicant also used her legal power to start investigations into suspicions of corruption crimes committed by members of the Government in connection with highly disputed pieces of legislation and to inform the public about these investigations (see paragraphs 12, 13 and 24 above). She also availed herself of the possibility to express her opinion directly in the media or during professional gatherings (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above).",

It refers in this connection to recommendation (REC(2000)19 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which recognises that prosecutors should have the right to take part in public discussions on matters concerning the law, the administration of justice and the promotion and protection of human rights, and they should be in a position to prosecute without obstruction public officials for offences committed by them, particularly corruption (see paragraph 90 above).",

Her statements did not go beyond mere criticism from a strictly professional perspective. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s position and statements, which clearly fell within the context of a debate on matters of great public interest, called for a high degree of protection for her freedom of expression and strict scrutiny of any interference, with a correspondingly narrow margin of appreciation being afforded to the authorities of the respondent State.",

Although the applicant remained on as a prosecutor, she was ultimately removed from her position as chief prosecutor on 9 July 2018 (see paragraph 67 above) before the end of her mandate. This removal and the reasons justifying it can hardly be reconciled with the particular consideration to be given to the nature of the judicial function as an independent branch of State power and to the principle of the independence of prosecutors, which \u2013 according to Council of Europe and other international instruments \u2013 is a key element for the maintenance of judicial independence (see paragraphs 90-93 above).
