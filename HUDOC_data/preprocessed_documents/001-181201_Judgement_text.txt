The case originated in an application (no. 58593/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hasan Mağın (“the applicant”), on 19 October 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr N. Yıldırım, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 20 February 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
On 12 October 2016 the Vice-President of the Second Section invited the Government to submit further observations, if they wish, in the light of the judgment in Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, ECHR 2016)
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it (see Yivli v. Turkey, no. 12723/11, 14 November 2017).
The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Istanbul.
On 16 June 1999 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of belonging to an illegal organisation, namely Hizbullah.
On 21 June 1999 the applicant’s statements were taken by the police in the absence of a lawyer. During his interrogation, he confessed being a member of the Hizbullah and gave a detailed account of his acts within the illegal organisation.
On 22 June 1999 the applicant was heard by the  public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the , again in the absence of a lawyer. In his statements before both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant denied the accusations and maintained that his statements to the police had been given under duress. On the same date, upon the order of the investigating judge, the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention.
On 30 June 1999 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed an indictment with that court, charging the applicant under Article 168 § 2 of the former Turkish Criminal Code, namely for membership of an illegal armed organisation.
On 9 November 1999 the applicant was released pending trial.
The State Security Courts were later abolished by Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, and the case was transferred to the Diyarbakır Assize Court.
On 12 June 2008, relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s statements to the police, the Diyarbakır Assize Court convicted the applicant under Article 314 § 2 of the new Turkish Criminal Code and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment. In convicting the applicant, the Assize Court further took into consideration information on computer hard disks and print-outs, which had been seized in a house belonging to the illegal organisation, as well as the statements of several witnesses who had testified against the applicant.
On 4 June 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.
A description of the relevant domestic law concerning the right of access to a lawyer may be found in Salduz v. Turkey ([GC] no. 36391/02, §§ 2731, ECHR 2008).
On 15 July 2003 Law no. 4928 repealed Section 31 of Law no. 3842, whereby the restriction on an accused’s right of access to a lawyer in proceedings before the State Security Courts was lifted.
