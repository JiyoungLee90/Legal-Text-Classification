The illtreatment/torture alleged (which was said to have occurred over a period of several days, first at Police Station No. 12 in Narimanov District of Baku, then at the Main City Police Department and finally at the Temporary Detention Centre of Narimanov District) was reportedly inflicted by several plainclothes officers, partly in the presence of senior police officials from the three establishments. It allegedly included truncheon blows on the soles of the feet (\u2018falaka\u2019), kicks, punches, verbal abuse, threats of rape and other forms of psychological pressure. Reportedly, the aim of the ill-treatment/torture was to force both men to publicly apologize for having sprayed graffiti on the monument of late President Heydar Aliyev and to bring flowers to the monument in front of TV cameras (which they had both refused).\u201d",

Based on its delegation\u2019s findings from the 2016 periodic visit, the CPT can only conclude that persons in police custody in Azerbaijan continue to run a very high risk of being ill-treated, at the time of their apprehension but mostly when being questioned by law enforcement officers. It is clear that the risk of ill-treatment is particularly high vis-\u00e0-vis persons who do not immediately confess to an offence of which they are suspected or provide other information sought by the police or officers from other law enforcement agencies, and that the ill-treatment inflicted on such persons could be of such severity as to amount to torture. There is also a clear link between the phenomenon of torture/ill-treatment and the corruption in law enforcement agencies (e.g. demanding payments in exchange for dropping or reducing charges, or even releasing persons from unrecorded custody); furthermore, the perception of impunity amongst law enforcement officials remains systemic and endemic.",

This highly regrettable state of affairs, which is clearly contrary to the Azerbaijani law and international standards, becomes even more of concern when seen in the context of the allegations of torture and other forms of ill-treatment referred to in paragraphs 19 to 26 above. ...",

To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government.

However, the records did not contain any explanation as to the origin of that redness or how it had been sustained (compare Musa Y\u0131lmaz v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 27566/06, \u00a7 49, 30 November 2010). Moreover, the Court notes the apparent discrepancies in the medical records in question as regards the timing of the applicants\u2019 admission to the temporary detention centre. Namely, according to those records, the applicants were admitted on the morning of 11 May 2016, whereas it follows from a letter from the head of the NDPO to the investigating authorities that the applicants were admitted in the middle of the night of 10 to 11 May 2016 (see paragraph 70 above for both accounts). In this context the Court deems it appropriate to refer to the observations made by the CPT during its visits to Azerbaijan concerning the \u201csuperficial\u201d nature of medical examinations carried out in the temporary detention centres and the alleged refusals of medical personnel to register injuries (see paragraph 83 above). As regards the applicants\u2019 forensic examinations, the Court notes that they were carried out with a delay of two weeks after the alleged events (see paragraph 103 below). The Court further notes that the forensic reports in question lack any detail and fall short of the standards accepted by the Court (see Ball\u0131kta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 7070/03, \u00a7 28, 20 October 2009). In particular, while both reports were worded in identical manner they did not specify the nature of the examinations and analysis carried out in order to corroborate or refute the applicants\u2019 allegations of ill-treatment and torture. The Court also observes that the forensic expert in his reports relied on the applicants\u2019 medical records of 11 May 2016 which were prepared in the temporary detention centre (see paragraph 72 above). However, in view of the above, the medical documentation produced in the temporary detention centre cannot be considered reliable and sufficient for forensic purposes. Thus, the Court finds that in the light of the existence of other credible evidence, for which the Government did not provide any explanation whatsoever, the medical documents referred to by the Government cannot serve as grounds for dismissing the applicants\u2019 allegations.",

They did not dispute the fact that the applicants were able to meet the lawyer of their own choosing only on 12 May 2016, during the hearings concerning their remand in custody. However, the Government did not explain why the applicants had been provided with State-appointed lawyers during the initial stage. On that point, the Court would again take note of the observations made by the CPT pointing to systematic delays of criminal suspects\u2019 access to lawyers until their confession had been obtained in the presence of ex officio lawyers (see paragraph 83 above). Against this background, in the absence of any explanation by the Government regarding delayed access to the lawyer of their own choosing, the Court finds that the fact that during the period in question the applicants gave self-incriminating \u201cexplanations\u201d (izahat) to police officers adds credibility to their allegations of ill-treatment.",

Notably, the applicants\u2019 forensic examinations were carried out with a delay of two weeks after the alleged events, even though their allegations of ill-treatment had been brought to the domestic authorities\u2019 attention in a prompt manner. As the Court has held on several occasions, a failure to secure forensic evidence in a timely manner is one of the most important factors in assessing the overall effectiveness of an investigation into allegations of ill\u2011treatment (see Mammadov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no.\u00a034445/04, \u00a7 74, 11 January 2007; Rizvanov v.

However, given that the applicants lodged their complaints with the authorities on 12 May 2016, that is immediately after the events in question, there is nothing which would justify the delay in examining those recordings, even within the period of seven days. Furthermore, the Court also notes the discrepancies as regards the storage of video recordings in the detention facility concerned. Namely, in the case of Mustafa Hajili v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, where, as established by the Court, the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment in the exercise yard of the same detention facility, the authorities alleged that the video recordings were automatically deleted one month later (no.\u00a042119/12, \u00a7\u00a023, 24 November 2016), whereas in the present cases that period was allegedly limited to seven days. It remains unclear from the NDPO\u2019s reply on which regulatory frameworks those storage periods are based, as they appear to vary from one case to another. Besides, the investigator in charge of the cases at hand failed to take immediate actions, such as to promptly examine the premises of the police station concerned and to collect the relevant evidence, but rather relied on formal written replies provided by the NDPO, namely the same police station whose officers and administration the applicants accused of ill-treatment. Nor did the investigating authorities consider the evidence put forward by the applicants as regards their alleged ill-treatment by the police (see paragraph 94 above).",

The personal searches of the applicants and the searches of their apartments had been carried out in the presence of attesting witnesses.

The requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. As a general rule, problems concerning the existence of a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d arise at the level of the facts. The very specific context of the present case calls for a high level of scrutiny of the facts. The Court\u2019s task is to verify whether there existed sufficient objective elements that could lead an objective observer to reasonably believe that the applicant might have committed the acts alleged by the prosecuting authorities (ibid., \u00a7 94). Besides, the Court has to have regard to all the relevant circumstances in order to be satisfied that objective information existed showing that the suspicion against the applicants was \u201creasonable\u201d. In this connection, at the outset, the Court considers it necessary to have regard to the general context of the facts of this particular case (see Rasul\u00a0Jafarov v.

First, in both cases the criminal charges and the description of the way in which the applicants had allegedly acquired and stored the drugs were the same: both applicants, while acting in organised criminal groups, had allegedly acquired large quantities of heroin from Iranian nationals, a small part of which they carried on themselves while the remaining parts they kept in their respective flats. Secondly, the investigative measures taken in both cases were identical in substance as well as in scope, to the extent that even the wording of the records and reports prepared within the investigations seem to have been copied and pasted. Thirdly, the Court cannot disregard the timing of the relevant inquiries and the measures taken against the applicants: the receipt of the operational information about the applicants\u2019 involvement in drug trafficking and their arrest took place on the same day and they were admitted to the temporary detention facility and brought before the domestic court to decide on their detention at around the same time.",

In this context, the Court observes that, as it transpires from the material in the case files, the criminal investigations against the applicants comprised two main phases: the first one consisted of the receipt of the operational information which led to the applicants\u2019 arrest, and the second one related to the investigative measures carried out following their arrest.

The operational information referred to by the police did not contain any details capable of identifying those persons. In order to verify that information and identify the suspects, the police therefore decided on the same day to conduct operational search measures, as \u201cit [was] not possible to identify the persons named \u2018Giyas\u2019 and \u2018Bayram\u2019 by other means\u201d (see paragraphs 40 and 46 above).

The operational information had merely referred to persons named \u201cGiyas\u201d and \u201cBayram\u201d living in Baku (compare Kobiashvili v. Georgia, no.\u00a036416/06, \u00a7\u00a061, 14\u00a0March 2019). In this connection the Court notes that there is a complete evidentiary void between the time when the authorities received information about certain individuals named \u201cGiyas\u201d and \u201cBayram\u201d being involved in drug trafficking and the time when the authorities approached the applicants with a view to arresting them. In particular, the Court observes that when ordering the operational measures, the officers in charge of the cases relied on \u201cthe materials [which were] collected\u201d on the basis of the operational information received. However, those materials do not appear in the case files. Nor is there anything in the domestic decisions or the Government\u2019s submissions before this Court which would suggest that those materials were classified by the relevant authorities. Furthermore, in their decisions on operational measures, the officers ordered that inquiries be conducted and that possible witnesses be questioned in order to identify the suspects named \u201cGiyas\u201d and \u201cBayram\u201d. Again, it does not follow from the documents in the files that any measures of that kind were ever taken. Thus, the fact that the authorities were able to identify the applicants as being those persons within a matter of hours without any specific measures having been taken raises serious questions as to the credibility of the operational information received and the measures carried out in this context.",

It follows from the documents submitted by the Government that both applicants were taken to the NDPO where the relevant searches were carried out. In this connection, the Court has already found in two cases against Azerbaijan, albeit under Article 6 of the Convention, that the police\u2019s failure to conduct a search immediately following an arrest without good reason raises legitimate concerns about the possible \u201cplanting\u201d of evidence (see Sakit\u00a0Zahidov v. Azerbaijan, no. 51164/07, \u00a7 53, 12 November 2015, and Layijov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 22062/07, \u00a7 69, 10 April 2014). The Court notes that the above considerations are also pertinent in the present cases, as the applicants were searched only once they had been taken into police custody and were under the complete control of the police. There is nothing to suggest that there were any special circumstances rendering it impossible to carry out a personal search on the spot immediately after the applicants had been stopped by the police. This is all the more true given that the applicants were stopped by the police in connection with alleged operational information that individuals named \u201cGiyas\u201d and \u201cBayram\u201d were carrying illicit drugs on themselves with the intention of selling them.",

However, as it transpires from the relevant records, the police did not attempt to search for other potential evidence \u2013 such as cash, information concerning possible suppliers or buyers, or items relating to drug paraphernalia, including scales and packaging material \u2013 limiting the relevant searches to exclusively seizure of the drugs.",

In this context, the Court agrees with the applicants that the use of video recording, be it during arrest, search or interrogation, constitutes an important safeguard against police misconduct, and the Court attaches particular importance to this type of evidence (see, for example, Sakit Zahidov, \u00a7 53, and Layijov, \u00a7 69, both cited above; Ciorap v.

Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those which offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. Moreover, Article 10 of the Convention protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed (see Oberschlick v.

The Court found that those actions constituted a mix of conduct and verbal expression and amounted to a form of artistic and political expression covered by Article 10 (see Maria Alekhina and Others v. Russia no.\u00a038004/12, \u00a7\u00a7 205-06, 17 July 2018). Likewise, the Court has found that pouring paint on statues of Ataturk was an expressive act performed as a protest against the political regime at the time (see Murat Vural v. Turkey, no.\u00a09540/07, \u00a7\u00a7 54-56, 21 October 2014). Detaching a ribbon from a wreath laid by the President of Ukraine at a monument to a famous Ukrainian poet on Independence Day has also been regarded by the Court as a form of political expression (see Shvydka v. Ukraine, no. 17888/12, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 30\u00a0October 2014). The Court also considered that the public display of several items of dirty clothing for a short time near the Hungarian Parliament, which had been meant to represent the \u201cdirty laundry of the nation\u201d, amounted to a form of political expression (see Tat\u00e1r and F\u00e1ber v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 26005/08 and 26160/08, \u00a7 36, 12 June 2012).",

However, it has found above that the real purpose of the applicants\u2019 arrest and their pre-trial detention, which was effected within the criminal proceedings instituted on the basis of drug-related charges, was to punish them for spraying graffiti on the statue and expressing throughout political slogans against the government (see paragraph 158 above). As the Court has previously held, when it comes to allegations of political or other ulterior motives in the context of criminal prosecution, it is difficult to dissociate pre-trial detention from the criminal proceedings within which such detention had been ordered (see Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan (infringement proceedings) [GC], no. 15172/13, \u00a7 185, 29 May 2019 and Lutsenko v. Ukraine, no. 6492/11, \u00a7 108, 3 July 2012). Furthermore, the Court cannot disregard the fact that the applicants\u2019 prosecution ultimately resulted in their final convictions and they were sentenced to lengthy prison terms, which they partially served. Thus, the Court finds that there is a causal link between the applicants\u2019 exercise of their freedom of expression and their prosecution for drug-related crimes (see mutatis mutandis Baka v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, \u00a7\u00a7 148-151, 23 June 2016, where the Grand Chamber first established prima facie evidence of the causal link and then found that the Government failed convincingly account for the impugned measure).",

Instead of acting within the constraints of the law, the authorities chose to prosecute the applicants for drug-related crimes in retaliation for their actions. The Court considers that such interference with the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression was not only unlawful, but it was also grossly arbitrary and incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which is expressly mentioned in the Preamble to the Convention and is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Baka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117).",
