The daughter had gone to bed, while S.K. and N.K. had been drinking coffee in the kitchen until about 1 a.m. At some point in time, they had been interrupted by a visit from G.P., another acquaintance, who had been looking for D.Sh., and, having learned that he had already gone, G.P. had left immediately. Subsequently, S.K. had gone to the bathroom. Worried about his long absence, N.K. had called for him and had received no answer.

They drew the prosecutor\u2019s attention to certain facts which appeared peculiar to them: in particular, S.K.\u2019s being dressed in a jacket after having allegedly been home for several hours; contradictory evidence as to the existence of an abrasion (possibly from the cord) on S.K.\u2019s hand; and the failure of the investigative authorities to examine the cord and to take away the axe and the chisel. Subsequently, on many occasions throughout the investigation, the applicants continued to suggest that S.K. could have been intentionally strangled with the cord and then placed in the bathroom, the hanging being imitated. Alternatively, he could have been poisoned by narcotic or psychotropic substances and incited to commit suicide. They alleged that the persons potentially implicated in the murder included his wife, her parents, and her lover (G.P.) and subsequently Y.M., a neighbour who had been on bad terms with S.K.",

Ukraine, no. 21454/04, \u00a7\u00a7 50-51 and 61, 3 March 2011).

At the same time, it does not appear from the case-file materials that the initial inspection of the scene and forensic examination were conducted so as to collect all relevant information and eliminate alternative explanations for S.K.\u2019s death, such as murder or incited suicide. As remarked upon in various remittal decisions, the police officers that arrived at the scene failed to examine an important body of physical evidence, including the latch of the bathroom door, the chisel and the axe used to break the door open, and the pipe to which the cord was attached. The cord itself was examined superficially and its origins were not verified. The same is true of the examination of S.K.\u2019s body.
