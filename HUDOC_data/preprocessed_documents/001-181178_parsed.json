His confinement in \u201ca cellar or a garage\u201d or \u201cin a police station\u201d was not authorised by a court, or, at least, no such documents have been submitted to the Court. The court order of 31 August 2002 only concerned Mr S. Selami\u2019s detention after 19 September 2002, the date when he had been transferred from the hospital to Skopje detention facility. During the unacknowledged detention, Mr S. Selami was deprived of any possibility of being brought before a court to review the lawfulness of his detention. He was left completely at the mercy of those holding him. An incommunicado detention carried out under somewhat similar circumstances was assessed by the Court to have constituted a particularly grave violation of Mr S. Selami\u2019s right to liberty and security as secured by Article 5 of the Convention (see, El Masri, cited above, \u00a7 237).",
