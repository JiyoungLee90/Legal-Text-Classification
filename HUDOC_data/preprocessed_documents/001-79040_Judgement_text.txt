The case originated in two applications (nos. 15667/03 and 2929/04) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Sylwester Wolf (“the applicant”), on 5 May 2003 and 23 December 2003 respectively. The applicant complained about the unreasonable length of his pre-trial detention (application no. 15667/03) and the excessive length of criminal proceedings (application no. 2929/04). He was represented before the Court by Mr M. Łuczkiewicz, a lawyer practising in .
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 11 November 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time. It further decided that the cases be examined simultaneously under Rule 42 § 2 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in .
The applicant was arrested on 24 April 2001 on charges of acting in an organised criminal group involved in the commission of armed robberies, offences against life or limb and property and drug trafficking. By a decision of the Katowice District Court of 25 April 2001 the applicant was remanded in custody until 23 July 2001. The court observed that on the basis of the evidence gathered so far (inter alia, evidence from two crown witnesses) there was a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question. It also referred to the risk that the further course of the proceedings would be jeopardised if the applicant were released.
Subsequently, the applicant’s pre-trial detention was prolonged on several occasions by the Częstochowa Regional Court (decisions of 19 July 2001, 18 October 2001, 29 November 2001) and by the Katowice Court of Appeal (decisions of 17 April 2002, 22 May 2002, 9 April 2003, 4 December 2002, 17 December 2003, 26 May 2004, 22 December 2004). The applicant challenged the decisions prolonging his detention on remand, but they were upheld (decision of the Katowice Regional Court of 30 May 2001; decisions of the Katowice Court of Appeal of 8 May 2002, 15 January 2003, 7 May 2003, 14 January 2004, 29 December 2004).
The applicant unsuccessfully applied for release and to have the preventive measure imposed on him replaced by a more lenient one (decisions of the Regional and Appeal Prosecutors of 21 May 2001, 11 June 2001, 9 July 2001, 1 October 2001, 3 December 2003 refusing the applicant’s requests; decisions of the Częstochowa Regional Court of 27 March 2003 and 4 September 2003). The courts justified their decisions prolonging the applicant’s detention on remand and their refusals to release him by referring to the complexity of the case, the significant number of accused, the existence of a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences concerned and the severity of the likely sentence. These facts gave rise to the courts’ assumption that the applicant, if released, could obstruct the proper course of the proceedings, especially given that some suspects were still at large. The courts were of the opinion that a comprehensive examination of the case required that the investigation be continued and that the applicant’s detention was the only way to secure the proper course of the proceedings.
On 28 October 2002 the Katowice Regional Prosecutor charged the applicant, in addition to the existing charges, with several counts of obtaining compensation under false pretences from an insurance company, illegal possession of firearms, extortion and drug trafficking.
On 27 February 2003 a bill of indictment against the applicant was submitted to the . The charges on the indictment included extortion, illegal possession of firearms and drug trafficking, committed while acting in an organised criminal group. The bill of indictment numbered 87 pages and the case file numbered 59 volumes. The prosecutor requested the court to hear 75 witnesses, including two crown witnesses. There were 22 accused.
The first hearing was held on 15 July 2003. 54 hearings were held in the case up until 16 February 2005 and about 70 hearings in total before the first-instance court up until December 2005. Some of the defendants and witnesses repeatedly failed to comply with the court summonses.
The hearing scheduled for 15 July 2003 was adjourned because of the absence of two lawyers. Some of the defendants requested the court to appoint legal-aid lawyers for them.
On 29 July 2003 the court held a hearing and heard an expert witness on the issue of the applicant’s health. The expert asserted that the applicant’s condition was not incompatible with his continued detention. In consequence, the applicant’s request of 20 May 2003 for release was dismissed.
Three accused voluntarily pleaded guilty. The relevant judgments were delivered on 5 and 13 August 2003.
The applicant pleaded not guilty and refused to testify.
On 30 July 2003 the court held a hearing. Another co-accused pleaded guilty. The judgment in his case was delivered on 13 August 2003. One of the defendants claimed to be ill and requested medical assistance; an ambulance was called. After a break in the hearing a doctor declared that the defendant was well enough to attend the hearing.
A hearing scheduled for 12 August 2003 was adjourned because one of the co-accused had withdrawn his lawyer’s power of attorney and had refused to accept a legal-aid lawyer.

During the hearing held on 17 April 2004 one of the accused claimed that he did not feel well enough to take part in the hearing. The judge referred to a medical certificate which indicated the contrary. Later the same accused pretended to lose consciousness; however an ambulance doctor found that his condition allowed him to participate in the hearing.
The hearing scheduled for 21 April 2004 was adjourned, as one of the accused objected to his locum tenens lawyer. On the same day the court, sitting in camera, dismissed a motion of one of the co-accused who had challenged the impartiality of the court.

The President of the  assured both the applicant and the Ombudsman that he would supervise the proceedings. In his opinion, there had been no undue delays in the proceedings, as roughly four hearings per month had been held. The case was complex and involved several accused; nevertheless, the proceedings had progressed steadily.
During a hearing held on 22 September 2004 the court heard a witness, who suddenly felt unwell. A doctor declared that his condition did not allow for the witness’ continued questioning and the hearing was adjourned.

On 3 January 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint about the length of the criminal proceedings under the Act of 17 June 2004. On 23 February 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed his complaint. In 17 pages of written reasons the court analysed the course of the proceedings from 27 March 2003 to 16 February 2005 and found that although the length of the proceedings had indeed been considerable, there had been no undue delays on the part of the court. The  had conducted the proceedings scrupulously, the hearings had been held regularly, four or even five times per month. The length of the proceedings had resulted from the complexity of the case and other objective factors and not from any negligence on the part of the court. The hearings were usually scheduled one month in advance to allow the accused time to prepare their defence. The court also noted that the case file had often been transferred to the Court of Appeal as a result of numerous motions and appeals filed by all the accused. The court acknowledged that the accused could not be blamed for availing themselves of their procedural rights; however, the number of filed motions had contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings, as had the conduct of some of the defendants. The Court of Appeal observed that special diligence was required when an accused was detained on remand, but in its view the first-instance court had been aware of that requirement and had fully observed it. The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that detention, even if lengthy, could be justified in the circumstances of a given case as long as it was supervised by a court and was found necessary.
