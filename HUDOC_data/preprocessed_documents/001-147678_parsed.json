Following the expiry of his tariff, he had had access to educational and work opportunities. He had been transferred to a prison offering the extended SOTP in September 2011, five months after tariff expiry. The prison had reasonably decided that the applicant needed a settling-in period before commencing further courses. The applicant had been swiftly informed of this, and could therefore not argue that he was uncertain as to when he would make progress.

This required reasonable opportunities to undertake courses aimed at helping prisoners to address their offending behaviour and the risks they posed. While Article 5 \u00a7 1 did not impose any absolute requirement for prisoners to have immediate access to all courses they might require, any restrictions or delays encountered as a result of resource considerations had to be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, bearing in mind that whether a particular course was made available to a particular prisoner depended entirely on the actions of the authorities (see \u00a7 218 of the judgment).",

In the Parole Board\u2019s February 2011 letter explaining its refusal to recommend release at tariff expiry in April that year, the Panel explained that the extended SOTP (and possibly a BLB programme once that had been completed) was considered necessary to further address his risk factors (see paragraph 15 above). In mid-April 2011 the applicant was informed by letter that the Secretary of State agreed with this assessment. She fixed the applicant\u2019s next Parole Board review to begin in March 2012 and to culminate in an oral hearing in September of that year (see paragraphs 16-17 above). The applicant was still, at this stage, pre-tariff expiry and his detention clearly justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention.",

He was transferred to HMP Whatton, a prison offering the extended SOTP, in September 2011, some five months later (see paragraph\u00a019 above). It is true that by this stage he had been waiting for access to the extended SOTP for over two years. However, as noted above, in order to assess whether any delay in access to prison courses constituted a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), the applicant\u2019s general progression through the prison system must be assessed in light of the particular circumstances of the case. In the applicant\u2019s case, it must be borne in mind that he had enjoyed prompt, pre-tariff-expiry access to several courses, including the core SOTP, the ETS course and the TSP. The five-month wait for a prison transfer cannot be viewed as unreasonable, having regard to all the opportunities offered to the applicant to progress through the prison system during his sentence and the steps then underway to enable his further progression.",

Reference was subsequently made, in response to a complaint by the applicant, to the limited resources and the high number of prisoners seeking access to offending behaviour programmes (see paragraph 23 above). This tends to support the applicant\u2019s allegation that his access to the extended SOTP was at this stage delayed, at least in part, for reasons of resource limitations. However, his reassessment nonetheless commenced in mid-January 2012, less than four months after transfer. It was swiftly completed, with the conclusion notified to the applicant in early February that he was not sufficiently motivated to undertake the course (see paragraph 25 above). The applicant has provided his own account of what happened during the assessment meetings but has not provided any evidence capable of undermining the conclusion reached by the deputy treatment manager of the course (see paragraph 41 above).",
