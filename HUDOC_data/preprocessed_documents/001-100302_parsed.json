On that basis, the Sofia District Court ordered the applicant to pay to the former owner 1,807.50, Bulgarian levs (BGN), the equivalent of 927 euros (EUR), in damages for the period from February 1992 to March 2002. The applicant's liability was limited to the latter date because this was when the action for damages had been brought. Apparently, the applicant failed to rely on the rules of statutory limitation, which under Bulgarian law was five years and could have led to the restriction of his liability to the period after March 1997. The applicant was also ordered to pay BGN 440, the equivalent of EUR 225, for the other party's expenses.",

Furthermore, for an initial period of several years the Restitution law was subject to highly uncertain interpretation (see Kayriakovi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44). Nevertheless, the applicant was in practice placed in a situation where he could have only avoided liability for damages by abandoning his flat immediately after the adoption of the Restitution Law in February 1992. In the Court's view, he could not have reasonably be required to do so (ibid., \u00a7 45). Moreover, in the case at hand the action under section 7 of the Restitution Law was brought against the applicant in December 1997, that is more than five years after the adoption of the Restitution Law (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). The applicant could not have reasonably been expected to foresee that and to act accordingly so as to avoid liability.",

These deficiencies are attributable to the State authorities, not the applicant (see, for example, Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 218 and\u00a0223, and Panayotova v. , no. 27636/04, \u00a7 21, 2 July 2009). The Court accepts that after the action under section 7 of the Restitution Law was brought against him in the end of 1997 the applicant must have been aware of the possibility that he might lose the apartment (see Kayriakovi, cited above, \u00a7 47). Nevertheless, in the Court's view, the automatic application of retrospective liability for damages to bona fides owners like him squares poorly with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of proportionality, foreseeability and fair balance (ibid.).",

However, although this will fall to be taken into account under Article 41, it cannot affect the Court's conclusion in the paragraph above that the applicant's automatic and retrospective liability for damages was in breach of the principles of proportionality, foreseeability and fair balance.
