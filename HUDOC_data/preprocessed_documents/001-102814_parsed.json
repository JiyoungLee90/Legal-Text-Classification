Furthermore, the institution of proceedings does not, in itself, satisfy all the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1. The Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective. The right of access to a court includes not only the right to institute proceedings but also the right to obtain a \u201cdetermination\u201d of the dispute by a court. It would be illusory if a 's domestic legal system allowed an individual to bring a civil action before a court without ensuring that the case was determined by a final decision in the judicial proceedings. It would be inconceivable for Article 6 \u00a7 1 to describe in detail the procedural guarantees to be afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without guaranteeing to the parties that their civil disputes will be finally determined (see Multiplex v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a058112/00, \u00a7\u00a045, 10\u00a0July 2003, and Kuti\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a048778/99, \u00a7\u00a025, ECHR 2002II).",

The Court has established that the liquidation of a State institution without a legal successor cannot dispense the State from the necessity to enforce a judgment against the liquidated entity. It has further noted that \u201cto conclude otherwise would allow the State to use this avenue to avoid payment of the debts of its organs, especially taking into account that changing needs force the State to make frequent changes in its organisational structure, including by forming new organs and liquidating old ones\u201d (Nikitina v. Russia, no. 47486/07, \u00a7 19, 15 July 2010, not final yet). A similar approach must be taken with regard to judicial proceedings against a State organ in which an individual challenges enforcement proceedings, given that enforcement was and remains the State's responsibility regardless of which particular institution is responsible for the performance of this function at any given moment. Therefore, the liquidation of the bailiffs' department without legal succession in the present case led to a denial of the applicant's right to have her compensation claim determined by a final decision on the merits. The Court finds therefore that such a denial deprived the applicant of the right of access to a court. There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect.",
