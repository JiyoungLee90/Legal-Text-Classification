Although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the seriousness of the offence. Nor can continuation of detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Dubinskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no. 48929/08, \u00a7 64, 3 July 2014 and Letellier v. France, 26\u00a0June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207).",
