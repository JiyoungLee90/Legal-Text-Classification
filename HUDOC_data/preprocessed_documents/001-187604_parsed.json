In such circumstances, the Court concludes that the relevant legal rules did not provide sufficient guidance and were not formulated with the degree of precision required by the Convention so as to satisfy the requirement of \u201clawfulness\u201d set out by the Convention (see, a contrario, Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, \u00a7\u00a055, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VII).

The question then is whether the arrest and detention were based on sufficient objective elements to justify a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the facts at issue had actually occurred (see, for example, W\u0142och v. Poland, no. 27785/95, \u00a7 108, ECHR 2000XI).

Thus, there could clearly not be a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d if the acts or facts held against a detained person did not constitute a crime at the time when they occurred. The issue in the present case is whether the applicant\u2019s detention was \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. The Convention refers here essentially to national law, but it also requires that any measure depriving the individual of his liberty be compatible with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual against arbitrariness (see, for example, W\u0142och v.

Although it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, under Article 5 \u00a7 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention and the Court can and should therefore review whether this law has been complied with (see, inter alia, Mooren v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 73, 9 July 2009).

In our view, these arguments are insufficient to reach the conclusion that the applicant was not detained on a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of having committed the offence of \u201cpimping\u201d.",

Where the domestic courts are called on to interpret a provision of criminal law for the first time, an interpretation of the scope of the offence which was consistent with the essence of that offence must, as a rule, be considered as foreseeable (see , no. 74613/01, \u00a7\u00a0109, ECHR 2007III). Even a new interpretation of the scope of an existing offence may be reasonably foreseeable for the purposes of Article\u00a07, provided that it is reasonable in terms of domestic law and consistent with the essence of the offence (see see , nos.\u00a011082/06 and 13772/05, \u00a7\u00a7 791-821, 25 July 2013). The Court has adopted a similar approach in assessing the lawfulness of an interference under other provisions of the Convention (see, for example, Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v.

In our view, there is nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in the latter and more extensive interpretation, adopted by the domestic courts in the applicant\u2019s case. In addition, such an interpretation of the notion \u201cprostitution\u201d seems consistent with the essence of the offence, which is to protect persons, in particular women, from sexual and economic exploitation. The interpretation adopted by the District Court and the Court of Appeal, ruling on the applicant\u2019s detention, was in accordance with the subsequent opinion of 21 October 2015 from the State Agency for the Protection of Morality, according to which the actions of the female models employed by the applicant could be considered acts of prostitution, in that their clients were able to obtain sexual gratification as a result of the models\u2019 performance and because the models were paid for those acts (see paragraph 14 of the judgment). It was also confirmed subsequently, not only in the judgment of 30 December 2016 convicting the applicant (see paragraph 13), a judgment that the applicant did not challenge by lodging an appeal, but also in other similar cases (the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments of 30 October 2015 and 13\u00a0September 2016 (see paragraphs 20 and 22 respectively)) and, importantly, by the Supreme Court in a judgment of 21 June 2016 (see paragraph 20).",

Firstly, the majority do not pay sufficient attention to the wording of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention, which requires only a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d, not a sufficient basis for a conviction, and it is first and foremost for the domestic courts to interpret and apply domestic law. Secondly, it follows logically, and at least implicitly, from the majority\u2019s reasoning, according to which the applicant \u201ccould not have reasonably been expected to foresee, even with appropriate legal advice, the consequences of his conduct\u201d (see paragraph\u00a035), that not only the applicant\u2019s detention, but also his subsequent conviction were, in the majority\u2019s view, unlawful. For the reasons set out above, we voted against finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c). In our view, a certain deference should be afforded to the domestic authorities, including prosecutors and domestic courts, as they interpret and apply domestic law in the light of present-day conditions and changing circumstances in society, provided that such an interpretation is sufficiently foreseeable and consistent with the essence of the offence, in the present case the provision of sufficient protection to vulnerable women against sexual and economic exploitation.",
