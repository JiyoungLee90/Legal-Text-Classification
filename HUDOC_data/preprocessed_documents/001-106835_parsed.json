In the instant case, the applicant alleged that he had been illtreated during his arrest. In particular, he complained that a police officer, Mr A.\u00c7., had headbutted him in the police car, breaking his nose. Subsequent medical reports further confirmed that the applicant\u2019s nose had been broken. The Court finds that this injury is sufficient to bring it within the scope of Article 3. It also observes that after acquainting itself with the evidence in the case file, in its decision the Beyo\u011flu Assize Court also found it established that Officer A.\u00c7. had broken the applicant\u2019s nose by head-butting him. Considering that the use of force had been disproportionate, the domestic court found the police officer guilty of illtreating the applicant under Article 245 of the former Criminal Code. Although the criminal proceedings were subsequently dropped as timebarred, in the instant case no cogent evidence has been provided to lead the Court to depart from the findings of the first-instance court in this respect.",
