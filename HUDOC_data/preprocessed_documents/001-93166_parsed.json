Had the applicant been dissatisfied with that decision, he could have continued the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor, which represents a measure corrective of a possibly wrong decision of the public prosecutor. Bearing in mind that the Court\u2019s case-law does not require an investigation necessarily to lead to conviction, the subsidiary prosecution should be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint. In support of the latter argument, the Government submitted statistics which show that at least 405 criminal charges of various kinds were brought by subsidiary prosecutors in different periods between 2001 and 2006 in four major Slovenian local courts. Thirty-seven of these cases ended with a judgment, six of which were convictions. All the remaining cases are either still pending or were discontinued, almost half of them because the charges were dismissed as inadmissible at the pre-trial stage (sklep o zavr\u017eenju obto\u017ebe).

The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances. To be effective, a remedy must be capable of remedying directly the impugned state of affairs (see Balogh v. Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7\u00a030, 20\u00a0July\u00a02004).",

The Court therefore sees no reason to require the applicant to pursue the prosecution of the accused officers on his own by lodging a bill of indictment, this being a responsibility of the public prosecutor who is certainly better, if not exclusively, equipped in that respect. It therefore concludes that by lodging a criminal complaint the applicant afforded the State an opportunity to put matters right by an institution of an effective official investigation (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0 90, and H.D. v.

The Court further notes that the applicant\u2019s sentence of imprisonment was lawful under Slovenian law and was imposed and executed in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. It also finds in this connection that there is no indication of arbitrariness on the part of the authorities\u2019 conduct. In short, the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty did not contravene Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 68, Series A no. 22, and T. v. the  [GC], no. 24724/94, \u00a7 103, 16 December 1999).
