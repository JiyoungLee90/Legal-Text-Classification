The first applicant swerved his car to the right to prevent a collision and then applied the brakes. The white Renault also stopped right in front of his car and four men in civilian clothes leapt out. The first applicant then noticed that the white Isuzu pickup travelling ahead of him had also stopped, probably to check what was happening behind. In a matter of seconds, one of the men who had leapt out of the white Renault opened his driver\u2019s door, shouted some words in Turkish and put a gun to his forehead, while another tried to pull him out of the car. When the first applicant resisted, holding tight to his unfastened seat belt, the man holding the gun hit him on the head above the left ear with the handle of his gun, which caused him to fall down on the road into a puddle of rainwater measuring 20 to 25 cm, in a semi-conscious state as a result of the force of the blow. The men kicked and punched him on the ground, and twisted and bit his hands to force him to let go of the seat belt, while the first applicant called for help. After receiving some forceful kicks below the pelvis and to the ribs, which were so strong that he thought his ribs were broken, he let go of the belt and rolled on the ground. The four men then picked him up by the arms and legs and dragged him to the white Renault, which was a left-hand drive car. The first applicant estimated that the whole ordeal, which had started at approximately 5.45 a.m., had lasted less than three minutes, and it had been witnessed by the driver of the white Isuzu pickup travelling ahead of him.",

He first explained to the trial court how the tracking process worked in general and stated that the dog could only track one person at a time, and would follow the freshest track in the area. On that morning, they had started the search at the place where the first applicant\u2019s car was first found. They had covered the 400-metre perimeter, but had not been able to find any tracks. Since the recent rainfall had made the ground wet, it would not have been possible to walk on the grass by the asphalt road without leaving footprints, but they had found no such marks, which meant that the first applicant had not left the area on foot.",

According to what V.Z. had heard from X, as he was driving from Pergamos to Pyla on the morning of 13 December 2000, X had noticed two civilian cars, one red and the other white, blocking the way of a doublecabin pickup that had been coming from the direction of Pyla (that is, the opposite direction to him).

They also showed him the video of the reconstruction exercise.

Arrest warrants were subsequently issued against those persons on 7 June 2001 on suspicion of the offence of abduction.

The courts which tried the first applicant were not courts of Turkey; they did not apply Turkish law, but rather the substantive criminal law and criminal procedure law of Cyprus, which had been codified during the British colonial period and was applicable on both sides of the island. Moreover Turkey, as the respondent State, could not attempt to effect any change in the law of the \u201cTRNC\u201d for the simple reason that it could not legislate outside its own borders. In other words, the respondent Government claimed that the acts complained of were imputable exclusively to the \u201cTRNC\u201d, an independent and sovereign State established by the Turkish-Cypriot community.",

The Court also stressed that where the fact of such domination over the territory was established, it was not necessary to determine whether the Contracting State exercised detailed control over the policies and actions of the subordinate local administration; the fact that the local administration had survived as a result of the Contracting State\u2019s military and other support entailed that State\u2019s responsibility for its policies and actions (see Loizidou (merits), cited above, \u00a7 56, and Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above). It follows that, in terms of Article 1 of the Convention, Turkey\u2019s jurisdiction must be considered to extend to securing the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified, and that violations of those rights are imputable to Turkey (see Cyprus v.\u00a0Turkey, cited above).",

The Court, therefore, cannot determine whether the judgment of the domestic court, which had not only the means but also the principal duty to clearly establish the facts contested by the parties, was the result of a fair and comprehensive consideration of the contradictory arguments before it, or whether it ruled in favour of the official version of the events presented by the prosecution following a perfunctory assessment that did not give sufficient regard to the first applicant\u2019s serious claims. The absence of such reasoning not only has implications vis\u00e0-vis certain procedural rights of the applicant, which will be examined in further detail below, but also detracts from the reliance which might otherwise have been placed on the trial court\u2019s judgment by the Court.

Three to four other men were in the fields to the right side of the road. One of them was being dragged by the arms and pleading to be let go (see paragraph 70 above).

However, the descriptions they provided in relation to those cars were somewhat inconsistent: whereas G.H. claimed that there was a white Renault parked on the left-hand side of the road with its bonnet open, and a red Renault to the right of that white car, A.G. stated that the car parked on the left-hand side of the road with an open bonnet had been a red Renault, and that the white Renault had been waiting on the opposite side of the road by some cypress trees and had flashed its lights at him. Even more striking was the fact that in his earlier statement to the SBA police on 19 December 2000 \u2013 that is, only six days after the incident \u2013 A.G. had not mentioned anything about a white car, which is hard to explain considering his later claim that that car had flashed its headlights at him.

The statement given by V.Z. regarding his employee X\u2019s alleged witnessing of the first applicant\u2019s abduction does not correspond to the latter\u2019s testimony. Whereas the first applicant alleged that the white Isuzu had been travelling ahead of him in the direction of Pergamos, and had actually stopped by the red Renault car and talked briefly to the persons standing in front of that car before driving away towards Pergamos, V.Z. claimed that X was travelling from Pergamos to Pyla, namely in the opposite direction, and had driven past the cars in question as the first applicant was being dragged out of his car, without stopping. The Court also finds it curious that although V.Z. informed the SBA police of X\u2019s alleged eyewitness account as early as 16 December 2000, neither V.Z. himself, nor Kyriacos Tsiakkourmas or the SBA police officer who had allegedly tracked X down had been called as witnesses by the defence during the subsequent criminal proceedings against the first applicant before the Famagusta Assize Court.",

The fact that the first applicant was arrested in \u201cTRNC\u201d territory for smuggling drugs only some ten days after the controversial arrest of Mr \u00d6mer Gazi Teko\u011ful by the Greek Cypriot authorities, which apparently led to some strong protests from the Turkish Cypriot side, may cast some doubts on the accusations brought against him. Moreover, whereas the allegation remains that the first applicant entered the \u201cTRNC\u201d between border stones nos. 96 and 97 separating the SBA from the \u201cTRNC\u201d, the Court notes that the domestic authorities, including the trial court, do not appear to have concerned themselves much with how he may have arrived there.

The applicant further complained, under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention, that he had been unlawfully remanded in custody without an adequate explanation as to why he had not been released and that he had been unable to challenge the lawfulness of his detention. He claimed in this connection that when he had first been brought before a judge, on 13 December 2000, he had not been offered the assistance of a lawyer and had thus been unable to follow the hearing or participate in the proceedings beyond sitting in the room as a passive spectator. He further argued that the subsequent remand hearings had similarly failed to comply with the fairness requirements under Article\u00a06 of the Convention, as (i) the tribunal had not been impartial; (ii)\u00a0the interpretation provided had been insufficient; and, most importantly, (iii) the restrictions placed on his ability to communicate with his lawyers had amounted to a denial of his right to adequate facilities for the preparation of his defence.",

Subsequently, on 21\u00a0December 2000 and 15 February 2001, the first applicant appeared before the \u201cTRNC\u201d Nicosia District Court and the Famagusta District Court, respectively, and on both occasions it was decided to prolong his remand in custody, despite his consistent protests that he had been unlawfully abducted. The Court considers that in all those hearings, the question of the lawfulness of the first applicant\u2019s detention was incorporated in the decisions whether to order his detention or to prolong it. The respondent Government did not dispute this; in fact, they themselves claimed in their observations that it had been open to the first applicant to challenge the lawfulness of his detention within the criminal proceedings against him, including on those three occasions when he appeared before the Nicosia and Famagusta District Courts.",

It was, therefore, not necessary for him to seek a separate writ of habeas corpus. The Court recalls in this connection that where a remedy has been pursued, use of another one which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Kozac\u0131o\u011flu v.

Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a084-86, 25 October 2007). Bearing in mind that the first applicant possessed no legal knowledge, was before a foreign jurisdiction and was allegedly provided with insufficient interpretation, legal representation would appear to have been indispensable to enable him to exercise his right to challenge the lawfulness of his detention. The Court notes in this regard that although legal assistance was available to the first applicant some two days after his detention, he claimed, and the Government did not dispute, that at least until his transfer to the Nicosia Central Prison on the evening of 21\u00a0December 2000, he had not been allowed to confer with his lawyers in conditions of confidentiality; all their meetings were attended by police officers who stood within earshot. The Court reiterates in this regard that respect for lawyer-client confidentiality is as important in the context of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention as in that of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c); confidential communication with one\u2019s lawyer is protected by the Convention as an important safeguard of the right to defence, which also applies in the context of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Castravet v. Moldova, no.\u00a023393/05, \u00a7\u00a7 49-50, 13 March 2007, and Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a05829/04, \u00a7 198 and the cases cited therein, and \u00a7 232, 31 May 2011). The adverse circumstances in which the first applicant met with his lawyers in the first eight days of his detention, during which period he appeared before the \u201cTRNC\u201d Nicosia District Court twice (on 13 and 21 December 2000), without any apparent justification, inevitably inhibited free discussion and thus hampered his right to effectively challenge the lawfulness of his detention, including by way of seeking a writ of habeas corpus (see Castravet, cited above, \u00a7 51), whereas the opportunity for legal review must be provided soon after the person is taken into detention (see, among others, Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a078, and Molotchko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a012275/10, \u00a7 148, 26 April 2012).",

Although he protested in vain that he was innocent, he was not given a realistic opportunity to challenge the legality of his detention, whereas the officers who had allegedly arrested him had been able to make submissions to the court freely. He was, therefore, initially denied some of the minimum procedural guarantees required for an effective exercise of the right under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, including those of the right to adversarial proceedings and equality of arms (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v.

The Court reiterates in this connection that while Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention does not impose an obligation on a judge examining the lawfulness of detention to address every argument raised by the detained person, its guarantees would be deprived of their substance if the judge could treat as irrelevant, or disregard, particular facts invoked by the detainee which could cast doubt on the existence of the conditions essential for the \u201clawfulness\u201d, in the sense of the Convention, of the deprivation of liberty (see Nikolova v.

However, although the relevant domestic courts ordered the prolongation of the first applicant\u2019s detention at the end of each hearing, there is no evidence in the case file to suggest that the issue of the lawfulness of his initial or continuing detention was subjected to a meaningful examination, which would have required an assessment of the compliance of the detention with domestic procedural requirements, as well as a review of the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest and the ensuing detention (see J\u0117\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000IX). Not even when it delivered its judgment against the first applicant did the Famagusta Assize Court explain why it had disregarded his allegations of abduction. It simply dismissed his arguments by stating that they were \u201cnot credible\u201d, without giving any further explanation. In those circumstances, the Court is of the view that the challenges made by the first applicant against the lawfulness of his detention within the domestic criminal proceedings proved ineffective in the instant case.

For that reason, the Court has held that when an act of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities was in compliance with laws in force within the territory of northern Cyprus, those acts should in principle be regarded as having a legal basis in domestic law for the purposes of the Convention (see Foka v.

Firstly, the Government argued that the first applicant had failed to appeal against the decision of the \u201cTRNC\u201d Nicosia District Court despite the latter\u2019s rejection of his allegations of ill-treatment as lacking any credibility. However, the Court notes from the minutes submitted to it that the said court did not rule in any way on the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment, but rather confined its examination to the bail request lodged by the applicant. The District Court\u2019s reasoning that his statements lacked credibility and reliability referred only to the assurances given by the first applicant regarding his bail request, not to his allegations of illtreatment. In those circumstances, and given that applicants are expected to pursue only those remedies which relate to the breaches alleged and which offer a reasonable prospect of success, the Court does not consider that the first applicant failed to exhaust the domestic remedies in relation to his Article 3 complaints by not appealing against a decision purely concerning his bail request and the prolongation of his remand in custody.",

The trial court rendered no decision on the allegations of ill-treatment raised by the first applicant, nor did it examine whether the force used against him during his alleged arrest had been proportionate.

While it was possible that those injuries had been sustained as a result of his resistance to the police, they were certainly not consistent with allegations of severe beating.

Having regard to the conflicting submissions before it, it falls to the Court to determine whether the force used for the first applicant\u2019s arrest was excessive and thus violated Article 3 of the Convention.

By way of a preliminary observation, the Court shares the respondent Government\u2019s view that such forceful blows might have been expected to leave more serious marks, such as haematomas, bruises or swelling on the relevant parts of the body (see T\u00fcz\u00fcn v. Turkey, no. 24164/07, \u00a7\u00a037, 5 November 2013). In particular, while the first applicant claimed that he had been hit forcefully above the left ear with the butt of a gun, to the extent that he tumbled out of the car as a result of the force applied and lost consciousness for a while (see paragraph 17 above), the Court notes that the medical examination conducted approximately eight hours after that incident noted only a small swelling above his left ear, without any bleeding or bruising. It appears that the swelling had almost subsided by the time of his second examination by a UN doctor the next day, despite the lack of any particular treatment, which raises doubts as to the veracity of his allegations. The Court moreover notes that whereas the first applicant claimed to have received a strong punch in the face, which allegedly caused his mouth to bleed and damaged his teeth, neither of the medical reports recorded such injuries to the mouth. Similarly, although the first applicant argued that he had experienced problems breathing because of the strong blow to his ribs, the medical experts did not record any substantial injuries in the rib area to corroborate that allegation.",

Moreover, on a number of occasions the police had not allowed him out of his cell to go to the toilet, whereas he had had to urinate often on account of his diabetes. He had therefore used a plastic bottle to urinate in his cell. He also complained that on the first two days of his detention at the Saray police station, he had hardly been given any food, and afterwards he had ordered food from the canteen with the money sent to him by his family.",

Malta, no. 55352/12, \u00a7 89, 23 July 2013), they are nevertheless expected to corroborate their allegations as much as the circumstances allow them. In similar situations the Court has considered, for example, written statements by fellow inmates provided by applicants in support of their allegations (see Visloguzov, cited above, \u00a7 45) or documents showing that relevant issues had been brought to the attention of the domestic authorities as sufficient evidence to declare the complaint wellfounded and shift the burden of proof to the Government (see Daniliuc v. Romania (dec.), no. 7262/06, \u00a7 53, 2 October 2012, and Aleksandr Vladimirovich Smirnov v. Ukraine, no. 69250/11, \u00a7 47, 13 March 2014). The Court notes that while the first applicant might have encountered understandable problems in submitting statements from other detainees, on account of the obvious language barrier and the fact that he did not share his cell with anyone else, it was nevertheless open to him to submit a copy of a complaint, made by himself or his lawyers, to any domestic authority describing in detail the physical conditions of his detention. The first applicant, however, has not submitted any evidence to show that he raised his complaints with the authorities, or even with his lawyers or the UN officials who visited him a number of times during his detention at the Saray police station, which inevitably raises doubts regarding the credibility of his allegations (see Bragin v. Russia (dec.), no. 8258/06, 28\u00a0January 2010). The Court particularly notes in this connection the report of the UN inspector dated 14 December 2000, in which the first applicant was quoted as saying that he had no complaints in relation to how he had been treated since his alleged handover to the Turkish Cypriot police, and had not mentioned his allegedly poor detention conditions (see paragraph 30 above).",

Hence, a lack of appropriate medical care and, more generally, the detention in inappropriate conditions of a person who is ill may in principle amount to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see \u0130lhan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7\u00a087, ECHR 2000-VII). In determining whether the authorities have discharged their health-care obligations vis-\u00e0-vis a detainee in their charge, the Court\u2019s task is to assess the quality of the medical services provided to the detainee in the light of his state of health and \u201cthe practical demands of imprisonment\u201d and to determine whether, in the circumstances of a particular case, the health-care standard applied was compatible with the human dignity of the detainee (see, for instance, Kaverzin v.

Moreover, the failure to provide proper medical aid to a detainee would not fall under Article 3 unless there was actual detriment to his or her physical or mental condition, or avoidable suffering of a certain intensity, or an immediate risk of such detriment or suffering (see, for instance, Mikalauskas v.

The Court acknowledges that the mere fact that a detainee was seen by a doctor and prescribed a certain form of treatment cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that the medical assistance was adequate (see Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7\u00a0116, 29\u00a0November\u00a02007). Nevertheless, relying on the information in the case file, the Court considers that in the instant case, the first applicant\u2019s condition was being monitored overall by doctors who frequently examined him and that the prison authorities generally responded adequately to his medical treatment requirements. There is no evidence of any complaint raised by the first applicant during the course of his detention to suggest that the prison authorities had ignored his medical needs. Moreover, the doctors who examined the first applicant stated expressly on various occasions that he had been receiving satisfactory treatment and had been following a dietary regime in line with the requirements of his medical condition.",

The Court also notes that the authorities did not withhold medical assistance from the first applicant on account of his uncooperative attitude. Not only did the frequent visits of the doctors continue, but at some point he was admitted to a hospital, where he stayed for approximately a week for close monitoring of his condition and the administration of the appropriate course of treatment, which he had failed to duly follow when left to his own devices.",
