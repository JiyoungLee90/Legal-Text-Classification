Bleeding in the brain and a red spot on the left side of the chest strongly suggested that X had been gripped tightly and violently shaken and suffered from \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d. X had severe brain injuries and would probably suffer lifelong mental and physical disabilities. The court found that X\u2019s injuries had occurred while he had been in his parents\u2019 care. Thus, in the court\u2019s opinion, it did not matter who had actually caused the injuries but it sufficed to state that the parents had failed to protect X from being injured.

The court then noted that the applicant had contested the physicians\u2019 conclusions and, moreover, that she had submitted a medical certificate of her own. However, the court considered that the applicant\u2019s reasoning in this regard was based on speculation and accusations which, in all essential parts, were unsubstantiated. It held that the medical certificate submitted by the applicant did not in any way contradict those previously submitted. Thus, nothing had emerged that would lead the court to reassess the circumstances that had led to the initial decision to take X into public care. Furthermore, the court found that the changes to the applicant\u2019s life (the divorce and obtaining sole custody of X) were not sufficient to have a decisive effect on the outcome of the proceedings. It also stressed that it was important that X continue to bond with his family home parents.

It referred to a certificate by the scientific advisor T.A., a physician specialised in medical radiology, which stated, inter alia, that X\u2019s injuries had been caused by severe violence and that his injuries corresponded exactly to \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d. The injuries could not have been caused by illness or complications related to an illness nor through a minor accident such as a fall from a changing table or similar. The injuries could not have been a consequence of an injury during delivery either. Thus, T.A. wholly agreed with the assessments previously made by Professor O.F.",

Although she had not actually witnessed anyone harming X, she said that the only person, apart from herself, who could have done so was B. On the day they had taken X to the hospital, B. had been in a bad temper. On that day B. had taken care of X while she had been in the bathroom preparing a bath for X, and from the bathroom she had heard X cry and had gone to see what was the matter. B. had then told her to leave the room and after she had done so the baby had become quiet and B. had left the apartment. Just shortly after this and while undressing X, she had noticed that something was wrong with him and that he was having trouble breathing. B. had threatened her and told her that she would be expelled from Sweden if she were to tell anyone what had happened. She also told the court that B. had often been irritated when X cried and that he had had a tendency to \u201cexplode\u201d. The applicant further stated that her life was stable, she spoke Swedish, had an apartment and work, and she would do everything to ensure that X received the care and treatment he needed.",

Thus, the court considered it encouraging that the applicant had now accepted the conclusions in the medical certificate concerning X\u2019s state of health and the cause of his injuries. In addition, the court considered that the applicant\u2019s life situation had improved since the decision to take X into public care. Of decisive importance to the court was, however, whether X\u2019s needs could be met by the applicant. In this context, the court noted that it had still not been clarified who had caused his injuries. The court further considered that, in the light of the applicant\u2019s statement before the court, her previous behaviour was difficult to understand. Although the court acknowledged the applicant\u2019s exposed situation at the time of X\u2019s injuries, it nevertheless stressed that the conditions in the family had led to serious deficiencies in X\u2019s care, causing him life-threatening injuries and lifelong disabilities. The court concluded that there was still a clear risk of impairment to X\u2019s health and development if the public care were to be terminated.",

Consequently, the Court has found that potential applicants may, as a general rule, be expected to lodge a domestic claim to seek compensation for alleged breaches of the Convention before applying to the Court (see Eriksson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52; Ruminski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037 and 39; and Marinkovic v.

In such a situation, the Court has found that an exception to the general rule exists because, even if a claim for compensation would be successful, this would not afford sufficient redress since it could only result in monetary compensation and not an end to the on-going situation (see S.J.P. and E.S. v.\u00a0Sweden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73).",

The best interests of the child had been duly considered by the national authorities throughout the proceedings.

Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, \u00a7 68). Account must also be taken of the fact that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned (see Olsson v.

It is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities regarding public care and access but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see, for instance, Hokkanen v. Finland, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no.\u00a0299-A, \u00a7 55, and Johansen, cited above, \u00a7 64). Thus, while the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation, in particular when assessing the necessity of taking a child into care, a stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of any further limitations, such as limitations on parental rights and access (see Kutzner v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

Italy, no. 31127/96, \u00a7 69, 16 November 1999).

In carrying out this balancing exercise, the Court will attach particular importance to the best interests of the child which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parent (see Johansen, cited above, \u00a7 78). Indeed, the Court has emphasised that in cases of this type (public care of children and contact restrictions) the child\u2019s interest must come before all other considerations (Gnahor\u00e9 v.

Subsequently, on 28 October 2008, the County Administrative Court ordered the public care of X on the ground that he had sustained severe brain injuries from having been gripped tightly and shaken violently and would probably suffer lifelong mental and physical disabilities. Since this had occurred while X was in the care of his parents, they had shown a serious lack of ability to care for their son. At this time, a criminal investigation concerning suspected child abuse committed by the applicant and/or B. had been initiated. Although the investigation was subsequently discontinued without establishing either suspect\u2019s criminal responsibility, the Court finds that the national authorities had legitimate and serious concerns for X\u2019s safety in his home and that their primary obligation was to protect him from any potential further harm (see, Gnahor\u00e9, cited above, \u00a7 56).

It further observes that, at this time, X had been in public care for about one year and seven months and had been living in the family home for roughly one year, where he had adjusted well and his special needs were provided for. Moreover, since May 2009 the applicant had been allowed to meet with X only for one hour per month due to the contact restrictions in place. These restrictions had been decided to allow X to adjust to the family home and to ensure the calm and stability that he required, as it had been observed that the visits had had a clearly negative effect on X\u2019s mental state.",

She further submitted that she was fully capable of caring for her child. Here the Court observes that already in December 2008, in the report by the treatment and evaluation home where the parents had been placed together with X for eight weeks, it had been stated that the applicant refused to accept X\u2019s injuries, that there had been considerable flaws in her emotional interaction with X and that she had seen him more as an object than as an individual, which was found to be highly worrying.",

This is in particular true in the light of the medical evidence which had been presented to the Social Council and the domestic courts and which was reinforced by the Legal Advisory Council\u2019s opinion submitted to the Administrative Court of Appeal in January 2011 as its assessment was identical to that made in the first forensic medical certificate of 3\u00a0September 2008.",

The applicant explained this change of position with reference to the fact that she was afraid because B. had threatened that she would be expelled from Sweden if she reported what had happened. The fact remains that she had separated from him already in March 2009 and had reported him to the police, claiming that he had threatened to kill her, in September 2009. Furthermore, she had been granted a permanent residence permit in April 2010 and thus, at the very latest, could have spoken of her suspicion about B. in her appeal to the County Administrative Court. Consequently, no valid explanation has been given for the applicant\u2019s long silence on this vital point, especially considering the strong medical evidence stating that X\u2019s injuries could only have been inflicted by severe violence which corresponded exactly to \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d and the applicant\u2019s consistent claim, up until that point, that she had no reason to suspect B.",

In doing so, she could have insisted that X be placed in a family home which shared her religious and linguistic background. By failing to do so, the applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies available to her in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and these complaints must therefore be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4.",

It follows that this complaint must also be declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",
