The rate for the Czech Republic was 0.4%. In other European countries the figures ranged from 0.5% in Sweden and Italy to 5.8% in Azerbaijan. In most European countries the figures were below 1%. According to the report, perinatal mortality is an important indicator of maternal care and maternal health and nutrition; it also reflects the quality of available obstetric and paediatric care, comparing different countries. The report recommended that, if possible, all foetuses and infants weighing at least 500g at birth, whether alive or dead, should be included in the statistics.

Neonatal outcomes of planned home births revealed less frequent prematurity and low birth weight, and less need for assisted newborn ventilation.

Moreover, the issue of home births touches on areas where there is no clear common ground amongst the member States (see paragraphs 59-61 above) and involves general social and economic policy considerations for the State, including the allocation of financial means, as setting up an adequate emergency system may involve shifting budgetary resources from the general system of maternity hospitals to a new security network for home births.

The applicants were free to give birth in a hospital of their choice, where in theory their wishes relating to matters concerning the birth would be respected (see paragraph 39 above). However, the material before the Court suggests that the conditions in most local hospitals, in terms of respecting the choices of mothers, were questionable (see paragraphs 7, 16 and 21 above). In this context the Court notes that the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended to the respondent State that it should ensure respect for patients\u2019 rights, avoiding unnecessary medical interventions (see paragraph 56 above). Accordingly, the free choice of mothers as to the hospital in which to give birth did not weaken the applicants\u2019 interest in having assisted home births.",

First, home births would be acceptable only in the case of \u201clow-risk\u201d pregnancies. Second, a home birth has to be attended by a qualified midwife, who is able to detect any complications during a delivery and to refer a woman in labour to a hospital if necessary. Third, the transfer of mother and child to hospital should be secured within a very short period of time. Thus, a situation such as the one in the Czech Republic, where medical professionals are not allowed to assist mothers who wish to give birth at home and where no specialised emergency aid is available, may be said to increase rather than reduce the risk to the life and health of the mother and newborn.",

The Court notes in this consideration that the material before it does not show that the Ministry of Health did originally carry out such an assessment. It further appears that the national authorities tried to initiate an open discussion, involving all relevant interest groups, on the issue of home births, but that this initiative eventually failed (see paragraph 26 above). A further assessment, by way of an obiter dictum, was made in July 2013 by the Constitutional Court, which held that a modern democratic State protected freedoms, including those that were accompanied by a certain degree of acceptable risk, and that the right of parents to a free choice of the place and mode of delivery was limited only by the interests of the safe delivery and health of the child; those interests could not, however, be interpreted as entailing an unambiguous preference for deliveries in hospital (see paragraph 36 above).",

This Court has held that Article 8 cannot be considered applicable each time an individual\u2019s everyday life is disrupted, but only in the exceptional cases where the State\u2019s failure to adopt measures interferes with that individual\u2019s right to personal development and his or her right to establish and maintain relations with other human beings and the outside world (see Zehnalov\u00e1 and Zehnal v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 38621/97, ECHR 2002-V).",

Whilst it is clear that childbirth itself forms part of a woman\u2019s private life, I can hardly agree that all the particular aspects of giving birth engage the protection of the Convention. In this respect the case should also be distinguished from the recent case of Konovalova v. Russia (no. 37873/04, 9 October 2014), in which the uninvited presence of students during the applicant\u2019s delivery amounted to interference with her private life, given that they \u201chad access to the confidential medical information concerning the applicant\u2019s condition\u201d.",

It cannot be interpreted as requiring the State to guarantee the level of comfort an individual seeks, even at the crucial moment of giving birth. As Lord Bingham said, cited in Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom (no. 4158/05, ECHR 2010), \u201cIt is true that \u2018private life\u2019 has been generously construed to embrace wide rights to personal autonomy.

A mere issue of a greater or lesser degree of psychological comfort does not, in my view, reach the required \u201clevel of seriousness\u201d, and goes far beyond the original intentions of the drafters of the Convention to protect the private life of an individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities.",

In other words, they requested the State to organise the necessary facilities to enable them to give birth at home with minimal risk, that is, in conditions similar to those in maternity hospitals.

As in other countries, the issue of home births seems to be the object of a form of power struggle between doctors and midwives. Paragraph 26 of the judgment gives an idea of how this struggle is fought out. When the issue of home births came up for examination in 2012, the Ministry of Health set up an expert committee composed of representatives of care recipients, midwives, physicians\u2019 associations, the Ministry itself, the Commissioner for Human Rights and public health-insurance companies. However, the representatives of the physicians\u2019 associations boycotted the meeting, arguing that there was no need to change the existing legal framework. Subsequently, no doubt after some efficient lobbying, they managed to obtain from the Ministry that it removed from the committee the representatives of care recipients, midwives and the Commissioner for Human Rights, with the argument that only with the remaining composition would it be possible for the committee to agree on certain conclusions. I am not aware whether, once the committee had been cleansed, it was capable of making any suggestion at all.",

The impugned legislation has a \u201cserious impact on the freedom of choice of the applicants, who were required, if they wished to give birth at home, to do so without the assistance of a midwife and, therefore, with the attendant risks that this posed to themselves and to the newborns, or to give birth at a hospital\u201d. While only relatively few mothers might prefer to give birth at home, I have no reason to doubt that for these women this is a very important matter of personal choice. To some extent this is also confirmed in the 2010 observations on the Czech Republic, adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. That Committee took up the issue and recommended that the State \u201cconsider taking steps to make midwife-assisted childbirth outside hospitals a safe and affordable option for women\u201d (see \u00a7 37 of the observations, quoted in paragraph 56 of the judgment).",

The majority rightly points out that there could be unexpected complications which would require a specialised medical intervention, and which could give rise to a life- or health-threatening delay before the mother could avail herself of the necessary care in a hospital (see paragraph 97 of the judgment).",
