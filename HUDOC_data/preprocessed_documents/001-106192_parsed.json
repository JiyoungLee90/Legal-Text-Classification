A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (Korolev v.  (no. 2), no.\u00a05447/03, 1 April 2010). Indeed, the underlying issue and the core of the applicant\u2019s complaint is the inconsistent case-law of the District Court in  as regards the right to fair wages and equal pay for equal work, that is, payment of the same salary increase granted to a certain category of police officers. The Court observes that this inconsistent adjudication stemming from the same jurisdiction affected many individuals in the same situation (see Raki\u0107 and Others v. Serbia, cited above, \u00a7 43). The Court further observes that this practice inevitably reduced public confidence in the judicial system and furthermore jeopardized the principle of legal certainty and equality of all before the law, which constitute fundamental attributes of the rule of law and are inherent in the Convention. Thus, this case is to be distinguished from the Ionescu case (cited above) that the Government refers to. In that case, which concerned access to a court in a case involving contractual issues between the applicant and a transportation company, the Court did not find that the applicant had suffered any significant disadvantage in the exercise of his right of access to a court (the financial loss was estimated by the applicant himself at EUR 90), or that respect for human rights required further examination in view of the already repealed impugned legislation and similar issues already resolved by this Court. Finally, the Court notes that the applicant in the present case was not obliged to have exhausted the constitutional complaint when he lodged his case before this Court as it was not considered an effective remedy at that time, nor would he be able to file it now because of the time limits for this avenue of redress.",

Whilst acknowledging that certain divergences in interpretation may be accepted as an inherent trait of any judicial system which, like the Serbian one, is based on a network of trial and appeal courts with authority over a certain territory, the Court notes that the conflicting interpretations in the applicants\u2019 cases stemmed from the same jurisdiction, namely, the District Court in Belgrade, and involved the inconsistent adjudication of claims brought by many persons in identical situations (see Vin\u010di\u0107 and Others v. Serbia, cited above, \u00a7 56; see also, mutatis mutandis, Tudor Tudor v. Romania, no. 21911/03, \u00a7 29, 24\u00a0March 2009). All this created a state of continued uncertainty, which in turn must have reduced the public\u2019s confidence in the judiciary. Finally, it would appear that even the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law on the matter had not effectively become consistent until, at best, the latter part of 2008 (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above), whilst formally this consistency had apparently never been secured in accordance with Article 40 of the Court Organisation Act (see paragraphs 16 and 26 above).",
