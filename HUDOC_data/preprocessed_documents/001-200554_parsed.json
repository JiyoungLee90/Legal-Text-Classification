She noted that the Court\u2019s case-law stated that pre-investigation inquiries had a number of shortcomings. In particular, if a pre-investigation inquiry was not followed by a criminal investigation, it alone was incapable of leading to the punishment of those responsible (she cited Zelenin v. Russia, no. 21120/07, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, 15 January 2015). Also, only a proper criminal investigation allowed for the whole range of investigative measures to be carried out, including questioning, confrontations, identification parades, searches, seizures and crime reconstructions (citing Lyapin v. Russia, no. 46956/09, \u00a7 132, 24 July 2014). A refusal to initiate a criminal investigation was found to be sufficient for a finding of a violation of Article 2 of the Convention under its procedural limb (citing Fanziyeva v. Russia, no. 41675/08, \u00a7 53, 18 June 2015). The applicant noted some of the deficiencies of the pre-investigation inquiry performed in her case. Firstly, the witnesses\u2019 explanations of the origin of the bruise on K.L.\u2019s shoulder had not been \u201cwitness statements\u201d in the sense that the witnesses had not been potentially criminally liable if they had given false testimony. The same was true for experts whose reports had been obtained within the framework of the pre-investigation inquiry. Furthermore, the pre-investigation inquiry had not examined K.L.\u2019s father\u2019s statements that following a request by the latter he had had to buy him cigarettes to give to senior officers and to send him money and that he had seen a bruise on his face. Those facts could have indicated that K.L. had been subjected to extortion and bullying and should have been properly investigated.",

The investigator had not found any evidence of bullying or other ill-treatment in respect of K.L. He had questioned K.L.\u2019s close relatives, friends and fellow service personnel, and ordered forensic examinations. Those actions had allowed the establishment of all the relevant facts. K.L. had apparently been suffering from depression owing to difficulties in his relationship and had committed suicide. Based on the results of the pre-investigation inquiry the investigator had found no elements of a criminal offence and had refused to initiate a criminal investigation. A copy of the above refusal decision had been sent to the applicant and she had had access to all the material of the pre-investigation inquiry.

Therefore, the State is also under an obligation to account for any injuries or deaths occurring in the army (see Beker v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a027866/03, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42 with further references). The Court has previously held that the failure to open a criminal investigation in a situation where an individual has died or has been seriously injured while in police custody is in itself a serious breach of domestic procedural rules capable of undermining the validity of any evidence which had been collected (see Fanziyeva, cited above, \u00a7 53 with further references, and Trapeznikova and\u00a0Others v. Russia, no. 45115/09, \u00a7\u00a7 34-36, 1 December 2016)). The present case is similar to such situations. As a result of the refusal to open a criminal investigation into K.L.\u2019s death, the investigating authorities never conducted a proper criminal investigation in which the whole range of investigative measures could be carried out, including questioning, confrontations, identification parades, searches, seizures and incident reconstructions. The Court has previously ruled that in the context of the Russian legal system a \u201cpre-investigation inquiry\u201d alone is not capable of leading to the punishment of those responsible, since the opening of a criminal case and a criminal investigation are prerequisites for bringing charges against the alleged perpetrators which may then be examined by a court (ibid.). Regard being had to the above and to the materials in its possession, the Court notes that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to come to a different finding in the present case. Accordingly, the Court does not consider it necessary to analyse every alleged deficiency in the domestic proceedings. The absence of a criminal investigation in the present case leads it to the conclusion that the Russian authorities did not take all reasonable steps to ascertain the circumstances in which K.L. died.",
