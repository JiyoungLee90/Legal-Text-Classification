It argued that she had raised that suspicion rather late in the proceedings, and that the Child Protection Centre\u2019s reports mainly relied on her and her mother\u2019s allegations. Furthermore, the Child Protection Centre\u2019s first report, dated 4 \u00a0March 2009, did not contain any information about alleged sexual abuse, while the reasoning in the second report, dated 14 March 2009, why certain observations of the children\u2019s behaviour would allude to sexual abuse by their father, was considered to be unsubstantiated. The District Court further held that the children\u2019s removal had been wrongful within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention and that C.B. had failed to establish that their return would expose them to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or otherwise place them in an intolerable situation pursuant to Article\u00a013 (b) of the Hague Convention.",

The court did not deny that the mother\u2019s adverse influence on the children regarding their father had also contributed to their negative attitude towards him. However, it also stated that the allegations of sexual abuse against him could neither be proven nor excluded. Regarding the statement on the applicant\u2019s mental health in the psychiatric opinion forwarded by the French Central Authority (see paragraph 72 below), the District Court considered that the report had not been drawn up in accordance with the Austrian standards for examining a person\u2019s educational skills as it had only been based on the applicant\u2019s interview with the expert and no psychological tests had been carried out. In contrast, the three expert opinions (see paragraph 52 above) were not only based on C.B.\u2019s allegations, but also on psychological tests of the children and their mother. However, in her examination of the case R. did not hold a meeting between the children and the applicant as such an interaction would have very likely resulted in the children being further traumatised.",

In August 2010 it had therefore requested that the French authorities provide the appropriate safeguards. According to the French Central Authority\u2019s answers by letters of 23 May and 8 July 2011, all conditions would be met to ensure that the children were returned without any risk; they also stated that the children would not be immediately entrusted to the applicant upon their return. The District Court concluded therefore that the children would temporarily be put into foster care, which was contrary to their best interests. It also pointed out that on 26 March 2012 it had held a hearing to discuss possible scenarios concerning the children\u2019s return to France and to consider alternative ways of reestablishing contact between the applicant and the children. Since the applicant had failed to attend the hearing without providing any excuse, the court assumed that the purpose of the proceedings seemed to be more for him to argue out his conflict with C.B. than for the children\u2019s return to France.

Switzerland ([GC], no. \u00a041615/07, ECHR 2010), the court stated that the possibility of the children being further traumatised, the serious difficulties that they would be likely to encounter under new living conditions in France and the lack of adequate safeguards were reasons why the return order could not be enforced. Instead, psychologically assisted contact between the applicant and the children should be slowly re-established in Austria.",

It observed that under the Hague Convention the court dealing with an application for return should act expeditiously when deciding it and, subsequently, when providing for the enforcement of an already issued return order. It would be contrary to that obligation if the court delayed or possibly impeded the return of a child by not ruling or by belatedly deciding the parties\u2019 requests. In that context, it noted that in the present case, after the District Court had delivered its decision on 13 August 2012, eleven months had already elapsed before the case eventually came before it.

Nonetheless, it noted that this development was mainly due to the fact that almost four years had elapsed since the return order had become final in October 2009. Therefore, the return order was still enforceable as long as it was not established that no adequate measures would be taken to protect the children\u2019s best interests upon their return to France. The Supreme Court therefore ordered the District Court to clarify whether the arrest warrant issued against C.B. in France could be lifted, to assess whether C.B.\u2019s mother in place of C.B. would be willing to accompany the children to France and care for them in a child protection institution, and to obtain the French authorities\u2019 assurance that the children could live in a child protection institution as close to the applicant as possible. It further held that it was for the applicant to apply to the competent authorities in France for temporary care for his children in a child protection institution, and that it was not for the Austrian courts to establish contact between him and the children under Article 11 (4) of the Brussels IIa Regulation since the establishment of contact for the purposes of the enforcement of a return order fell within the competence of the authorities of the State from which the children had been abducted.",

It held that C.B.\u2019s mother was unwilling to stay temporarily with the children in France after their return and that, in any event, C.B. had to start serving her prison sentence once she entered France. It further noted that the French authorities had formulated different ways of avoiding the children\u2019s separation from their mother, but could not give any guarantees in advance; instead, they had pointed out that C.B. first had to return the children to France before any concrete measures could be taken. The District Court therefore concluded that the French authorities had failed to devise an exact plan which, in particular, would avoid the children being immediately separated from their mother. Given that the children would probably be placed in a child protection institution in a (for them) foreign country and without any familiar caregivers around, there would be a severe risk of harm for them within the meaning of Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention if they were returned to France.",

However, it was now for the Austrian courts only to decide whether the requirements of Article 11 (4) of the Brussels IIa Regulation were fulfilled, namely whether the children could be returned to France without being separated from their mother. In this regard, it held that the District Court had correctly concluded that the requirements of Article\u00a011 (4) were not fulfilled, since the French authorities had not provided sufficient guarantees to ensure that the children would not suffer severe harm upon their return. It had not been established that the children could stay with C.B. while she was serving her prison sentence, and since their grandmother was unwilling to accompany them to France, they would be left without any caregivers familiar to them.",

The court considered that the District Court had already made sufficient attempts to obtain concrete guarantees from the French authorities as it was mainly their responsibility to take adequate measures. In particular, the French authorities should have given an undertaking that the decision of 7 January 2009 provisionally determining the children\u2019s main residence with their father would be revoked and that, despite the prison sentence, C.B. would be granted safe conduct in order to be able to participate in the custody proceedings in France. The Regional Court also considered that the applicant\u2019s conduct was not in the children\u2019s best interests either, since the enforcement of the decision of 7 January 2009 and C.B.\u2019s criminal conviction appeared to be more important to him than their well-being, and he did not even realise the seriousness of the burden to which he would expose his children if they were forced to return to him after not having seen him for more than six years. In sum, the Regional Court concluded that because of a lack of adequate \u201csafe harbour orders\u201d the children\u2019s return to France entailed a grave risk for them; furthermore, since they had meanwhile adapted well to living in Vienna, their uprooting would very likely also lead to a severe endangerment of their well-being.",

It reiterated that the return of the children could not be refused if it was established that the French authorities had made adequate arrangements to protect the children\u2019s best interests upon their return. However, if there remained doubts in this respect, the return would have to be refused.

Hence, C.B. would not risk immediate arrest if she entered France. The public prosecutor however noted that in any event C.B. would have to start serving her prison sentence, and that suspending it from the outset would not be possible. She could however apply to serve the sentence under electronic surveillance immediately after being imprisoned if she proved that she had a residence in France.

Such an order would overrule the decision of the Rochefort tribunal de grande instance family judge of 7 January 2009, which had determined that the children\u2019s main residence was with their father. As for C.B.\u2019s prison sentence, it was recommended that she or her counsel contact the competent public prosecutor in advance and already prepare the necessary applications, since it could not be excluded that she would be questioned by the judge in charge of the review of her punishment as early as on the first day of her detention.",

It further stated that the children would not be allowed to stay at the detention centre while C.B. was serving her sentence. During that time they would be cared for by their father or by the Youth Welfare Office. Instead of temporary foster care, the children\u2019s judge could order educational support in an \u201copen setting\u201d consisting of a team of social workers assisting the father with his children. If the exact return date was not communicated by the Austrian authorities in advance and an interim measure had to be adopted quickly due to C.B.\u2019s detention, the public prosecutor would have to order temporary foster care for the children and would have eight days to bring the case before the children\u2019s judge, who would then have to take the necessary steps.",

As more lenient measures, the court may also reprimand a party or threaten to take coercive measures. Section 110(2) allows for the use of reasonable direct coercion in the enforcement of custody rulings. However, direct coercion may only be used by judicial bodies and is in practice entrusted to specially trained bailiffs. The court may also request the Youth Welfare Office or the Juvenile Court Assistance Office for support in enforcing the custody ruling. According to the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law, the use of direct coercion, meaning the physical taking away of the child, is possible as a measure of last resort for the implementation of a return order. However, since the use of direct coercion constitutes a massive intrusion on the child\u2019s personal domain, a particularly cautious approach should be adopted when removing a minor from his or her previous living environment (judgment of 17 February 2010, 2 Ob 8/10f).",

Apart from one unsuccessful attempt on 7 December 2009, they had never taken any effective steps to locate C.B. and the children. At an early stage of the proceedings, they had allowed her to keep her addresses secret; however, the two addresses which had then been \u201crevealed\u201d as C.B.\u2019s places of residence had been fictitious. Furthermore, even though the courts had known her workplace they had never searched for her there. The applicant also stressed that the Austrian courts\u2019 measures of re-examining in a new set of proceedings whether the children\u2019s return would entail a grave risk for them had disregarded evidence and facts to the contrary, such as the expert opinion obtained by the children\u2019s judge at the La Rochelle tribunal de grande instance stating that the applicant did not suffer from any mental disorders, or the discontinuation of the preliminary proceedings against him for suspected sexual abuse of the children. The Austrian courts had therefore failed to comply with their obligation under the Hague Convention to act expeditiously, which had eventually led to a decision of nonenforcement due to the lapse of time.",

The obligation was, however, not absolute but required the State to take into account the interests of all those concerned, and in particular the well-being and the rights of the child as any obligation to apply coercion in this area had to be limited. The Government stressed that in the present case the Austrian courts had been obliged to enforce a return order which they had issued themselves; thus, they had been entitled to re-evaluate whether the children would be exposed to a grave risk of harm upon their return to France. The non-enforcement of a final return order could exceptionally be justified due to a change in the relevant circumstances. In view of the accusations raised against the applicant and the risk of the children being further traumatised if separated from their mother, confirmed by several expert opinions, the Austrian courts had been bound to ask the French authorities to take adequate measures to protect the children\u2019s well-being upon their return and to carefully examine any safeguards offered by them. At the same time, the courts had had to deal with numerous remedies lodged by both parties. The processing of the case had therefore been time-consuming. Notwithstanding the short time-limits laid down by the Hague Convention, the Austrian courts had been under an obligation to undertake an effective examination of the arguments submitted by the parties within the meaning of Article 11 (4) of the Brussels IIa Regulation in conjunction with Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention.

The Government asserted that due to the unsuccessful enforcement attempt of 7 December 2009 the District Court had focussed on re-examining the \u201cimminent risk for the children\u201d and on leading the parents to a mutual agreement. Therefore, the taking of further coercive measures would necessarily have aggravated the children\u2019s situation and would have been a risk for their wellbeing. The Government further argued that the applicant had not substantiated which specific obstructive behaviour of C.B. had to be sanctioned or specified which delay could have been prevented by further coercive measures. Lastly, the Government asserted that throughout the enforcement proceedings the applicant had not shown any willingness to accept an agreement with C.B. in order to re-establish contact between him and his sons and to facilitate the enforcement of the return order. During the whole proceedings the applicant had never applied to the courts for contact rights or clearly expressed his wish to see his children before their return to France.",

However, the obligation is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with a child who has lived for some time with the other parent may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken. The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all are always important ingredients. While national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests and the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention. In a situation where contact between parent and child might jeopardise such interests or infringe such rights, the national authorities are under a duty to ensure that a fair balance is struck between them (see Raw and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80; Maire, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-71; Sylvester, \u00a7 58; Ignaccolo-Zenide, \u00a7 94; and M.A. v.

The Court considers that the Austrian courts, in finding that C.B. had unlawfully removed the children, took into account both the children\u2019s and the father\u2019s interests in a reunion as well as the public interest in restoring the status quo of the habitual residence of a child in the event of wrongful removal and did not overstep their margin of appreciation.",

However, after this first unsuccessful attempt no further steps towards enforcement were taken. The Court accepts that coercive measures against children have to be limited in this sensitive area, but is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that because of the unsuccessful enforcement attempt, the domestic courts had to focus on re-examining the \u201cimminent risk for the children\u201d and on leading the parents to a mutual agreement as further coercive measures would have aggravated the children\u2019s situation. From the documents at hand, the Court observes that by a decision of 2 April 2010 (see paragraph 38 above) the District Court dismissed C.B.\u2019s request for non-enforcement of the return order. A fresh psychiatric opinion, dated 29 March 2010, indicating possible fear and panic reactions of the children contrary to their best interests upon their return, was submitted to the District Court on 26 April 2010 (see paragraph 41 above). Thus, there is no indication that, in the period between the time when the return order became final and the day of the unsuccessful enforcement attempt or in the course of the following months (see paragraphs 29 \u2013 38 above), new circumstances arose, which would have essentially differed from those known to the courts in the main proceedings and would have justified a reassessment of whether the children\u2019s return would entail a grave risk for them.",

Thus, they would not have been dependent on another enforcement request by the applicant after the first enforcement attempt had proven unsuccessful. The Court is also not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that at that stage of the proceedings the enforcement of the return order would already have implied the risk of the children being further traumatised. It observes that the first arrest warrant against C.B. was issued on 16 March 2010, around four months after the return order had become final. Thus, even assuming that in this period a possible separation of the children from their mother had already required special care to meet the children\u2019s needs, their return to France together with C.B. would not necessarily have implied an immediate separation from her. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that further steps taken by the domestic courts during this period, be they of a coercive nature against C.B., or requests for \u201csafe harbour orders\u201d addressed to the French authorities, would have facilitated the enforcement of the return order.",

Nonetheless, the domestic courts did not take any further steps to search for C.B., either at the private addresses which were known to the District Court, or at her workplace. It is true that the domestic authorities had to deal simultaneously with a number of remedies; however, in the specific context of return proceedings, it is for each Contracting State to equip itself with adequate and effective means to ensure compliance with its positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention as effective respect for family life requires that the future relations between parents and children are not determined by the mere passage of time. Moreover, without overlooking that the enforcement proceedings have to protect the rights of all those involved, with the interests of the child being of paramount importance, the lapse of time risks compromising the position of the non-resident parent irretrievably, and, as long as the return decision remains in force, the presumption stands that return is also in the interests of the child (see, for instance, IgnaccoloZenide, \u00a7 108; Sylvester, \u00a7 68; and M.A. v.

Nonetheless, the domestic courts continually pointed out that the allegations of sexual abuse had never been proven, and it could not be excluded that they had been raised by C.B. for tactical reasons.

The Court accepts that by then, due to the lapse of time, the domestic courts, having at hand several expert opinions relating to that issue, naturally considered that the children would very likely be further traumatised if they were separated from their mother upon their return. The Court notes in this connection that it was then for the domestic courts to decide whether appropriate safeguards in accordance with Article 11 (4) of the Brussels IIa Regulation were offered by the French authorities to exclude a severe risk of harm for the children upon their return within the meaning of Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention, and it would not be for the Court to substitute its own assessment of the appropriateness of these measures for that of the domestic courts.",

Whereas the return order was issued rather expeditiously and the enforcement attempt of 7 December 2009 was prepared and carried out swiftly, it subsequently took the domestic courts nearly five and a half years until they finally decided against enforcement of the return order.

Therefore, the Court cannot but conclude that the change in circumstances was primarily determined by the passage of time and that, having regard to the failure to adopt any further coercive measures, including location measures, in particular in the first set of enforcement proceedings, this was mainly attributable to the conduct of the Austrian authorities.
