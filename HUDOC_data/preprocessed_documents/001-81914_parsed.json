He averred that the latter had groundlessly discontinued criminal proceedings against high-ranking persons from the executive branch, and had exploited the Prosecutor's Office for the purpose of reprisals against political opponents of the ruling party and his own opponents. The applicant also claimed that the Chief Prosecutor had created a fearful and morbid working atmosphere in the Prosecutor's Office by acting rudely and insultingly towards his subordinates, even, as rumour had it, occasionally physically assaulting them. He further claimed that, according to certain rumours, the Chief Prosecutor had heavily beaten his former wife and a female judge. According to the same rumours, the Chief Prosecutor was mentally ill and suffered from paranoia, for which he had undergone treatment in a psychiatric hospital. According to the applicant, all these rumours had to be verified by the Supreme Judicial Council. The applicant also alleged that the Chief Prosecutor had deliberately tried to wreck the Criminological Studies Council by harassing members of its staff. The applicant further averred that the Chief Prosecutor and his entourage, who had repeatedly uttered threats against the late , were responsible for the latter's death. According to the applicant, that event had to be investigated with a view to determining whether the Chief Prosecutor had incited 's suicide, which was a criminal offence. Finally, the applicant submitted that he had intended to resign because of the bad atmosphere in the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office, but had eventually decided that the more proper thing to do was to continue performing his work and opposing the nuisance generated by the Chief Prosecutor from within.",

The Court further notes that the court examining the applicant's civil action against the Prosecutor's Office found that on the evening of 12 May 2000 S.D., a prosecutor from the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office, had gone to the applicant's office at the Courts of Justice building, had sealed it off and had advised the police officer on duty at the entrance not to let the applicant enter the building (see paragraphs 9 and 20 above). The court further found that, as a result, the applicant had not had access to his office between 12 and 15 May 2000 and that his draft resignation letter could have been taken from his desk and submitted to the Chief Prosecutor only by another person who had had access to his office during that time (see paragraph 20 above). On the basis of these findings made by the national courts, the Court is satisfied that at some point between 12 and 15 May 2000, most probably on the evening of 12 May 2000, the applicant's office was searched by officials \u2013 either the prosecutor S.D. or others \u2013 of the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office, who took the applicant's draft resignation letter from the drawer of his desk.",

In the Court's opinion, the applicant did have such an expectation, if not in respect of the entirety of his office, at least in respect of his desk and his filing cabinets. This is shown by the great number of personal belongings that he kept there (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, such an arrangement is implicit in habitual employer-employee relations and there is nothing in the particular circumstances of the case \u2013 such as a regulation or stated policy of the applicant's employer discouraging employees from storing personal papers and effects in their desks or filing cabinets \u2013 to suggest that the applicant's expectation was unwarranted or unreasonable. The fact that he was employed by a public authority and that his office was located on government premises does not of itself alter this conclusion, especially considering that the applicant was not a prosecutor, but a criminology expert employed by the Prosecutor's Office (see paragraph 5 above). Therefore, a search which extended to the applicant's desk and filing cabinets must be regarded as an interference with his private life.",

The national courts found that the person who had carried out the search, be it the same prosecutor S.D. or another person, had access to the Courts of Justice building, admittance to which was restricted, and was apparently connected to the Chief Prosecutor (see paragraph 20 above). The material obtained during the search was later brought before the Chief Prosecutor and was used by him to terminate the applicant's employment (see paragraph 12 above). In these circumstances, there is no reason to assume that the search was an act carried out by persons in their private capacity. It is immaterial whether the persons who carried out the search acted as public prosecutors or as representatives of the applicant's employer, the Prosecutor's Office, because in any event they were acting as agents of the State. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the responsibility of a State under the Convention may arise for the acts of all its organs, agents and servants. Acts accomplished by persons in an official capacity are imputed to the State in any case. In particular, the obligations of a Contracting Party under the Convention can be violated by any person exercising an official function vested in him (see, mutatis mutandis, Wille v.  [GC], no. 28396/95, \u00a7 46, ECHR 1999VII). The Court thus concludes that the search amounted to an interference by a public authority with the applicant's right to respect for his private life.",

On this point, the Court notes that the sealing off of the applicant's office took place outside the normal hours of business and within an extremely short timespan after the publication of his letter. The search took place either immediately before or shortly after the office had been sealed off. The applicant's dismissal, which was engineered on the basis of material obtained during the search, followed three days later, immediately after the weekend. During that time the applicant was not allowed access to his office (see paragraphs 912 above). This sequence of events appears significant to the Court, especially when weighed up against the contents of the applicant's published letter, in which he made grave accusations against the Chief Prosecutor and denounced certain workplace practices which the latter had established (see paragraph 7 above). Moreover, the Government did not exclude the possibility that the applicant's dismissal had been the result of the publication of his letter (see paragraph 49 above). The Court therefore concludes that the string of measures taken against the applicant was indeed a result of that publication and that these measures amounted to restrictions and penalties within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, that is, an interference with his freedom of expression.",

The Court does not consider that in the circumstances the notion of effective remedy went as far as calling for the opening of criminal proceedings against the persons who had carried out the search. Therefore, the refusal of the prosecuting authorities to open such proceedings (see paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 above) did not in itself amount to a breach of Article 13. However, the Court notes that the Government did not point to any other avenue of redress which the applicant could have used to vindicate his right to respect for his private life, nor did they refer to any relevant domestic court judgments or decisions. They have thus failed to show that any remedies existed in respect of the unlawful search in issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Vereinigung demokratischer Soldaten \u00d6sterreichs and Gubi v. Austria, judgment of 19 December 1994, Series A no. 302, p.\u00a020, \u00a7 53; and Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, \u00a7 154, 11 December 2003).

The refusal of the prosecuting authorities to open criminal proceedings pursuant to the applicant's request did not therefore entail a breach of Article 13. However, as already noted above, the Government did not point to any other avenue of redress whereby the applicant could have aired his grievances resulting from the search of his office.

However, the issue remains whether the proceedings in which he did so may be regarded as a remedy in respect of the alleged violation of Article 10 of the Convention. On this point, the Court notes that their subject matter was confined to determining whether the applicant had in fact tendered his draft resignation, as required for the termination of his employment to be valid under Article 325 \u00a7 1 (1) of the Labour Code (see paragraphs 20, 22, 24 and 28 above). Accordingly, the courts at all levels concentrated on this issue and did not discuss the substance of the applicant's freedomof-expression grievance. It is true that the applicant did not expressly plead that the termination of his employment had been a sanction for the publication of his letter, confining himself to a description of the context and the events leading up to his dismissal. However, he cannot be blamed for not doing so, as this was not part of the cause of action under Article\u00a0325 \u00a7 1 (1) of the Labour Code (see paragraph 28 above). On the other hand, it transpires from the description of the facts in his statement of claim that the impugned events were a result of his accusations against the Chief Prosecutor (see paragraph 19 above).",
