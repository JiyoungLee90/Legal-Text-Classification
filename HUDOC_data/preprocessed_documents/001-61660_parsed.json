A change in the composition of the trial court after the hearing of an important witness should therefore normally lead to the rehearing of that witness (P.K. v.

Thus, although these provisions have a certain relevance outside the strict confines of criminal law, the Contracting States have greater latitude when dealing with civil cases concerning civil rights and obligations than they have when dealing with criminal cases (see, for example, Dombo Beheer BV v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0274-B, p. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33).",
