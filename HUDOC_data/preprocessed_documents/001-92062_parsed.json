The court noted that, according to a certificate of an investigator of the Grozny Prosecutor\u2019s Office, enclosed in the case file, on 10 March 2000 officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and servicemen of the federal forces, in the course of the counter-terrorist operation in the Chechen Republic, had apprehended Mr Magomed Dzhabayev at his home and taken him to an unknown destination. At the same time on 18 April 2002 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Grozny established that Mr Magomed Dzhabayev had been apprehended by unidentified persons in camouflage uniform and an investigation was pending into these events. The court found that from the materials available it did not follow that there was any connection between the disappearance of Mr Magomed Dzhabayev and any allegedly unlawful actions by the State authorities.",

It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities\u2019 conduct (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0358, and Imakayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0164).",

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, \u00a7 64, Reports 1997III).",
