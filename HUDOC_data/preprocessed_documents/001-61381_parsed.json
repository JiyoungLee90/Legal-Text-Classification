However, in the present case the applicant bank had validly appealed against the ruling concerned to the Municipal Court, which had considered it on the merits. Seeing that the ruling was not reasoned, notification of it could not improve the procedural position of the applicant bank.

Under section 27, the CNB was empowered to impose compulsory administration on a bank if the bank's financial situation and liquidity failed considerably or repeatedly to satisfy the conditions laid down in the Act, and previous measures or sanctions had not remedied the situation. Under section 29(1), compulsory administration became effective on the date of the relevant entry in the Companies Register, the CNB not being required to notify the bank of its decision to place it in compulsory administration. Before registration, the decision to impose compulsory administration was published in the Commercial Bulletin. Section 29(2) provided that the functions of the bank's statutory body were suspended by the appointment of a compulsory administrator until the end of the compulsory administration. Under section 30, the compulsory administrator was entitled to take measures necessary to restore the stability and liquidity of the bank concerned, including closure of its branches or other administrative units. Under section 33, compulsory administration could be terminated by: (a) revocation, if there were no longer any reasons for its continuance; (b) expiry of the period originally fixed by the CNB, if that period had not been extended; and (c) withdrawal of the bank's banking licence.",

The Court observed that the disregarding of a company's legal personality would be justified only in exceptional circumstances, in particular where it was clearly established that it was impossible for the company to apply to the Convention institutions through the organs set up under its articles of incorporation or \u2013 in the event of liquidation \u2013 through its liquidators. Although the subject company was in the process of liquidation, it had not ceased to exist as a legal person at the time the shareholders lodged their application with the Commission and was at that time represented by its two liquidators, who had legal capacity to defend its rights and therefore to apply to the Convention institutions, if they considered it appropriate. There was, in the view of the Court, no reason to believe that the liquidators had not performed their duties satisfactorily and there was, on the contrary, sufficient evidence to show that they had taken all the measures which they considered to be in the interests of the insolvent company's assets. In these circumstances, the Court concluded that it had not been clearly established that at the time the application was lodged with the Commission it was not possible for the company to apply through the liquidators to the Convention institutions in respect of the alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

On the contrary, the complaint made relates to the very fact that a compulsory administrator was appointed at the instance of the CNB without a proper opportunity being granted to the bank which was the subject of the administration order to oppose it. Where, as in the present case, the essence of the complaint is the denial of effective access to court to oppose or appeal against the appointment of a compulsory administrator, to hold that the administrator alone was authorised to represent the bank in lodging an application with the Convention institutions would be to render the right of individual petition conferred by Article 34 theoretical and illusory.",

The functions of the bank's statutory organ were thereupon suspended and were assumed by the compulsory administrator, who was appointed at the same time and who alone could represent the applicant bank or authorise a legal representative. Accordingly, the Commission found that, even assuming that it was open to a court, in proceedings of review of decisions of administrative organs under Article\u00a0247 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to review the reasons for which the compulsory administration had been imposed, it was not reasonably possible for the bank (through its statutory organ) to lodge such a request for review since it would risk its rejection as having been introduced by an unauthorised person.",

It did not examine the reasons for which the compulsory administration had been imposed on the applicant bank and subsequently extended.

The Commission observed that the imposition on the applicant bank of the compulsory administration, and each successive extension of it, were measures which determined the bank's civil rights for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention and therefore gave rise to the latter's right of access to a court to challenge the reasons for the measures in question.

The Prague Municipal Court did not determine such a dispute and neither Mr Moravec nor the applicant bank itself were capable of being parties to the proceedings before that court. To criticise the Municipal Court, as the Commission did in the course of finding a violation of Article\u00a06 of the Convention, for not having used its competence to examine the reasons for which the compulsory administration had been imposed and extended, as if it were determining a dispute between the CNB on the one hand and Mr Moravec and the applicant bank on the other, is to reproach that court for something which formed no part of the proceedings before it. The essential function of the court under Article 200(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure, when deciding on matters relating to entries in the Companies Register, is not to determine a dispute concerning civil rights and obligations but to verify whether the conditions laid down in the relevant legislation for making an entry in the Register have been fulfilled. In matters relating to the Companies Register, the court does not deliver a\u00a0judgment or decision. Since the procedure is exclusively a written procedure and is in private, in the sense that there is no hearing, the final ruling of the court is not published. However, the ruling must be reduced to writing and notified to the party applying for registration, from which moment it becomes binding. While it is true that there exists a possibility of appeal from rulings of the court relating to the Companies Register, if by the ruling the application is granted in all respects, no appeal lies since an appeal can only be lodged by the party in whose favour the court has ruled.

It is true, as pointed out by the Government, that the decision of the CNB to place a bank in compulsory administration does not require those made responsible for administering the bank to use the bank's property in any different manner than before and that such a decision is designed only to prevent the existing management of the bank from improperly dissipating the assets of the bank concerned. Nevertheless, the Court is unable to accept the Government's argument that the decision of the CNB thereby affected only the rights of the existing management of the bank rather than the bank itself.",

The Court recalls in this regard that conformity with the spirit of the Convention requires that the word \u201ccontestation\u201d in the French text, which has no counterpart in the English text, should not be construed too technically and should be given a substantive rather than a formal meaning (see e.g., Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v.

Moreover, even if the use of the French term \u201ccontestation\u201d implies the existence of a disagreement, the Court finds that such a disagreement clearly existed in the present case, the applicant bank having sought to contest, through its former management, the decision to impose and extend the compulsory administration when it became aware of the rulings of the District Court.",

The Court however observes that the original decision, which was taken on 27\u00a0September 1993 and published in the Commercial Bulletin on 29\u00a0September 1993, contained a notice to the effect that administrative procedural provisions were not applicable and that no appeal lay against the CNB's decision. Moreover, as noted by the Commission, the decision became effective on 30 September 1993 when it was entered in the Companies Register pursuant to the ruling of the Prague 1 District Court. As from that date, the powers and functions of the statutory organ of management of the bank were suspended and transferred to the compulsory administrator, who alone was authorised to represent the bank and to appoint a legal representative to conduct proceedings on the bank's behalf. The Court observes that, in its judgment of 30 November 2000, the Supreme Court held that, until the date of entry in the Register, the applicant bank's own statutory body remained empowered to act on the bank's behalf (see paragraph 35 above). However, the Court notes that the entry was in fact made on the day after publication of the CNB's original decision in the Commercial Bulletin. In these circumstances, even assuming that the decision of the CNB was liable to be judicially reviewed and that in any such proceedings the civil courts would have had jurisdiction to review the grounds on which the compulsory administration had been imposed, the Court finds that the applicant bank had no practical possibility of bringing or pursuing such review proceedings through its statutory management body.",

It is not the role of the courts to examine the substantive reasons for which the compulsory administration has been imposed or subsequently extended.
