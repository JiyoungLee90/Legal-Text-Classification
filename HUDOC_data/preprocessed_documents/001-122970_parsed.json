The court therefore considered it necessary to restrict the applicant\u2019s parental rights, with reference to Article 73 of the Russian Family Code. The court rejected the applicant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s argument to the effect that it had not been proven that the applicant posed any danger to his son. It stated in this respect that Ms T.K.\u2019s request for the applicant\u2019s parental rights to be restricted was based not only on his psychiatric condition but also on his conduct, which demonstrated that he had avoided playing a part in the child\u2019s upbringing.",

The Government further argued that the interference was proportionate and \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d since it had the lawful aim of protecting the health and rights of a minor. The domestic courts established that the applicant and his spouse had not been fulfilling their parental duties due to their psychiatric disorders and difficult circumstances of life, and that D. had been in his grandmother\u2019s care since his birth. The courts took into account the applicant\u2019s representative\u2019s arguments as well as all the relevant factors, and reached a reasonable decision to restrict the applicant\u2019s parental rights. The Government pointed out that the applicant had withdrawn his claim to transfer his son into his care, as since the latter had been living with his grandmother from the day he was born, his separation from the grandmother could lead to a psychological trauma. Furthermore, the restriction of parental rights was a temporary measure that could be lifted should the circumstances change. However, the applicant never applied to have it lifted.",

So that the guardian could effectively fulfil these responsibilities, Article 75 of the Family Code subjected contact between the child and the parent(s) with restricted parental rights to the consent of either the guardian or, where a guardian has not been appointed, to the authority in whose care the child has been placed. Therefore, the decision to grant the applicant the right of contact with the child subject to the guardian\u2019s consent was in accordance with the domestic law. Should the applicant consider that the guardian had withheld consent unreasonably, it was open to him to challenge her actions before the custody and guardianship authority. However, the applicant did not make any complaints about the guardian\u2019s conduct. Furthermore, the applicant had been communicating with his son regularly by telephone; his son spent every other weekend with him, as well as some days every summer.

Given that this provision specifically applies to parents whose parental rights have been restricted, the Court does not find it unreasonable that the guardian should have the opportunity to deny such a parent contact with the child in a particular situation where specific circumstances might give reasons to believe that such contact would be detrimental for the child. At the same time the power of the guardian to withhold his/her consent must be subject to safeguards against abuse of this right. As pointed out by the Government, the applicant had the opportunity to challenge the guardian\u2019s conduct before the custody and guardianship authority, which was not contested by the applicant.
