Neither does the letter mention the names or ranks of the servicemen interviewed (see paragraph 78 above). Furthermore, it appears that the servicemen\u2019s oral submissions were taken at face value and were not independently checked by, for example, examining the checkpoints\u2019 logbooks. Hence, the Court finds that this document does not disprove the applicant\u2019s allegation concerning the abductors\u2019 military vehicles\u2019 unhindered passage through checkpoints located in Katyr-Yurt.

However, it transpires from witness interview records provided by the Government that early in the morning of 12\u00a0November 2002 a number of persons, including the deputy head of the local administration and an officer of the ROVD, put the local police on notice about the abduction of the Ilyasov brothers (see paragraphs 69, 71 and 72 above). The Court is thus satisfied that the police were notified of the abduction in due time. Accordingly, it was for them to report the incident to a prosecutor\u2019s office via official channels of communication that should exist between various law-enforcement agencies (see Khalidova and\u00a0Others v. Russia, no. 22877/04, \u00a7 93, 2 October 2008). However, it was not until 25 January 2003 that the police informed the district prosecutor\u2019s office, which launched an investigation on 29 January 2003, that is more than two months after the abduction. Such a delay per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event.",

It is obvious that, if they were to produce any meaningful results, these investigative measures should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. The delays and omissions, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0Turkey\u00a0[GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004XII).",

In particular, despite numerous credible witness statements about the abductors\u2019 use of military vehicles, including APCs, there is no indication that any genuine attempts have been made to identify those vehicles or their owners. As it has been already pointed out, the ROVD letter concerning the inspection of unspecified checkpoints not only does not permit the Court to establish whether those checkpoints were indeed located in Katyr-Yurt but suggests that the investigators limited themselves to interviewing unspecified servicemen and taking their statements at face value, without verifying them by, for example, checking the checkpoints\u2019 logbooks. It neither transpires that the investigation made any attempts to interview persons who could have provided information as to who had been permitted to pass through the town during curfew hours.",

Furthermore, the applicant, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Moreover, owing to the time which had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted.
