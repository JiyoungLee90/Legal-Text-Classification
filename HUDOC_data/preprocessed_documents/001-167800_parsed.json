The Government argued that the Bjelovar County Court had correctly held that there was no reason for the applicant to attend the session of the appeal panel. This was so because the applicant had been heard during the trial and had been awarded the opportunity to effectively participate in the first-instance proceedings. The Government also contended that since the prosecution had not appealed against the first-instance judgment and had not been summoned to the session of the appeal panel, the applicant had not been placed in a disadvantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis the prosecution. Moreover, they asserted that the Bjelovar County Court had not had the power to impose a more severe sentence on the applicant and, in view of the applicant\u2019s arguments in her appeal, it had had no reason to hear her in person.",

Croatia (no. 8067/12, \u00a7 94-102, 4 December 2014), the Court found, after a detailed examination of the Croatian system of appeal proceedings, that when an appeal court was called upon to make a full assessment of an applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence regarding the charges against him or her, in view of not only the arguments he or she had adduced before the first-instance court but also the arguments concerning the alleged failures of that court to establish all the relevant facts and to apply the relevant substantive and procedural rules correctly, this \u2212 as a matter of fairness \u2212 required the applicant\u2019s presence at the session of the appeal panel. Moreover, in the case of Loni\u0107 (cited above, \u00a7 100) the Court considered it irrelevant that the appeal against the firstinstance judgment had been lodged only by the applicant, since that did not affect the principal question brought before the second-instance court, namely whether the applicant was guilty or innocent, which, in order for the trial to be fair, required the applicant\u2019s presence at the session of the appeal panel.",

Moreover, she contended that the trial judge had erred in the factual findings and had failed to obtain certain evidence requested by her, as a result of which some crucial facts had been left undetermined (see paragraph 8 above).",

In this connection the Court reiterates that although this is not expressly mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 6, the object and purpose of the Article taken as a whole show that a person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d is entitled to take part in the hearing. Moreover, sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 3 guarantees to \u201ceveryone charged with a criminal offence\u201d the right \u201cto defend himself in person\u201d, and it is difficult to see how the applicant could exercise these rights without being present (see Sejdovic v.
