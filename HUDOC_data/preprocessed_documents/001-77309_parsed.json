Poland (dec) no.\u00a041413/98. 5 April 2001). In the present case, the applicant\u2019s repeated unsuccessful motions for exemption from the court fees for an expert opinion and her subsequent refusals to pay them resulted in the court\u2019s decision not to admit the evidence which the applicant had asked for.

The applicant did not contest the decision to stay the proceedings and did not ask the court to resume the proceedings until more than one year had elapsed from the date of the termination of the other set of proceedings. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that the domestic court\u2019s decision to stay the proceedings is open to criticism on the grounds, for example, that it could itself have resolved the ownership dispute in the context of the proceedings brought by the applicant. It is also to be noted that after resuming the impugned proceedings, the courts examined the case file diligently and there was no inordinate delay in the proceedings; three judgments were delivered within a period of 9 months.",
