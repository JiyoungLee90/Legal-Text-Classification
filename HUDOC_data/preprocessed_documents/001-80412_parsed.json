In this respect, the Court notes that following the evaluation made by the Forest Cadastral Commission, the whole of  was designated as forest area in 1968. Since no opposition was made, the decision became definitive in 1970 and this conclusion was annotated in the title deed registry (see paragraph 7 above). The Court also takes note of the fact that the applicant signed an agreement with C.\u00c7. in 1985, by which C.\u00c7. promised to sell the land in question to the applicant (see paragraph 8 above). Thereafter, on 12 August 1986 the Forestry Directorate initiated proceedings before the Ayval\u0131k Civil Court of General Jurisdiction against C.\u00c7. to annul the registration of his title. The applicant intervened in these proceedings on 23 February 1987 (see paragraph 19 above). It was only on 20 September 1989 that the applicant purchased the land in question and registered it in his name (see paragraph 10 above). Having regard to the above, the Court concludes that the applicant was aware that the land in question bore the characteristics of a forest. It is also an undisputed fact, that under Turkish law, private occupation of forests is prohibited.",
