A change in method of calculating pensions from the contributory one to the remuneration-based one (\u201cretributivo\u201d) was not to the detriment of the financial sustainability of the system. Thus, the changes brought about by the impugned Law sought to bring the relationship between pensionable remuneration and contributions into line with the system in force in Italy during the same period of time. The Law provided that remuneration received abroad (used as a basis for pension calculations) was to be adjusted by applying the same percentage ratios used for pension contributions paid in Italy during the same period. Thus, the norm made explicit what had been in the original interpretative provisions. Consequently, there had been no breach of the principle of legal certainty. Nor was the norm discriminatory since the acquired and more favourable rights of earlier pensioners were, by then, unassailable. Furthermore, the Law did not discriminate against people who had worked abroad, because it simply ensured an overall balance in the welfare system, and avoided a situation where people who had contributed relatively little to a foreign pension scheme were entitled to the same pension as those who had paid the much higher Italian contributions. The contested Law did not provide for any ex post facto reductions, as it merely imposed an interpretation which could already have been inferred from the original provisions. Lastly, this system still allowed for a sufficient and satisfactory pension, adequate for the lifestyle of a worker. Accordingly, the claim of unconstitutionality of the said Law was manifestly ill-founded.",

It considered that other, opposing interests which were also constitutionally protected and which related to the matter in issue prevailed in the circumstances of the case. It followed that there existed compelling general interest reasons justifying a retroactive application of the law. Indeed the effects of the new law were such as to avoid a welfare system which privileged some and was disadvantageous to others, guaranteeing respect for the principles of equality and solidarity, which because of their founding nature, occupied a privileged position when weighed against other constitutional rights. The impugned law was inspired by the principles of equality and proportionality and took into account the fact that contributions paid in Switzerland were four times lower than those paid in Italy. It thus applied a direct recalculation which allowed pensions to be dispensed in proportion to the contributions paid, thus levelling out any inequalities and rendering the welfare system more sustainable for the benefit of all its users. Even the ECHR had upheld this reasoning in the Maggio case in relation to the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, although it did not find it to be sufficient to avoid a violation of Article 6. However, unlike the Court, which is bound to examine complaints separately, the Constitutional Court had to take a global approach and evaluate a case on the basis of all the relevant constitutional guarantees. The claim of unconstitutionality was therefore unfounded. Indeed to conclude otherwise would not only have consequences on the pension system but would also go against the spirit of the Court\u2019s judgment in Maggio, which rejected the applicant\u2019s claims for a pension based on the previous calculation method.",

It thus posed a serious problem of coherence in relation to the evaluation of periods worked in Switzerland, in so far as Swiss salaries were subject to a contribution of 8%, compared with 32% for Italian salaries. It followed that the pensions of Italian people who had worked in Switzerland were overvalued vis-\u00e0-vis both other Italian workers who had paid contributions only in Italy and also Swiss workers who had paid lower contributions but who also received smaller pensions. That is why the Government enacted Law no. 296/2006, which provided that if contributions paid abroad were transferred to the Italian system in accordance with international agreements regarding social security, the remuneration of people having worked abroad, for the period during which they worked abroad, was to be determined by multiplying their paid-up contributions by one hundred and dividing that sum by the contribution rate applicable in Italy in the relevant period.

The instant case is also different from the case of OGIS-Institut Stanislas, OGEC Saint-Pie X and Blanche de Castille and Others cited by the Government, where the applicants also attempted to derive benefits as a result of a lacuna in the law, which the legislative interference was aimed at remedying. In those two cases the domestic courts had acknowledged the deficiencies in the law in issue and action by the State to remedy the situation had been predictable (\u00a7\u00a7 112 and 72 respectively).",

At that stage the State itself created a disparity which it tried to amend only twenty-four years later (and thirty-eight years after the enactment of the original legal provisions). Indeed it does not appear that there had been any timely attempts at adjusting the system earlier, despite the fact that numerous pensioners who had worked in Switzerland were repeatedly winning their claims before the domestic courts. In this connection the Court notes that before the enactment of Law no. 296/2006 the domestic courts had repeatedly found in favour of people in the applicants\u2019 position, and that interpretation of the relevant legal provisions (as confirmed by the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment of 6\u00a0March\u00a02004) had become the majority case-law. It follows that, given also that in the decades during which the application of the calculation concerned had been challenged in the domestic courts there had been a majority interpretation in favour of the claimants (save some first-instance decisions), in the present case, unlike in the above-mentioned cases, a legislative interference (shifting the balance in favour of one of the parties) was not foreseeable.",

Indeed, even accepting that the State was attempting to adjust a situation it had not originally intended to create, it could have done so perfectly well without resorting to a retrospective application of the law. Furthermore, the fact that the State waited twenty-four years before making such an adjustment, despite the fact that numerous pensioners who had worked in Switzerland were repeatedly winning their claims before the domestic courts, also creates doubts as to whether that really was the legislator\u2019s intention in 1982.",

As a consequence, according to the first applicant, between the years 1996 when he started receiving his pension and 2009, he received a monthly pension of EUR 873 as opposed to EUR 1,372 which he would have obtained had his proceedings not been interfered with and had he been successful, and for the year 2010 he received a pension of EUR 1,178 instead of EUR 1,900. On the basis of these calculations the Court observes that the first applicant lost considerably less than half of his pension.

Greece, no. 39574/07, 22\u00a0October 2009) and that, conversely, minimal reductions to a pension or related benefits are likely not to do so (see, for example, among many other authorities, Valkov and Others, cited above; Arras and Others v. Italy, no.\u00a017972/07, 14 February 2012; Poulain v. France (dec.), no. 52273/08, 8\u00a0February 2011; Lenz v. Germany (dec.), no. 40862/98, ECHR 2001X; and Jankovi\u0107, cited above). However, the fair balance test cannot be based solely on the amount or percentage of the reduction suffered, in the abstract.

Germany (dec.), no. 52449/99, ECHR 2001V (extracts) concerning the reduction of the applicant\u2019s pension rights under an additional pension scheme, and Da Concei\u00e7ao Mateus and Santos Januario v. Portugal (dec.), nos. 62235/12 and 57725/12 concerning the impact of the reduction of some subsidies on the applicants\u2019 financial situation and living conditions). In proceeding in this way the Court has found that even reductions of 65%, as substantial as that may be, did not in the specific circumstances of the case upset the said fair balance in the very exceptional context of a punishment of a convicted and dismissed policeman (see Banfield v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a06223/04, ECHR 2005XI concerning the forfeiture of part of the applicant\u2019s pension after his dismissal from the police force after a conviction).",

From the information publicly available it also appears that the minimum pension for that year amounted to EUR 5,993, that is, EUR 461 per month. The Court further notes that according to the European Committee of Social Rights, the amount of minimum pension (pensione minima) in 2011 stood at EUR 6,246.89 (EUR 520 per month).

Indeed, save for Mr Rodelli, all the applicants receive less than the average monthly pension in Italy, and six out of eight applicants receive less than EUR 1,000 per month. The difference in sums received between the applicants reflects their job category as well as the different periods of time they spent in Switzerland and in consequence the actual contributions they paid. In that connection, the Court highlights that the present case concerns contributory benefits, and while it is true that the Court no longer makes a distinction between contributory and non-contributory benefits for the purposes of the applicability of the provision (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2005X), when assessing a reduction of social security payments, it is indeed of significance that such pensions were based on actual contributions paid by the applicants (transferred to the relevant disbursing authority), albeit lower than those paid by others, and that therefore they were not a gratuitous welfare aid solely funded by the tax-payer in general.",

Through those actions, the Italian legislature deprived arbitrarily the applicants of their claims to the amount of pension which they could legitimately expect to be determined in accordance with the decided case-law of the highest courts of the land (see above paragraph 42), an element which cannot be ignored for the purpose of determining the proportionality of the impugned measure (see Maurice v.

The Court finds no reasons to hold otherwise in relation to people who moved to Switzerland. Furthermore, in the Maggio judgment (\u00a7 73), the Court also held that the impugned cut-off date arising out of Law no. 296/2006 was reasonably and objectively justified given that Law no. 296/2006 was intended to level out any favourable treatment arising from the previous interpretation of the provisions in force, which had given people in the applicants\u2019 position an unjustified advantage, bearing in mind the needs of the social security system in Italy.",

                        "content": "7.\u00a0\u00a0According to statistical data collected by the INPS for the year 2010[1], in Italy, 14.4 % of pensioners received pensions of less than EUR\u00a0500; 31 % of pensioners received pensions of between EUR 500 and EUR 1,000; 23.5 % of pensioners received pensions of between EUR 1,000 and EUR 1,500, while 31.1 % of pensioners received pensions of more than EUR 1,500. Those sums take into consideration all pensions received, such as old-age, invalidity and war pensions, etc. Therefore, in the present case, none of the applicants falls into the lowest pension bracket. However, even if they did, given that approximately 15% of the retired population gets by on less than EUR 500 per month, it cannot be said that pensions in that lowest bracket, and still less the old-age pensions actually received by the applicants (which fall into the more advantageous brackets), are at such a low level as to deprive the applicants of the basic means of existence (see, mutatis mutandis, Fiedler v. Germany and Mann v. Germany, nos. 24116/94 and 24077/94, Commission decisions of 15 May 1996, both unreported; see also, more recently, Koufaki and Adedy v. Greece (dec.), nos. 57665/12 and 57657/12, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, 7 May 2013). These data further prove the huge and unjustified disparity there would have been, to the advantage of the applicants, had the system not been amended. In that connection one cannot lose sight of the importance of maintaining a healthy and sustainable pensions framework for the good of society at large. The removal of discriminatory regulations and the control of public expenses by the State are legitimate aims for the purposes of securing social justice and protecting the State\u2019s economic wellbeing, and in implementing social and economic policies the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities in determining what is in the general interest of the community is a broad one (see Hoogendijk v. the Netherlands, (dec.) no. 58641/00, 6 January 2005).",

Bearing in mind the State\u2019s wide margin of appreciation in regulating the pensions system and all the factors mentioned above, and reaffirming the Court\u2019s findings in Maggio, cited above, I find that the applicants were not made to bear an individual and excessive burden.",
