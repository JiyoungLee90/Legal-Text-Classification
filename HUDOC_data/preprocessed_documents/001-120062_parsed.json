In doing so, the Court went to great lengths to devise an \u201cadditional rule\u201d, namely \u201c...whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability [of the admitted] evidence to take place\u201d (\u00a7 147 of the Grand Chamber judgment).
