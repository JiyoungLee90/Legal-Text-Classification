In those decisions the House of Lords affirmed the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that a procedural irregularity would not necessarily deprive the court of jurisdiction to make a confiscation order. Following publication of the decisions, counsel advised the applicant against continuing his appeal and withdrew from the case. However, with the assistance of his solicitors the applicant did continue the appeal. His solicitors sought leave to amend the grounds of appeal to include two further grounds: first, that the confiscation order was unlawful because it had been made in respect of facts constituting a substantive offence when the applicant had only pleaded guilty to the prior and distinct offence of conspiracy; and secondly, that the duration of the proceedings up to the date of the appeal had been unreasonably long, in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Mrs Justice Rafferty found that the Crown Court judge\u2019s reasons for extending the six-month time limit \u201cwere the proper administration of justice, based upon judicial availability. They explicitly were not for the purpose of allowing the Crown to secure more information\u201d. Applying R v. Knights and R v.

On\u00a021\u00a0November 2008 a High Court Judge dismissed the applicant\u2019s judicial review application. In particular, he noted that the slow progress of the appeal against the confiscation order was interrupted by the supervening decision of the applicant to seek leave to appeal out of time against conviction. As the application for leave took place within a reasonable time, the only period of delay which was both material and unexplained was the period between 24 June 2004 (the hearing of the application for leave to appeal against conviction out of time) and 21 July 2005 (publication of opinions of the House of Lords in R v.

Moreover, the Court notes that at the hearing on 3 August 2000 the applicant did not object to the listing of the confiscation proceedings on 13\u00a0October 2000, more than two months after the expiry of the six-month time limit. Finally, the Court observes that this period of delay was considered by the Court of Appeal, which concluded on 14 February 2006 that the Crown Court judge\u2019s reasons for extending the six-month time limit \u201cwere the proper administration of justice, based upon judicial availability. They explicitly were not for the purpose of allowing the Crown to secure more information\u201d. Applying R v. Knights and R v.

Consequently, this delay is not attributable to the conduct of the State authorities. Moreover, although applicants should generally not be blamed for exercising their legal entitlement to appeal, in the present case the Court notes that the application for leave to appeal was lodged more than three years out of time and in spite of advice from counsel to the effect that there were no grounds for the applicant to appeal against his conviction.

It also recalls that in the present case the , in its decision of 4 November 2008, indicated that this period of delay was \u201cboth material and unexplained\u201d. Although the Court recognises that this delay was entirely attributable to the delay in the related cases of R v. Knights and R v. Soneji, it notes that the Court of Appeal and House of Lords in those cases were at all times aware of the significant number of follow-up cases pending before the lower courts and would therefore have known that any delay in determining those appeals would have a knock-on effect on other cases. The Court does not, therefore, consider that the State can avoid responsibility for this period of delay in the applicant\u2019s case by attributing it to the delay in R v. Knights and R v. Soneji.
