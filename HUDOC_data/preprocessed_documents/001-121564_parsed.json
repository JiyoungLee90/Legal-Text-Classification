This Article provides, in its paragraph 1, that an award in respect of damage may be made against the State, without the claimant having to prove the fault of State officials, only in specific exhaustively listed situations, including an unlawful application of a custodial measure (compare Korshunov v. , no. 38971/06, \u00a7 61, 25 October 2007). The interpretation adopted by the Regional Court in the applicant\u2019s case was consistent with the textual reading of the Article: the Regional Court held that, since the applicant\u2019s detention had been found \u2013 in the Presidium\u2019s decision of 13 December 2006 \u2013 to have been unjustified rather than formally unlawful, paragraph 1 of Article 1070 did not apply.

Thus, the applicant was required to show that Judge K. had been convicted of a wrongful judicial act, which he was unable to do. It is apparent that, by issuing the arrest warrant without sufficient reasoning, Judge K. erred in the assessment of relevant facts but did not thereby commit any criminally reprehensible act which the applicant could have proven to the required standard of proof.",
