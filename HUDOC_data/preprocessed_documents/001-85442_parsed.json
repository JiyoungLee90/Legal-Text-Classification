Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor\u2019s office and the other law-enforcement authorities after the news of their detention had been communicated to them by the applicants contributed significantly to the likelihood of the disappearance, as no necessary steps were taken in the crucial first days and weeks after the arrests.
