The applicant applied to the London Borough of Southwark Council for assistance on 9 February 2007, on the basis that she had become unintentionally homeless. An unintentionally homeless person with a minor child would ordinarily qualify as being in priority need pursuant to section\u00a0189 of the Housing Act 1996 (see paragraph 13 below), and would thus be provided with suitable housing, usually within the locality. Those in priority need are considered to be a class of persons to whom reasonable preference must be given in the allocation of social housing. As there is a significant shortage of social housing in , those in priority need would generally be placed in temporary accommodation until appropriate social housing became available. In the case of the applicant, however, as her son was subject to immigration control, he was disregarded by the Council in the determination of whether the applicant was in priority need, in accordance with section 185(4) of the Housing Act 1996. On 14 March 2007 the Council decided that the applicant was not therefore in priority need and not entitled to social housing.",

As the applicant\u2019s son was not eligible, the applicant did not have a priority need. Consideration was also given to the question of whether the applicant was vulnerable for any other reason; however, it was found that the applicant was not hindered in the performance of everyday tasks by any medical problems and that she was no less able to fend for herself than the average person. There was therefore no special reason to find that she was entitled to homelessness assistance due to vulnerability. On 24 May 2007 the original decision was upheld.",

The local authority had refused to treat mother and daughter as being in priority need of homelessness assistance when they became unintentionally homeless, due to the daughter\u2019s immigration status. The Court of Appeal held that Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 and specifically sections 188, 189 and 193 were designed to protect the family lives of the homeless by ensuring that families who became unintentionally homeless were accommodated together. It therefore fell within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention. A majority of the Court of Appeal found that the basis of distinction between Mrs Morris, on the one hand, and the parent of a child who was not subject to immigration control, on the other, was either the national origin of the child, or a combination of statuses including nationality, immigration status, settled residence and social welfare. It was not considered necessary to decide finally whether there was one sole factor on which the distinction was based; the important point was that nationality was among the factors. As such, very weighty or solid justification was required if the distinction was to be found to be compatible with the Convention. The Court of Appeal found that, regardless of the precise basis of the differential treatment, the justification offered by the Government \u2013 the need to preserve immigration control and to prevent \u201cbenefits tourism\u201d \u2013 was not sufficiently weighty, nor was it a proportionate and reasonable response to the perceived problem. The discouraging of \u201cbenefits tourism\u201d or the \u201cover-staying\u201d of dependent relatives was an intelligible policy goal, but was not served by legislative measures which discouraged British citizens or those with a right of abode from coming to or remaining in the United Kingdom, because they could not accommodate their dependent relatives who were also lawfully permitted to be in the United Kingdom. Section 185(4) was found not to be a proportionate or even logical response to the perceived problem. The Court of Appeal observed that it was not apparent that the Government or Parliament had considered the potentially discriminatory impact of the legislation; however, even if such impact had been considered, it could not be considered to fall within even the very wide margin of appreciation that the Government enjoyed with regard to such matters.",

He too was excluded by section 185(4) from establishing a priority need for housing assistance because his child was subject to immigration control. Unlike Mrs Morris, however, at the time of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment, he had an ongoing need for assistance, being still prospectively homeless. This situation would not be alleviated by the declaration of incompatibility, since the impugned provision would remain in force until changed by Parliament. Mr Badu\u2019s case was therefore remitted by the Court of Appeal to the relevant local authority for reconsideration, with specific regard to whether he could be provided with accommodation under powers conferred upon the authority by other legislation.",

The changes addressed the incompatibility in so far as British citizens are concerned but meant that a person such as Mr Badu or indeed the applicant in this case, with indefinite leave to remain, would still not be considered to be in priority need of housing assistance if his or her eligibility was dependent on another person who was from abroad and subject to immigration control, such as the applicant\u2019s son. Moreover, in the case of a British citizen like Mrs Morris or a European Economic Area (EEA) or Swiss national, where the priority need resulted from a dependent child who was subject to immigration control, the local authority\u2019s duty to provide accommodation would be satisfied by the local authority procuring an offer of a tenancy from a private landlord, whether or not the applicant chose to accept such an offer. In cases where there was a dependent child who was not subject to immigration control, by contrast, the local authority\u2019s duty would not be discharged by procuring such an offer if the applicant chose not to accept it.",

The applicant, if considered to be in priority need, would have fallen into a class of persons entitled to be given reasonable preference for an allocation of social housing.

The Government further observed that at the time the applicant sought assistance, those identified as homeless spent on average 21 months in temporary accommodation, which was frequently property leased by the local authority from private landlords and then sub-let to tenants and could therefore be more expensive to tenants than even the private-sector tenancy obtained by the applicant, given the costs of leasing the property. Given that the applicant obtained an offer of social housing in March 2009, the Government submitted that she spent a similar amount of time in privately leased accommodation as she would have done had she been granted temporary accommodation and that it is possible that she would have paid a higher rent in such temporary accommodation than she had had to pay in the private accommodation she found with the assistance of her local authority. The Government emphasised the fact that the applicant and her son were never actually homeless and that there was other legislation which required local authorities to provide accommodation or other assistance to children who were in need. In the event of the applicant\u2019s son actually becoming homeless, the Government argued that there were means other than section 193 of the Housing Act 1996 by which he could have been provided with housing.",

The Court observes that, regardless of the amendments, the applicant\u2019s case would not have been handled any differently under the new legislation, since as she is not a British citizen or an EEA or Swiss national, the new limited duty brought in by section\u00a0193(7AA) of the Housing Act 1996 would not have applied to her. She would still not have been eligible for homelessness assistance under the amended legislation.

However, as the Court has previously held with regard to other social benefits (see, for example, Stec and Others v. the  (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2005-X), where a Contracting State decides to provide such benefits, it must do so in a way that is compliant with Article 14. The impugned legislation in this case obviously affected the home and family life of the applicant and her son, as it impacted upon their eligibility for assistance in finding accommodation when they were threatened with homelessness. The Court therefore finds that the facts of this case fall within the ambit of Article 8. In so finding, the Court notes the conclusion of the Court of Appeal at paragraph 25 of Westminster City Council v. Morris (see paragraphs 15-18 above) and further notes the fact that the Government agree that Article 8 applies to the instant case. The Court must therefore go on to consider whether the applicant was impermissibly discriminated against within the meaning of Article 14.",

Dealing first with the question of who is the appropriate comparator to this applicant, or the person to whom she was in an analogous situation, the Court notes that the applicant does not make an express submission in this regard. However, given her reliance on the case of Westminster City Council v. Morris (cited above), and contention that persons with indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom have an equivalent status to those with British citizenship, the Court assumes that she may well consider herself to have been in a relevantly similar position to a person, such as Mrs\u00a0Morris, who was a British citizen with a child who was subject to immigration control. The Court observes, however, its finding at paragraph\u00a039 above, according to which it is only the position under the Housing Act 1996 prior to its amendment that is relevant to the consideration of the applicant\u2019s case. The Court further notes that a person such as Mrs Morris would have been treated in exactly the same way as the applicant under the relevant provisions, in that they would not have been considered to be in priority need because their dependent child, being subject to immigration control, would have been disregarded under section\u00a0185(4) of the Housing Act 1996. There is therefore no differential treatment for the purposes of Article 14 if a British citizen with a child subject to immigration control is the appropriate comparator.",

Again, the Court observes that the applicant does not specifically state that she considers herself to be in an analogous position to such a person. However, the Court considers that such a person is a more relevant comparator than a British citizen, given that the submissions of both the Government and the applicant as regards the ground of distinction, considered below, focus on the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s status rather than that of the applicant, and also given that, but for the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s status, the applicant would have been considered to be in priority need of housing assistance. In any event, the Court does not consider it necessary to determine conclusively whether the applicant and her son were in an analogous situation to either of the comparators suggested above, for reasons which are expanded upon at paragraphs 48 to 51 below.",

The Government, on the other hand, contend that the basis for the differential treatment of the applicant was her son\u2019s immigration status which, being a purely legal rather than a personal status, did not amount to \u201cother status\u201d in terms of Article 14.",

Morris (see paragraphs 15-18 above) in relation to the ground of distinction, but notes that, firstly, neither of the judges who formed the majority of the Court of Appeal in that case reached an express conclusion as to whether nationality formed the sole ground for the distinction; and, secondly, that that case involved a British citizen rather than a person, such as the applicant, with indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. The Court finds that, on the facts of this applicant\u2019s case, the basis upon which she was treated differently to another in a relevantly similar position, who for the reasons given at paragraph 42 above is considered to be the unintentionally homeless parent of a child not subject to immigration control, was her son\u2019s immigration status. The Court specifically notes in this regard that the applicant\u2019s son was granted entry to the  on the express condition that he would not have recourse to public funds.

The Court has previously found that a person\u2019s place of residence constitutes an aspect of personal status within the scope of Article 14 (see Carson and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71), in spite of the fact that a person can choose their place of residence, meaning that it is not an immutable personal characteristic. Similarly, immigration status where it does not entail, for example, refugee status, involves an element of choice, in that it frequently applies to a person who has chosen to reside in a country of which they are not a national. The\u00a0Court further notes the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment in A. and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7\u00a7 182-90, ECHR 2009) in which, although it was not found necessary to consider the complaints under Article 14, the Grand Chamber nonetheless upheld the findings of the House of Lords that there had been impermissible discrimination on the grounds of nationality or immigration status. In so doing, the Court tacitly accepted immigration status as a possible ground of distinction within the scope of Article 14. Finally, the Court notes that it has in its previous case-law found that a large variety of different statuses, which could not be considered to be \u201cpersonal\u201d in the sense of being immutable or innate to the person, amounted to \u201cother status\u201d for the purposes of Article 14 (see Clift v. the , no. 7205/07, \u00a7 58, 13 July 2010, for a review of the Court\u2019s case-law on this question).",

The Court also points out its finding in the case of Ponomaryovi v.

The Court further notes that these classes cannot be considered as arbitrary or discriminatory. Those who have a fixed right to be in the United Kingdom, such as refugees or those with permanent, unconditional leave to remain, are entitled both to social housing and to housing assistance. Those whose leave to remain in the  is conditional on their ability to support themselves without recourse to public funds are not. The Court notes in this regard the applicant\u2019s argument that it is inconsistent that she should be eligible for social housing but not considered to be in priority need should she and her son become homeless. However, there is nothing arbitrary in the denial of priority need to the applicant when it would be based solely on the presence in her household of her son, a person whose leave to enter the United Kingdom, granted only a few months before the applicant\u2019s request for housing assistance, was expressly conditional upon his having no recourse to public funds. By bringing her son into the  in full awareness of the condition attached to his leave to enter, the applicant accepted this condition and effectively agreed not to have recourse to public funds in order to support her son. The Court upholds the Government\u2019s argument that it is justifiable to differentiate between those who rely for priority need status on a person who is in the United Kingdom unlawfully or on the condition that they have no recourse to public funds, and those who do not, and finds that the legislation in issue in this case pursued a legitimate aim, namely allocating a scarce resource fairly between different categories of claimants.",

In the event, the applicant, who had previously lived in private accommodation, moved with her son into other private-sector housing, the tenancy of which was secured with the assistance of the local authority. The Court notes that, had the applicant been eligible and considered to be in priority need, she would most likely have been housed in temporary accommodation, quite possibly also within the private sector, until a social tenancy became available. The private-sector tenancy obtained by the applicant was outside the Borough of Southwark due to the shortage of suitable private-sector housing within the borough. However, this may also have been the case had the applicant been deemed to be in priority need, and had there been no suitable accommodation available within the Borough of Southwark at the given time. In the applicant\u2019s case, she moved back to Southwark when she was offered a social housing tenancy seventeen months later, which was within a similar timescale as that in the case of a person accorded priority need.",
