In that regard, it is incumbent upon the relevant domestic authorities to ensure, in particular, that diagnosis and care have been prompt and accurate, and that supervision by proficient medical personnel has been regular and systematic and involved a comprehensive therapeutic strategy. The mere fact of a deterioration of an applicant\u2019s state of health, albeit capable of raising, at an initial stage, certain doubts concerning the adequacy of the applicant\u2019s treatment in prison, cannot suffice by itself for a finding of a violation of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article\u00a03 of the Convention, if, otherwise, it can be established that the relevant domestic authorities have in a timely fashion provided all the reasonably available medical care in a conscientious effort to hinder the development of the illness in question. A penal authority\u2019s failure to keep comprehensive records concerning a detained applicant\u2019s state of health or a respondent Government\u2019s failure to submit such records in their entirety would consequently allow the Court to draw inferences as to the merits of the applicant\u2019s allegations of a lack of adequate medical care (see, for instance, Blokhin v.

Following notification of the present application, the Government submitted a copy of the medical file on the applicant\u2019s treatment, fully accounting for the period in question. In other words, by disclosing all the information necessary for the assessment of the quality of the treatment in issue, the Government have discharged their burden of proof, assisting the Court in its task of factual determination, and the applicant\u2019s subsequent objections must be treated with caution (see Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072).",

During his time in hospital, which lasted three months, the prison\u2019s medical staff took good care of the applicant by having him undergo various laboratory screenings and tests and consultations with various medical specialists. Having been diagnosed with TB and HCV, the relevant specialists set out a particular plan of treatment for the applicant, which was then duly implemented by the prison medical staff. As a result of that treatment, the applicant\u2019s condition related to his TB significantly improved, which resulted in his discharge from the prison hospital on 12\u00a0February 2008 (see paragraph 30 above; compare Jashi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a067-69, and Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-81; and contrast, for instance, Poghosyan v.

After the applicant\u2019s discharge from the prison hospital, the medical personnel of prison no. 7 continued providing him with the relevant antibiotics for an additional five months. Throughout the period of his treatment, both on an inpatient and outpatient basis, the Prison Service regularly arranged for the applicant\u2019s sputum culture and sensitivity to be tested by the National Centre for Tubercular and Lung Diseases. The results of those tests confirmed the suitability of the ongoing treatment. All in all, upon completion of the relevant treatment plan, the applicant was cured of TB, a fact which was confirmed by the repeated sets of medical tests conducted between December 2008 and February 2010 showing no traces of the disease in his system.",

Thus, as early as November 2007, the relevant medical specialists opined that, given an incompatibility between the side-effects of anti-HCV drugs and the needs of the treatment against TB, as well as the fact that at that time the applicant\u2019s HCV was in a very early stage, the treatment for the latter infection should be postponed until after the completion of the anti-TB treatment. In November and May 2007 and June 2010, additional biochemical tests of the applicant\u2019s blood samples confirmed that the HCV\u2019s activity in the applicant\u2019s organism was consistently low. Being guided by the professional caution of the attending doctors, who informed the applicant of the possible side-effects of the anti-HCV treatment, the applicant made, in June 2010, a fully informed decision about the further postponement of the proposed treatment. All those circumstances clearly suggest that the Prison Service made use of a truly comprehensive therapeutic strategy to address the applicant\u2019s HCV (compare Jashi, cited above, \u00a7 69; mutatis mutandis, Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, \u00a7 79, 4\u00a0October 2005; and Popov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 26853/04, \u00a7 211, 13 July 2006).",

In this regard, it observes that the charge for possession of an illicit object in prison \u2013 the offence laid down in Article 378 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code \u2013 was confirmed, firstly, by the purported discovery of the knife in the applicant\u2019s bed by the prison officers during the search of his cell and, secondly, by the associated inference drawn by the domestic courts from the former fact that the knife necessarily belonged to the applicant. Consequently, and given in particular, the domestic courts\u2019 duty under national law to take into consideration all the circumstances of a criminal case, both for and against the accused, in an objective and thorough manner (see paragraphs 37, 38 and 57 above), any physical evidence and/or witness statements that could corroborate or refute the above-mentioned fact and inference were obviously relevant for the purposes of a fair trial. A similar duty is furthermore embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as well, whereby a criminal court, bound by a fundamental principle of in dubio pro reo, is expected to conduct a trial free from any preconceived idea of guilt of the accused and, in the event of doubt, always to decide in the latter\u2019s favour (compare, amongst other authorities, Topi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 51355/10, \u00a7 45, 10 October 2013, and Melich and Beck v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a035450/04, \u00a7 49, 24 July 2008).",

                                                "content": "63.\u00a0\u00a0The Court further observes that in his defence, the applicant chose to question the validity of both the search conducted by the prison officers and the inference that the discovered knife had necessarily belonged to him. To do so, he applied to have the domestic courts hear evidence from his cellmates. He explained, in particular, that, as his cellmates had had the possibility to observe the search, a fact acknowledged by the prison officers themselves (see paragraph 17 above), their testimonies might arguably have contained indications about possible arbitrary actions committed by the officers during the search. Alternatively, assuming that the knife had been found in his bed as a result of a faultlessly conducted search, the applicant asked the domestic courts not to make hasty conclusions about the identity of the owner of the weapon; he suggested that the knife in question could have been planted in his bed by somebody else the moment the prison officers entered the cell with the intention of conducting a search. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s application to have his cellmates examined before the court was not at all vexatious, but that it was directly relevant to the factual basis of the accusation against him as it could arguably have strengthened his line of defence (compare, mutatis mutandis, Polyakov, cited above, \u00a7 34, and Kuveydar v. Turkey, no.\u00a012047/05, \u00a7 42, 19\u00a0December 2017). In circumstances where the charge against the applicant was grounded on the assumption of his possessing an illicit object in his prison cell, the latter\u2019s wish to have his cellmates heard was nothing else but a reasonable attempt to challenge that key assumption in an effective manner (compare, mutatis mutandis, Popov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0183, and Topi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 45). This is particularly so in the light of the three following facts that rendered the overall fairness of the proceedings questionable. Firstly, the witnesses for the prosecution, the prison officers who had conducted the search of the applicant\u2019s cell, gave clearly inconsistent statements concerning the exact circumstances in which the penknife had been discovered. Secondly, the public prosecutor conceded himself during the trial that the video recording of the search did not establish with certainty whether the penknife had been found in the applicant\u2019s bed (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). Lastly, there was an apparent contradiction between the above-reffered video recording and the report on the search, which stated that the penknife had been found under the mattress on a bed (see paragraph 11 above).",

However, such grounds for the refusal, apart from constituting a negation of the above-mentioned duty to examine the case without any preconceived idea about the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence and always to decide in the event of any possible remaining doubt in the latter\u2019s favour (see paragraph 62 above), cannot be taken, in the light of the Court\u2019s relevant case-law under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, as adequate and sufficient reasons (compare, for instance, Polyakov, cited above, \u00a7 35; Grega\u010devi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 56; and Poropat, cited above, \u00a7 45). As a result of the domestic courts\u2019 unjustified refusal to hear evidence from the witnesses on the applicant\u2019s behalf, the latter was stripped of the only opportunity he had to challenge effectively the backbone of the accusation put forward against him. As to the remaining evidence mentioned by the Government \u2013 the video recording and the written record of the search of the applicant\u2019s cell and seizure of the knife \u2013 these two items, did not represent any additional, stand-alone direct evidence, and were therefore inconclusive of the applicant\u2019s guilt and cannot thus affect the assessment of the overall fairness of the procedure (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Dorokhov, no. 66802/01, \u00a7\u00a7 74 and 75, 14\u00a0February 2008, and Polyakov, cited above, \u00a7 36).",
