The Court also found a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 when the Moldovan courts examined a late appeal without giving compelling reasons for extending the time-limit for lodging the appeal (see Melnic v. Moldova, no. 6923/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-44, 14\u00a0November 2006). It also found in Dacia S.R.L. v.
