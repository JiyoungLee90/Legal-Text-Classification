Their unregulated way of life, in which they are abandoned entirely to their own fate, is a failing on Turkey\u2019s part. The Gypsies\u2019 current unordered way of life, and the fact that it is considered quite unnecessary to venture into their closed world in any way despite the long history we share, is a further shortcoming. Associated with this is the fact that while Gypsies have indeed lived for many years among us, they have been ostracised by local people and targeted by vilifying remarks which have, for the most part, been unenlightened and prejudiced. The negative response and distressing accusations which they encounter wherever they go have driven Gypsies, who already have a societal structure which is closed off from the outside world, to live in still narrower confines.",

It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy\u2019s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 145, ECHR 2005VII, and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2005XII). The Court further notes that as a result of their turbulent history and constant uprooting the Roma have become a specific type of disadvantaged and vulnerable minority. As the Court has noted in previous cases, they therefore require special protection (see D.H. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 182).",

He considered that these statements constituted an attack on his Roma identity. However, the Court observes that the case does not concern a difference in treatment, and in particular ethnic discrimination, as the applicant has not succeeded in producing prima facie evidence that the impugned publications had a discriminatory intent or effect. The case is therefore not comparable to other applications previously lodged by members of the Roma community (see, regarding education, ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0175210; regarding housing, Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27238/95, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2001I; and, regarding elections, Sejdi\u0107 and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 27996/06 and 34836/06, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2009). Accordingly, the main issue in the present case is whether the impugned publications, which allegedly contained racial insults, constituted interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life and, if so, whether this interference was compatible with the said right. The Court will therefore examine the present case under Article 8 of the Convention only.",

The applicant claimed that the book, and in particular the chapter providing information about the living conditions of Roma in different cities of , constituted an insult towards the Roma community. In dismissing this claim at two levels of jurisdiction the Turkish courts relied, inter alia, on a report prepared by seven university professors which found that the book in dispute was an academic study based on scientific research (see paragraph 25 above). They considered that the remarks and expressions were not insulting, were of a general nature, did not concern all Roma and did not constitute an attack on the applicant\u2019s identity (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above). Moreover, the Ankara Civil Court of General Jurisdiction found that the book examined the social structure of the Turkish Roma/Gypsy community and was based on scientific data (see paragraph 21 above).",

In this connection it is important to note, that while the author pointed to certain illegal activities on the part of some members of the Roma community living in particular areas, nowhere in the book did he make negative remarks about the Roma population in general or claim that all members of the Roma community were engaged in illegal activities. Furthermore, in different parts of the book, namely in the preface, introduction and conclusion, the author emphasised in clear terms that his intention was to shed light on the unknown world of the Roma community in Turkey, who had been ostracised and targeted by vilifying remarks based mainly on prejudice (see paragraphs 10-11 and 13 above). In view of the foregoing, and in the absence of any evidence justifying the conclusion that the author\u2019s statements were insincere, it was not unreasonable for the domestic courts to hold that he had put effort into his work and had not been driven by racist intentions (see, mutatis mutandis, Jersild v. Denmark, 23\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 298).",

In particular, the Turkish courts attached importance to the fact that the book had been written by an academic and was therefore to be considered as an academic work. In recent judgments, the Court has also stressed the importance of such works (see Sorgu\u00e7 v. Turkey, no.\u00a017089/03, \u00a7\u00a7 21-35, 23 June 2009, and Sapan v.
