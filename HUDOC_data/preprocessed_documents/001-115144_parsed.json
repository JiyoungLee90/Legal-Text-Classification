S.B. stated in those proceedings that the applicant\u2019s son had sold everything he had for drugs and had borrowed money from co-inmates, but not from him. According to S.B., the applicant\u2019s son, in order to get more money from his family, falsely reported to authorities that he and D.M. had been extorting money from him. This had had consequences for S.B. as he had been moved to Block 1 for eleven months. S.B. also admitted that he had met the applicant\u2019s son at the staircase on the day of his death. He said that the applicant\u2019s son had greeted him and that he in response had pushed him, saying that he did not have the right to greet him as he had been the reason for his transfer to Block 1. As there was insufficient evidence that S.B. had extorted money from the applicant\u2019s son, and in particular there was insufficient proof that the applicant\u2019s son had owed anything to S.B., the prosecutor eventually discontinued the proceedings (on 24 March 2010).

The written reasons given for the Prosecutor\u2019s decision, which is eighteen pages long, refer to, inter alia, statements by prisoners. While most of them did not indicate anything which would attract particular attention, two of them testified that the applicant\u2019s son prior to his death had mentioned to them that he was unhappy about not having a television, and that he had said he did not feel well, but did not mention suicide. One also said that the applicant\u2019s son had told him that he wanted to sue the Head of Block 1, S.\u017d. Prisoner I.N. said that the applicant\u2019s son had been addicted to heroin and spent EUR 40 to 50 on drugs per day. I.N. said that he had lent him EUR 470, and had taken his jacket as EUR 200 of it. The decision further refers to the analysis of the video recordings and to the limited contact between the applicant\u2019s son and S.B. It also notes that S.B. was sanctioned in disciplinary proceedings for an attack on the applicant\u2019s son. The decision moreover refers to statements by S.\u017d., who said during questioning by the police that he had been in daily contact with the applicant\u2019s son in the days preceding his death. After his return from Koper Prison, S.\u017d. had not noticed any changes in his behaviour which would indicate that he was a suicide risk. According to S.\u017d., the applicant\u2019s son wished to stay in a single cell and the fact that there was no light in cell 20 did not appear to bother him. Moreover, he seemed content on 13 August 2009, after being moved to a new cell. S.\u017d. also said that the applicant called the prison authorities on an almost daily basis, in particular before the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s transfer to Koper Prison, requesting her son\u2019s transfer and claiming that he felt unsafe. On the basis of the evidence in the file, the Prosecutor concluded that S.B.\u2019s behaviour had not caused the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s suicide. The Prosecutor also found that there was not the slightest indication that the applicant\u2019s son had been murdered. Furthermore, he noted that his accommodation had been determined in the standard procedure and not at the discretion of S.\u017d., that the prison staff had acted within their competences, and that S.\u017d. and J.P. had tried to make the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s accommodation as comfortable as possible in the circumstances. He established that the applicant\u2019s son had never been denied medical or psychiatric assistance. There was also no evidence of other acts alleged by the applicant, including the alleged extortion by I.N.",

However this fact does not appear to have played any role in the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s suicide, in particular as the latter took place after he had been moved to a new cell. The Court further notes that four months had passed from the last occasion on which he had threatened with self-harm. During this period he had spent some time in Koper Prison and then in a single cell in Block 1 in Dob Prison. There do not appear to have been any reports of abuse or attacks by fellow inmates after he was placed in a single cell, apart from the brief encounter with S.B. on the day of his suicide. S.B. appeared to behave violently towards the applicant\u2019s son, although no injuries were sustained by the latter. The authorities were unaware of this incident. It was not reported by the applicant\u2019s son, who also showed no obvious signs of distress afterwards. The incident was observed on video recordings only after the suicide. The Court regrets that contact between the applicant\u2019s son and S.B., who had a previous history of conflicts, was made possible and that the incident of 14\u00a0August 2009 had not been immediately reported by the guards to the prison administration. The Court is also struck by the fact that drugs were circulating in the prison and were relatively easy to access for prisoners. However, it does not find these oversights sufficient to vest the domestic authorities with responsibility for the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s death.",

According to official records, Mr Ketreb was suffering from a personality disorder known as \u201cborderline status\u201d and from anxiety dysphasia, had twice tried to kill himself by hanging and had been involved in serious violent incidents including self-inflicted wounds which showed a worrying aggravation of his mental state. He had openly and unequivocally threatened to commit suicide and he had recently learned about his conviction to five years\u2019 imprisonment. Mr Ketreb was therefore in need of strict surveillance in order to protect him from suicidal attempts; however, the psychiatric service had not been consulted before placing him in a disciplinary cell and the latter had not been searched in order to confiscate objects (in particular, a belt) which the prisoner could have used to commit suicide. By contrast, the applicant\u2019s son had not been diagnosed as suffering from any psychiatric condition, had not attempted to kill or harm himself and had not been placed in a disciplinary cell. His suicidal tendencies had been expressed only once, on 9 February 2009 (see paragraphs 21 and 86 above), which is more than six months before the date of his death. Following his statement, he was transferred to a cell with video surveillance and the day after he declared that he had no intention of committing suicide and that he had calmed down (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). No similar need for strict surveillance can therefore be found in the case of the applicant\u2019s son.",

As to allegations of lack of medical or psychiatric care, the Court notes that there is no indication in the case file that the care provided to the applicant\u2019s son was not appropriate or adequate. The applicant did not point to any unanswered requests for assistance or any relevant omission on the part of the authorities. As regards her complaint concerning overcrowding in prison, the Court refers to its findings in Lali\u0107 and Others, cited above, in which it found the general conditions of detention in the closed wing of Dob Prison to be adequate vis-\u00e0-vis Convention standards. The Court also notes that there is no indication that the applicant\u2019s son had insufficient space in the cells in which he had been held.

Both the Convention and the rules of procedure are silent as to the standard of proof this Court should adopt in determining complaints made thereto. In respect of alleged violations of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, the former Commission adopted the criminal standard of \u2018proof beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 in the Greek case. That standard was subsequently applied by the Court over thirty years ago in Ireland v the United Kingdom and it has continued as a \u2018constant\u2019 within the Court\u2019s case law ever since. Some commentators have argued, robustly, that the common-law standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt adopted in criminal trials has no place in the scrutiny of the human rights\u2019 responsibilities of states conducted by an international court of non-criminal jurisdiction. This Court is not a criminal court trying individuals charged with criminal offences and expecting victims of serious violations to prove their allegations \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 places upon them an onerous and unfair burden. Compelling as such arguments are, I find myself bound to apply the standard of proof which this Court has consistently required. Consequently, although I have considerable misgivings about the care afforded to the applicant\u2019s son whilst a vulnerable detainee in the custody of the respondent State, I cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it was responsible for his death.",

Firstly, although distinguishable from the deceased in Keenan v. the United Kingdom or Ketreb v. France in that the applicant\u2019s son was not diagnosed with a specific psychiatric condition, he was, nevertheless, a vulnerable person with a chemical dependency whose condition required particular care on the part of the authorities. Having threatened to commit suicide after altercations with two other prisoners, he should not have been transferred to the same block in which they were detained or, at the very least, he should not have been exposed to defenceless encounters with them. One would hope that, henceforth, where a vulnerable prisoner threatens to commit suicide following conflict with other detainees, the authorities will take particular care to ensure that unsupervised contact between such prisoners is not made possible.",

It is evident from the judgment that narcotics are, relatively, easily accessible to prisoners within that facility. With that knowledge, the prison authorities cannot wash their hands of the adverse consequences that flow from their \u201ctoleration\u201d of the problem. Vulnerable individuals with chemical dependency will continue to feed their addiction (rejecting, as did the applicant\u2019s son, alternative methadone programmes) and drug pushers will, in their characteristic way, continue to exploit such persons. This entire scenario cannot but have contributed to the overall desperate situation in which the applicant\u2019s son found himself. Whilst I cannot, beyond reasonable doubt, fix the respondent\u2019s state with responsibility for his death, I can hope that it will address the obvious deficiencies in the existing regime in the light of the events in this case.",
