Even if, as the judgment concludes, the factors adduced by the Government fell short of establishing that the situation in French Polynesia necessitated the interference in question, we take the view that circumstances in a territory such as this one, at the distance it is from metropolitan France and in the political atmosphere which existed at the time, may because of potential consequences for public order or territorial integrity amount to \"local requirements\" within the meaning of Article 63 (art. 63) to which \"due regard\" should be paid. We would not, however, go so far as to conclude that the paying of \"due regard\" to such circumstances should of itself lead inescapably to a finding that the interference was justified in this case. What it would do is more to condition the approach to be adopted in considering the question of possible justification under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).",

The judgment asserts, without supporting reasoning, that Mrs Piermont\u2019s \"possession of the nationality of a member State of the European Union and, in addition to that, her status as a member of the European Parliament do not allow Article 16 (art. 16) of the Convention to be raised against her, especially as the people of the OTs take part in the European Parliament elections\" (paragraph 64). It thus, in effect, adds by judicial action a new immunity to those which the member States saw fit to provide for members of the European Parliament by the terms of the Protocol of 8 April 1965 on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities (paragraph 35). We cannot subscribe to this approach. Mrs Piermont, a German national, was at the relevant time (before, as the judgment acknowledges, a European citizenship was recognised by the Community treaties) indubitably an alien in the eyes of French law, notwithstanding her status as a member of the European Parliament (and the elections for which campaigning was in progress were not elections to the European Parliament). We consider, therefore, that Article 16 (art. 16) has to be regarded as at least of some relevance: its reference to \"aliens\" is unambiguous and without express exception; and convincing grounds would be required for an exception to be inferred. We are not satisfied that such grounds exist.",

Account must be taken of the increased internationalisation of politics in modern circumstances, and, so far as the present case in particular is concerned, of the interest which nowadays an MEP may legitimately have in the affairs of a Community territory. In the light of these developments, limits may have to be admitted to the restrictions on the political activity of aliens permissible under Article 16 (art. 16). With this in mind, and having regard to the approach adopted by the Court in its Groppera Radio AG and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 28 March 1990 (Series A no. 173) to the interpretation of the third sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 10 (art. 10-1), we would accept that the object and purpose of Article 16 (art. 16) should, like that sentence, be examined in the context of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2). In particular, when the proportionality of the interference with Mrs Piermont\u2019s freedom of expression is under consideration, account should be taken of the principle embodied in Article 16 (art. 16).",

There was an atmosphere of considerable tension in French Polynesia at the time and the intervention of the applicant in the election campaign could reasonably be regarded as liable to provoke disorder. For this reason she had been asked by the authorities, on her arrival in the territory, to be discreet in her public statements.

Since her detention at the airport prior to the making of the order and thereafter until the departure of her flight for Tokyo was a necessary part of the process of denying her, legitimately in terms of Convention obligations (as the Court has found), entry into the territory, it did not amount to an interference with rights under Article 10 (art. 10): she had not, because of the exclusion, become entitled to exercise such rights there.
