In that case the applicant brought three such actions complaining of poor detention conditions, in three separate periods, in remand prison IZ-39/1 of Kalingrad. One action was discontinued without the examination on the merits. Two others were dismissed as being manifestly ill-founded. The domestic courts' findings were based on the grounds that, firstly, the overcrowding, which was the subject of the complaints, had been caused by a lack of financial resources needed for reconstruction of, and repair works in, the remand prison; secondly, the facility administration had not been responsible for the lack of financing, and, thirdly, the administration could not refuse to admit detainees \u201cwhen the maximum capacity of the facility had been exceeded\u201d (see Artyomov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14146/02, \u00a7\u00a716, 18, 31 and 33, 27\u00a0May 2010). The Court, having observed the circumstances of that case and the domestic civil law, came to a conclusion that as a remedy, civil proceedings for damage caused by poor detention conditions could rather be considered theoretical and illusory than adequate and effective in the sense of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see ibid, \u00a7\u00a7 110-112).",

Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. Yet it cannot be said that detention on remand in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention. Nevertheless, the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a v.
