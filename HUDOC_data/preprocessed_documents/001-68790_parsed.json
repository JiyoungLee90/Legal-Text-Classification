Mr Chikviladze shouted an order to close the door quickly. He asked that it be left closed until such time as he had reported the situation to his superiors in the Prisons Department. Mr Dalakishvili, who did not understand the reason for such violence, believed that a riot was about to begin and increased the number of wardens on the floor in question.",

According to Mr Mskhiladze, this was explained by the fact that, at the request of the Ministry of Security's investigation team responsible for examining the illegal border crossing, the Procurator-General's Office had submitted a request for assistance in that criminal case to the Russian authorities, in accordance with the Minsk Convention. The request, accompanied by the applicants' photographs and fingerprints, was intended to identify the persons concerned and had been drawn up at the end of August 2002. Given that the extradition request, supported by photographs of the applicants and other documents, had been submitted on 6\u00a0August 2002, Mr Mskhiladze did not believe that the two sets of photographs could be the same.",

In addition, according to the Georgian Ministry of Justice, those individuals did not possess, and had never possessed, Georgian nationality. The Ministry for Refugees had also indicated that they were not on the refugee list. Thus, the extradition orders of 2 October 2002 had not resulted from a hasty procedure.

Firstly, the criminal case against Mr Shamayev, Mr Khadjiev, Mr\u00a0Adayev and Mr Vissitov was still pending before the domestic courts (see paragraph 108 above) and the court to which the case had been remitted should correct the violations found by the Court of Cassation before the Court ruled on the application. Secondly, given that their signatures had been forged by Ms Mukhashavria and Ms Dzamukashvili, the above-named applicants had never applied to the Court (see paragraph 230 above). In addition, the Court had disregarded Mr Khadjiev's rights by failing to \u201cofficially communicate\u201d his case, as submitted by Mr Kotov, to the respondent Governments (see paragraph 235 above). Since the lawyer of Mr\u00a0Khadjiev's choice had accordingly not been permitted to take part in the proceedings, even though he had not resorted to forgery, the Court had no procedural basis for ruling on the merits of the disputed matters.",

Before agreeing to the extradition of the five applicants, the Procurator-General's Office had taken the necessary measures to obtain as many firm assurances as possible from the Russian authorities to the effect that those individuals would not be sentenced to death or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In support of this claim, the Government referred to the terms of the letters from the Russian Procurator-General's Office dated 26 and 27 August and 27 September 2002 (see paragraphs\u00a068 et seq. above).

In such cases, the Court seeks to ascertain whether the death penalty itself amounts to ill-treatment as prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. It has already established that Article 3 cannot be interpreted as generally prohibiting the death penalty (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, pp. 40-41, \u00a7\u00a7 103-04), since that would nullify the clear wording of Article 2 \u00a7 1. That does not, however, mean that circumstances relating to a death sentence can never give rise to an issue under Article 3. The manner in which it is imposed or executed, the personal circumstances of the condemned person and a disproportionality to the gravity of the crime committed, as well as the conditions of detention while awaiting execution, are examples of factors capable of bringing the treatment or punishment received by the condemned person within the proscription under Article 3 (see Soering, cited above, p.\u00a041, \u00a7 104). Attitudes in the Contracting States to capital punishment are relevant for assessing whether the acceptable threshold of suffering or degradation has been exceeded (see Poltoratskiy v. Ukraine, no. 38812/97, \u00a7\u00a0133, ECHR 2003V). The Court has also found that, as a general principle, the youth of the person concerned is a circumstance which is liable, with others, to put in question the compatibility with Article 3 of measures connected with a death sentence (see Soering, cited above, pp. 40-43, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a010308).",

France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 95, ECHR 1999V). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3, and the assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case (see also paragraph 338 above). Treatment is considered to be \u201cinhuman\u201d if, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering (see, inter alia, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2000XI). The Court wishes to emphasise that a State is liable for all persons in detention, since the latter, in the hands of the State's employees, are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (see Berktay v. Turkey, no. 22493/93, \u00a7 167, 1 March 2001, and Alg\u00fcr v. Turkey, no. 32574/96, \u00a7 44, 22 October 2002). However, the Court cannot ignore the potential for violence in a prison setting, nor the threat that disobedience on the part of inmates may well degenerate into bloodshed requiring the prison authorities to enlist the help of the security forces (see Sat\u0131k and Others v. Turkey, no. 31866/96, \u00a7 58, 10 October 2000). Nevertheless, in respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Tekin v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998IV, pp. 1517-18, \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 53, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000IV).",

The Court considers it established that the use of force occurred between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. and that it was preceded by peaceful attempts on the part of the prison staff to persuade the prisoners to comply with the order to leave the cell (see paragraphs 124, 147 and 148 above).",

Nor, in view of the photographs of the cells in Prison no. 5 (see paragraph 20 above), the assessment report on cell no. 88, the expert report and the statements by various witnesses (see paragraphs 96, 144 et seq. above), does it doubt that the applicants had armed themselves with various objects, including bricks and pieces of metal, with a view to opposing their possible extradition. In those circumstances, the Court accepts the Georgian Government's argument that the intervention of fifteen members of the special forces, armed with truncheons (see paragraphs 124, 151 and 159 above), could reasonably be considered necessary to ensure the safety of the prison staff and prevent disorder spreading throughout the rest of the prison. Nonetheless, it must now consider whether this necessity was not primarily the result of acts or omissions by the authorities themselves.",

Towards three or four o'clock in the morning, prison staff, including the prison governor, ordered the applicants to leave their cell, giving fictitious reasons (disinfection or search), even though a vehicle was already waiting in the neighbouring prison courtyard to transport four of them for transfer to the Russian authorities (see paragraphs 124 and 148 above).

The collective resistance which they offered to the State employees seems to have been linked to the legitimate fears that they experienced at the idea of their extradition (see paragraph 340 above). In the light of the evidence in its possession, the Court considers that the tactic of trickery and speed adopted by the Georgian authorities was intended to trap the applicants and, by presenting them with a fait accompli, to avoid complications (see, mutatis mutandis, \u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041 and 42, ECHR 2002I; Bozano v.

On the contrary, the authorities' attitude, and the manner in which they managed the extradition enforcement procedure, incited the applicants to riot (contrast Caloc v. France, no. 33951/96, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000IX). In the Court's opinion, the recourse to physical force in such circumstances cannot be regarded as having been justified by the prisoners' conduct.",

Mr Khanchukayev also had a fractured left shoulder. Mr Issayev had bruising to the face, especially around the right eye. Mr Khashiev and Mr Baymurzayev showed no traces of violence. However, according to their representatives, Mr Baymurzayev, who ordinarily suffered from a serious deformation of the jawbone, was hospitalised on account of a fracture to that area (see paragraphs 106 and 208 above). Mr Kushtanashvili had not been examined by the doctor in question.

Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998VIII, pp. 3271-72, \u00a7 11) and the fracture to the left shoulder sustained by Mr Khanchukayev indicate that those applicants' injuries were sufficiently serious to amount to ill-treatment within the scope of Article 3 (see A. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998VI, p. 2699, \u00a7 21, and Ribitsch v.

This is a minimum safeguard against arbitrary treatment. This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5: by virtue of paragraph 2 any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4.

As such, being intended to ensure the continued existence of the matter that is the subject of the application, the interim measure goes to the substance of the Convention complaint. As far as the applicant is concerned, the result that he or she wishes to achieve through the application is the preservation of the asserted Convention right before irreparable damage is done to it. Consequently, the interim measure is sought by the applicant, and granted by the Court, in order to facilitate the \u201ceffective exercise\u201d of the right of individual petition under Article 34 of the Convention in the sense of preserving the subject matter of the application when that is judged to be at risk of irreparable damage through the acts or omissions of the respondent State. It is implicit in the notion of the effective exercise of the right of application that for the duration of the proceedings in  the Court should remain able to examine the application under its normal procedure (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7 108). Indications of interim measures given by the Court, as in the present case, allow it not only to carry out an effective examination of the application but also to ensure that the protection afforded to the applicant by the Convention is effective; they also subsequently allow the Committee of Ministers to supervise execution of the final judgment. Such measures thus enable the State concerned to discharge its obligation to comply with the final judgment of the Court, which is legally binding by virtue of Article 46 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 125). Thus, in Mamatkulov and Askarov, the Court concluded that a failure by a Contracting State to comply with interim measures is to be regarded as preventing the Court from effectively examining the applicant's complaint and as hindering the effective exercise of his or her right and, accordingly, as a violation of Article 34 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0128).",

Indeed, the Court's fact-finding visit does not replace national supervision by the European supervision introduced by the Convention, but amounts to a procedural measure in the context of that supervision. Through its system of collective enforcement of the rights it establishes, the Convention reinforces, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the protection afforded at national level (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.

Any application which does not do so may be declared inadmissible on this ground alone\u201d (Philip Leach, Taking a Case to the European Court of Human Rights, London, 2001, p. 85). We imposed fairly strict rules on the two Governments with regard to compliance with procedural formalities. Procedural rigour and the principle of equality of arms required the same attitude towards the applicants' representatives. However, I have not found convincing arguments in the judgment to justify the indulgence shown. The result has been that, even at the point of adopting its judgment, the Court has been obliged to refer occasionally to two surnames in respect of the same individual and to take pains to avoid mentioning the nationality of such or such an applicant.",

In my opinion, this conclusion, based on factual conjecture (the \u201cgeneral situation in Chechnya\u201d as described in paragraphs 364 and 366) and legal speculation (a fairly superficial interpretation of the validity of the Russian Constitutional Court's judgment of 2 February 1999), is also based on a value judgment concerning a deterioration of the situation in the region (see paragraph 367) and there is no justification for it in the Court's case-law. In Mehemi (no. 1), the Court found that there would be a potential violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) if the applicant (who had family ties in France) were to be extradited (see Mehemi v. France (no. 1), judgment of 26\u00a0September 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VI); this is not the case here.
