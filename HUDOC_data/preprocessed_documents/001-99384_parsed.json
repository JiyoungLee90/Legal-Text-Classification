It is true that the  on both occasions did not address the specific issue of the non-insertion of a mark or the insertion of a straight line. However, the Court notes that in its judgment of 20 April 1993 the Constitutional Court did not accept the argument that the recording of marks for religion in school reports amounted to a breach of the principle of separation of Church and State and the principle of the State's neutrality. The Constitutional Court further considered that the recording of such marks did not give rise to an issue as regards the right not to reveal one's religion or convictions as provided in section 2 (5) of the Freedom of Conscience and Religion Act. In these circumstances, the Court finds that any attempt to mount a successful challenge to the issue of the non-insertion of a mark for \u201creligion/ethics\u201d would be futile.

Norway ([GC], no. 15472/02, ECHR\u00a02007VIII). The Government stressed firstly that in accordance with paragraph 1(1) of the Ordinance, religion or ethics classes could be provided only at the request of parents or of pupils who had reached the age of majority. Secondly, the teaching of religion or ethics could be organised only if sufficient numbers of parents (pupils) expressed such a wish (see relevant domestic law and practice above). The Government submitted that in cases where it was particularly justified, either of these optional subjects could be organised in a different manner from that specified in the Ordinance, depending on the resources available to the local authority which ran the school. There was no obligation to organise such classes where there were insufficient numbers of interested pupils in a municipality, if the latter did not have adequate resources to cover the costs involved. Having regard to the above, the Government maintained that the school authorities or the authority which administered the schools attended by Mateusz Grzelak had not been obliged to organise a course in ethics for him, given that there were not enough interested pupils in the same school or municipality.",

The authorities should do their utmost to minimise the risk of a child's stigmatisation because he or she did not follow a religion/ethics course. It was the school's duty to provide pupils who did not follow a class in religion or ethics with care and supervision whenever they were on the school premises.

The Court has frequently emphasised the State's role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society (see Leyla \u015eahin v.

The Court has accepted, as noted above, that Article 9 is also a precious asset for non-believers like the third applicant in the present case.

The Court considers that the absence of a mark for \u201creligion/ethics\u201d would be understood by any reasonable person as an indication that the third applicant did not follow religious education classes, which were widely available, and that he was thus likely to be regarded as a person without religious beliefs. The Government in their submissions indicated that the vast majority of religious education classes concerned Roman Catholicism. The fact of having no mark for \u201creligion/ethics\u201d inevitably has a specific connotation and distinguishes the persons concerned from those who have a mark for the subject (see, Sinan I\u015f\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7 51).

The amended Ordinance introduced the rule that marks obtained for religious education class or ethics would be included in the calculation of the \u201caverage mark\u201d obtained by a pupil in a given school year and at the end of a given level of schooling. In this respect the Court observes that the above rule may have a real adverse impact on the situation of pupils like the applicant who could not, despite their wishes, follow a course in ethics. Such pupils would either find it more difficult to increase their average mark as they could not follow the desired optional subject or might feel pressurised \u2013 against their conscience \u2013 to attend a religion class in order to improve their average. It is noteworthy in this respect that the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 2 December 2009 referred to the risk that the choice of religion as an optional subject could have been the result of pressure from local public opinion, but nevertheless did not address this issue as lying outside its jurisdiction (see paragraph 48 in fine above).",

In that case the Court reviewed under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 the arrangements for a compulsory subject in Christianity, Religion and Philosophy taught during the ten years of compulsory schooling in . The model existing in  is different in a number of respects. Religious education and ethics are organised on a parallel basis, for each religion according to its own system of principles and beliefs and, at the same time, it is provided that teaching of ethics is offered to interested pupils. Both subjects are optional and the choice depends on the wish of parents or pupils, subject to the proviso that a certain minimum number of pupils were interested in following any of the two subjects. The Court notes that it remains, in principle, within the national margin of appreciation left to the States under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to decide whether to provide religious instruction in public schools and, if so, what particular system of instruction should be adopted.

The failure to provide classes in ethics as such does not reveal a breach of either Article 14 in conjunction with Article 9 or of Article 9 alone. It follows that I will, as the majority did, confine myself to issues relating to the giving of marks for \u201creligion/ethics\u201d or rather the absence thereof, which is a consequence of the fact that classes in ethics were not available.",

An additional basis for finding difference in treatment would seem to be offered in paragraph 96 where it is mentioned that there is a difference in treatment because a mark for \u201creligion/ethics\u201d was factored into the calculation of a pupil's average mark, whereas a pupil like the third applicant not attending \u201creligion/ethics\u201d did not have this possibility.",

On the one hand, there are pupils who attended religious classes and received a mark for their performance. On the other hand, there is the applicant whose parents, in the exercise of their rights to freedom of conscience and religion i.e. under Article 9 of the Convention, decided that he should not attend classes on religion and received no mark in consequence since an alternative class in ethics was not available. For the purpose of giving marks for a particular subject, which is the relevant situation in this case, pupils who do not attend a particular class are not in the same situation as those who do attend. Also, as regards the calculation of the average mark after 1 September 2007 I fail to see a difference in treatment that would fall within the ambit of Article 14. In both groups only subjects that a pupil has completed are included in the calculation of his or her average mark. The possible positive or adverse impact of not having followed a course on religion or ethics, and not having received a mark as a result, could have on the applicant's average is a matter of pure speculation. Everything would hinge on his performance in the subject. The mere possibility that if he scored well enough his average might be increased cannot as such be a sufficient basis for finding a difference in treatment under Article 14. Accordingly, there is in my view, as regards marking or the calculation of an average mark, no difference in treatment of persons in relevantly similar or analogous situations. Having come to this conclusion there is no need to examine the facts of the case any further under Article 14 of the Convention.",

The Court declared the complaint manifestly illfounded (see also C.J., J.J. and E.J. v. , no. 23380/94, Commission decision of 16 January 1996, DR 84, p. 46).

However, it has not been substantiated that the school authorities can be held responsible for this. Furthermore, the third applicant's parents are declared agnostics in a society that is predominantly Catholic. The case file does not indicate that they had specific reservations about revealing their convictions. On the contrary, the parents have visibly pressed hard to have their rights as non-believers asserted. Although of course this is their right they cannot have it both ways.

The non-attendance of a particular class is reflected by the fact that the relevant space is left blank or a straight line is used.
