Thus, even without an express complaint from the applicant, a duty to investigate had already arisen at that stage. This is so because Article 3 of the Convention requires an official investigation in cases where there are sufficiently clear indications that illtreatment might have occurred (see Velev v.

The investigative committee did not interview the applicant and K., who had allegedly witnessed the applicant\u2019s beatings, and did not order the applicant\u2019s forensic medical examination. It offered no explanation to the applicant\u2019s injuries, as was acknowledged by it (see paragraph 16 above). Its most recent decision was similar to the previous decisions which had been annulled because they had been based on incomplete inquiries. In upholding that decision in the proceedings under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the domestic courts relied on the dismissal of the applicant\u2019s allegations of police ill-treatment by the trial court in the criminal proceedings against him (see paragraph 18 above), while the trial court in doing so had relied on the subsequently overruled refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers (see paragraphs 20-21 above).
