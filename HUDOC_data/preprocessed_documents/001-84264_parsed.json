However, it should be recalled that the Convention system does not envisage a mechanism to challenge legal provisions in abstracto, but only in relation to the specific application of such laws to the particular circumstances of an applicant's situation (see, among others, Brogan and Others\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 29 November 1988, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0145B, p. 34, \u00a7\u00a053).

The Court notes that the relevant provisions of the CCP did not entitle the parties to submit any additional comments on each others' submissions. Consequently, even if the applicant had had prior knowledge of the respondent's reply, she would not have been able to submit to the Supreme Court any further arguments with a view to influencing the forthcoming examination of her case. More importantly, the Supreme Court did not take into account any of the respondent's arguments when addressing the applicant's cassation claim (see paragraph 20 above). Consequently, it cannot be said that, in the course of the examination of her cassation claim, the applicant was put in a weaker position than her adversary.",
