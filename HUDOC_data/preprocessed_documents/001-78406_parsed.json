Greece (dec.), no. 62503/00, 26 September 2003). These considerations can be equally pertinent to the enforcement of judgments against the companies, which did not enjoy sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State or in respect of which the ban on the attachment of property was applied (see, for instance, Mykhaylenky and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 35091/02 and others, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2004-..., and Rudenko v. , no. 11412/02, \u00a7\u00a025, 29 November 2005). In the latter cases, the Court held that the enforcement of judgments was hindered because of the State's failure to take some budgetary or legislative measures, rather then by shortcomings in the enforcement procedure (see Romashov, no. 67534/01, \u00a7\u00a031, 27 July 2004).",

The Court further notes that in the Ukrainian legal system neither the courts nor the bailiffs have power to overrule the law or to compel the State to amend its Budget laws. Even assuming that the applicant instituted the enforcement proceedings, the execution of the judgment against that debtor company would be substantially impeded due to the above Law (see Solovyeva v.\u00a0\u00a0, no. 32547/03, \u00a7\u00a025, 13\u00a0December 2005).",
