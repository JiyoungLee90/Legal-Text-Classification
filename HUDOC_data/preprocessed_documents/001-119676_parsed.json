Although the applicant\u2019s detention may have initially been justified on these grounds, after a certain amount of time had elapsed the courts were obliged to give specific reasons for continuing her detention. Instead, they repeatedly relied on the same grounds for nearly five years throughout the applicant\u2019s time in detention, advancing such grounds for its continuation as the necessity to investigate the case further without analysing whether the applicant\u2019s situation had changed.",

It also refers, in very general terms, to the fact that the applicant \u2018was prescribed treatment for her illnesses\u2019. However, such broad and general references are made without any attempt to identify the actual treatment prescribed for each of the illnesses diagnosed thus making it impossible to determine whether such treatment, if administered, was either requisite or adequate. The judgment notes, for example, that the applicant was diagnosed with, inter alia, chronic gall-bladder disease and chronic pancreatitis whilst in prison. However, it contains no consideration of whether she received any treatment, specifically, for these conditions and, if so, whether that treatment was adequate. This level of generality and vagueness when dealing with such a fundamentally important right under the Convention is not sufficient to enable me to conclude that the State\u2019s obligation to provide \u2018requisite medical treatment\u2019 to the applicant has been discharged.",

These specific claims are not denied by the respondent State. Indeed, it confirms that the applicant was diagnosed with, inter alia, severe myopic astigmatism and retinal angiosclerosis and was advised to wear glasses as of August 2005, a fact noted by the majority (\u00a7 67). Notwithstanding this uncontested medical diagnosis and advice, on the Government\u2019s own submission, it took the authorities some eight months (April 2006) to conduct a \u2018selection\u2019 of spectacles for the applicant. It is not known whether any glasses were actually selected and, if so, whether they were adequate or, indeed, whether they were ever even supplied to the applicant (\u00a7 67).

Being diagnosed with myopia of medium severity, the applicant, without glasses, was able to attend to himself and move around but, clearly, could not read or write normally. The Court accepted that being without his own glasses for two and a half months and being deprived of new glasses which had been prescribed for him for a further two and half months, must have created a lot of distress in the applicant\u2019s everyday life and must have given rise to a feeling of insecurity and helplessness.
