Its scrutiny is limited to consideration of the impugned measures in the context of the applicant\u2019s Convention rights, taking into account the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting States (see P\u0142oski v. Poland, no.\u00a026761/95, \u00a7\u00a038, 12 November 2002). At the same time the Court emphasises that, even if a detainee by the very nature of his situation must be subjected to various limitations of his rights and freedoms, every such limitation must nevertheless be justifiable as necessary in a democratic society. It is the duty of the State to demonstrate that such necessity really existed (ibid \u00a7 35).",
