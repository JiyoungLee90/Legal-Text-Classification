Even in its decision to release the applicant, the Regional Court refused to examine the applicant\u2019s allegations of breaches of domestic law and the Convention because of the bar created by Article 372 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure then in force, and did not specify any reasons for the applicant\u2019s release (see paragraph 24 above). The release order could thus be interpreted as an acknowledgement that the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s remand was open to question, but it did not constitute an adequate judicial response for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see, mutatis mutandis, ibid., \u00a7\u00a0101).
