As to the applicant\u2019s conduct, it observes that the hearing of 2 March 1995 was adjourned until 15 February 1996 due to a legitimate impediment of the applicant\u2019s counsel. Even if this adjournment was requested by the applicant and he may be considered partly responsible for the delay which resulted, this cannot justify the delay of almost one year in rehearing the case (see the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2552, \u00a7 79). The Court moreover notes that the hearing of 16\u00a0June 1994 was postponed to 1 March 1995 by reason that the lawyers were on strike from 13 until 18 June 1994. In this respect, the Court recalls that a delay in the criminal proceedings caused by a lawyers\u2019 strike cannot be attributed to the State, whereas the period of time elapsed between the end of the strike and the new hearing is to be imputed to the conduct of the authorities (see the Portington v. Greece judgment of 23\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p.\u00a02633, \u00a7\u00a033). The Court is not unaware of the complications which strikes may cause by overloading the list of cases to be heard by courts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Papageorgiou v. Greece judgment of 22\u00a0October\u00a01997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2291, \u00a7 48). Nevertheless, having regard to the fact that the following hearing was fixed at 1 March 1995, which is more than eight months after the end of the strike, the Court considers that this period must be imputed, at least partly, to the State\u2019s authorities.

Moreover, the hearing of 15 February 1996 was adjourned by the Magistrate\u2019s own motion first until 23 January, then until 10 July 1997. These delays, which amount to a global period of more than two years and five months, cannot be excused by the volume of work with which the Cosenza District Court had to contend at the relevant period. In this respect, the Court recalls that Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (Portington v.\u00a0Greece judgment of\u00a023\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2633, \u00a7 33).
