If a domestic system bars access to a court, the Court will verify that the dispute is indeed such as to justify the application of the exception to the guarantees of Article 6. If it does not, then there is no issue and Article 6 \u00a7 1 will apply irrespective of whether the applicant seeks reinstatement or some other form of pecuniary redress (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 61-62; see also Efendiyeva v. , no.\u00a031556/03, \u00a7 42, 25\u00a0October 2007).
