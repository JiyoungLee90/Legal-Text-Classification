Instead, the Constitutional Court focused on the constitutional requirement to have available an effective remedy against an unlawful, unjustified or disproportionate deprivation of liberty. Under Russian law there were two types of penalty of administrative removal: the controlled-departure procedure and the mandatory-removal procedure. The latter could be accompanied by a decision by the trial judge to issue an order with a view to enforcing the penalty; that decision was enforceable immediately. The use of such detention had to be in compliance with the requirements of proportionality; be based on good reasons; and correspond to the requirement of the reasonableness of legal regulations and practical application. The Constitutional Court also pointed out that such detention was not automatic but remained at the discretion of the judge who had to find that it was necessary for ensuring the enforcement of the penalty of removal, having due regard to all the pertinent circumstances. The Constitutional Court then noted that it was indeed the case that under Russian law a trial judge was not required to put a time-limit on a detention order and that it was not excluded that such detention could continue after the expiry of the two-year period for enforcement of the penalty. A judge could not legally discontinue enforcement of a penalty where no country was ready to accept a defendant. The absence of judicial review of detention contributed to the uncertainty which was present in the applicable legislative framework. The Constitutional Court required the federal legislature to amend the CAO without delay by making provision for effective judicial review.",

As regards general measures, the Russian authorities submitted that they were considering the necessity of legislative reform, setting a time-limit for detention in centres for aliens pending removal. As regards the violations of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 4 of the Convention found in Kim (cited above), the Russian authorities indicated in Action Plan,  that the judgment had been translated, published and disseminated to the competent authorities and that an assessment by them of the need for legislative reform was to take place by December 2015. Following that assessment, a report was submitted to the President of the Russian Federation in August 2016, including proposals for legislative amendments. As a result, by an Order of 26 October 2016 the Government instructed the Ministry of the Interior to prepare a draft law \u201cOn Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences\u201d concerning detention with a view to expulsion and deportation as well as appeals. The draft is due to be finalised by December 2017.",
