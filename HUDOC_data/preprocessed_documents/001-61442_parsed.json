Since then he had been a target for the PKK, although he acknowledged that he had been able to move around freely in Diyarbak\u0131r. He had changed his identity and was initially provided with a little financial assistance by the gendarmerie, from Commander E\u015fref Hatipo\u011flu. He knew that, if he gave false testimony as a confessor, an additional 5 year term of imprisonment could be added to his original sentence.",

However, its findings after its visit in 1994 demonstrated that torture and other forms of ill-treatment were still important characteristics of police custody. In the course of visits in 1996, CPT delegations once again found clear evidence of the practice of torture and other forms of severe ill-treatment by the police. It referred to its most recent visit in September 1996 to police establishments. It noted the cases of seven persons who had been very recently detained at the headquarters of the anti-terrorism branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate and which ranked among the most flagrant examples of torture encountered by CPT delegations in Turkey. It concluded that resort to torture and other forms of severe ill-treatment remained a common occurrence in police establishments in Turkey.",

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see the Aksoy v.

Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual cases. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicants did everything that could reasonably be expected of them to exhaust domestic remedies (cf. the above cited judgments: Akdivar and Others v.

Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and its Protocols, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 \u00a7 2 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see, among other authorities, the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A, no 25, p. 65, \u00a7163, and the Selmouni v.

The Court recalls in this regard that, in respect of persons deprived of their liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by their own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see the Ribitsch v. Austria judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, p. 26, \u00a7 38, the Tekin v. Turkey judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, \u00a7 53, and the Selmouni v.

France judgment cited above, \u00a7 96). However, as the Court has further observed, certain acts which were classified in the past as \u201cinhuman or degrading treatment\u201d as opposed to \u201ctorture\u201d could be classified differently in the future: the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably requires greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies (ibid. \u00a7 101).",

Notably, Mr Hatipo\u011flu simply dismissed allegations of this type (paragraphs 307 and 315-316 above) and the Public Prosecutors generally considered such matters to be a mere defence tactic (Prosecutor Haney at paragraph 357 above and, purportedly, Chief Prosecutor Sel\u00e7uk at paragraph 565). Judge Ural made no assessment or investigation of the applicants' clear claims to him, only drawing conclusions as to their remand in custody (paragraphs 508-531 above). Moreover, the State Security Court failed to reach any conclusion regarding the applicants' allegations of ill-treatment, adjourning the criminal proceedings against them for five years should they remain of good behaviour (paragraph 77 above).",

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation (see the Assenov v.

If this were not the case, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice, and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (ibid.). Such an investigation should therefore be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible.",

On the one hand, the applicants argued that the Law established a special regime which applied throughout Turkey, including the state of emergency areas, and which required that investigations relating to lawyers should be carried out directly by Public Prosecutors even in matters unrelated to their professional activities. In this regard, reliance was placed on the circular of the Ministry of Justice of 14 February 1994 (paragraph 586 above) which reiterated and emphasised this requirement.

No written records were produced of any communications between the Prosecutor's Office and the gendarmerie relating to the decision to detain, whether in the form of requests or instructions or otherwise; the only written authorities to detain which were referred to in evidence were those of the gendarmerie itself, contained in the two warrants sent by fax to the police in Cizre and Istanbul (paragraphs 386 and 418 above).

The Court pointed out that, while the obligation to provide an effective investigation into the deaths caused by, inter alios, the security forces had been held to be implied into Article 2 in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by that Article were not theoretical or illusory but practical and effective, the provisions of Article 2 included the requirement that the right to life be \u201cprotected by law\u201d. In addition, the Court noted, Article 2 may also concern situations where the initiative must rest on the State for the practical reason that the victim is deceased and the circumstances of the death may be largely confined within the knowledge of State officials (p. 295, \u00a7 91).

Furthermore, although the victim of an alleged breach of this provision may be in a vulnerable position, the practical exigencies of the situation will often differ from cases of use of lethal force or suspicious deaths. The Court considers that the requirement under Article\u00a013 of the Convention that a person with an arguable claim of a violation of Article\u00a03 be provided with an effective remedy will generally provide both redress to the applicant and the necessary procedural safeguards against abuses by State officials. The Court's case-law establishes that the notion of effective remedy in this context includes the duty to carry out a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for any ill-treatment and permitting effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure (see the Aksoy judgment ...). Whether it is appropriate or necessary to find a procedural breach of Article 3 will therefore depend on the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d",

There is no evidence in the case file to substantiate the applicants' complaints of torture or other ill-treatment, apart from their declarations, which are only those that anyone taken into custody puts forward either at the time or in preparation of his / her defence once released. In similar cases which have already been tried, one finds the same descriptions of acts \u201ccharacterised\u201d as torture or ill-treatment; it is not surprising, therefore, that the applicants in the present case repeat such allegations one after the other in the form of this well known clich\u00e9. However, the majority find such allegations \u201ccredible and consistent\u201d and that the claims were \u201ccredible as a whole\u201d (paragraphs 639-641 above) \u2013 vague terminology when there is not the slightest element of material proof to substantiate it; as if the mere repetition by 10 to 15 people of an agreed text could be deemed \u201ccredible and consistent\u201d! A number of untruths repeated and embellished one after the other do not constitute a real truth. In sum, the reasoning of the majority, on which their finding of a violation is based, is nothing more, in my opinion, than supposition, speculation and misplaced deduction. This is why, I think, they had to look for support in \u201cinternational materials\u201d (paragraph 596 above), which are irrelevant when one examines an allegation of torture, complaint or material fact, where one must prove with certainty that the events did actually occur. The fact that ill-treatment of detainees in Turkey had been found by certain institutions is not a convincing argument on which to rely in the present case.",

This is why the old Court rejected claims under this head unless they could be accurately assessed, as in the case of the destruction of property. Secondly, the sums awarded under this head, together with those awarded as moral damages are clearly excessive.
