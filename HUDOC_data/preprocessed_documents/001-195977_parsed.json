The margin of appreciation left to the national authorities in assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it is not, however, unlimited, but goes hand in hand with European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 of the Convention. As indicated above, when exercising its supervisory function, the Court\u2019s task is not to take the place of the national courts, but rather to review, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the Convention relied on (see, with further references, Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v.

Seeking to receive a response to the question written on his placard (see paragraph 41 above), the applicant drew the public\u2019s attention to the other side of the story of the unification of Russia and Adygeya, thus contributing to a debate on a matter of public interest. The wording on the placard was not offensive or obscene. The applicant\u2019s actions were by no means violent or aggressive. State officials (the FSB and police officers) chose to interrupt and put a stop to his actions a few minutes after they had started. In doing so, they grabbed the applicant by the hands. The applicant was allowed to go home in his own car. However, once at home, he was invited to go to the police station in a police car for a \u201cpreventive conversation\u201d with the head of the police station.

The Government have not provided any explanation as to what the purpose of such a \u201cpreventive conversation\u201d would have been, yet the very wording implies that at least one of its objectives would have been to prevent similar actions in the future by persuading the applicant to refrain from repeating his behaviour. In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that uniformed police officers invited the applicant to come to the police station for a \u201cpreventive conversation\u201d and that the applicant subsequently waited three and a half hours for the head of the police station had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the exercise of his freedom of expression, as this was likely to discourage him from expressing opinions on the history of Adygeya in the future (see, mutatis mutandis, Wille v.

In the Court\u2019s view, this is neither a \u201crelevant\u201d nor \u201csufficient\u201d reason for the interference in question. The Government also argued that the applicant\u2019s actions had not corresponded to \u201cthe aim of the public event\u201d (see paragraph 36 above), implying that only one set of views could be tolerated at the celebratory meeting, which runs contrary to the principles of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see, among many other authorities, B\u00e9dat v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a056925/08, \u00a7 48, 29 March 2016).

However, the question written on the applicant\u2019s placard pertained to the very nature of the celebratory meeting. The Court has already held in the context of Article 11 of the Convention that the purpose of an assembly is often linked to a certain location and/or time (see Lashmankin and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a057818/09 and 14 others, \u00a7\u00a0405, 7\u00a0February 2017) and that the place chosen for an assembly is important, so that the participants in the assembly may exercise their right to freedom of expression in a satisfactory manner, invite the public to reflect on their ideas and inform the public about issues of importance to society, and openly express their ideas (see S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a037273/10 and 17\u00a0others, \u00a7 109, 24 May 2016). The Court has previously observed on a number of occasions that in the sphere of political debate the guarantees of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention are often complementary (see, among other authorities, Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], nos.\u00a029580/12 and 4\u00a0others, \u00a7 102, 15\u00a0November 2018). In its view, this approach is applicable in the context of the present case. The Court thus considers that the time and place that the applicant chose for his actions were of particular importance as regards the delivery of the message that he sought to convey.",
