In the majority\u2019s view, the finding of the Senica District Court (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above) indicated that the applicant could claim, at least on arguable grounds, that he met the relevant requirements for the restitution of his father\u2019s property.

In so far as section 23 of the Judicial Rehabilitation Act of 1990 provided that the conditions under which this Act was to apply to claims resulting from quashed confiscation decisions, the manner of redress and the scope of such claims were to be defined in a special law, such a law had to observe at least as a minimum the existence of property as a consequence of the annulment of confiscations. One cannot interpret section 23 as giving carte blanche for any conditions in such a special law. This limitation has a direct consequence for the interpretation of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitations Act of 1991. Since this Act lays down the conditions for submitting claims resulting from quashed convictions by which property was confiscated, as well as the manner of redress and the scope of such claims, it has to be presumed that it was deemed to respect as thoroughly as possible the existence of the property in question. This line of interpretation leads to the conclusion that, under the 1991 Act taken in conjunction with the 1990 Act, there existed for the applicant a legitimate expectation that he could not only claim in theory the return of the coins but also receive in practice any support from the State authorities in this respect.",

My argument is not that the 1991 Act did not respect this concept of rehabilitation, but that the interpretation by the courts did not fully take into account the consequences of the fact that the annulment of the confiscation had already created a property right.

In some of the cases referred to, movable property recorded or inventoried in State cultural institutions such as museums, galleries or libraries was restored to the entitled persons, mainly on the basis of a restitution agreement between the claimant and the State institution in question. It appears that the courts have not always insisted on the requirement of individually identifiable items as they did in the present case. It should also be noted that there are features distinguishing the present case from the case cited in paragraph 24 of the judgment (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d). In that case, the entitled persons did not identify the State institution to which the property in question was transferred, the manner of its transfer or the movable property as such.",
