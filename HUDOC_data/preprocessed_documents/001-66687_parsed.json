In the applicant\u2019s view, the overall length of the proceedings was essentially due to the fact that the agricultural lands\u2019 commission had failed to issue valid decisions pursuant to his applications for restitution. This had been the cause for all the appeals before the courts, which had consumed years to examine and had in the end become meaningless, and had also made necessary the institution of fresh restitution proceedings pursuant to section 11(2) of the Agricultural Lands Act.

During the first years after the adoption of the Act the number of cases before the district courts had surged, and a few years later these cases had created backlogs at the Supreme Court. For this reason the legislature had amended the Act, providing for review of the district courts\u2019 judgments by the regional courts, which had greatly streamlined the procedures and reduced the delays.
