For the reasons given in my above-mentioned dissenting opinion, I infer from the Court\u2019s Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985 (Series A no. 94) that where the issue of family reunification arises in a case of \"immigrants who already had a family which they left behind\", the State of settlement is in principle bound to respect the choice of immigrants who have achieved settled status there and, accordingly, must as a rule admit members of the family left behind by such settlers. There may, perhaps, be exceptions to this rule. However, in my opinion, where reunion with the immigrant\u2019s little children is at stake it is very difficult to admit that the rule should not be followed. So much for general principles. I now turn to the case at hand.",

Admittedly, one might be tempted to doubt whether he has acquired that status by means which are above suspicion. However, since the Government have not relied on this feature of the case and have accepted that Salah Ahmut is a Netherlands national, the principle of equality requires that the Court apply the same standards as it would apply to those whose  nationality is irreproachable. In the context of the present case the fact that the  authorities have allowed Salah Ahmut to retain his Moroccan nationality is immaterial.",

In view of these circumstances, the measures adopted by the  authorities do not appear to be either necessary or proportionate to the legitimate aims that Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2) foresees, and therefore not justified under this provision (art. 8-2). To deny a father and son their right to be together when the son is at an age at which he needs his father\u2019s care and guidance, particularly since his mother has died, and to deny a national of the Netherlands the right to have his son begin an education in the adopted country of which he is a national according to the law, is in my opinion contrary not only to the European Convention of Human Rights but also to \"cogent reasons of a humanitarian nature\" as set forth in the national legislation (1982 Aliens Circular, Chapter B19, paras. 1.1 and 2.5).",

The subsequent education of the child in Morocco and the fact that he is now 14 years old and has grown up outside the  in the care of other relatives are circumstances that should not be considered when deciding the present case. They are facts extraneous to the measures complained of, and, as such, they merely highlight the fatal consequences of impeding the reunited family life which the applicants desired. The benefit of hindsight when deciding judicial cases several years after a complaint has been lodged may certainly prove to be of use when assessing the reality of a risk but never, in my opinion, to judge the conformity with the Convention of impugned measures adopted by national authorities at the time. This opinion is not inconsistent with the principles set out in paragraph 67. The fact that Mr Salah Ahmut is a national of the , and his child\u2019s age at the time of the refusal, are in my view, decisive in finding a violation in the present case.",
