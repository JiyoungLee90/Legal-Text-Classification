Furthermore, his subsequent attempts to legalise the unlawful construction ex post facto had been unsuccessful (see paragraphs\u00a011 and 13 above). In accordance with the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law, the prohibition to build on forest land was justified by the importance of forests to the environment, and could not be considered disproportionate (see paragraph\u00a030 below). Moreover, an order to demolish a building built in an area where construction was prohibited was necessary in order to protect the environment and to ensure a fair balance between the public interest and individual rights, and thus it could not be considered disproportionate either (see paragraph 31 below). The court ordered the applicant to demolish the buildings within six months, in view of the difficulties which he might face during the autumn and winter.

The court emphasised that the applicant had knowingly built the house without a construction permit (see paragraph\u00a027 below), and the fact that he had hoped to be able to legalise it ex post facto could not exempt him from responsibility. The court considered that the obligation to demolish the buildings was proportionate and struck a fair balance between individual rights and the public interest \u2013 in particular, the protection of the environment and rational use of protected areas.
