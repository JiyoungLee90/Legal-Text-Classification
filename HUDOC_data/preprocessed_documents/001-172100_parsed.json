The provision in question provided that the detention measure could be extended beyond two years if the pre-trial proceedings could not be completed because of \u201cimportant obstacles\u201d which could not be overcome (see paragraph 73 above). It did not set any statutory timelimit for extending the detention measure. The Constitutional Court considered that the provision, by its imprecise and broad wording, could lead to arbitrary decisions by the courts on detention on remand and thus infringe the very essence of constitutional rights and freedoms. Referring to other grounds for extraordinary extensions of detention on remand under Article 263 \u00a7 4, namely where the criminal proceedings have been suspended, the accused is under prolonged psychiatric observation, preparation of an expert opinion in protracted, evidence has to be collected in a particularly complex case or in a foreign country, or the accused has intentionally caused a delay in the proceedings, the Constitutional Court stated that although those criteria were to some extent also vague, their constitutionality could be ensured through their precise definition formulated through practice and by reference, inter alia, to the settled case-law of the European Court of Human Rights as regards violations of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The Constitutional Court ruled that the provision in the part which had been declared unconstitutional was to be repealed within six months of the date of the publication of the judgment in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw).",

One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain. The progressive development of the criminal law through judicial lawmaking is a wellentrenched and necessary part of legal tradition in the Convention States (see Del Rio Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092 and 93, ECHR 2013-VI with further references).",

The proceedings relating to such a request are essentially designed to secure financial reparation for damage arising from the execution of unjustified detention on remand (see W\u0142och, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a090 and 91).",

In their subsequent decisions to extend the applicant\u2019s detention on remand, the domestic courts emphasised that the likelihood that a severe punishment would be imposed on him was, under domestic law, in itself sufficient reason to justify the detention measure.

The latter reason was continuously referred to in spite of the fact that the domestic courts acknowledged that the applicant had not to date attempted to interfere with the proceedings (see paragraphs 37, 39, 41, 42\u00a0and 44 above). It was also noted that his effective detention on remand in that case had up to that point lasted less than two years, in view of the fact that he had concurrently been serving the prison sentence imposed in the other case (see paragraph\u00a041 above).",
