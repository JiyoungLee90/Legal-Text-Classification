At the same time the police had investigated different offences allegedly committed by the applicant. The latter pre-trial investigation had ended in September 2005. After that, the District Court had resumed the examination of the case remitted by the Supreme Court. The Deputy Chancellor of Justice found it somewhat problematic that the fresh hearing in the District Court only took place in December 2005, although the case had been remitted already in November 2003. However, having obtained a statement from the District Court, the Deputy Chancellor of Justice was satisfied that it had been justified for that court to wait for the outcome of the additional pre-trial investigation relating to the case and to allow it to examine the remitted case and possible new charges against the applicant in joint proceedings. In these circumstances, the Deputy Chancellor of Justice took the view that the length of the proceedings had not exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d.",

It further notes that the invoice submitted by the applicant does not include any costs and expenses pertaining to the applicant\u2019s attempt to speed up the proceedings by way of lodging a complaint with the Deputy Chancellor of Justice. The Court subscribes to the Government\u2019s view that the costs and expenses incurred before the State Treasury are not related to the applicant\u2019s complaints before this Court.
