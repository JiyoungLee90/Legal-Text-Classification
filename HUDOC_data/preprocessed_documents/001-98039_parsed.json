The Court reiterates its constant approach that a jurisdictional error, a serious breach of court procedure or abuses of power may, in principle, be regarded as a fundamental defect and therefore justify the quashing (see, mutatis mutandis, Luchkina v. Russia, no. 3548/04, \u00a7 21, 10 April 2008). However, nothing in the text of the Presidium's ruling of 14 October 2004 enables the Court to conclude that the lower courts' judgments were indeed quashed because these courts had ruled on the constitutionality of the federal law in excess of their jurisdiction. Neither the alleged jurisdictional error nor abuse of competence was cited by the Presidium as a ground for the annulment of the judgments of 1 and 30 April 2003. On the contrary, it clearly follows from the wording of the supervisory instance ruling that the sole ground for the quashing was the misinterpretation and incorrect application of the provisions of the State Commodity Bonds Act by the courts. Furthermore, it was not claimed before the supervisory-review instance by the respondent authority that the previous proceedings had been tarnished by a fundamental defect, such as, in particular, a jurisdictional error, serious breaches of court procedure or abuses of power (see Luchkina, cited above). Such argument was only advanced in the Government's observations. In the absence of any reference to the ground for quashing cited by the Government in the texts of the supervisory-instance ruling of 14 October 2004, the Court is unable to conclude that the quashing was caused, and even less justified by the substantive jurisdictional error by the lower courts. It therefore rejects the Government's argument.",

The Court further reiterates that the existence of a debt confirmed by a binding and enforceable judgment constitutes the beneficiary's \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, among other authorities, Androsov, cited above, \u00a7 69). However, he was prevented from receiving the award through no fault of his own. The quashing of the enforceable judgment frustrated the applicant's reliance on a binding judicial decision and deprived him of an opportunity to receive the money he had legitimately expected to receive. In these circumstances, even assuming that the interference was lawful and pursued a legitimate aim, the Court considers that the quashing of the enforceable judgment in the applicant's favour by way of supervisory review placed an excessive burden on the applicant and was incompatible with Article 1 of the Protocol No. 1.",
