The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0120, and Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0101).",

However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. On this latter point the Court has explained that where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government. That is justified by the fact that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082 and 83, with further case-law references).",

Moreover, the applicant\u2019s cellmate, A.D., stated that the applicant had told him about the alleged assaults and had shown him marks left by the beatings (see paragraph 25 above). Similarly, the escort officer, M.S., gave evidence that he had seen bruises on the applicant (see paragraph 28 above). The applicant\u2019s coaccused, V.P., stated that the escort officers had beaten the applicant (see paragraph 30 above), and another of the co-accused, P.V., gave evidence that he had heard the applicant screaming (see paragraph 32 above).",

Given these circumstances, the Court considers that the respondent Government have failed to discharge their burden of proof and to submit a plausible explanation refuting the applicant\u2019s account of events (see Balajevs v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 8347/07, \u00a7 94, 28\u00a0April\u00a02016, which also concerned illtreatment by the detainee escort officers in the premises of the Riga Regional Court). The statements provided by the detainee escort officers were all, except one, drafted in broadly the same manner, despite the officers having been questioned separately, and no face-to-face confrontation was organised between the applicant and those officers (see paragraph 28 above). Therefore, the Court has no reason to doubt the applicant\u2019s account of events and finds that the injuries found on his body were sustained as a result of assaults by the detainee escort officers on 20, 21, 24 and 25\u00a0May 2010 (see Mustafa\u00a0Hajili, cited above, \u00a7 41).",

Moreover, the ill-treatment inflicted by the detainee escort officers on the applicant, who was a minor and entirely under their control, must also have caused him considerable mental suffering, diminishing his human dignity.",
