He further observed that the methods used by the police, such as threatening them with the use of gas or with prosecution for committing a crime against a person in authority, had just been measures aimed at pressuring the applicant and R.D.P. to release themselves. According to the criminal judge the fire fighters also intimidated the applicant and R.D.P. by telling them that the walls could collapse if the authorities opted to use machinery to release them. The purpose behind this was to make them release themselves voluntarily. Additionally, the criminal judge observed that the authorities had then taken the decision to tie the applicant\u2019s right hand to his ankle in order to immobilise him, in view of the risk of the walls collapsing and the applicant\u2019s threat to kick down the unstable wooden posts that had been installed by the fire fighters as a preventive measure.",

According to the Audiencia Provincial, the applicant was aware of the fact that what he was publicly saying was false.

In particular, the applicant relied on paragraphs a) and d) of Article 20 of the Spanish Constitution. The applicant stated that the narrated facts at the press conference had been true, as had been recognised by the domestic courts in the framework of the criminal proceedings, yet the only thing that had differed had been the intention attributable to the police officers. The applicant had used the term \u201ctorture\u201d in a colloquial manner. This type of expression could not be limited by strict criminal-legal definitions. The applicant further stated that the term \u201ctorture\u201d contained several meanings apart from the strictly criminal one. According to the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language (Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola  hereinafter \u201cthe Academy\u201d), the word torture meant \u201cserious physical or psychological pain inflicted on somebody, with various methods and tools, with the purpose of obtaining a confession or as a means to punish\u201d. However, according to this same institution, the word torture also meant \u201cserious pain or suffering, or the thing that produces it\u201d. The applicant further stressed that the word \u201ctorture\u201d was in daily used to refer to any kind of mistreatment. Ultimately, the applicant argued that restricting the use of the word \u201ctorture\u201d to those scenarios where all the criminal elements of the crime were present was an excessive restriction on the right to freedom of expression and, in particular, on a social debate which concerns the methods used by public powers in order to pursue a legitimate aim.",
