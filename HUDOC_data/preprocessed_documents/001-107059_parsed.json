Although the applicant\u2019s detention may have initially been justified based on these grounds, after a certain lapse of time the courts were obliged to give other express grounds for his continued detention. Instead, they repeatedly relied on the gravity of charges against the applicant (see paragraphs 13 and 18 above), used stereotyped formulae for all the defendants, without addressing specific facts and individual circumstances concerning the applicant (see paragraph 18 above), did not advance any grounds for the applicant\u2019s continued detention or did not rule on it at all (see paragraphs 8, 10-12 and 15-18 above).

It thus considers that the complexity of the case alone cannot explain the overall duration of the proceedings. Nor does the conduct of the applicant explain such duration. On the other hand, the Court is of the view that the proceedings were mainly delayed by three remittals of the case for fresh consideration and by fourteen adjournments of the hearings (see paragraphs 10, 12, 15 and 23 above). Even though the courts several times applied compulsory summonses on the persons failing to appear, they also had at their disposal other effective mechanisms to ensure those persons\u2019 presence (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, no. 7324/02, \u00a7 31, 4 April 2006). It was not suggested by the Government that the courts had ever considered applying them. Nor did the majority of the compulsory summonses seem to have any effect (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 71). The Court concludes, therefore, that the main responsibility for the protracted duration of the proceedings rested with the domestic courts.",
