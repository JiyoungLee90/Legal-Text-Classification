After he had given the order to move, the column of cars had approached the Volkswagen Passat that was parked at right angles to the street. The commanding officer had ordered the arrest of three men who were standing next to the Passat and who turned out to be Mr\u00a0Ka\u0142ucki, G.B. and T.N. The arrest was to be carried out by police officers from the last two cars in the column. The police vehicles had moved one after the other, blocking the street and the suspects' car. The suspects had tried to escape and two of them had jumped into the car and driven off fast, taking advantage of a gap that had been left between the second and third police vehicles. By this time almost all the police cars had stopped and the police officers had got out. They were armed with guns and semi-automatic rifles. A police officer, who in the proceedings was named anonymous witness no. 4, got out of the second vehicle and found himself in the way of the Passat so he jumped aside to avoid being hit by the rapidly moving car. He shouted \u201cpolice\u201d and started shooting, aiming at the tyres of the suspects' car. He fired eleven shots from his sub-machine gun (pistolet maszynowy Glauberyt). Another police officer, witness no. 2, got out of the first vehicle and found himself facing the escaping Passat. He was wearing a fluorescent vest marked with the word \u201cPolice\u201d, and shouted \u201cstop, police\u201d but the driver failed to obey. At the last moment, the witness had had to jump aside but had nevertheless been hit by the car and sustained an injury to his leg. He had not lost balance, and fired five shots from his gun (pistolet marki Glock) at the tyres of the Passat. A policeman from the anti-terrorist forces, witness no. 3, had stepped out of the second car and had also attempted to stop the car by firing eleven shots from his sub-machine gun (pistolet maszynowy MP-5). He aimed at the engine, front tyres and, as the car was passing him, its side and the rear tyres. The next police officer, witness no. 6, had followed police officer no.\u00a02 out of the first police vehicle. As the suspects' car was passing him he noticed that the driver was aiming at him with an object resembling a gun. The police officer then fired a short burst from his machine gun (karabin Kalashnikov) aiming at the lower side of the car and tyres. Finally, another officer from the antiterrorist forces, witness no. 18, had got out of the third vehicle. Noticing that the suspects' car had passed one of the police vehicles and hit officer no. 2, he had run after the escaping vehicle, shouted to the driver to stop and opened fire with his machine gun (a Kalashnikov), aiming at the car's left rear tyres. The other police officers had run after T.N., the remaining suspect who had not managed to get into the car, and overpowered him.",

They submitted that G.B. and Mr Ka\u0142ucki had not been armed as the guns found in the car had not been used and did not have their fingerprints on them. The gun linked by the expert to Mr Ka\u0142ucki by scent identification had been hidden in the pocket of the car seat and thus could not have been used by him. The applicants alleged that the prosecutor had failed to deal with many inconsistencies in the testimonies of the police officers. Moreover, it had not been explained why no blood stains had been found in the car even though Mr Ka\u0142ucki had died of a haemorrhage and suffered many bullet wounds. The applicants also blamed the police for not preparing the operation properly. They pointed to the fact that in total twenty-three armed police officers had participated in the operation during which forty shots had been fired at the car (including one which had passed through a point above the driver's door handle, five through the boot, eight through the rear bumper, and four through the driver's seat and back seat). The car's tyres remained undamaged despite the testimonies of the police officers that they had all aimed at the tyres. The applicants therefore submitted that the force used by the police officers against two unarmed men had been disproportionate.",

In line with the above-mentioned principle of strict proportionality inherent in Article\u00a02 (see McCann and Others, cited above, \u00a7 149), the national legal framework regulating arrest operations must make recourse to firearms dependent on a careful assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and, in particular, on an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the fugitive and of the threat he or she posed. As the text of Article 2 itself shows, the use of lethal force by police officers may be justified in certain circumstances. Nonetheless, Article 2 does not grant a carte blanche. Unregulated and arbitrary action by State agents is incompatible with effective respect for human rights. This means that, as well as being authorised under national law, policing operations must be sufficiently regulated by it, within the framework of a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force (see Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7 58 and Andreou v. , no. 45653/99, \u00a7 50, 27 October 2009).",
