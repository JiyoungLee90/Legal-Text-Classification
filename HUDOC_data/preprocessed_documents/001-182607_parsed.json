In particular, he drew the Court\u2019s attention to another possible date on which the offence might have become time-barred, arguing that E.T.\u2019s parliamentary immunity had acted as a temporary procedural barrier, and therefore the statute of limitations had been suspended for the whole period E.T. had been a deputy.

In particular, the applicant drew the Court\u2019s attention mainly to two elements which, in his view, proved the domestic authorities\u2019 negligence: firstly, the decision of the Court of Appeal, by which the proceedings had been suspended until Parliament granted leave to continue the prosecution of E.T. and the time that had elapsed from the date that judgment had been published on 17 February 2010 until it had been finalised on 10 August 2010.

In view of the above, the Court does not discern any element of arbitrariness in the domestic court\u2019s decision to suspend the proceedings. As regards the period of eight months that passed from the publication until the finalisation of that decision, the Court notes that even though it is undoubtedly long, it cannot be considered in itself unreasonable or the cause of the offence of which E.T. was accused subsequently becoming time-barred. In any event, the Court underlines that domestic law suspends the deadline leading to a particular offence becoming time-barred when a criminal prosecution cannot continue in accordance with a legal provision (see paragraph 21 above).",

In this regard, the Court notes that the parties erroneously maintained that the relevant period had ended when judgment no.\u00a08658/2012 had been finalised. The Court reiterates its case-law according to which when domestic law does not provide for service of judgments, as in the present case, then the date on which the parties may actually find out their content must be taken into consideration (see Papachelas v. Greece [GC], no. 31423/96, \u00a7 30, ECHR 1999II). The proceedings at issue were criminal proceedings, in which the competent authorities published their judgment on the date of the hearing, so the parties were immediately informed that the offence of which E.T. was accused had become time-barred.

However, and without ignoring the complexity of the present case, the Court notes that more than two years passed from the date the offence became time-barred until judgment no. 8658/2012 of the Court of Appeal was published holding that the offence had become time-barred. In the Court\u2019s view, however, such a delay for what was merely a procedural decision was excessive. The Court also notes that the Government did not adduce any argument as to why it had been necessary for the domestic courts to wait until E.T.\u2019s status as a parliamentarian had ended to then hold a hearing in order to rule that the offence had become time-barred. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the Government have advanced no fact or argument justifying a different conclusion in the present case.
