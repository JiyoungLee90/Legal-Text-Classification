In addition, it pointed briefly to two instances, on 28 September 2013 and 19 January 2014, when the child had been reluctant to go with the mother. After the father had complained to the social services about it, they had met with the child together with a psychologist and the child had said that he had been hit by his grandfather and locked alone in a room. The report concluded that the father was in a position to provide the children with a higher standard of living, and that although the mother was attempting to create a calm environment in which to bring up the second applicant, the important adult in his life was his father. It was advisable not to change the second applicant\u2019s habitual place of residence, which was with his father, and to give V.D. custody of the child (see also para 38 below).",

In particular, between March and May 2015 V.D. had retained the child in his home despite custody having been given to the first applicant. No proof had been presented before the court, either orally or in writing, to confirm V.D.\u2019s submissions that he and the first applicant had reached an agreement for the second applicant to live with his father. Further, there had been several complaints by the first applicant to the prosecution service in connection with her inability to have contact with the child as determined by the courts. The second applicant was happy spending time with his mother and younger sibling, and the first applicant was not preventing his contact with his father. However, the child only saw his mother at the premises of the foundation providing social services, and not in the comfort of her own home, which suggested that V.D. had not made efforts to encourage the child to stay with his mother. Continued restrictions to the second applicant\u2019s contact with his mother would lead to his being alienated from her, which was not in his best interests. It was also important for him to live with his younger sibling, who was of a similar age.",

While the second applicant undoubtedly felt ill at ease at his mother\u2019s home, this was because of the incident when he had been hit by his grandmother, as well as his father\u2019s conduct. The grandmother had since moved abroad, so there was no further danger of violence in the mother\u2019s home. Moreover, the first applicant had demonstrated better parenting skills, and if the second applicant continued to be separated from her then there was a real risk that the relationship between the two would collapse.

Relying in particular on the findings of the domestic courts, the Court finds it established that since 18 September 2013, when the domestic courts granted the applicant temporary custody, the first applicant has experienced systematic difficulties in exercising her parental and visiting rights, and that for lengthy stretches of time the two applicants have not been able to live together in violation of the rulings of the domestic courts (see paragraph 23 above). Thus, V.D. retained the child between 16 March 2015 and 13 May 2015, and then again between 10 June 2015 and 14\u00a0January 2016 (see paragraphs 53-55 above). Furthermore, before May\u00a02015 V.D. regularly failed to comply with the contact regime as determined by the courts, by not returning the child to the mother on the set date and at the set time (see paragraph 56 above). It appears that after February 2016 the second applicant continued to live with his father, against the mother\u2019s wishes and in defiance of two judicial decisions (see paragraph\u00a058 above).",

In doing so it will assess whether the national authorities have taken all necessary steps that could reasonably be demanded in the circumstances, aimed at allowing the individuals concerned to reunite and preserve the relationship between them (see K\u0159\u00ed\u017e v.\u00a0the Czech Republic, no. 26634/03, \u00a7 85, 9 January 2007). Given the child\u2019s very young age, the adequacy of the measures pursued by the authorities is to be judged by the swiftness of their implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent who does not live with him (see Edina T\u00f3th v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a051323/14, \u00a7 53 with further reference, 30 January 2018).",

In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the first applicant the sum of EUR 2,700 for the proceedings before the Court, of which sum EUR 900 is to be paid directly into the bank account of the applicants\u2019 representatives. The above amount covers legal fees incurred in the context of the proceedings before the Court and translation expenses. The amount in respect of legal fees is calculated with reference to the hourly rate of EUR\u00a070 applied in respect of applicants\u2019 lawyers\u2019 fees in recent cases against Bulgaria of comparable complexity (see Aneva and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos. 66997/13 and 2 others, \u00a7 135, 6 April 2017).",
