It does not appear from the case file that this delay was due to the fact that the parties had to be given sufficient time for their submissions. In this connection the Court further notes that the presiding judge, as far back as April 1996, had instructed the rapporteur to prepare the hearing. On 1 June 1996 the case was transferred to a new rapporteur. However, a hearing did not take place until August 1997, that is, more than one year later. Furthermore, during several periods in the proceedings the parties exchanged observations without any steps being taken by the . With regard to the numerous criminal complaints lodged by the applicants between 1999 and 2003, the Court recalls its case-law, according to which the domestic courts should consider the possibility of having copies made in order to avoid delays caused by the dispatch of the case file (see Gisela M\u00fcller v. , no. 69584/01, \u00a7\u00a085, 6 October 2005).
