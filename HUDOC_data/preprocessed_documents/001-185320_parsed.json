The child had been desired by both.

The child was living in a well-organised and emotionally stable family unit consisting of a father, a mother and other children. The Court of Appeal pointed out that it was convinced that this family union would be destroyed if the applicant\u2019s paternity were established and contact rights ordered. The hearing of the child and the legal parents had shown that in the child\u2019s perception of the world, there was only one father, the mother\u2019s husband. There were no indications that the latter did not assume his role as a father towards the child or assumed it differently than towards his other children. The child was well-integrated in the family, where she felt protected and secure. This assessment was also consistent with the conclusions of the child\u2019s curator ad litem.",

This question could, however, ultimately only be determined by a paternity test, to which the child\u2019s legal parents were opposed. The mother affirmed that her husband was the biological father of her daughter and both stood firm against the applicant. According to the Court of Appeal it resulted from the hearing that the legal father trusted, in principle, his wife\u2019s assertions but at the same time had doubts as to his paternity, although he had not explicitly expressed them. In spite of these doubts, and the long-lasting court proceedings, he did not put in question his wife\u2019s statements. The Court of Appeal received the impression that the spouses had barricaded themselves against the applicant as if they were in a corral, as had shown the legal father\u2019s declaration that the legal proceedings did not have a negative impact on the relationship with his wife but had rather consolidated it. The Court of Appeal concluded that the legal father could live with this uncertainty, and that his attitude had no consequences for the child. If, however, the applicant\u2019s biological paternity were to be established, the legal father would realise that his long-standing trust in his wife was not justified. It was not possible to predict the legal father\u2019s reaction, but the manifest risk that the spouses\u2019 marriage would break up could not be dismissed in view of the couple\u2019s past difficulties.

Granting contact or information rights pursuant to Article 1686a of the Civil Code assumed that, other than biological paternity, the claimant has a serious interest in the child, that contact served or information was not contrary to the child\u2019s best interest and that the claimant had a legitimate interest in obtaining such information. Article 1686a did not, however, determine the order in which the court had to assess its conditions. At the same time, the order of assessment had to take into account that an interference with the person\u2019s basic rights was admissible only when necessary. With reference to its decision of 17 December 2013 (no. 1 BvL 6/10) the Federal Constitutional Court emphasised that in order to prevent an unnecessary interference with the right to family life of the existing family, the competent court might order a paternity test only when the further conditions of the provisions were met. However, where the determination of the further conditions of this provision would constitute a heavy burden on the persons involved, the court might order a paternity test first. When assessing the degree of interference with family life, the question of whether paternity was in dispute between the parties was of particular importance.",

It reiterates in particular that Article 8 can be interpreted as imposing on the member States an obligation to examine whether it was in the child\u2019s best interests to allow a biological father to establish a relationship with his child, in particular by granting contact rights (Anayo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67-73; Schneider, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 95-105; and Ahrens v.\u00a0Germany, no. 45071/09, \u00a7 74, 22 March 2012). This may imply the establishment, in contact proceedings, of biological \u2013 as opposed to legal \u2013 paternity if, in the special circumstances of the case, contact between the alleged biological father \u2013 presuming that he is in fact the child\u2019s biological parent \u2013 and the child were considered to be in the child\u2019s best interests (Schneider, cited above, \u00a7 103; and Kautzor v.

It further notes that regarding the possibility to base contact rights on the applicant\u2019s alleged biological paternity in bearing in mind the Court\u2019s judgments Anayo and Schneider, the Court of Appeal held that the determination of the applicant\u2019s biological paternity against the legal parents\u2019 will was contrary to the child\u2019s wellbeing; it could, however, leave open this question because contact with the applicant would, in any event, jeopardise the child\u2019s wellbeing due to the deep conflicts between the legal parents and the applicant and the risk entailed by the fact that the applicant had not ruled out telling the child that he was her biological father.

Furthermore, in taking its decision to refuse contact, the Court of Appeal had regard to the entire family situation and relied on an extensive written statement by the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, an experienced psychologist. There is therefore no indication that the judges of the Court of Appeal had based their findings on standardised arguments in favour of social families.

It argued that if the applicant\u2019s biological paternity were established, it could not be ruled out that this might destroy the child\u2019s present family as the mother\u2019s husband might lose trust in his wife.",

The Court notes that the Court of Appeal was convinced that if the applicant\u2019s biological paternity were to be established against the spouses\u2019 will, there was a risk that their marriage would break up, thereby endangering the wellbeing of the child who would lose her family unit and her relationships. The Court of Appeal came to this conclusion after a thorough analysis of the child\u2019s integration in the family where she felt protected and secure, the role of the mother\u2019s husband as father and by taking into account the spouses\u2019 difficulties and crisis in the past, which were related to the applicant.",

It is true that in this context the Court of Appeal did not specifically address the right to information. In particular, it did not give any weight to the question whether the obligation to provide the applicant with information about the child would have any significant impact on the spouses\u2019 right to respect of their family life. However, in the specific circumstances of the case, the Court can accept the Court of Appeal\u2019s argumentation based on the negative consequences for the child of the determination of paternity which was a necessary preliminary condition for granting information rights (see paragraph 25 above).",
