The failure of certain witnesses to show up had further delayed the proceedings, but the court had reacted to that and had ordered that they be brought by force.

Another lengthy delay which may partly be attributed to the applicant's conduct is the time following the adopting of the decisions to discontinue the proceedings in June 2000. It must be noted that she had requested such a discontinuation only two months earlier, in April 2000, and could hence have reasonably expected a response to her request (see paragraph 38 above). While no evidence has been produced before the Court to show that she did learn about the discontinuation before April 2004, almost four years later, it seems that a substantial part of this interval was due to her not taking appropriate steps to obtain information on that at the court's and the prosecutor's office's registries.

However, the Court notes that the Blagoevgrad District Court's and the Blagoevgrad Regional Court's judgments were quashed and the case was remitted for a retrial solely on account of a procedural flaw which was obvious and could have easily been prevented: the difference in the composition of the firstinstance court during the trial and at the time when it gave judgment (see paragraphs 19 and 32 above). This breach of the rules of procedure effectively nullified the judicial proceedings up to that date and obliged the authorities to start them anew. Moreover, the trial resumed only on 24 March 1999 \u2013 more than a year later \u2013, on account of the vain attempt of the prosecution to obtain a change of venue (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). No activity took place after that, until the proceedings were discontinued fifteen months later, in June 2000 (see paragraphs 37 and 39 above). It is furthermore striking that it was only after the case had gone through three levels of court that the prosecution itself, by making a belated request to amend the charges, which could have easily been done at a much earlier phase, caused its remitting to the phase of the investigation, thus rendering the entire hitherto procedure useless (see paragraph 35 above). In this connection, the Court notes that in previous cases against Bulgaria it has already observed that inordinate delays in criminal proceedings have been brought about by the unjustified remittal of criminal cases to the investigation stage (see Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 59913/00, \u00a7 93, 2 February 2006, citing Kitov v. Bulgaria, no. 37104/97, \u00a7 73, 3 April 2003; see also S.H.K. v.

Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, \u00a7 92, 3\u00a0November 2005). Finally, the Court notes that the applicant was not notified about the discontinuation of the proceedings in June 2000 (see paragraph 40 above).",

However, it appears that, as in the first set of proceedings against her, the interval between the discontinuation of the proceedings in June 2000 and the moment when she learned about it \u2013 April 2004 \u2013, was in large part due to her not taking appropriate steps to obtain information about their course (see paragraph 58 above).",

These lapses amounted in total to two years and eight months. It is furthermore striking that only after the case had gone through numerous hearings that the prosecution itself requested that the trial be discontinued in view of the insufficient precision with which the charges against the applicant had been formulated, which could have easily been remedied at an earlier time (see paragraphs 54 above). Finally, the Court notes that the applicant was not notified about the discontinuation of the proceedings in June 2000 (see paragraph 58 above).",
