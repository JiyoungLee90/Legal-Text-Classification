However, they provided no evidence indicating that she (and not her son or Mr V.) had actually been notified of the summons, nor did they allege that this was the case (contrast Lazariu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 95 and 101). There is also nothing to show that, despite the requirement of the national law (see paragraph 24 above), the authorities ever ascertained whether the first applicant had had a \u201cgood reason\u201d not to appear. Furthermore, as the facts also indicate, the police managed to find the first applicant and bring her before the investigator within a day of the order for enforced attendance being issued. Thus, the Court is not persuaded that the police could not just as effectively have found the first applicant to summon her properly. Accordingly, given the lack of evidence that the first applicant was notified of the summonses, the Court finds that her obligation to appear before an investigating officer was not sufficiently \u201cconcrete and specific\u201d. It follows that her deprivation of liberty on 1\u00a0April 2005 was not justified under the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b).",

When the investigator arrived at the detention centre she officially detained the first applicant for forty-eight hours, with a view to applying for court authorisation of her pre-trial detention. The first applicant was not questioned until the next day, that is about twenty-four hours after her arrest. Therefore, the Court finds that the first applicant\u2019s detention during that period was not required in order to fulfil the obligation that she appear for questioning (see Farhad Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 37138/06, \u00a7\u00a0163, 9\u00a0November 2010).

For this reason, the Convention organs have consistently refused to uphold applications from persons convicted of criminal offences who complain that their convictions or sentences were found by appellate courts to have been based on errors of fact or law (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, \u00a7 42; see also Bozano v.\u00a0France, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, \u00a7 55, for an example of police detention of an applicant whose deportation order was later quashed).",
