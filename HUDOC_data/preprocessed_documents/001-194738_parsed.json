In addition, the decision referred to explanations from some police officers, without providing their names, who had stated that they had taken part in apprehending participants of the unauthorised demonstration on 24 March 2007 and taking them to police buses. They denied applying any physical force to those apprehended or receiving any complaints from them.

In such circumstances, arguments relating to the inadmissibility of a piece of evidence or a measure could be presented during examination of the administrative-offence case or on appeal against a decision in such a case. However, where CAO proceedings were discontinued, any actions taken during such proceedings could then be challenged under Chapter 25 of the CCP, if such actions impinged upon the person\u2019s rights or freedoms, created obstacles to their being exercised, or unlawfully imposed liability. The same approach was applicable where no CAO proceedings were instituted. This Ruling ceased to be applicable in September 2016.",
