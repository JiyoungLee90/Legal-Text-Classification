It may therefore appear that the contested Decree was delivered in the exercise of discretionary powers by the authorities (see Bozhilov v.\u00a0Bulgaria (dec.), no. 41978/98, 22 November 2001). However, the Court notes that the direct sale of a company to its staff was envisaged by Article\u00a018 of the Act as one of the forms of privatisation of State property (see paragraph 29 above). Furthermore, Article 10 of the Act explicitly provided that the members of staff of companies being privatised had equal rights to buy the property of such companies (see ibid.). Based on the above legal provisions, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s contention that she had a right to buy the property, namely shares in the Company during its privatisation, was not devoid of legal basis and that such right could be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law.

Nevertheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see, among other authorities, Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13\u00a0July 1995, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 316B; Papon v.

However, paragraph 2 of Article 160 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, as applied by the domestic courts to the applicant\u2019s case, imposed a total restriction on the applicant\u2019s possibility to seek judicial protection against a decision of the executive authorities, namely the Decree, irrespective of whether the alleged unlawfulness of the Decree or its alleged unconstitutionality was invoked. The Government alleged that the domestic courts had not refused to examine the applicant\u2019s claim for annulment and that the applicant\u2019s claim concerned the alleged unconstitutionality of the Decree rather than its unlawfulness. In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s claim for annulment was left unexamined by the final decision of the Court of Cassation on 9\u00a0September 2005 (see paragraph 22 above). The Government\u2019s allegation that the domestic courts had examined the claim is therefore not based on the facts of the case.",

Therefore, the Government\u2019s allegation that the applicant\u2019s claim concerned the alleged unconstitutionality of the Decree rather than its unlawfulness is not based on the facts of the case either. In this respect, the Court points out that the domestic courts did not indicate whether Article 15 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code and paragraph 2 of Article 160 \u00a7 1 of the CCP was applied to the applicant\u2019s claim only in its part concerning the alleged unconstitutionally of the Decree and, if that was the case, what the reasons were for leaving unexamined the part relating to the alleged unlawfulness of the Decree. It can therefore be concluded that paragraph 2 of Article 160 \u00a7 1 of the CCP was applied to the applicant\u2019s claim as a whole. In this respect, the Court takes note of the fact that, as was mentioned by the Constitutional Court in its decision of 16 November 2006, there existed a judicial practice in accordance with which paragraph 2 of Article 160 \u00a7 1 of the CCP was applied by the domestic courts to deny court examination of claims contesting the legality of a decree of the President or the Government (see paragraph 31 above). Lastly, as far as the decision of the Constitutional Court is concerned, the Court notes that paragraph 2 of Article 160 \u00a7 1 of the CCP was found incompatible with the Constitutional provisions guaranteeing judicial protection of rights and freedoms of individuals, and declared invalid.",
