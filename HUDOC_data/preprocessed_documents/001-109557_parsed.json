She said that she would undergo any programmes or assessments by a social worker, and that she was willing to see the guardian and D.I. again. She concluded that she had no intention of resuming a relationship with P.C. if K. were returned to her. She had discovered from the guardian\u2019s report how he had treated his older children. She asked for the opportunity to be assessed as a sole parent for K. and accepted that K. would have to remain in care while the assessment took place.",

He said that his preference would be for [K.] to stay with his foster placement on a long-term basis, but it appears that he recognised that this was not an option.

The proposition that the \u2018... court needs all the help it can get\u2019 has an immediate attraction, but the help must always be directed at achieving the right outcome for the child. Often there is the disadvantage of delay, and it is necessary accordingly to consider the possible outcomes of an assessment. In the present case the justices justified the delay as it retained the prospect of what they regarded as the best outcome for [K.] \u2013 rehabilitation to his family. But that outcome depended on the assessment being able to demonstrate that the mother had the capacity to parent [K.] in the long term. Given that the justices\u2019 findings contain the phrase \u2018neither parent is at present capable of caring for [K.]\u2019, it is necessary to give consideration as to how the proposed assessment would proceed. If it was envisaged that [K.] would remain with his foster parents and spend increasing periods of visiting contact with his mother the report, \u2018if successful\u2019, would merely state that the mother had given all the signs of being able to care for her son, at least in the contact situation. If it was envisaged that there would be a phased return to the mother, with increasing periods of staying contact, then the report would be able to speak with greater confidence of the mother\u2019s capacity to parent her son. In either case however [K.] would be exposed to a degree of disruption of his foster placement, and to the risk of emotional harm should the assessment break down. In both cases the duration of the assessment would be too short to enable the report writer to give any sufficient guarantee that the mother would not, as predicted by the local authority and the guardian, resume her relationship with the father in due course.\u201d",

The assessment of the mother would never have been able to provide evidence that would be sufficient to justify the refusal of a care order and the decision to return [K.] to his mother, given her shortcomings and the real risk that she would be unable to maintain her separation from the father. In reality the only effect of postponing the decision to make a care order was to delay, and therefore to jeopardise, the process of finding an alternative long term placement for [K.] by way of adoption ...

But it is hard to see how that application was justified on the facts and circumstances, and [the County Court\u2019s] decision to set aside an order which stood on flimsy legal foundation is hardly open to challenge. Nor do I think in the end that there is any substance [to the complaint] that he dealt with the outcome in too peremptory a fashion. After all, the mother\u2019s legal team knew from the form of the notices of appeal to the circuit judge precisely what the local authority sought to gain from the hearing. It was quite open to [counsel for the applicant] to submit to the judge that he should not make a placement order even if he were persuaded to make a care order, since there was insufficient material to enable him to carry out the Section 1 review. It seems that she did not make that submission prior to judgment and, as I have already observed, she ignored the opportunity to make it immediately on receipt of the written judgment and to ask the judge to reconsider the order of 6 [June].\u201d",

Third, there was nothing on the face of the County Court judgment to indicate that the judge had left K.\u2019s wishes out of account in reaching its decision. Fourth, there was nothing to suggest that the decision would have been different had the applicant submitted that he lacked sufficient information to make a placement order. Fifth, the applicant could have, had she so wished, made that submission by taking advantage of the judge\u2019s invitation (see paragraph 82 above). Sixth, considering the evidence as a whole, it was clear that each decision had been taken because on the basis of expert evidence the courts considered that returning K. either to his parents or to the applicant alone would cause harm and would not be in his best interests. Finally, the Government pointed out that before any final adoption order was made the court would be obliged again to consider the matters set out in section 1 of the 2002 Act.

However, it observes that the considerations listed in section 1 of the 2002 Act (see paragraph 103 above) broadly reflect the various elements inherent in assessing the necessity under Article 8 of a measure placing a child for adoption. In particular, it considers that in seeking to identify the best interests of a child and in assessing the necessity of any proposed measure in the context of placement proceedings, the domestic court must demonstrate that it has had regard to, inter alia, the age, maturity and ascertained wishes of the child, the likely effect on the child of ceasing to be a member of his original family and the relationship the child has with relatives.",

Further, the national authorities have had the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned, often at the very stage when care measures are being envisaged or immediately after their implementation. There is therefore a need to allow them a certain margin of appreciation in deciding how best to deal with the cases before them and it is accordingly not the Court\u2019s task to substitute itself for the domestic authorities but to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken and assessments made by those authorities in the exercise of their margin of appreciation (see\u00a0K and T., cited above, \u00a7 154; A.D. and O.D., cited above, \u00a7 83; Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, \u00a7 138; and R. and H., cited above, \u00a7 81).

This is accordingly a domain in which there is an even greater call than usual for protection against arbitrary interferences (see B. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, \u00a7\u00a063, Series A no. 121; X v. , no. 11223/04, \u00a7 47, 17 July 2008; and R. and H., cited above, \u00a7 76).",

The Court has indicated that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of taking a child into care. However, a stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by the authorities on parental rights of access, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life, as such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between the parents and a young child are effectively curtailed (see K and T., cited above, \u00a7 155; R.K. and A.K., cited above, \u00a7 34; and A.D. and O.D., cited above, \u00a7 83; R. and H., cited above, \u00a7 81).

He considered that the duration of the assessment would be too short to provide sufficient guarantees that the separation of the applicant and P.C. would last (see paragraph 80 above). He reached the conclusion that \u201cthe evidence about the mother was clear\u201d and that an assessment of the applicant would never be able to provide evidence that would be sufficient to justify the refusal of a care order, given her shortcomings and the real risk that she would resume her relationship with P.C. Thus the only effect of the decision to order an assessment was to delay and jeopardise the prospect of finding a long-term placement for K (see paragraph 81 above).",

While, as the Court has explained above, it is in a child\u2019s best interests that his family ties be maintained where possible, it is clear that in K.\u2019s case this was outweighed by the need to ensure his development in a safe and secure environment (see\u00a0paragraph 134 above). In this regard the Court observes that attempts were made to rebuild the family through the provision of support for alcohol abuse and opportunities for parenting assistance (see paragraphs 27 and 33 above). When the applicant indicated that she had separated from P.C., she was given details of domestic violence support that she could access (see\u00a0paragraph 26 above). It appears that she did not access such support and ultimately reconciled with P.C. on that occasion. The reports prepared by the social worker, the guardian and D.I. highlighted the difficulties encountered in trying to assist the family to address concerns as a result of the parents\u2019 failure to engage with the authorities and, in particular, P.C.\u2019s uncooperative stance (see paragraphs 36-37, 41, 44-45, 47 and 58 above).",

The issue is not merely one of form or procedure: there can be no more draconian measure in the context of the relationship between parent and child than an order which permanently severs family ties. The need for safeguards against arbitrary, or even merely unjustified or unnecessary interference, is compelling (see\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0136), and one such safeguard is the provision of clear and detailed reasoning in the judgment demonstrating not only that the child\u2019s best interest and other factors have been weighed in the balance, but also that the domestic criteria for the making of the relevant order have been carefully considered and scrupulously applied. The County Court judgment is lacking in all this.",

In any case, the \u201cremedy\u201d of requesting the judge to, as it were, beef up his reasoning after the judgment has been delivered (which seems to be more than just correcting mere factual error, spelling mistakes, numbers etc), thereby allowing the judge to \u201cmake up\u201d for substantial mistakes even in his assessment of the facts or of the law, seems a very odd way of administering justice.",
