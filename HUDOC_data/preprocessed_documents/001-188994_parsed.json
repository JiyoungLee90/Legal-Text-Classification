The Education Authority concluded that the children were growing up in a \u201cparallel world\u201d without any contact with their peers and that they received no attention of any kind which would enable them to have a part in communal life in Germany. It therefore suggested a court measure under Article 1666 of the German Civil Code (see paragraph 25 below), arguing the children\u2019s best interests were endangered owing to their being systematically deprived of the opportunity to participate in \u201cnormal\u201d life. The youth office (Jugendamt \u2013 hereinafter: \u201cthe youth office\u201d) supported the request of the Education Authority.

It also ordered the applicants to hand their children over to the youth office for enforcement of the rules on compulsory school attendance and authorised the youth office to use force if necessary. In its reasoning the court stated that the parents\u2019 persistent refusal to send their children to a State school or a recognised grant-aided independent school not only violated section 67 of the Hesse School Act (Hessisches Schulgesetz) (see paragraph 31 below) but also represented an abuse of parental authority which risked damaging the children\u2019s best interests in the long term. Independent from the question of whether it could be ensured that the children were acquiring sufficient knowledge through the applicants\u2019 homeschooling, the children\u2019s not attending school was preventing them from becoming part of the community and learning social skills such as tolerance, assertiveness and the ability to assert their own convictions against majority-held views. The court found that the children needed to be exposed to influences other than those of their parental home to acquire those skills. Lastly, the court concluded that no less severe measures were available. Owing to the persistent refusal of the applicants to send their children to school, only withdrawing parts of parental authority could ensure the children\u2019s continual attendance at school and would prevent them suffering harm on account of them being educated at home.",

On 22 November 2012 a member of staff of the youth office, acting as the children\u2019s guardian, attempted to take the children to the Education Authority\u2019s premises to conduct the learning assessment. The children refused to go with him. A second attempt to take the children to the learning assessment on the same day by two members of the public-order office and a police patrol also failed on account of the children\u2019s refusal to accompany them. In a letter dated 10 December 2012 the applicants were notified of two dates (19 December 2012 and 17\u00a0January 2013) on which the children were to be assessed at home. The applicants submitted statements to the Education Authority in which they informed the latter that the children did not wish to participate in the assessment. In a letter dated 20 December 2012 the Education Authority informed the applicants\u2019 lawyer that in order to ensure the children\u2019s school attendance the children would, among other things, firstly have to undergo a learning assessment. At the same time the parents were informed that the appointment of 19 December 2012 had been cancelled, but the appointment of 17 January 2013 still stood. However, staff of the Education Authority were not allowed to enter the family home when they arrived for the appointment in January 2013. The father spoke to the members of staff and explained that he believed that the Family Court\u2019s decision had been unlawful and that he alone was authorised to decide whether his children attended school or not.",

At the outset the court noted that up to that date the children had not attended school, even though the decision of the Darmstadt Family Court had not been suspended. It also observed that all attempts to conduct a learning assessment had failed on account of the children\u2019s and the parents\u2019 resistance. As to the law, the court outlined that the decision to withdraw parts of parental authority under Articles 1666 and 1666a of the Civil Code (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below) presupposed a significant endangerment of the best interests of the children, which the parents were unable or unwilling to prevent. To establish such an endangerment, a process of balancing the various interests had to be undertaken, during which the rights and interests of the children and of the parents as well as the interests of society had to be considered. In particular, a withdrawal of parental authority could not be justified to enable children to receive the best possible education but only to prevent any endangerment of children. Applying these principles to the case at hand, the court concluded that the applicants\u2019 persistent refusal to ensure that their children attended school risked damaging the best interests of the children. According to the court, the children\u2019s best interests were in concrete danger on account of them being kept in a \u201csymbiotic\u201d family system and being denied an education which met standards which were both well recognised and fundamentally important for growing up in society. The education they were receiving from the applicants could not compensate for not attending school. Five hours of homeschooling \u2013 including a lunch break \u2013, which was conducted concurrently for all four children, could not suffice to offer each child a range of schooling appropriate to his or her age. In addition, the children were also not members of any sports club, music school or similar organisation where they could acquire other skills important for their education. The court also noted that the applicants\u2019 submissions as a whole showed that their main concern was creating a strong attachment between the children and their parents to the exclusion of others. Moreover, by their persistent refusal they were also teaching the children that they did not need to comply with the rules of community life if they found them disagreeable. Lastly, the Court of Appeal found that there were no less severe measures available, since merely issuing instructions would have been ineffective, as shown by the applicants\u2019 previous conduct and submissions. Consequently, the withdrawal of parts of parental authority by the Family Court had been correct.",

The court held that, as pointed out in its decision of 25 April 2013 (see paragraph 15 above), the applicants\u2019 persistent refusal to send their children to school constituted child endangerment and that neither their temporary schooling nor the learning assessment of the children had changed that conclusion. However, the court continued, the situation had changed in comparison to that of August 2013, at which point \u2013 according to the information provided by the youth office \u2013 several elements had led to the children\u2019s removal from the family home: a risk emanating from the children\u2019s father to their physical integrity could not be excluded; failed attempts to bring the children to school by the police had led to the risk of the children internalising the attitude that laws had had no bearing on them; attempts to carry out a learning assessment had failed owing to the resistance of the applicants; and according to the information available at the time, it had been possible to assume that the children had had no contact with anyone outside of the family whatsoever. According to the information gathered since the removal of the children by the youth office, any risk to their physical integrity emanating from the applicants could now be excluded. Moreover, the learning assessment had showed that the knowledge level of the children was not alarming and that the children were not being kept from school against their will. Since permanent removal of the children from their parents would be the only possible way to ensure the continued schooling of the children, this was no longer proportionate as it would have a greater impact on the children than being homeschooled by their parents. The Court of Appeal however emphasised that the present decision should not be understood as permission for the applicants to homeschool their children. In that regard it observed that the Education Authority had already lodged a criminal complaint against the applicants for failing to comply with the rules on compulsory school attendance, which carried a maximum sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment.",

A partial withdrawal of parental authority and the ordering of guardianship are in principle suitable for countering such an abuse of parental authority.

The interferences had been, however, in accordance with the law and had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the health, rights and freedoms of the applicants\u2019 children. Moreover, the interferences had been necessary in a democratic society. The German authorities had established, based on the information available at the relevant time, that the best interest of the children had been at risk and that this fact had required the partial withdrawal of parental authority. Despite compulsory school attendance, the children had not attended a State school for years. The schooling by, in particular, their mother had had to be regarded as inadequate, since the children had been taught only for five hours a day, interrupted by a lunch break, and, notwithstanding their different ages, all children had been taught together and the same curriculum. In addition, the children had had no regular contact with society and hardly any opportunity to meet children of their own age, for example during music lessons or in sports clubs, or to acquire social skills. They consequently had grown up isolated within their own family enclave, in which the applicants had ensured that their children had established a strong attachment to them, to the exclusion of others. The courts had therefore correctly assumed that a \u201csymbiotic\u201d family system had emerged. Further information had not been available to the authorities as the applicants had persistently resisted and prevented the children\u2019s situation from being examined in detail by the youth office or the Education Authority. The domestic courts, in particular the Frankfurt am Main Court of Appeal, outlined these sufficient and relevant reasons in detail in their decisions. The courts had also assessed whether less severe measures had been available but had correctly concluded that, given the applicants\u2019 previous conduct and persistent rejection of schooling outside their own home, which could not even be changed by criminal sanctions, no other measures had been available. Moreover, as soon as the learning assessment had been undertaken and the applicants had agreed to send their children to a public school, the children had been returned to their parents.",

On a procedural level, decisions had to be based on sufficient and relevant reasons, parents had to be involved in the proceedings and separation of children and parents should only be a measure of last resort and kept as short as possible. Ordo Iuris further argued that home-schooling as such could not justify removal of children from their parents and made extensive submissions \u2013 in particular concerning Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention \u2013 regarding the protection of a right to home-schooling under the Convention.

Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7 66, ECHR\u00a02002I). The margin of appreciation will vary in the light of the nature of the issues and the seriousness of the interests at stake, such as, on the one hand, the importance of protecting a child in a situation which is assessed as seriously threatening his or her health or development and, on the other hand, the aim to reunite the family as soon as circumstances permit (K. and T. v. Finland [GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7\u00a0155, ECHR 2001VII; Mohamed Hasan v. Norway, no. 27496/15, \u00a7 145, 26 April 2018). The Court reiterates that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when assessing the necessity of taking a child into care (see K. and T. v.\u00a0Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0155). In addition, the Court will have regard to the fact that perceptions as to the appropriateness of intervention by public authorities in the care of children vary from one Contracting State to another, depending on such factors as traditions relating to the role of the family and to State intervention in family affairs and the availability of resources for public measures in this particular area.

In contrast, having regard to the statements of, in particular, Mr. Wunderlich \u2013 for example that he considered children to be the \u2018property\u2019 of their parents \u2013 and on the information available at the time, the authorities reasonably assumed that the children were isolated, had no contact with anyone outside of the family and that a risk to their physical integrity existed (see paragraphs 10, 18 and 23 above). The Court also reiterates that even mistaken judgments or assessments by professionals do not per se render childcare measures incompatible with the requirements of Article 8. The authorities \u2013 both medical and social \u2013 have a duty to protect children and cannot be held liable every time genuine and reasonably-held concerns about the safety of children vis-\u00e0-vis members of their families are proved, retrospectively, to have been misguided (see R.K. and A.K. v. the United Kingdom, no. 38000/05, \u00a7 36, 30 September 2008). The Court would also add that the unavailability of this information was based on the applicants\u2019 resistance to have the learning assessment conducted prior to the removal of the children.",

The Court observes that the Darmstadt Family Court heard testimony from the applicants, their children and the youth office and appointed a guardian ad litem for the children to represent their interests. In addition, the applicants submitted extensive written pleadings to the domestic courts. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicants, represented by legal counsel, were in a position to put forward all their arguments against the temporary and partial withdrawal of parental authority and that the procedural requirements implicit in Article 8 of the Convention were complied with.",

They held, in particular, that the prior conduct of the applicants and their persistent resistance to measures had shown that merely issuing instructions would be ineffective. The Court notes that not even prior administrative fines had changed the applicants\u2019 refusal to send their children to school.

In that regard it notes that the children were returned to their parents after the learning assessment had been conducted and the applicants had agreed to send their children to school. The Court therefore concludes that the actual removal of the children did not last any longer than necessary in the children\u2019s best interest and was also not implemented in a way which was particularly harsh or exceptional (see K.\u00a0and T. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0173).
