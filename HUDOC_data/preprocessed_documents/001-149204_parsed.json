The notice of dismissal also referred to three paragraphs of the University staff regulations (see paragraphs 32-34 above). In applying the above legislation to the facts of the case the domestic courts analysed whether the content of the impugned email was compatible with several ethical principles; this, according to domestic practice, was sufficiently foreseeable (see paragraph 35 above). Although the applicant contested the quality of the above provisions and their application by the domestic courts, the measure was based on sufficiently clear provisions of domestic law according to which employees owed to their employer a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion (see Guja v. Moldova [GC], no. 14277/04, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2008). The Court reiterates in this connection that even if the requirement to act in good faith in the context of an employment contract does not imply an absolute duty of loyalty towards the employer or a duty of discretion to the point of subjecting the worker to the employer\u2019s interests, certain manifestations of the right to freedom of expression that may be legitimate in other contexts are not legitimate in that of labour relations (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others, cited above, \u00a7 76).

These principles provide that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual\u2019s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly. Moreover, Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed (see, among many other authorities, Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053 and the case-law cited there).",

In this connection the Court refers to the defendant\u2019s submissions during the court hearing in which it submitted that the email contained threats and blackmail and that the applicant had fulfilled his threats by publicly divulging defamatory statements about his employer (see paragraph 21 above).

In reaching their conclusion about the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s dismissal the domestic courts analysed the applicant\u2019s motivation and concluded that it ran counter to the ethical principles enshrined in the concept of \u201cgood morals\u201d under section 101 of the Labour Law.",

Firstly, it was not disputed that it was the reorganisation of the department which prompted the applicant to raise complaints and to question the transparency of the procedure. In this connection the Court notes that before sending the impugned email the applicant came up with several proposals and explicitly asked the Rector to forward them to the members of the constituent assembly (see paragraph 11 above). Thus, the applicant attempted first to address the issues within the hierarchy (see, mutatis mutandis, Heinisch, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a072-76, and Guja, cited above, \u00a7\u00a073). Secondly, in view of the structure of the University, it was not completely unreasonable to address the demands to the Rector, given that the latter was the respondent in the appeal proceedings and, in accordance with the constitution of the University, could convene the constituent assembly (see paragraph 32 above). In addition, he had a right of suspensive veto in the Senate (ibid.) and was the highest-ranking official managing the University, and represented it without specific authorisation. The Court also notes that in the contested email the applicant explicitly expressed his intention to inform the constituent assembly before it took its decision, and that the deadline by which the applicant asked the Rector to reply coincided with the meeting of the constituent assembly. Thirdly, as regards the calculation of the compensation, the amount requested was not unreasonable, in view of the fact that the applicant had been elected as a professor until April\u00a02013 and that the proposed settlement was based on his average monthly income as well as on the terms laid down in his employment contract, according to which all disputes should first be settled in an amicable manner.",
