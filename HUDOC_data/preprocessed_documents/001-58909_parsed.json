The real difficulty in the case seems to me to arise from the sweepingly broad and unqualified terms of Article 236 itself. The Article makes it an offence punishable with imprisonment for anyone to insult a civil servant during and in connection with the carrying out of his official duties. As I understand it, the Article allows no discretion to the domestic court other than to convict a defendant once it finds that insults have been addressed to a civil servant when carrying out his official duties. In particular, it appears that the court is neither required nor free to examine the circumstances in which insulting words were used, or whether the use of the words could be justified, or whether the conduct of the civil servant provoked the insulting words or whether the use of the words in any way hindered the civil servant in the performance of his official duties. In this regard, I note the Government\u2019s submission that, in determining whether an offence is committed under Article 236, \u201cit is irrelevant or indifferent whether a civil servant was substantially right or wrong in undertaking a specific action within his official duties ..., it is sufficient to establish that a civil servant was insulted during the carrying out of his/her official duties\u201d. This is in marked contrast to the provisions of Austrian law which were examined by the Court in the case of Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 2) (judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV), where a defence was available to a person using insulting language to another if the insults were provoked and resulted from the understandable indignation of the person concerned.",

The applicant was, in these circumstances, amply justified in exercising his freedom of expression in remonstrating with the municipal guards. The fact that, in the course of doing so, he used two insulting words which evidently reflected his sense of frustration with the attitude of the guards, could not in my view justify his prosecution.
