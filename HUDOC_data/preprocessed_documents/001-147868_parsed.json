Using the same approach and making an assessment based on all the materials at its disposal, the Court estimates the pecuniary damage suffered at EUR 40,000. Furthermore, since the value of the right of use, at the material time, was equivalent to the market value of a corresponding share in a flat in whose respect such right was enjoyed (ibid., \u00a7 20), the Court decides to award this amount to the applicants jointly (see also Tunyan and Others, cited above, and Danielyan and Others, cited above), while dismissing the remainder of their claim.
