In the current case, the applicant set out in his application form sent on 18\u00a0July 2013 a description of his conditions in Timi\u0219 Police Inspectorate which raised a prima facie issue concerning the compliance by the State authorities with the criteria set forth in Article 3 of the Convention in this respect. It was therefore sufficient to warrant examination by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Br\u00e2ndu\u015fe v.

The Court has already had the opportunity to examine similar objections raised by the Government in a number of cases and decided that in the applicants\u2019 situation there was an effective remedy for their complaints (see Petrea v.\u00a0Romania, no. 4792/03, \u00a7\u00a7 33-36, 29 April 2008, and Toma Barbu v.\u00a0Romania, no. 19730/10, \u00a7\u00a7 74-76, 30 July 2013). The Court notes that there is no evidence in the files to show that the applicants raised this complaint before the domestic authorities. Therefore, the applicants\u2019 complaint concerning the lack of adequate medical treatment while in detention is inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. Consequently, it must be rejected in accordance with Articles 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",
