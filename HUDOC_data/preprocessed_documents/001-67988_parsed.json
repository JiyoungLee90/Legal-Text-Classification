It finds that it would be inappropriate to separate the contentious and administrative proceedings and to assess their length in isolation (see Svetlana Naumenko v. Ukraine, no. 41984/98, judgment of 9 November 2004, \u00a7 74). It therefore decides to dismiss the Government's objection as to the admissibility of the applicant's complaint about the length of the contentious proceedings, which they deemed out of time. As to the overall length of the proceedings at issue, the Court notes that they began in February 1998 and were terminated on 6 April 2001. Their duration was therefore three years and two months for two levels of jurisdiction. It finds that the proceedings in the applicant's case were conducted actively and continuously throughout this period as both the contentious and the administrative proceedings concerned the same subject-matter, namely the recovery of the money which had been transferred to accounts in the Savings Bank. During this period, the case was remitted for reconsideration on three occasions, the proceedings were adjourned three times and the administrative proceedings were terminated. The Court also notes that a protest was lodged against the final decision given in the applicant's favour.",
