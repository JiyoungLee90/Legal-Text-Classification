The Permanency Panel did not make any recommendations on adoption at this stage but recommended that the care plan should be made more explicit and the second applicant, who had stopped drinking at this time, be monitored to see if she remained sober. It referred the matter of the care plan back to the LAC review. On 4 September 2003, the LAC referred N\u2019s case to the Adoption Panel. However, it also decided that a \u201ckinship assessment\u201d (a social work assessment of whether a specific family member can care for a child) be completed in respect of N\u2019s maternal grandmother, MRH. That assessment was completed in November 2003 and concluded that it would not be appropriate for N to be placed with MRH.

The  is unusual amongst members of the Council of Europe in permitting the total severance of family ties without parental consent. (Professor Triseliotis thought that only  and perhaps one other European country allowed this.) It is, of course, the most draconian interference with family life possible. That is not to say that it can never be justified in the interests of the child. The  has said that where the interests of the child and the interests of the adults conflict, the interests of the child must prevail: eg Yousef v The  [2003] 1 FLR 210, para 73. But it can be expected that the European Court would scrutinise the relevance and sufficiency of the reasons given for such a drastic interference with the same intensity with which it has scrutinised severance decisions in other care cases: see, in particular, P, C and S v United Kingdom [2002] 2 FLR 631, para. 118. The margin of appreciation accorded to the national authorities is correspondingly reduced. In a freeing application, the question must be whether it is necessary and proportionate to sever the links with the family of birth if a new family has not yet been identified.\u201d",

The child\u2019s welfare was paramount but this did not mean that a court should exclude the parent\u2019s Article 8 rights from its consideration. This was applied in Homefirst Community Health and Social Services Trust v. SN [2005] NICA 14 to a \u201cfreeing order\u201d (see\u00a0section 2 below). In that case, the mother\u2019s child was taken from her care four months after his birth. She underwent therapy for personality and mental health difficulties. The Court of Appeal found that, had the Trust in that case been fully cognisant of the mother\u2019s rights under Article 8, it should have given her a further opportunity to prove herself through therapy. Despite the progress she had made, at the time of the court\u2019s judgment her son had been settled with prospective adopters for nearly three years and thus it was in the child\u2019s best interest that he should be freed for adoption.

The \ntwo-stage procedure of freeing N for adoption and then seeking an adoption order was compatible with Article 8. The aim was to resolve issues of consent at an early stage, thus providing clarity and certainty for all concerned. This often required courts to proceed without knowing which form of adoption was possible but it was recognised that it was easier to find adoptive parents after a child had been freed. It would sometimes be undesirable for a court to consider adoption in the abstract but there were also cases where the need to free the child was so pressing that it should be done even without knowing what form adoption would take. The domestic courts had taken such a view with N. It was open to them on the evidence to do so. The applicants had participated throughout the proceedings, (in\u00a0contrast with B. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121) and had been represented throughout (in contrast with P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 56547/00, ECHR 2002VI). Even after the freeing order they were joined to proceedings for the adoption order hearing (in\u00a0contrast with X v. Croatia, no. 11223/04, 17 July 2008). The present case was therefore much closer to Scott v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a034745/97, 8 February 2000, where the Court had upheld a decision to free the child of an alcoholic mother for adoption because the mother had had the opportunity to participate in the proceedings.",

They made the following five points in respect of Baroness Hale\u2019s dissent. First, it was incorrect that Article 18(2) contemplated, or even expected, that prospective adopters would be found before a freeing order was made: it only required that it be likely that the child be placed for adoption. The virtue of a freeing order was that it widened the choice of prospective adopters to those who would only contemplate adoption if it was likely to be endorsed by the court. Second, it was incorrect to state that, in , the search for prospective adopters only took place after a freeing order was made; in the present case, this had been done by looking for carers who had been approved as both foster and adoptive carers. Third, there were ways in  in which both birth parents and prospective adopters could participate simultaneously in child care proceedings. Fourth, in , the courts considered issues of post-adoption contact before an application for an adoption order was made: for example, such an approach had been taken in Re Z. and T. (see paragraph 46 above). Fifth, even Baroness Hale had accepted that there were cases in which the need to free a child for adoption was so pressing that a freeing order should be made without knowing what options were available.",

It is not an easy task to find suitable adoptive parents for a child, particularly when that child has already formed emotional ties to his or her biological parents. Even where suitable adoptive parents can be found, there may be a reluctance on their part to consider adoption when the biological parents are opposed to such and where there is a possibility that a final adoption order will not be made. If freeing a child makes it easier to find adoptive parents and if there is a pressing need to place that child for adoption, then seeking a freeing order may well be the best means of safeguarding his or her best interests. Moreover, it is clear from the relevant Northern Irish legislation that freeing orders are not made lightly or without reference to clear and well-defined criteria. By Article 3(1)(a) of the 1995 Order, a child\u2019s welfare should be the domestic court\u2019s paramount consideration (see paragraph 43 above). Article 9 of the 1987 Order reiterates that principle and further directs the court to give full consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child; the importance of providing the child with a stable and harmonious home; and the wishes and feelings of the child (see\u00a0paragraph 45 above). Article 18(2) further requires that the court be satisfied that it is likely that a child will be placed for adoption (or has already been so placed), a more exacting requirement that the current statutory scheme in England and  (see paragraphs 47 and 49 above). Although it would clearly be more advantageous to the biological parents if they were to retain the right to participate to the end of adoption proceedings (that is, to have the right to participate in the second, adoption order stage), their interests must be balanced against the interests of the child (see Sommerfeld v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a031871/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062-64, ECHR\u00a02003VIII (extracts). If it is in the child\u2019s interests to be adopted, and if the chances of a successful adoption would be maximised by a freeing order, then the interests of the biological parents must inevitably give way to that of the child. The  statutory scheme, as interpreted by the Northern Irish courts, allows for that balance to be struck between those interests in a manner which shows appropriate respect for all those concerned. As such, it is capable of being applied compatibly with Article 8.",

The applicants\u2019 reasons for resisting the freeing order were first, their wish to rely on the second applicant\u2019s prolonged sobriety and second, the uncertainty as to whether there would be post-adoption contact. However, the very reason why the trial judge had made the freeing order was his conclusion that there was a pressing need for N to be adopted. In\u00a0reaching that conclusion, the trial judge also found that the timescale for addressing the second applicant\u2019s alcohol problem was too long to be in N\u2019s interests and that the benefits of adoption outweighed the benefits of post-adoption contact. It is unclear, therefore, that the reasons advanced by the applicants to resist the adoption would have had any greater resonance had they been able to rely on them at the adoption order stage of proceedings. However, even assuming that they would, it is clear to the Court that, by the freeing order stage of proceedings, the interests of the applicants in further participating in the proceedings had to give way to N\u2019s interests in being placed for adoption.",

This course of action may have provided greater procedural protection to the applicants because it would have enabled them to better resist the adoption by arguing either that the Trust had not carried out a proper search for prospective adopters or that the prospective adopters were being unreasonable in refusing post-adoption contact. However, the trial judge was well aware of this aspect of the applicants\u2019 case. He was also aware of the difficulties in proceeding without a clear picture as to the identity or attitude of prospective adopters. Some weight must be attached to his finding that, even if prospective adopters who would agree to post-adoption contact could not be found, the benefits of adoption outweighed those of post-adoption contact. On the basis of the evidence before him (and\u00a0in particular the evidence of Professor Triseliotis), this was a conclusion he was entitled to draw and there was nothing arbitrary or unfair in his conclusion that N\u2019s adoption was best achieved by making a freeing order. Moreover, the Court also considers that due weight must be given to the evolution in the Trust\u2019s position in the course of the proceedings before the High Court. They had initially been opposed to post-adoption contact but later indicated that they would look for prospective adopters who would meet N\u2019s need for post-adoption contact. In the event, the Trust were able to find adopters who did agree to contact. In the Court\u2019s view, the Trust\u2019s efforts to accommodate the applicants\u2019 concerns goes some way to mitigating the effects of the High Court\u2019s decision to make the freeing order without knowing the views of prospective adopters. Finally, the subsequent proceedings in the case indicate that, even after the freeing order had been made and upheld on appeal, the applicants were able to participate in the proceedings and to make representations as to the issue of post-adoption contact (see paragraphs\u00a034- 37 above). Indeed, they were able to do so because, as the High Court observed in its judgment of 25 February 2008, the Northern Irish courts were to consider the issue of post-adoption contact with \u201cfresh eyes\u201d after Baroness Hale\u2019s dissenting judgment in the House of Lords (see paragraph 35 above).",

Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed (see Elsholz v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2000-VIII, and Kutzner v.\u00a0Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2002I). For these reasons, measures which deprive biological parents of the parental responsibilities and authorise adoption should only be applied in exceptional circumstances and can only be justified if they are motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining to the child\u2019s best interests (see Aune v. , no. 52502/07, \u00a7\u00a066, 28 October 2010; Johansen, cited above, \u00a7 78 and, mutatis mutandis, P.,\u00a0C. and S. v. the , no. 56547/00, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2002VI). However, mistaken judgments or assessments by professionals do not per se render childcare measures incompatible with the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention. The authorities, both medical and social, have duties to protect children and cannot be held liable every time genuine and reasonably held concerns about the safety of children vis\u00e0vis members of their family are proved, retrospectively, to have been misguided (R.K. and A.K. v. the , no. 38000/05, \u00a7 36, 30\u00a0September 2008).",

In respect of the actions of the Trust, the Court does not consider that the applicants\u2019 argument that the Trust failed to keep its plans for N under review is supported by the evidence before it. From the chronology set out at paragraphs 10\u201313 above, the Court is satisfied that the Trust had not decided irrevocably to have N placed for adoption without first considering the possibility of placing her with MRH. The initial care plan submitted by the Trust with its application for a care order contemplated adoption but did not commit it to pursuing only adoption. The Permanency Panel, in referring N to the Adoption Panel on 20 August 2003, declined to make any recommendations on adoption. The LAC review of 4 September 2003 decided simultaneously to refer N to the Adoption Panel and to have a kinship assessment completed on MRH. It may well be that the Trust was prompted to carry out the kinship assessment by the greater interest shown by MRH in looking after N, but the decision to carry out the assessment was taken before MRH had taken the formal step of applying for a residence order on 23 September 2003. The result of that assessment showed that the Trust had good reason to reject the possibility of N being placed with MRH and the applicants have not sought to show that, before the application for the care order was made, any other family member had come forward as an alternative carer. Some weight must be attached to the Family Judge\u2019s decision to grant the Trust\u2019s care order application, refuse MRH\u2019s residence order application and approve the Trust\u2019s plan to reduce gradually N\u2019s contact with her family. The Court also considers that, in light of the second applicant\u2019s previous relapses, the Trust was entitled to maintain its application for a freeing order and to leave it for the court, in deciding on that application, to consider what, if any, progress had been made by the second applicant at that time. The Trust\u2019s willingness to change its position on post-adoption contact in the course of the freeing order proceedings supports the conclusion that it kept its position on adoption under review throughout the proceedings.",

Having identified these difficulties he went on to consider the appropriateness of further treatment. He\u00a0concluded that the Trust had taken all reasonable steps to help the applicant and that the timescale for any further help would be too long and would endanger N\u2019s welfare. In this context, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that N\u2019s welfare could not be sacrificed to the need to address the second applicant\u2019s problem with alcohol was both a relevant and sufficient reason for rejecting the applicants\u2019 submission that the freeing order should not be made because of the second applicant\u2019s sobriety. In addition, while it is true that the Court of Appeal took a more optimistic view of the second applicant\u2019s attempts to remain sober, all three members of the court agreed that adoption was in N\u2019s best interests. The majority also found that, even if there was a greater probability of the second applicant remaining sober than the trial judge had found, the possibility of a relapse could not be excluded and the evidence was that any such relapse would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for N. When read in conjunction with Lord Justice Nicholson\u2019s further observations as to the critical age of N (quoted at paragraph 25 above), these reasons are also relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 and complement those given by the trial judge.",

The domestic authorities were entitled to make different decisions as to the care of all of the children concerned in this case and to find that that N\u2019s age meant that adoption was in her best interests. Nor would it be appropriate to have regard only to the care the applicants have given to O: it is an unfortunate feature of this case that the subsequent difficulties which the applicants have had in caring for their other children would appear to justify the concerns of the domestic authorities which led them to remove N from the family home and place her for adoption. The domestic authorities, in seeking to protect the welfare of N and her siblings, have been required to respond to a complex and at times uncertain family situation. The Trust in particular, has had the benefit of long and close contact with the family and, for that reason, must enjoy a measure of discretion in its response (W., cited above, \u00a7 62). There is nothing to indicate that it has exercised improperly that discretion or that its concerns for N\u2019s welfare were not genuine or reasonable.",

However, in the Court\u2019s view, any failing on the part of the High Court was remedied by the approach taken by the Court of Appeal, which made clear its views that post-adoption contact was in N\u2019s interests and that the Trust should make every effort to find prospective adopters who would agree to such contact. Lord Justice Nicholson\u2019s direction that Lord Justice Campbell should preside at the adoption order hearing was made precisely in order to ensure that the Trust made those efforts.

As to the first submission, it is in the very nature of adoption that no real prospects for rehabilitation or family reunification exist and that it is instead in the child\u2019s best interests that she be placed permanently in a new family. Article 8 does not require that domestic authorities make endless attempts at family reunification; it only requires that they take all the necessary steps that can reasonably be demanded to facilitate the reunion of the child and his or her parents (Pini and Others v.\u00a0Romania, nos. 78028/01 and 78030/01, \u00a7 155, ECHR 2004V (extracts)). Equally, the Court has observed that, when a considerable period of time has passed since a child was originally taken into public care, the interest of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, K. and T. v.\u00a0Finland, cited above, \u00a7 155; Hofmann v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), no. 66516/01, 28 August 2007). Similar considerations must also apply when a child has been taken from his or her parents. As to the second submission, had the position of the Trust not changed in the course of the proceedings, and had the domestic courts not clearly expressed their preference for post-adoption contact, the Court might have seen greater force in the applicants\u2019 submission that they were acting reasonably in refusing to agree to adoption. However, the manner in which the freeing proceedings evolved demonstrates to the Court\u2019s satisfaction that, once the domestic courts had concluded that adoption was in N\u2019s best interests, they were also entitled to conclude that any reasonable parent who paid regard to their child\u2019s welfare would have consented to the adoption.
