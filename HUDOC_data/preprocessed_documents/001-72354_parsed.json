Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed.

Slovakia (dec.), no. 40221/98, 31 August 2000). Further, it has no power to examine, as such, any facts that took place more than six months before the introduction of an application, namely 15 April 2000 in this case. Finally, the Court observes that it has no jurisdiction to examine legislation or practice in the abstract (see the Holy Monasteries\u00a0v.\u00a0, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, p. 30-31, \u00a7 55).",

However, in respect of lustration proceedings, this consideration loses much of its validity. In the first place, lustration proceedings are, by their very nature, oriented towards the establishment of facts dating back to the communist era and are not directly linked to the current functions and operations of the security services. Thus, unless the contrary is shown on the facts of a specific case, it cannot be assumed that there remains a continuing and actual public interest in imposing limitations on access to materials classified as confidential under former regimes. Secondly, lustration proceedings inevitably depend on the examination of documents relating to the operations of the former communist security agencies. If the party to whom the classified materials relate is denied access to all or most of the materials in question, his or her possibilities to contradict the security agency\u2019s version of the facts would be severely curtailed. Finally, under the relevant laws, it is typically the security agency itself that has the power to decide what materials should remain classified and for how long. Since, it is the legality of the agency\u2019s actions which is in question in lustration proceedings, the existence of this power is not consistent with the fairness of the proceedings, including the principle of equality of arms. Thus, if a State is to adopt lustration measures, it must ensure that the persons affected thereby enjoy all procedural guarantees under the Convention in respect of any proceedings relating to the application of such measures.",

These rules were, however, secret and the applicant did not have full access to them. On the other hand, the State \u2013 in the person of the SIS \u2013 did have full access. In those circumstances, and irrespectively of whether the placing of the burden of proof on the applicant was compatible with domestic law, that requirement placed an unrealistic burden on him in practice and did not respect the principle of equality. It was thus excessive. The applicant\u2019s proceedings therefore cannot be considered as offering him effective protection of his right to respect for his private life.

I agree with that statement of principle and regard it as correct in general. However, I disagree with its application in this particular case since, as I understand them, the facts of this case do not support such a general conclusion. It is clearly not the case that \u201call or most of the materials in question\u201d were classified and inaccessible to the applicant. Only one document was not ultimately disclosed, namely the 1972 Guidelines, which the applicant invokes and relies upon as the ground for his allegations of inequality. I do not believe that the failure to disclose one old Act renders all the available proceedings unfair and incompatible with the Convention requirements. In my opinion, the domestic courts were right not to take a formalistic approach, and to choose instead to address the substance of the case rather than rely on the Guidelines, which were only distantly related to the particular circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case and to the assessment of his conduct at the material time. Having said that, I share the Chamber\u2019s view that there should be no limitations on access to materials classified as confidential or even secret under the former totalitarian communist regimes. Certainly, it must not be a security agency itself that decides what materials should or should not remain classified, and for how long.",
