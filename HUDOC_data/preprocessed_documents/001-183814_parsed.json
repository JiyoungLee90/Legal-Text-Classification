Considering the above-mentioned content of the article and the then ongoing dispute between the parties and especially their personal confrontation at the City Council, it is at the outset clear and without a doubt that the references (facts and characterisations) solely and exclusively concern the complainant. Furthermore, from the impugned article it is apparent that in it the following facts are included: that the complainant 1) had built a gazebo with a tiled roof on her land and that a part of the roof jutted out onto the street; 2) had built a pavement and had planted trees in a public space; 3) threatened to sue persons (who were proven to be the drivers of the defendant) who dared to park in a place where other residents also parked their cars. It is also apparent that these facts are accompanied by adverse judgments against her and that those facts are connected to her in her capacity as head of the local council, that is to say that her above-mentioned actions had taken place arbitrarily and in abuse of her position at Chortiatis Municipality. It was proved that the above-mentioned facts which the defendant disseminated to others via the local press were true, as the complainant admitted ... It was also proved that a) the above-mentioned facts that the defendant disseminated in the above-mentioned way could harm, seen objectively, the honour and reputation of the complainant, also in view of her aforementioned capacity in conjunction with the fact that the dissemination took place via the local press and became known to an indefinite number of people; b) the defendant knew that the disseminated facts were capable of harming the honour or reputation of the complainant, and c) the defendant wanted to make such a dissemination harming her honour and reputation. It follows that, in the present case, the above-mentioned elements objectively and subjectively constitute the criminal act of simple defamation (Article 362 of the Criminal Code) which, however, goes without punishment, under Article 366 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Criminal Code. Nevertheless, taking into account the way the above-mentioned defamation was expressed, and in the circumstances which were previously detailed, the court concludes that there was an intention to insult, and for this reason the defendant must be punished for this act. In particular, the court bases its conclusion on the fact that the applicant presented the above-mentioned true facts along with unacceptable value judgments and references to the complainant\u2019s public post, such as, \u2018Because those people will serve petty political \u2013 but mostly their own personal \u2013 interests much more readily in order to impose themselves more easily than others, others whose vote they wormed out by making many promises\u2019, and unfamiliar characterisations such as, \u2018Those are the totally (un)worthy, squeaky clean people in proper clothes every Sunday\u2019, or, \u2018As they are bailiffs, like spies, they also find out the names of the people from the number plates of the cars\u2019. Lastly, the defendant\u2019s separate argument that he committed this act with a legitimate interest must be dismissed as unfounded, as the above-mentioned expressions included in the article \u2018The ludicrousness of power\u2019, which the defendant published in the newspaper Chortiatis 570, indicate that he intended to insult the complainant. These phrases were not necessary in this case for the expression of the defendant\u2019s desire to protect the legitimate interest upon which he relied, and he could have used other phrases such as: \u2018they try to serve their [own] personal interests\u2019 instead of, \u2018Because those people will serve petty political \u2013 but mostly their own personal \u2013 interests much more readily in order to impose themselves more easily than others, others whose vote they wormed out by making many promises\u2019; or the phrase, \u2018the elected public persons\u2019 instead of, \u2018Those are the totally (un)worthy, squeaky clean people in proper clothes every Sunday\u2019; as well as the expression, \u2018as bailiffs, they know how to find other people\u2019s data\u2019, instead of, \u2018As they are bailiffs, like spies, they also find out the names of the people from the number plates of the cars\u2019 ...\u201d",

Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, among other authorities, Perna v.

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see, Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2004XI; and for cases specifically against Greece see, Mika v. Greece, no. 10347/10, \u00a7\u00a031, 19 December 2013; Koutsoliontos and Pantazis v.

The article mainly referred to E.P.\u2019s actions concerning a gazebo which had partly taken up public space. The Court notes that it has not been submitted, nor does it appear, that the accusations made against E.P. in the applicant\u2019s article concerned conduct that was regarded as criminal under domestic law (see Med\u017elis Islamske Zajednice Br\u010dko and Others v.

Accordingly, the accusations attained the requisite level of seriousness as could harm E.P.\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court therefore must verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance between the two values guaranteed by the Convention, namely, on the one hand, the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression protected by Article 10 and, on the other, E.P.\u2019s right to respect for her reputation under Article 8 (see Axel\u00a0Springer\u00a0AG, cited above, \u00a7 84).",

As such, her activities in that capacity were clearly of legitimate concern if not to the general public then to the readership of the local newspaper in which the applicant\u2019s article was published.

In the instant case, the Court takes into account that the applicant was sentenced to a two-month suspended prison sentence. In that regard, the Court reiterates that while the use of criminallaw sanctions in defamation cases is not in itself disproportionate (see Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, \u00a7\u00a040, ECHR 2004II; Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July, cited above, \u00a7\u00a047; Ziembi\u0144ski v. Poland (no. 2), no. 1799/07, \u00a7 46, 5 July 2016), a criminal conviction is a serious sanction, having regard to the existence of other means of intervention and rebuttal, particularly through civil remedies (see Frisk and Jensen v. Denmark, no. 19657/12, \u00a7 77, 5 December 2017). The Court has emphasised on many occasions that the imposition of a prison sentence in defamation cases will be compatible with the freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been seriously impaired, as, for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Cump\u0103n\u0103 and Maz\u0103re v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2004XI, and Mika, cited above, \u00a7 33). It considers that the circumstances of the instant case \u2013 a classic example of criticism of a locally elected politician in the context of a debate on a matter of public interest in the community \u2013 presented no justification for the imposition of a prison sentence. Such a sanction, by its very nature, will inevitably have a chilling effect on public discussion, and the notion that the applicant\u2019s sentence was in fact suspended does not alter that conclusion particularly as the conviction itself was not expunged (see Marchenko v. Ukraine, no. 4063/04, \u00a7 52, 19 February 2009 and Malisiewicz-G\u0105sior v. Poland, no. 43797/98, \u00a7 67, 6 April 2006).",

When, as in the present case, it nevertheless appears that the domestic courts have been insufficiently attentive to those standards, it would be highly desirable for the Court to give sufficiently clear guidance, so as to enable the domestic courts to discern the line of analysis which, in line with the Convention, should come into play in such situations.",

The Court has stated that where the balancing exercise between those two rights has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Delfi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0139, with further references).

In the present case, the applicant is a private individual who exercised his freedom of expression in relation to issues which had arisen in his own environment and drawn his attention in connection with his business activities.

France ([GC], nos.  and\u00a0, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2007IV, and Redaktsiya Gazety Zemlyaki v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7 42). Politicians, too, are entitled to have their reputation protected, even when they are not acting in a private capacity, but the requirements of that protection have to be weighed against the interests of the open discussion of political issues, or other issues of public interest (see Lingens v. Austria, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, \u00a7\u00a042).",

Local politicians or office holders are also legitimate targets of criticism for their acts or omissions in their public functions, although they may not otherwise be well-known to the public, even at the local level (see, for example, Ziembi\u0144ski v. Poland (no. 2), no.\u00a0, 5 July 2016; Jucha and \u017bak v. Poland, no. , \u00a7 45, 23\u00a0October 2012; and Kwiecie\u0144 v. Poland, no. , \u00a7 52, 9 January 2007).",

The key question is whether a publication or other action in the exercise of freedom of expression contributes to a debate of public interest. The Court has specified that the notion of public interest relates to matters which affect the public to such an extent that it may legitimately take an interest in them, which attract its attention or which concern it to a significant degree, especially in that they affect the well-being of citizens or the life of the community. This is also the case with regard to matters which are capable of giving rise to considerable controversy, which concern an important social issue, or which involve a problem that the public would have an interest in being informed about (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v. France [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a0103, 10 November 2015, with further references). Thus, for instance, the Court has underlined the importance of citizens being able to report on alleged irregularities in the conduct of public officials (see Med\u017elis Islamske Zajednice Br\u010dko and others, cited above, \u00a7 82). On the other hand, the communication of negative information concerning aspects of a person\u2019s private life rather than his or her conduct in a public function may not attract protection (see, for instance, Marin v. Romania, no. 306997/02, 3 February 2009).",

The Court has held that in order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks, bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may, on that basis, constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7 126). But even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d for the impugned statement: if there is not, that value judgment may prove excessive (see idem \u00a7 126, with further references).",

Ukraine, no. , \u00a7 50, 19 February 2009). In the context of insinuations published through the press by an advocate criticizing the outcome of a case and suggesting that the prosecutor was corrupt, the Court, reiterating that even value judgments could be excessive without a sufficient factual basis, held that the advocate\u2019s freedom of expression had not been violated, as no factual support for the insinuations had been presented (see Karpetas v.
