This implies above all that they are to be interpreted in a restrictive fashion if the Convention is not to become a dead letter. In fact, the Convention as a whole rests upon the unanimous rejection of this phenomenon of illegal child removals and upon the conviction that the best way to combat them at an international level is to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practical application of this principle requires that the signatory States be convinced that they belong, despite their differences, to the same legal community within which the authorities of each State acknowledge that the authorities of one of them \u2013 those of the child's habitual residence \u2013 are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic invocation of the said exceptions, substituting the forum chosen by the abductor for that of the child's residence, would lead to the collapse of the whole structure of the Convention by depriving it of the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration.\u201d",

The Government pointed out in this connection that the principle laid down in the preamble to the Hague Convention that a child wrongfully removed by its parents should be promptly returned to the State of its habitual residence was based on the premise that the primary victim was the child itself, thus obliging the States Parties to act diligently, in accordance with Articles 7 and 11 of the Hague Convention. The Government also observed that the Court had found against States which had not ensured a child's prompt return, had judged the adequacy of a measure by the swiftness of its implementation, and had further held that in certain cases it was for the competent national authorities to punish the abducting parent, as the passage of time could have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent with whom it did not live; they cited, among other authorities, the Maire v.\u00a0Portugal judgment of 26 June 2003 and the Ignaccolo-Zenide v.

On this point, the Government contended that no criticism could be laid against a court, as the first applicant had done, for making a restrictive interpretation of the exceptions to the principle of the child's prompt return, nor could it be inferred that this court had refused as a matter of principle to take account, in assessing the alleged risk, of the new situation arising from the child's abduction. They observed that the first applicant's interpretation would amount to rendering the Hague Convention devoid of substance, and it would be contrary to its very purpose if the parent responsible for the wrongful removal could systematically rely on his or her own unlawful action to invoke a risk of serious trauma in the event of the child's return to his or her place of habitual residence. The Government observed that the analysis made by the domestic courts was consistent with the solutions usually adopted by the various States Parties to the Hague Convention, and with the Court's case-law. They then concluded that the Court of Appeal had struck a fair balance between the competing interests, since it had taken into account, first, Charlotte's living conditions in her new environment (her strong attachment to her mother and her good relations with her maternal grandparents and her perfect integration in France), inferring therefrom that she had a strong capacity of adaptation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0as had been noted by the Court of Appeal in its 3\u00a0December 2004 judgment concerning the child's provisional placement in care ;\u00a0and,\u00a0secondly, the material, emotional and psychological aspects of the living conditions offered by her father, which were those that she had known for three years (the father's irreproachable conduct, contrary to the unproven allegations of the first applicant, the possibility for him to organise his working hours to look after Charlotte, his circle of family and friends, and the positive material aspects of the conditions in which the child would be received). The Court of Appeal had thus conducted a general examination of the best solution for the child, leading the Court of Cassation to find that it had legally substantiated its decision.",

In this connection it is appropriate to refer to Recommendation No. 874 (1979) of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly which states: \u201cChildren must no longer be considered as parents' property, but must be recognised as individuals with their own rights and needs\u201d. The Court further observes that in the Preamble to the Hague Convention the Contracting Parties express their conviction that \u201cthe interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody\u201d and stress their desire to \u201cprotect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the State of their habitual residence, as well as to secure protection for rights of access\u201d. These stipulations must be regarded as constituting the object and purpose, within the meaning of Article 31 \u00a7 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, of the Hague Convention (see, to that effect, Paradis and Others v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), no. 4783/03, 15 May 2003).",

As to the State's obligation to take positive measures, Article\u00a08 includes the right of a parent \u2013 in this case the father \u2013 to the taking of measures with a view to his or her being reunited with his or her child and an obligation on the national authorities to take such action (see, for example, Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 94). However, this obligation is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with his or her child may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparation. The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned are always important ingredients. In addition, when difficulties appear, mainly as a result of a refusal by the parent with whom the child lives to comply with the decision ordering the child's prompt return, the appropriate authorities should then impose adequate sanctions in respect of this lack of cooperation and, whilst coercive measures against children are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of manifestly unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the child lives (see Maire, cited above, \u00a7 76). Lastly, in this kind of case, the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation. Proceedings relating to the award of parental responsibility, including the enforcement of the final decision, require urgent handling as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent with whom it does not live. The Hague Convention recognises this fact because it provides for a range of measures to ensure the prompt return of children removed to or wrongfully retained in any . Article\u00a011 of the Hague Convention requires the judicial or administrative authorities concerned to act expeditiously to ensure the return of children and any failure to act for more than six weeks may give rise to a request for explanations (see Maire, cited above, \u00a7 74).",

The Court notes that Charlotte, following the delivery of the Court of Appeal's judgment of 13 May 2004, became untraceable, as her mother had hidden her whereabouts from the authorities to evade execution of the decision (see paragraph 20 above), thus showing the first applicant's total lack of cooperation with the French authorities. The circumstances of the police intervention at Charlotte's nursery school on 23 September 2004, albeit somewhat unclear, for the purposes of enforcing the judgment of 13 May 2004, were therefore the result of the first applicant's constant refusal to hand Charlotte over to her father voluntarily, despite a court order which had been enforceable for more than six months.",

She claimed that, in ordering her daughter's return to that country, the French authorities had not made sure in concreto that her rights would be preserved and, in particular, had not made the return subject to guarantees that she would have access to those courts. The first applicant explained that she had nevertheless pointed out that, in view of the US decision concerning the father's right of custody, it was to be feared that she would no longer be free to travel to and from that country, which was entitled to deny entry to anyone who had prevented a  citizen from exercising custody rights. She could not therefore be certain that she would be able to present her case effectively before the  courts or even to enter the country. Even if she did obtain leave to enter, she alleged that she would not be able to see her daughter in view of the order of the New York State Family Court, which had decided that her visits could only take place in the \u201ccourthouse\u201d and that she would have to deposit with the court 50,000 dollars, which was a considerable sum. In addition, she claimed that she had recently been required to undertake not to take any steps to contact her daughter in the United States, including by telephone, in return for the possibility that she might then be given of presenting her case before a  court.",

They moreover observed that prior to 2006 the applicant had not expressed the slightest intention of returning to that country, whereas she could have sought the \u201creactivation\u201d of her Green Card or used other solutions for travel to the United States, in particular the possibility of applying for a \u201cReturning Resident's Immigrant Visa\u201d. Cooperation between the Central Authorities, instituted by the Hague Convention itself, also ensured that a parent, in the event of a voluntary initiative, could return with no difficulty to the child's country of residence. In addition, the Government produced an official record dated 9 July 2004 showing that the first applicant had made representations to the prosecutor following the judgment of 13 May 2004 ordering Charlotte's return. It can be seen from this document, among other things, that in response to the mother's fears concerning the possibility of her arrest if she travelled to the United States, the public prosecutor notified her of a letter of 28\u00a0June 2004 from the New York Family Court certifying that no warrant had been issued for her arrest, and of a letter dated 2\u00a0July 2004 from the French Bureau of Consular Affairs referring to the legislation that applied in the United States to the right of abode of foreigners and explaining the various options open to her if she wished to reside there. Lastly, the Government observed that these fears had been shown by the facts of the case to be unfounded, because she had appeared before the judge hearing the case prior to the delivery of his order of 8 February 2006. The Government thus concluded that, in order to engage France's responsibility in this respect, the first applicant would have had to have shown that she had attempted to enter the  but had been prevented from doing so.",
