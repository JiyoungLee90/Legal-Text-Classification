Additionally, the applicant's congenital kidney anomaly had been prone to natural deterioration and could have led on its own to a decline in the kidney function, which was what had made the removal necessary. It could not be categorically established that the beating had not contributed to the need for the removal of the kidney, but the main factor had been the congenital anomaly.",

There existed direct evidence that the applicant had been subjected to violence even after he had been brought to the ground and had not had the possibility to resist or run away. Even if the officers had misidentified the applicant, this had not legally justified the physical assault that they had inflicted on him. Moreover, the use of force had continued after the applicant had been subdued. There existed a direct causal link between the violence and the injuries sustained, as confirmed by all of the medical expert reports. The court went on to state that it did not agree with the lower court's conclusion as regards the extent of the applicant's injury. To exclude the causal link between the surgical removal of the applicant's right kidney and the incident of 14 May 1994, the  had relied on the conclusion of four medical experts and had rejected as illogical the conclusion of Dr A.I. However, that court had disregarded that conclusion on purely formal grounds, without discussing its main points. It was unclear whether the opinion of the four experts was in fact based on the raw medical data, which in turn cast doubt on its correctness. The court concluded that if the lower court had taken into account these considerations, it could have made a different finding as to the reason for the surgical removal of the applicant's right kidney. However, since no appeal had been lodged by the prosecution, the court only noted this factual mistake and did not correct it in its judgment by holding that the applicant had suffered intermediate bodily harm, as that would worsen the accused's position.",

Where there is a choice of remedies, the exhaustion requirement must be applied to reflect the practical realities of the applicant's position, so as to ensure the effective protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (see Allgemeine Gold- und Silberscheideanstalt A.G. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9118/80, Commission decision of 9 March 1983, Decisions and Reports (DR) 32, p.\u00a0165; and, more recently, Krumpel and Krumpelov\u00e1 v.

Seeing that the remedies available within the criminal justice system in  are the normal avenue of redress for alleged police ill-treatment (see Kemerov v.\u00a0Bulgaria (dec.), no. 44041/98, 2 September 2004, with further references), the Court does not find the applicant's choice of procedure unreasonable. It may be true that even after the acquittal of the officers and the dismissing of the civil claim in the criminal proceedings the applicant could still bring a tort action against the officers or against the body vicariously liable for their actions. However, the Court, in line with its consistent caselaw, considers that, having used up the possibilities available to him within the criminal justice system, the applicant was not required to embark on another attempt to obtain redress by issuing separate civil proceedings (see Assenov and Others, cited above, p. 3286, \u00a7 86).",

If the authorities could confine their reaction to such incidents solely to the payment of compensation, while not doing enough to identify and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity. Thus the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Krastanov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 50222/99, \u00a7 60, 30 September 2004, with further references).",

The officers had exhibited no positive intention of injuring or humiliating the applicant. Immediately after the incident they had escorted the applicant to a hospital and then to his home.

As the applicant's injuries had not been caused by the use of excessive force and as he had resisted arrest, it was incumbent on him to prove the causal link between the use of force and the subsequent kidney problems.

Even in the most difficult of circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism or crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols Nos. 1 and 4, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 of the Convention even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see, among many other authorities, Assenov and Others, cited above, p.\u00a03288, \u00a7 93). To fall within the scope of Article 3 ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Further, in determining whether a particular form of ill-treatment should be qualified as torture, consideration must be given to the distinction, embodied in Article 3, between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment. As noted in previous cases, it appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see, among many other authorities, \u0130lhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 84 and 85).",

Moreover, they had lasting consequences for his health (see paragraphs 8, 11 and 1418 above). It is also clear that the acts of violence against the applicant were committed by the police officers in the performance of their duties. They took place during the applicant's arrest (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). The exact circumstances of the arrest and intensity of the force used against the applicant were disputed by the parties and were subject to conflicting evaluations by the national courts. While the first and the secondinstance courts were of the view that the violence against the applicant had been wrongful and had exceeded what was necessary to effect his arrest, and accordingly found the police officers guilty (see paragraphs 34, 36 and 39 above), the Supreme Court of Cassation held that the use of force had been fully warranted and reversed the conviction (see paragraph 42 above). However, the acquittal of the officers by a national court bound by the presumption of innocence and by the manner in which domestic law regulates the use of force by the police does not absolve Bulgaria from its responsibility under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, p. 26, \u00a7 34). The Court must scrutinise the alleged breach of Article 3 with heightened vigilance, because this provision prohibits inhuman treatment in absolute terms, irrespective of the victim's conduct (ibid., p. 24, \u00a7 32). Bearing in mind the nature and the extent of the applicant's numerous and serious injuries, the circumstances surrounding his arrest (including the fact that the officers, who were merely trainees, were not accompanied by a supervisor \u2013 see paragraph 8 in limine), and the fact that at the material time the applicant was only fourteen years old and clearly inferior to the officers in terms of physical strength, and analysing these facts in the light of its jurisprudence in this domain (see paragraph 63 above), the Court concludes that the force used against the applicant was clearly excessive, both in intensity and duration.",

In the case of an arguable allegation of a breach of Article 3, Article 13 calls for an effective mechanism for establishing the liability of State officials or bodies for acts or omissions involving a breach of the victims' rights under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2001V; and Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2002II). In particular, if the allegations concern torture or serious illtreatment by State agents, this mechanism must consist, at a minimum, of a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see, among many other authorities, \u0130lhan, cited above, \u00a7 97). This investigation must be based on a standard comparable to the one used by the Court in assessing complaints under Article 3 (see Tzekov v.

The national authorities, while bound by the presumption of innocence and by the terms in which domestic law is couched (see Ribitsch, cited above, p. 26, \u00a7 34), must nevertheless review the acts alleged to amount to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention in the light of the principles which lie at the heart of the Court's analysis of complaints under this provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, pp. 4748, \u00a7\u00a0121; Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30\u00a0October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 39, \u00a7 123; and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 138, ECHR 1999VI).",

It is not for the Court to determine whether this construction was correct, as it is for the national courts to interpret domestic law.

The courts below it had clearly established that the applicant had suffered numerous injuries and that these were the result of excessive force (see paragraphs 34, 36 and 39 above). Without subjecting these findings to doubt, the Supreme Court of Cassation gave them a different legal qualification, holding that the officers had lawfully assaulted the applicant, as he had tried to escape and had been \u2013 albeit wrongfully \u2013 identified as the person wanted by the police. In so doing, that court treated as irrelevant a number of other factors \u2013 that at the time of the events the applicant was fourteen years old, that the violence against him had continued after he had been subdued, and that the beating had been wilful \u2013, all of which were material for determining whether the act complained of amounted to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.
