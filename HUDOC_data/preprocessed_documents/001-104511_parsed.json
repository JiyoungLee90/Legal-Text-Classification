Its scope is more extensive and requires that no representative of the State or a public authority should declare a person guilty of an offence before their guilt has been established by a \u201ccourt\u201d (see Moullet v.

Indeed, the wording of Law no. 4616 is unequivocal, in that it requires criminal courts to suspend criminal proceedings in respect of certain offences without reaching a definitive conclusion as to the defendant's guilt. The Court's foregoing considerations are further supported by the fact that, according to the document submitted to the Court by the applicant, she has no criminal record.
