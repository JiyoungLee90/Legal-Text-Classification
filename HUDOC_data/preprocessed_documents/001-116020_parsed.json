In particular, the psychiatric examination report prepared in 2000 concluded that the applicant was incapable of understanding the meaning of his actions and unable to control them. The incapacitation decision had thus been taken in order to protect the interests of other people, as well as his own interests.

The Court recalls that in such cases the individual concerned is not only an interested party but also the main object of the court\u2019s examination (see X. and Y., cited above, \u00a7 83, with further references; see also mutatis mutandis, Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 74).

In the present case, however, the District Court merely stated that the applicant\u2019s personal presence would be \u201cprejudicial to his health\u201d, and there is no evidence that the court ever sought a doctor\u2019s opinion on that particular question, namely what effect appearing in court might have had on the applicant. The Court is not aware of any other obstacles to the applicant\u2019s personal appearance in court.

The Government did not refer to any such norm either. The fact that there is a State-run system of forensic institutions (see the domestic court\u2019s reasoning in paragraph 16 above) does not mean that they have a monopoly on providing expert opinions to the courts. On the contrary, Russian law at the time explicitly permitted examinations by experts not belonging to the State forensic institutions (see paragraph 61 above).

A similar requirement follows from Article 12 (4) of the CPRD (see paragraph 66 above). In Stanev, cited above, the Court observed that \u201cthere is now a trend at European level towards granting legally incapacitated persons direct access to the courts to seek restoration of their capacity\u201d (\u00a7 243). In Russia at the time the law neither provided for an automatic review nor for a direct access to the court for an incapacitated person, so the latter was fully dependant on his guardian in this respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Salontaji-Drobnjak v. Serbia, no.\u00a036500/05, \u00a7\u00a0134, 13\u00a0October 2009). Where, as in the present case, the guardian opposed the review of the status of his ward, the latter had no effective legal remedy to challenge the status.

Secondly, the Court\u2019s case-law under Article 5 requires that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see Creang\u0103 v.

Thus, the hospital has forty-eight hours to examine the patient (Section 32 (1) of the Act), and then twenty-four hours to submit a hospitalisation request to a competent judicial authority (Section 32 (2) of the Act), which, in turn, has five days to decide on that request (Section 34 (1) of the Act).",

Although it is sometimes difficult to discern the genuine will of a mentally ill person (see, for example, Storck v. , no. 61603/00, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2005V), the Court is confident that in the present case the applicant did not agree to the hospitalisation. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that his confinement was originally regarded as non-voluntary by all the parties involved. Despite that, from 20\u00a0December 2002 it became possible to keep him confined without a court order. As a result, the applicant was unable to enjoy the safeguards associated with the judicial process.

However, those reports mostly referred to the history of the applicant\u2019s illness and did not mention recent instances of aggressive or self-destructive behaviour.

In other words, the applicant was unable to marry primarily because of the same two major factors analysed under Article 8, namely the deficiencies in the domestic decision-making process and the rigidity of the Russian law on incapacity. In view of its findings under Article 8 of the Convention, the Court considers that there is no need for a separate examination under Article 12 of the Convention.",
