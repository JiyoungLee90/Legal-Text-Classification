The case originated in an application (no. 32668/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Croatian nationals, Mrs Biserka Uljar, Mr Ratomir Brnabić, Mrs Lolita Dabelić and Mrs Eleonora Tijanić (“the applicants”), on 17 July 2002.
The applicants were all represented by Mrs B. Uljar. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 5 July 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the remainder of the application at the same time.
The applicants were born in 1951, 1947, 1970 and 1971 respectively and live in .
The applicants are heirs of the late A.B. who died on 14 December 1995. The first and the second applicant are his children, and the third and the fourth applicants are his grandchildren (children of his other daughter).
In the context of inheritance proceedings following A.B.'s death, on 16 August 1996 his former wife, M.K., brought a civil action against the applicants in the Krk Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Krku). M.K. sought her share in co-ownership of a house on the account of certain investments she had made while living in common law marriage (izvanbračna zajednica) with the deceased.
In the period between the entry into force of the Convention in respect of  and the rendering of the first-instance judgment, the Krk Municipal Court held nine hearings.
At the hearing held on 17 March 1998 the applicants moved for evidence to be taken in order to prove that A.B. had not lived in a common law marriage with the plaintiff and that he had reconstructed his house independently with his own means. On 22 April and 3 August 1998 the court heard two and six witnesses respectively.
The Krk Municipal Court then requested certain witnesses to be heard before other courts. In reply, it received minutes of the witness testimonies from the Zadar Municipal Court and the Split Municipal Court.
On 11 August 1999 the applicants filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that there had been no common law marriage between the plaintiff and the late A.B.
The next hearing was held on 12 August 1999 at which the court heard nine witnesses.
At the next hearing held on 25 April 2000 the court heard the second and the third applicant and adjourned the hearing for 10 August 2000, when the first applicant again sought for a number of witnesses to be heard.
At the next hearings held on 5 June and 13 August 2001 the court heard yet more witnesses and on 3 December 2001 it closed the main hearing.
On 3 December 2001 the court gave judgment dismissing both M.K.'s action and the applicants' counterclaim. On appeal, on 1 October 2003 the  (Županijski sud u Rijeci) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case finding that it was necessary to establish the plaintiff's citizenship.
In 2003 the first and the second applicant filed a constitutional complaint concerning the length of the proceedings. On 16 January 2004 the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared their complaint inadmissible because the County Court had in the meantime, on 1 October 2003, quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case.
In the resumed proceedings, on 4 November 2003 the President of the Krk Municipal Court accepted the applicants' request for withdrawal of the first-instance judge and assigned another judge to hear the case.
The court held hearings on 12 February 2004 and 17 June 2004.
On 26 October 2004 the court adopted a decision declaring the plaintiff's action inadmissible, because as a foreign national, she had not obtained the necessary permissions for acquisition of property in line with the domestic legislation. At the same time, the Krk Municipal Court concluded that the applicants' counterclaim had been withdrawn. M.K. appealed against that decision but on 9 March 2006 the  dismissed her appeal.
The relevant part of section 63 of the Constitutional Act on the  (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette no. 49/2002, of 3 May 2002; “the Constitutional Court Act”) reads as follows:
