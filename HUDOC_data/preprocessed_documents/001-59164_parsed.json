In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s appeal against the first consolidation scheme of May 1979 was successful. It is true that his appeal against the occupation and valuation schedule of April 1983, which was finally dismissed by the Administrative Court in May 1985, contributed to a certain extent to the length of the proceedings. Moreover, the lodging of an appeal against the notification of the second consolidation scheme of May 1991, which was finally dismissed by the Administrative Court in October 1995, is somewhat difficult to understand and may also have delayed the termination of the proceedings.

The Court agrees with the Government that the two cases are not fully comparable, as the proceedings in the Wiesinger case were marked by a special feature which is absent in the present case, namely that the applicant\u2019s former plots of land were re-designated as building land after the provisional transfer (ibid., p. 23, \u00a7 62), occasioning a considerable change in value for which he had not received final compensation at the time of the Court\u2019s judgment. However, in the present case the applicant received parcels of approximately equal value and financial compensation for the remaining difference. Nevertheless, the proceedings in the present application lasted more than twice as long as the proceedings in the Wiesinger case. In conclusion, the Court, having regard to the sums usually awarded in civil length of proceedings cases and making an assessment on an equitable basis, grants the applicant ATS 200,000 for non-pecuniary damage.",
