A trial then took place before two instances; it lasted until December 2006. In line with the jurisprudence set out above, the Court takes those proceedings into account and finds that it has jurisdiction to deal with this complaint in so far as it concerns procedural acts or omissions occurring after ratification (see, among many other authorities, \u0160ilih v.

Whatever the method of investigation, the authorities must act as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. Even when strictly speaking no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that ill-treatment has been used. The authorities must take into account the particularly vulnerable situation of victims and the fact that people who have been subjected to serious ill-treatment will often be less ready or willing to make a complaint (see Bat\u0131 and Others v. Turkey, nos. 33097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7 133, ECHR 2004IV, and the authorities cited therein).",

The investigation must also be thorough: the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. Furthermore, the investigation must be prompt and independent. The investigation lacks independence where members of the same unit as those implicated in the alleged ill-treatment undertook the investigation (Mikheyev v. , no. 77617/01, \u00a7\u00a7 108-110, 26 January 2006). Lastly, the investigation must afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny to secure accountability. While the degree of public scrutiny required may vary, the complainant must be afforded effective access to the investigatory procedure in all cases (Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 137).",

It is true that the applicant\u2019s injuries were not very serious (see Ilieva and Georgieva v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 9548/07, 17 April 2012, in which the Court held that comparable injuries inflicted upon the applicants by private individuals were not capable of triggering the State\u2019s procedural obligation to conduct an official investigation). However, the threshold is lower in the case of an arguable claim that injuries have been inflicted upon a detained person by State officials: the Court has held that, in respect of a person deprived of his liberty, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 336; Rivas v. , no. 59584/00, \u00a7 37, 1 April 2004; and Toteva v. , no. 42027/98, \u00a7 55, 19 May 2004).

However, those statements were taken by the unit which had been involved in the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant and which therefore lacked independence (see, by analogy, Ramsahai and Others v. the  [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7\u00a0335, ECHR 2007II, concerning the obligation to investigate under Article 2; Bursuc v. , no. 42066/98, \u00a7 104, 12 October 2004, concerning the obligation to investigate under Article 3; and the CPT standards, document no. CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 - Rev. 2011, p. 97). Furthermore, while it is true that the applicant, the defendants, four other police officers and a medical expert were later heard by the investigating judge, no questions were put to them. There are therefore no indications that the investigating judge was prepared to scrutinise the police\u2019s account of the incident (see Matko v. , no. 43393/98, \u00a7 90, 2 November 2006). It is nevertheless the case that the Court is only competent ratione temporis to look at the period after the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Serbia on 3\u00a0March 2004, while taking into consideration the state of the case at that date (compare Pali\u0107 v. , no. 4704/04, \u00a7 70, 15\u00a0February 2011).",

The Court is satisfied with the diligence displayed by the trial court in trying to establish whether the applicant had sustained his injuries during his fight with M.M., as claimed by the defendants, or at the police station, as claimed by the applicant (see Berli\u0144ski v. , nos. 27715/95 and 30209/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a068-71, 20 June 2002).
