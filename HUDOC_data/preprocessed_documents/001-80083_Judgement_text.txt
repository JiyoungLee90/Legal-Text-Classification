The case originated in an application (no. 10816/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Piotr Kozimor (“the applicant”), on 22 December 2000.
The Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 6 September 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the applicant's pre-trial detention, lack of equality of arms in the proceedings for prolonging his pre-trial detention and the censorship of his correspondence to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
On 23 September 2005 the applicant's sister, Mrs Renata Kozimor, informed the Court's Registry that the applicant had died on 12 August 2005. She stated that she wished to continue the proceedings before the Court in her late brother's stead.
The applicant was born in 1971 and lived in .
On 14 August 1997 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 15 August 1997 the Przemyśl District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed a homicide.
Subsequently, the applicant's pre-trial detention was prolonged on several occasions, in particular at the hearing held on 5 November 1998.
On 21 December 1998 the  (Sąd Wojewódzki) convicted the applicant of homicide and sentenced him to 25 years' imprisonment.
On 29 April 1999 the Court of Appeal quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case.
On 2 June 1999 the  (Sąd Okręgowy) decided to prolong the applicant's pre-trial detention. The court gave the following reasons:
“Prolongation of the applicant's detention on remand is justified by the fact that the applicant has been accused of homicide.”
On 24 February 2000 the  dismissed the applicant's request for release. The reasons of the decision are as follows:
“[The applicant] has been accused of having committed [a homicide] and the original reasons for keeping him in detention are still valid.”
On 3 March 2000 the  further prolonged the applicant's pre-trial detention. The court found that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary because he had been charged with homicide and the trial court had started the process of obtaining expert evidence.
On 12 April 2000 the trial court held the first hearing. Subsequently, ten hearings were held.
On 2 June and 29 August 2000 the applicant's pre-trial detention was prolonged as the courts considered that the necessity to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings and the severity of the anticipated penalty justified keeping him in custody.
On 14 September 2000 the Rzeszów Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal against the decision of 29 August 2000.
The applicant submits that neither he nor his lawyer was informed about the majority of scheduled court sessions at which his detention on remand was prolonged and that he was not allowed to attend any of these sessions.
On 28 December 2000 the  gave judgment. The court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to 25 years' imprisonment. The applicant appealed.
On 17 May 2001 the Rzeszów Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) amended the impugned judgment. The court sentenced the applicant to 15 years' imprisonment. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).
On 28 February 2002 the Supreme Court dismissed his cassation appeal as being manifestly ill-founded.
On 28 February 2001 the Court's Registry sent to the applicant, who at that time had been detained on remand in the Przemyśl Detention Centre, an application form and accompanying documents in reply to his letter in which he had notified his intention to lodge a complaint with the Court.

The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines detention on remand as one of the socalled “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze). Article 249 § 5 provides that the lawyer of a detained person should be informed of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision is to be taken concerning prolongation of detention on remand.
