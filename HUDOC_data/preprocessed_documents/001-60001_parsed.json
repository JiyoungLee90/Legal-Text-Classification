According to the applicants, there was no doubt that Mrs Gretel Janssen acted like an employee when she cleaned her husband\u2019s work clothes. Consequently she was covered by the employer\u2019s insurance. There was clearly a causal link between the exposure to asbestos and Mrs Gretel Janssen\u2019s disease. Moreover, the amount of the compensation to be awarded was determined by law. The case was thus not very complex. Had the Duisburg Social Court fixed promptly a date for a hearing, compensation could have easily been granted to Mrs Gretel Janssen in 1986 when she was still alive. In 1987 the Federal Social Court, however, had developed an erroneous case\u2013law on which the Social Court had based its judgment in 1989. ",
