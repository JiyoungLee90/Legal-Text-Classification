The principle of equality of arms requires that each party should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case under conditions that do not place him or her at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his or her opponent (see Avoti\u0146\u0161 v.

Each party must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed or evidence adduced by the other party, including the other party\u2019s appeal.
