However, the crucial difference between the situation in the present application and the situations in the applications referred to in the preceding paragraphs is that the applicants in the present application claim that for a long period after the attack on their villages they were unable to complain about the events to the national authorities. In other words, unlike the applicants in the aforementioned cases, the applicants in the present case do not claim that they introduced their application with the Court pending the initial investigation because they found the latter ineffective (see Meryem \u00c7elik and Others v.

After that period of inactivity they went on to make official complaints to the authorities in 2004, and a number of steps were taken by the prosecutors. As a result of those steps two prosecutors concluded that the applicants\u2019 villages had been bombed by aircraft as alleged by them (see paragraphs 43 and 53 above). Indeed, as can be seen from the steps taken by the national authorities summarised above, more numerous and more meaningful steps were taken in the investigation at the domestic level after the introduction of the complaints by the applicants in 2004 than had been taken before then.",

The Court thus finds it reasonable that, having failed to have their allegations investigated properly, and having been hindered by the military authorities in their attempts to seek justice, the applicants must have lost all hope and realised that the domestic remedies would not yield any results, and introduced their application (see, mutatis mutandis, Mladenovi\u0107 v.

The Court fully endorses that rationale, but notes that in the exceptional circumstances of the present application, it was the official complaints made by the applicants in 2004 which prompted the national authorities to begin establishing the facts surrounding the attacks on the applicants\u2019 villages. Since, as noted above, according to the domestic legislation, the investigation file would be open for a period of twenty years (see paragraph 40), the complaints made by the applicants were not rejected because of any failure to comply with the domestic statutory time-limits.",

In such a situation it must be recognised that there may be obstacles to the proper functioning of the system of the administration of justice. In particular, the difficulties in securing probative evidence for the purposes of domestic legal proceedings, inherent in such a troubled situation, may make the pursuit of judicial remedies futile and the administrative inquiries on which such remedies depend may be prevented from taking place (ibid. \u00a7\u00a070).",

Furthermore, the Court considers it of paramount importance that the applicants complained of a major attack on their villages which had caused dozens of deaths and injuries among the civilian population and which, they maintained, had been carried out by war planes belonging to the Air Force of the respondent State (see, mutatis mutandis, Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 27065/05, \u00a7 179, 2 December 2010).

The Court accepts that, as soon as the applicants considered that the situation in their region had improved after the emergency rule had been lifted and that there was a reasonable chance of the perpetrators of the attacks on their villages being identified and punished, they instructed a lawyer and introduced official complaints with the national authorities. Although, initially, there were a number of positive developments in the investigation and the applicants\u2019 complaints were taken seriously, that investigation quickly lost steam and decisions were taken once again to transfer the investigation file between different prosecutors\u2019 offices. This, coupled with the military investigation authorities\u2019 attempts to withhold their investigation documents from the applicants, led the applicants to form the view that the investigation would not be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible, and they introduced their application with the Court within six-months of the military prosecutor\u2019s decision to close his investigation. Indeed, the pertinent arguments advanced by the applicants in their petition to challenge the military prosecutor\u2019s decision were not taken into account by the military court and, three days after they introduced their application with the Court, the military court rejected the objection lodged by the applicants against the military prosecutor\u2019s decision (see paragraph\u00a061 above).",

The first one is the information provided to the military prosecutor by the Air Force that no flying activity had taken place over the applicants\u2019 villages (see paragraph 55 above). The second ground is the applicants\u2019 inability to identify the type and make of the airplanes which bombed their villages (see paragraph 52 above). Although the military prosecutor\u2019s investigation will be examined below when the effectiveness or otherwise of the investigation into the applicants\u2019 allegations is assessed (see paragraphs 186-198 below), the Court deems it important to comment already at this stage on these two grounds relied on by that prosecutor when he closed his investigation.",

As for the second ground, the Court, like the applicants (see paragraph 59 above), also considers that it clearly lacks any logic as it assumes that either foreign military aircraft had entered Turkish airspace, bombed the two villages, and then left without being detected, or that there existed a civilian aircraft capable of dropping large bombs, causing such large-scale destruction and flying undetected. Moreover, it does not appear to have occurred to the military prosecutor that villagers with no specialist knowledge of military aviation would naturally be unable to identify the type or make of fighter jets which flew over their villages at speeds of hundreds of miles per hour.",
