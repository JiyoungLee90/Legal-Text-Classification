Switzerland, 19\u00a0February 1996, \u00a7 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I, and Pejcinoski v.\u00a0Austria (dec.), no. 33500/96, 23 March 1999). In their view, it was primarily the applicant\u2019s duty, and not that of the Russian authorities, to take care of his family and ensure that they lived together. To that end he had to comply with the relevant laws and regulations so as to obtain in due time the authorisation required for his stay in Russia. Yet, despite the numerous breaches of the immigration regulations committed by the applicant, the authorities had for a long time refrained from ordering his administrative removal. The decision on the applicant\u2019s administrative removal was taken after he had been found guilty of an administrative offence on account of a breach of immigration laws for the fifth time. Therefore, the applicant must have realised that his failure to rectify his conduct would result in his removal. Furthermore, the applicant had been found guilty of an administrative offence on account of a breach of traffic rules sixteen times during his stay in Russia. Therefore it was only after the applicant had demonstrated particular defiance of the Russian law and order that such measure was taken. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s removal was proportionate and \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d as required by Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",

The applicant also submitted that, although while living in Russia he had not been officially employed, he had been helping his wife with their family enterprise Geo-Agro.

The applicant maintained that he was a good citizen, who had two university degrees, respected public order, had made all the efforts to duly regularise his stay in Russia and had only failed because of difficulties with obtaining certain documents from Georgia, which had been complicated by the rupture of diplomatic relations between Russia and Georgia in 2008. The applicant further submitted that, having lived in Russia for fifteen years and thus being a long-term immigrant, he had lost any ties with Georgia and after his deportation had to live in Belarus. In 2012 he obtained citizenship of Armenia, which constituted further evidence of the absence of any ties with Georgia.

It further notes that, when in the course of the police identity check on 24 October 2011 the applicant failed to present any documents authorising his stay in Russia, he explained that, believing that he could enter Russia from Belarus without a visa, he came to Russia for certain business matters and was going to leave once they were solved. The applicant did not mention his family as the reason for his coming to Russia. Nor was his family referred to in the proceedings before the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Penza which found him guilty of the breach of immigration regulations on the same date. The applicant mentioned his family in Russia for the first time only in the appeal proceedings before the Penza Regional Court. This leads the Court to give weight to the Government\u2019s doubts as to whether the applicant still maintains strong ties with his family in Russia.",

Russian being one of the two official languages in Belarus, the Court sees no insurmountable obstacles for the applicant\u2019s family to join him in the country of his choice.",

In particular, after he had failed to apply for the renewal of his residence permit in 2004 and had been found guilty of an administrative offence on this account in April 2006, a new residence permit was issued to him in August 2006, despite his request for renewal being two years overdue (see paragraph 18 above). After the applicant again failed to apply in time for the renewal of his residence permit in 2009, this time the renewal was refused. Nevertheless, although the applicant was ordered to leave Russia upon the expiry of his valid residence permit, the immigration authorities specifically stated that he could re-enter Russia after having complied with the immigration regulations (see paragraph 25 above). However, the applicant chose to disregard the order and to remain illegally in Russia. When the authorities eventually became aware of this and on 3\u00a0March 2011 found him guilty of an administrative offence for his failure to leave Russia after the expiry of his residence permit, they did not order his administrative removal, which would entail a five-year ban on re-entry, but provided him with a transit visa so that he could leave Russia legally (see paragraph 32 above).",

In this regard the Court dismisses as implausible the applicant\u2019s allegations that on the Belarussian-Russian border he was misled by the passport control officers who told to him that, having entered Russia from Belarus, he could stay in Russia without a visa for several weeks (see paragraphs 37 and 65 above). The applicant could not have been unaware that Georgian nationals needed a visa to enter Russia. Furthermore, having been ordered to leave Russia on account of a breach of immigration rules, he also must have realised that he would need a specific authorisation to re-enter. The applicant thus knowingly acted in breach of the immigration rules and procedures. Therefore, it was only when he was for the fifth time found guilty of an administrative offence, and this time of a particularly serious nature as it concerned illegal entry to the country, that on 24 October 2011 the Russian authorities ordered his administrative removal.",
