The difference in material conditions of detention creates the presumption that an applicant\u2019s transfer to a different type of facility would require the submission of a separate complaint about the conditions of detention in the previous facility within six months of such a transfer (see Fetisov and Others v. , nos. 43710/07, 6023/08, 11248/08, 27668/08, 31242/08 and 52133/08, \u00a7\u00a076, 17 January 2012).",

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7 67, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85, 26 July 2001). The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions ordering extensions of detention or dismissing applications for release. It is not the Court\u2019s task to establish such facts and take the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic courts\u2019 decisions and of the matters of fact mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Korchuganova v. Russia, no. 75039/01, \u00a7\u00a072, 8\u00a0June 2006; Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7 86; and Labita, cited above, \u00a7 152).",

France, 17\u00a0March 1997, \u00a7\u00a044, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II). The Court notes in this respect that at no time did the domestic court, when extending the applicant\u2019s detention, mention the nature or the number of the applicant\u2019s prior offences. In such circumstances, the Court cannot accept that the national courts could have reasonably feared that the applicant would commit new offences, if released (see, by contrast, Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12 December 1991, \u00a7\u00a070, Series A no. 224).",

The Court notes that the domestic authorities considered that the applicant might abscond due to his lack of employment and/or absence for the registered place of residence. The Court might accept the grounds cited by the authorities as relevant. However, it cannot find them decisive given that the judicial decisions authorising the applicant\u2019s continued detention remained silent as to why such risk of absconding could not have been offset by any other means of ensuring his appearance at trial.",
