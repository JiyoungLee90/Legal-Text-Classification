In the court\u2019s view, the burden of proof to show that had there been a timely auction the share could have successfully been sold to a buyer with the requisite liquidity lay with the applicant. However, the applicant could not prove this assertion. The court observed that the buyer suggested by the applicant had never had, according to its books, the capital needed for the acquisition; that the company in which the share belonged had lost all its own capital by early 1997 and been in liquidation as of July 1997; and that its manager had been convicted of fraudulent bankruptcy.",

Moreover, had the sale of the frozen share been authorised or its auction executed by the Tax Authority as was required by the law, the applicant could have recovered its value which had however been entirely lost due to the Tax Authority\u2019s unlawful omission.

It comprises three distinct rules. The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties. However, the three rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH v. the , 23 February 1995, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 306B). Those forms of interference must comply with the principle of lawfulness and pursue a legitimate aim by means reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (B\u00e4ck v. Finland, no. 37598/97, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2004VIII).",

It is satisfied that the measure thus aimed at securing the payment of taxes, for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 1 (see Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik, cited above, \u00a7 66 in fine). However, such an interference will mean a violation of that Article unless it is lawful and reasonably proportionate to the aim sought. The Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether or not the measure was proportionate in quantitative terms, because in any event it constituted a violation of the principle of lawfulness for the following reasons. The Court observes the Court of Appeal\u2019s position that the Tax Authority had been under a statutory obligation to hold an auction in order to sell the attached asset within two months from its attachment (see paragraph 9 above). For the Court, this obligation formed an integral part of the lawfulness of the interference in question, equally serving the interests of debtor and creditor. However, according to the findings of the domestic courts, the sale required under the law never took place, and this amounted to an unlawful omission on the part of the State, for which the latter\u2019s tort liability was not established only because the damage sustained could not be proven (see also paragraph 24 below). It follows that the continued seizure after that period cannot be considered lawful.",

The Court of Appeal could not be said to have violated the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing since it had had good reasons for ordering the applicant to prove the amount of the purchase price which it could have obtained for the share had it been sold within or outside the enforcement procedure. It was doubtful whether under Hungarian market circumstances a business share purchased for HUF 32 million in 1993 could have been sold at a price three times higher when no meantime investment or equity raise had been put in place. It could be presumed that even if the share had not been attached in the tax procedure, no potential buyer would have been willing to pay over HUF 103 million at a time when the financial situation of the company in which the share had belonged had significantly worsened. Therefore it could not be argued that the loss of the value of the share in question had been a direct consequence of tax enforcement.",

It agrees with the Government in that generally it is not unfair to require a party to civil litigation to prove a fact which that party wishes to rely on. However, in the Court\u2019s view, in the instant case the mechanical application of this principle led to the non-respect of \u201cequality of arms\u201d, inherent in the notion of fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. In the Court\u2019s view, it was precisely the respondent Tax Authority\u2019s own unlawful omission to hold an auction (see paragraphs 9 and 17 above) that prevented the applicant from ascertaining and proving the value of the attached share. The Court cannot speculate about the actual market value of the share at issue or the chances of selling it to a solvent buyer in the face of the financial difficulties experienced by the company in which it belonged. It is satisfied with observing that due to an unlawful omission on the part of the respondent authority the applicant was demanded to prove a hypothetical fact. For the Court, the frustration of the applicant\u2019s claims in this manner cannot, as a matter of fair trial, be endorsed. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
