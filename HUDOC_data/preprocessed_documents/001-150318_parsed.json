For such a procedural obligation to come into effect, a significant proportion of the investigating steps required by this provision will have been or ought to have been taken after the critical date (see Janowiec and Others, \u00a7 142). The Court has also applied this principle to cases concerning deaths at the hands of private individuals (see Lyubov Efimenko v.

However, it took the national authorities another fifteen years after the ratification of the Convention to conduct the trial, in which the hearings had not even begun until the entry into force of the Convention. A significant proportion of the proceedings covering a lengthy period of time therefore took place after the critical date. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s complaints about the State\u2019s failure to conduct an effective and prompt trial pertain to a large extent to this period. In view of this, the Court finds that the alleged procedural violation of Article 3 falls within its temporal jurisdiction and that it is therefore competent to examine this part of the application in so far as they occurred after 28 June 1994.",

This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, such as by taking witness statements and gathering forensic evidence, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see Denis Vasilyev v. Russia, no.\u00a032704/04, \u00a7 100, 17 December 2009, with further references). The promptness of the authorities\u2019 reaction to the complaints is an important factor (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). Consideration has been given in the Court\u2019s judgments to matters such as the time taken to open investigations, delays in identifying witnesses or taking statements (see M\u0103t\u0103saru and Savi\u0163chi v. Moldova, nos.\u00a038281/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 and 93, 2 November 2010), the length of time taken for the initial investigation (see Indelicato v. Italy, no. 31143/96, \u00a7 37, 18\u00a0October 2001), and unjustified protraction of the criminal proceedings resulting in the expiry of the statute of limitations (see Angelova and Iliev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a055523/00, \u00a7\u00a7 101-103, 26 July 2007, and P.M. v.

In this respect, the Court has already held that the protection mechanisms available under domestic law should operate in practice in a manner allowing for the examination of the merits of a particular case within a reasonable time (see Ebcin v. Turkey, no.\u00a019506/05, \u00a7 40, 1 February 2011, with further references).",

It is noted that the applicant\u2019s complaint was focused on the trial stage of the criminal proceedings concerning the rape committed against her in November 1983. The charges against the three defendants were brought in 1984, ten years before the Convention became operational for Slovenia, however the main hearing did not commence until 18 November 1996 (see paragraph 14 above), a year after the case against N.T. \u2013 who had apparently left Slovenia years before and could not be traced \u2013 was severed from that of the other two defendants (see paragraph 12 above). Following T.D.\u2019s death in 2003, A.M. was convicted of aggravated rape on 3 November 2004 (see paragraph 17 above). The judgment having been quashed on appeal, he was again convicted on retrial (see paragraph 19 above). His subsequent appeal was allowed with regard to the sentence only, and the higher court\u2019s judgment was eventually confirmed by the Supreme Court on 3 September 2009 (see paragraph 21 above).",

Admittedly, the absence of an accused may entail the adjournment of a hearing and therefore some delay in the conduct of the trial. However, the Court has already held that considerable delays in the conduct of criminal proceedings may adversely affect their effectiveness to the detriment of both the defendants and victims, regardless of their outcome (see Ebcin, cited above, \u00a7 56). In this regard, adjournments and intervals of total inactivity between hearings appear to have been turned into a \u201cmodus operandi\u201d for dealing with the applicant\u2019s case. While it is true that considerable difficulties were encountered by the district court in attempting to secure the defendants\u2019 presence, only a very few measures were envisaged beyond conducting inquiries into the defendants\u2019 places of residence, and even those steps taken did not prove effective. The proposal to place T.D. in detention pending trial for failing to appear at court was rejected, while an international arrest warrant was only issued in respect of N.T. in 2004 (paragraph 14 above), although he had not resided in Slovenia already at the time of the incident and could not be located since 1989. The authorities\u2019 inaction therefore led to delays which can only be described as manifestly excessive; moreover, little interest was shown in finding N.T. and bringing him to justice.",
