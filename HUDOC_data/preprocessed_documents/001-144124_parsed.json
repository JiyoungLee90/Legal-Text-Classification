He complained that, although the introductory part of the detention order stated that the court had reviewed preliminary evidence collected by the prosecution, no evidence or any other information giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence had been presented by the prosecution to the first-instance court. The court had issued the order solely on the basis of the decision to charge the applicant with the criminal offences and the prosecution\u2019s request to order his remand in custody, without independently verifying whether there was a reasonable suspicion against him. He further complained that the court had not provided relevant and sufficient reasons to justify his detention by finding that he might abscond from the investigation or attempt to obstruct the proceedings. As for his conduct prior to arrest, he had been cooperative with the authorities and, on more than one occasion, had appeared for questioning after a simple phone call, even without having been formally summoned. Other factors, such as the fact that he had a wife and a small child, a permanent residence and a job in Baku, his personality, social status and professional occupation, his affiliation with the Council of Europe\u2019s programmes, no prior criminal record, and so on, also showed that he was very unlikely to abscond and should have been taken into account by the court.

Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or discontinuing suspicions which provide the grounds for detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300A).",

What also needs to be considered is that the applicant was charged with \u201corganising\u201d a riot that had already started in Ismayilli one day before his visit to the town and that had initially been sparked, in a spontaneous manner, by an incident of local significance.

The presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of a fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph 1 (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 35). It not only prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person charged with a criminal offence is guilty before he has been so proved according to the law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 62), but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations, which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 41, and Daktaras v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43, ECHR 2000X). The Court stresses that Article 6 \u00a7 2 cannot prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal investigations in progress, but it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7 94, 23 October 2008, with further references) . Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Butkevi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s submission that the purpose of the impugned statement was to inform the public about the steps taken by the authorities in connection with the Ismayilli events, and in particular their intention to investigate the applicant\u2019s involvement in the events. Given that the applicant was a politician, the authorities might have considered it necessary to keep the public informed of the criminal accusations against him. However, the Court considers that the statement, assessed as a whole, was not made with necessary discretion and circumspection. Whereas in the end of the relevant paragraph the authorities noted that the applicant\u2019s actions would be \u201cfully and thoroughly investigated and [would] receive legal assessment\u201d, this wording was negated by a preceding unequivocal declaration, contained in the same sentence, that those actions by the applicant had been \u201cillegal\u201d. Moreover, by stating in the same paragraph that \u201cit has been established that ... [the applicant] ... made appeals to local residents ..., such as calls to resist the police, not to obey officials and to block roads\u201d, the authorities essentially prejudged the assessment of the facts by the courts.

However, an applicant alleging that his rights and freedoms were limited for an improper reason must convincingly show that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed or which could be reasonably inferred from the context. A mere suspicion that the authorities used their powers for some other purpose than those defined in the Convention is not sufficient to prove that Article 18 was breached (see Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, \u00a7 255, 31 May 2011).",

As a consequence, there are only a few cases where a breach of that Convention provision has been found. Thus, in Gusinskiy (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78), the Court accepted that the applicant\u2019s liberty had been restricted, inter alia, for a purpose other than those mentioned in Article 5. It based its findings on an agreement signed between the detainee and a federal Minister for the Press, from which it was clear that the applicant\u2019s detention had been applied in order to make him sell his media company to the State. In Cebotari v. Moldova (no.\u00a035615/06, \u00a7\u00a7 46 et seq., 13 November 2007) the Court found a violation of Article 18 of the Convention in a context where the applicant\u2019s arrest was visibly linked to an application pending before the Court. In Lutsenko v. Ukraine (no. 6492/11, \u00a7\u00a7 108-09, 3 July 2012) the prosecuting authorities seeking the applicant\u2019s arrest explicitly indicated the applicant\u2019s communication with the media as one of the grounds for his arrest, such reasoning clearly demonstrating that his arrest was an attempt to punish him for publicly disagreeing with accusations against him. In Tymoshenko v.\u00a0Ukraine (no.\u00a049872/11, \u00a7 299, 30 April 2013) the reasoning formally advanced by the authorities suggested that the actual purpose of the detention was to punish the applicant for a lack of respect towards the court which it was claimed she had been manifesting by her behaviour during the judicial proceedings. Furthermore, both the Lutsenko and Tymoshenko cases were similar in their circumstances in that both applicants who were former high-ranking Government officials and leaders of opposition parties were, soon after the change of power, accused of abuse of power and the authorities\u2019 actions against them were considered by the public to be part of the politically motivated prosecution of opposition leaders in Ukraine. However, in both cases, the Court chose to look at the matter separately from this general context of the allegedly politically motivated prosecution, because in each case it could discern other specific features (described above) which led to a finding of a breach of Article 18 (see Lutsenko, cited above, \u00a7 108, and Tymoshenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 296 and 298-99).",

Thus, the conclusion to be drawn from this finding is that the authorities have not been able to demonstrate that they acted in good faith. However, that conclusion in itself is not sufficient to assume that Article 18 was breached, and it remains to be seen whether there is proof that the authorities\u2019 actions were actually driven by improper reasons.",

In particular, the Court refers to all the material circumstances which it has had regard to in connection with its assessment of the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) (see paragraph 92 above), and considers them equally relevant in the context of the present complaint. Moreover, it considers that the applicant\u2019s arrest was linked to the specific blog entries made by the applicant on 25, 28 and 30 January 2013. The blog post of 28 January 2013, in particular, included sourced information shedding light on the \u201ctrue causes\u201d of the Ismayilli protests, which the Government reportedly attempted to withhold from the public and which was immediately picked up by the press. Following the applicant\u2019s blog entry, the information cited by the applicant was promptly removed from the websites of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Ministry of Taxes (see paragraph 13 above). Even though the prosecution did not make any express references to the applicant\u2019s blog entries, the Court notes that the accusations against him were first made in the authorities\u2019 official press statement of 29 January 2013, immediately after the applicant\u2019s blog post of 28 January 2013, and he was first \u201cinvited\u201d to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office for questioning on the same day. Whereas by that time several days had passed from the applicant\u2019s visit of Ismayilli on 24 January 2013, there is nothing in the case file to show that the prosecution had any objective information giving rise to a bona fide suspicion against the applicant at that time, and it has not been shown that they were in possession of any such information or witness statements at any point up to the moment of the applicant\u2019s arrest on 4 February 2013.",
