Without overlooking the differences between Velikovi and Others (which concerned the application of special legislation on the restitution of nationalised property) and the present case, the Court, as in Velikovi and Others, attaches significant weight to the fact that the first two applicants had acquired the apartment at issue in material breach of substantive provisions of the relevant regulations \u2013 the apartment had largely exceeded in size the limits imposed by law at the relevant time for a family like that of the first two applicants (see paragraphs 7, 8 and 19-23 above).

Independently of the authorities' control, however, in the 1990s that amount lost its value, owing to inflation and the depreciation of the Bulgarian currency. The loss suffered by them was therefore the product of inflation and the depreciation of the Bulgarian currency over the relevant period. The Court will examine below the applicants' claim that the proceedings were excessively lengthy, at a time of rampant inflation (see, Kovacheva and Hadjiilieva\u00a0v. , no. 57641/00, \u00a7\u00a034, 29\u00a0March\u00a02007). However, for the purposes of the applicants' complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the judicial decisions declaring their title null and void, the Court does not consider that inflation and the depreciation of the Bulgarian currency during the 1990s give rise to an issue under that provision. It reiterates that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not impose on States the obligation to maintain low inflation or the purchasing power of the national currency (see Danilyuk v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 5326/02, 19 May 2005).",

In particular, procedural omissions on the part of the Ministry of the Interior, the plaintiff in the proceedings, were at the origin of delays of not less than ten months (see paragraphs 11-13 and 15 above). Also, the judicial authorities were responsible for delays totalling more than two years as a result of defective summons (see paragraphs 14 and 20 above) and periods of inactivity (see paragraph 22 above). While the case had a certain factual complexity, that fact does not justify the delays mentioned above. Also, the Court considers that the applicants were not responsible for any significant delay.",
