The case originated in an application (no. 34630/11) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Dragiša Zajkesković (“the applicant”), on 11 April 2011.
The applicant was represented by Dragana Videnović & Mile Petković, a law firm based in Bor.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, who was subsequently substituted by their current Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 18 December 2014 notice of the application was given to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Bor.
The proceedings began on 30 March 1992 when the applicant brought a lawsuit against third persons concerning the execution of a contract.
On 19 June 1997 the first-instance court accepted the applicant’s claim.
On 30 October 1997 the appeal court quashed the decision on legal costs, remitted that issue to the first-instance court for a retrial and upheld the remainder of the first-instance judgment.
The first-instance court subsequently rendered three decisions on the costs of the proceedings on 23 July 1998, 19 February 1999 and 3 March 2000. All of these decisions were quashed on appeal.
On 5 February 2013 the first-instance court rendered a fourth decision on the issue of legal costs awarding the applicant approximately 2,000 euros (EUR).
According to the information on the file, the proceedings are currently pending before the second-instance court.
On 13 March 2013 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded him EUR 300 for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in this regard. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court ordered the applicant’s proceedings to be expedited.
