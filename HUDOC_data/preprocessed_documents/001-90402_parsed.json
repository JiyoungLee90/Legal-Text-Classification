There is no specific period after which revocation will be appropriate although Annex A to Chapter 13 of the IDIs gives broad guidelines on the length of time deportation orders should remain in force after removal. Cases which will normally be appropriate for revocation 3 years after deportation include those of overstayers and persons who failed to observe a condition attached to their leave, persons who obtained leave by deception, and family members deported under section 3(5)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971. With regard to criminal conviction cases, the normal course of action will be to grant an application for revocation where the decision to deport was founded on a criminal conviction which is now \u201cspent\u201d under section 7(3) of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Paragraph 391 of the Rules, however, indicates that in the case of an applicant with a serious criminal record continued exclusion for a long term of years will normally be the proper course. This is expanded on in Annex A to Chapter 13 of the IDIs, which indicates that revocation would not normally be appropriate until at least 10 years after departure for those convicted of serious offences such as violence against the person, sexual offences, burglary, robbery or theft, and other offences such as forgery and drug trafficking.",

It is clear from the Court\u2019s case-law that children born either to a married couple or to a co-habiting couple are ipso jure part of that family from the moment of birth and that family life exists between the children and their parents (see L. v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a045582/99, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2004IV). Although co-habitation may be a requirement for such a relationship, however, other factors may also serve to demonstrate that a relationship has sufficient constancy to create de facto family ties (Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands, 27\u00a0October 1994, \u00a7\u00a030, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0297C). Such factors include the nature and duration of the parents\u2019 relationship, and in particular whether they had planned to have a child; whether the father subsequently recognised the child as his; contributions made to the child\u2019s care and upbringing; and the quality and regularity of contact (see Kroon, cited above, \u00a730; Keegan v. , 26 May 1994, \u00a7\u00a045, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0290; Haas v. the , no.\u00a036983/97, \u00a7\u00a042 ECHR 2004I and Camp and Bourimi v. the , no.\u00a028369/95, \u00a7\u00a036, ECHR 2000X).",

His mother and two of his brothers live in the , and he has fathered four children, all of whom are British citizens. His children are 25, 24, 18 and 12 years old. He also has a grandchild by his eldest son. In the circumstances, the Court considers that he has strong ties with the . Nevertheless, it cannot overlook the fact that the applicant has never co-habited with any of his children. Three of his children have now reached the age of majority, and although the applicant remains in contact with them, they are in no way dependent upon him. His youngest daughter, with whom the Court has found that he enjoyed family life in the , currently resides with her mother and her mother\u2019s husband. Without underestimating the disruptive effect that the applicant\u2019s deportation has had, and will continue to have, on Naomi\u2019s life, it is unlikely to have had the same impact as it would if the applicant and his daughter had been living together as a family.
