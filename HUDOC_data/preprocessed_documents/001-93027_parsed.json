Each party or coalition could freely assess the facts establishing the existence of such collaboration, and their assessment was not subject to review by the electoral authorities. The purpose of the law was to allow the party or coalition to nominate only candidates of impeccable moral standing.

In a judgment of 21 June 2001 a threemember panel of that court set aside the Central Electoral Commission\u2019s decision and declared the Vratsa Regional Electoral Commission\u2019s decision null and void. It found that not only the parties and coalitions but also the candidates themselves had standing to seek review of the electoral authorities\u2019 decisions to strike them off the lists. It went on to hold that, while section\u00a023(3) of the 2001 Election of Members of Parliament Act expressly provided for judicial review of some of the Central Electoral Commission\u2019s decisions, this did not mean that the decisions not expressly mentioned therein were not subject to such review, in view of the general rule that judicial review of administrative decisions could be limited only by statute, which was not the case here. It further held that the Central Electoral Commission had erred in accepting that these decisions fell within the regional commissions\u2019 discretion. Under section 48(5) of the abovementioned Act, the striking of a candidate off the list had to be predicated on information to the effect that he or she had collaborated with the former State security agencies. In the absence of such information, strikingoff was precluded. The Dossiers Act provided that the only basis for proving collaboration with the former State security agencies was a report from the Dossiers Commission. The certificates issued by the Commission did not constitute such a basis, as already found by the court in its judgment of 13 June 2001 (see paragraph 10 above). The annulment of Mr Petkov\u2019s registration on the basis of such a certificate was therefore null and void.",

In addition, decisions on the results of elections must also not take too long, especially where the political climate is tense. This means both that the timelimits for appeals must be very short and that the appeal body must make its ruling as quickly as possible. Timelimits must, however, be long enough to make an appeal possible, to guarantee the exercise of rights of defence and a reflected decision.

However, it considers for three reasons that these difficulties were largely of the authorities\u2019 own making. First, the electoral statute which made it possible to request the deregistration of candidates on account of their links with the former State security agencies \u2013 apparently a very delicate issue in Bulgarian politics \u2013 was enacted less than two and half months before the elections (see paragraph 37 above), at odds with the recommendations of the Council of Europe on the stability of electoral law (see paragraph 52 above). Second, instead of requiring such links to be checked prior to the candidates\u2019 nomination, it allowed the parties or coalitions which had nominated them to seek their deregistration subsequently. It thus put in place a mechanism which was bound to engender serious practical difficulties and lead to legal challenges which would have to be examined under considerable time constraints. This mechanism was aptly described in the OSCE\u2019s report as opening the \u201cpossibility of ... eleventhhour changes to the lists[, posing] problems not only for election administrators and courts, but also for parties and voters whose understanding of candidates running in the elections was undoubtedly affected\u201d (see paragraph 53 above). Third, the practical arrangements for the application of this rule \u2013 criticised in the OSCE\u2019s report as being quite vague (see paragraph 53 above) \u2013 were clarified by the Central Electoral Commission just twelve days before the elections (see paragraph 9 above), whereas this could have been done much earlier. The initial registration of the candidates by law had to be \u2013 and in fact was \u2013 completed thirty days prior to the elections (see paragraphs 13, 19, 23 and 38 in fine above). Although the Supreme Administrative Court adjudged the applicants\u2019 applications for judicial review in record time, taking respectively just four, one and two days, this could not make up for the fact that, for the abovementioned reasons, the issue of the applicants\u2019 deregistration was being reviewed so shortly before the day of the elections, or, in Mr Petkov\u2019s case, even after that day (see paragraphs 17, 21 and 26 above).",

In cases where \u2013 as here \u2013 the authorities, through deliberate actions and omissions, prevent a parliamentary candidate from running, the breach of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 cannot be remedied exclusively through such an award. If States were able to confine their response to such incidents to the mere payment of compensation, without putting in place effective procedures ensuring the proper unfolding of the democratic process, it would be possible in some cases for the authorities to arbitrarily deprive candidates of their electoral rights (see, by way of example, Podkolzina; Melnychenko; and Krasnov and Skuratov, \u00a7\u00a7 1834, 42 and 5267, all cited above) and even to rig elections.

Under Article 66 of the 1991 Constitution the Constitutional Court may hear challenges to the lawfulness of parliamentary elections, and under Article\u00a0149 \u00a7 1 (7) of the Constitution it is competent to review the lawfulness of the election of individual MPs (see paragraph 35 above).

In particular, it is not clear whether the scope of that court\u2019s review allowed it to address satisfactorily the essence of their grievances, and whether, had it found the breaches of their electoral rights serious enough to require remedial action, it would have been able to provide them with sufficient redress, by, for instance, ordering repeat elections. This uncertainty seems to be a result of the lack of clear and unambiguous provisions in this domain and of the scarcity of rulings on such matters. The latter, in turn, stems from the limitation on the persons and bodies who may refer a case to the  (see paragraph 35 above). While section 112 of the 2001 Elections of Members of Parliament Act states that parliamentary candidates may challenge the elections before that court, it stipulates that they may not do so directly, but only through the limited category of persons or bodies who are entitled to refer a matter to it (see paragraph 46 above). This means that candidates \u2013 or, indeed, any other participant in the electoral process \u2013 cannot directly compel the institution of proceedings before that court. The fact that such proceedings have apparently been instituted only three times, following petitions made by groups of MPs (see paragraph 46 above), shows the inaccessibility of this remedy in practice.

In particular, section 48(5) of that Act gave the parties and coalitions full discretion in composing the lists for the election. Parties and coalitions were free to submit lists as they considered best, taking into account whatever considerations they chose. There was no right for an individual candidate to be registered or to be put on the list. The electoral authorities thus decided upon requests from parties, not upon individual motions.

No individual rights of the candidates were addressed. The wording of the relevant provision did not require proof. Such an exemption may be considered necessary because incriminating material is likely to arise from outside sources, once the names of candidates become known to a wider public. On the other hand, the thirtyday timelimit did not allow for a final assessment of the facts with a subsequent comprehensive review by a commission or a court. The law thus gave to the parties and coalitions in explicit terms one single ground to ask for a change in their list of candidates up to seven days before the elections. According to the Central Electoral Commission, each party or coalition could freely assess the facts establishing the existence of such collaboration, and their assessment was not subject to review by the electoral authorities.",
