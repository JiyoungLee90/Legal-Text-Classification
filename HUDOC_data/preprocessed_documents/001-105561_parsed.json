Moreover, the courts scheduled seven hearings. Four hearings were held, while three were called off (see paragraphs 23 and 47 above).",

The Court attaches importance to two periods of inactivity for which the State could be held responsible; the delay of nearly six months between the request for an investigation and the investigating judge\u2019s decision (see paragraphs 58 and 61 above) and, in particular, the delay of one year and five months between the bill of indictment and the date the court scheduled the first hearing (see paragraphs 65 and 71 above).",

Thus, the Court cannot make any inference on this particular question. The Court further notes that the applicant\u2019s complaint relates chiefly to the fact that, by virtue of the interim decision of 20\u00a0April\u00a02005, he could only have had a very limited contact with A., which was moreover conducted under supervision by social workers. The applicant alleged that this situation lasted for an excessive period of time. In this connection, the Court notes that owing to the fact that he was suspected of child abuse, the interim decision of 20\u00a0April\u00a02005 was maintained until the final decision in the criminal proceedings. The Court would emphasise that the fact that the civil court was awaiting the criminal court\u2019s judgment before allowing regular contact did not release the domestic authorities, including the criminal court, from their obligation to examine the case promptly (see \u0160ilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7 205, 9\u00a0April\u00a02009). The criminal court nevertheless took almost three years to decide on the charges against the applicant; a period in which the applicant\u2019s opportunities to enjoy family life with A. were severely curtailed.",

However, in urgent cases such as this one a delay caused on that account may be justified only if limited to a few days as there is no reason why copying the file would not be an appropriate solution if certain documents are needed for examination in another set of proceedings. In this connection, the Court would reiterate that it is for the State to organise its judicial system in such a way as to enable its courts to comply with the requirements of the Convention, including those enshrined in Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, R.M.D. v.

Invoking Article 14, the applicant complained that, while a criminal investigation had been opened against him for alleged abuse of A., the State had failed to open a criminal investigation against A.\u2019s mother\u2019s new partner on the basis of the same type of allegations, made by the applicant himself.
