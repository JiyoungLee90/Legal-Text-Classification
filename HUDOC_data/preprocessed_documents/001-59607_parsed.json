He agreed that a full personality assessment was required of the applicant who was still seen as having a psychopathic personality. The Secretary of State did not agree that these matters could be safely addressed in open prison conditions. He noted that the applicant had failed to attend further courses in anger management, social skills and communications, as arranged after the Secretary of State\u2019s decision of 20 November 1996. He also had regard to an intervening incident which had occurred on 31 July 1998 when the applicant was being escorted to court by a female officer. After she had refused to allow him to smoke in the vehicle, he had slammed the van door against her, causing her to fall and hurt her arm. He had sworn at her, threatening to kill her, adding that he had already killed one woman. The applicant was found guilty under the Prison Rules of assault and using threatening, abusive or insulting words. The Secretary of State considered that this disclosed impulsive violent behaviour towards a woman over a trivial incident, which had clear similarities with his original offence. He remained an unacceptable risk and was advised that until he co-operated with staff in addressing the areas of concern, the Secretary of State saw no justification in allowing him to progress further towards release. It was however agreed that his next review should take place in July 2000.",

In the applicant\u2019s case, time was necessary for him to attend courses and therapy, and for possible improvements in his character and behaviour to be properly assessed. The DLP reviews in 1996 and 1998 concluded that he was not ready for release and, in view of the need for work on reintegration and prolonged testing on the areas of concern in his behaviour, it was reasonable and proportionate to revert to the normal two year interval.

While the applicant was perceived as having remaining problems to address, in particular following an incident with a female prison officer in July 1998, it is apparent that the panels, who in 1996 and 1998 heard the applicant and the evidence concerning the risk posed by him to the public, considered that he was showing improvement and recommended that this be reflected in progressive steps towards a less restrictive regime. The judge who heard the judicial review application in October 1997 also had doubts as to the rationality of the Secretary of State\u2019s decision to keep the applicant in closed conditions, noting that it was only after a long term prisoner had been tested in open conditions that he could safely be released. It is evident therefore that the applicant was a prisoner who had developed significantly during the course of his sentence and could not be considered as a person in respect of whom no further change of circumstance could be envisaged.
