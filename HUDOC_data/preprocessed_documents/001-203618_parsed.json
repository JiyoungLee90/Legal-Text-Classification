The Court also agrees with the Polish Constitutional Court that an exemption from court fees does not need to have an automatic effect of depriving the winning party of a possibility of having his or her costs reimbursed. Such regulation could in fact lead to a breach of that party\u2019s Article 6 rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Stankiewicz, cited above). Lastly, the Court takes note of the existence of a legal framework which provides for an opportunity to have such litigation costs reduced or waived by a court taking account of the parties\u2019 conduct, the character of the proceedings or the considerations of social policy.",
