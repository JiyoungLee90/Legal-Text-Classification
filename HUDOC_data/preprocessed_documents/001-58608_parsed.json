They further submitted that the Decree had been wrongly applied to their family\u2019s Company because the nationalisation conditions laid down in the Decree, in particular the condition that the company should have more than 150 employees, were not satisfied. The applicants argued that the Company had therefore been nationalised pursuant to Act no. 115/1948, that is after 25 February 1948, the decisive date for restitution under the Restitution Act.",

Accordingly, this Act as well as the Privatisation Act did not apply to the applicants\u2019 case. The court noted that the order of the Minister of Food of 11\u00a0January 1949 had only a declaratory character. It stated that the fact that the Decree had been applied to the applicants\u2019 property contra legem, as the Company had less than 150 employees, could not influence its finding as to the decisive date of the nationalisation. The court considered in this regard certain documentary evidence, in particular a statement from the former owners of the Company, made in response to a request from the former Ministry of Food (Ministerstvo v\u00fd\u017eivy), dated 24 November 1945, that the average number of employees between 1 January 1938 and 1\u00a0January 1940 was 117.3, and heard the husband of the fourth applicant (who died before the end of the restitution proceedings on 7\u00a0September\u00a01995).

From the applicants\u2019 observations submitted to the Prague 1 District Court it appears that in 1945 the Company did not satisfy the conditions prescribed by Decree no. 101/1945, i.e. it did not reach the necessary number of 150 employees. However, the Ministry of Food of the Czech Republic also presented the calculations of the former trade union council of the Company which was under national administration, from which it appears that the average number of employees was 204. According to the former owners, the production of soap, the perfumery, the production of glycerine, the production of crystal soda, the sawmill and the press workshop in \u017didovice should not have been nationalised because they were not inseparable from the margarine production business. The national enterprise Rakovn\u00edk Margarine was therefore created contrary to Article 8 \u00a7 1 (c) of Decree no. 101/1945 because this decree did not permit the creation of a national enterprise except under Article 1 \u00a7 1 \u2026\u2019",
