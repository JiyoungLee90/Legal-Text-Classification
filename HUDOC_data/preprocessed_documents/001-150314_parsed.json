It considered that the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding or otherwise interfering with the proceedings had been supported by statements of witness L. (see paragraph 8 above) and the fact that when the police had identified the applicant\u2019s whereabouts in Kursk he had tried to escape.

The Constitutional Court held that such an extension was only possible if there still existed \u201csufficient grounds to believe\u201d that the accused might abscond during the investigation or trial, reoffend or otherwise obstruct the establishment of the truth, as provided by Article\u00a097 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court concluded that the challenged provision could not be interpreted as providing for superfluous or unlimited detention. Neither did it deprive the defendant and his counsel of the right to challenge before a higher court the lawfulness and validity of the extension order, as well as to make an application for lifting or altering the custodial measure.",

The applicant was granted access to the case file on 28 May 2008, over five months before the expiry of the maximum detention period (see paragraph 15 above). His detention was subsequently extended within the maximum twelve-month period, - on 11\u00a0July, 17\u00a0September and 6 October 2008 until 18 September, 10\u00a0October and 18\u00a0November 2008 respectively, to enable him to finish studying the case file. However, this time proved insufficient for him to read the entire case file comprising hundred volumes and thousands of additional pages of material evidence. For that reason, at the request of the investigator the District Court further extended the applicant\u2019s detention beyond the maximum twelve-month period on 11\u00a0November 2008 - until 10 January 2009, and on 30\u00a0December 2008 - for an unlimited period of time until the applicant and his defence counsel read the case file in full (see paragraphs\u00a017 and 20 above).",

The applicant was charged with five counts of loan fraud and tax evasion, which is a serious crime. His conduct after the opening of the criminal case against him gave grounds to believe that he might abscond from justice or exert pressure on witnesses. According to the case file material the applicant, being director general of the holding, forced his subordinates (witnesses L. and D.) to abscond from the investigation, refuse to testify or give false testimony. It has also been established that after the opening of the criminal case and the beginning of checks at the holding, the applicant had absconded from the investigation and left Belgorod Region, that for over a month he had been in hiding, and that he had been finally arrested in Kursk where he had also attempted to escape. At the examination of the issue of extension of the applicant\u2019s detention the applicant\u2019s lawyer repeatedly requested the court to release the applicant on bail. The proposed bail was, however, disproportionate to the damage caused by the crimes charged against the applicant and could not secure his appropriate behaviour during the investigation and his participation in the trial. The Government further submitted that the applicant\u2019s detention between 28\u00a0May 2008 and 30\u00a0March 2009 (over ten months) had been attributable to the applicant, who had been deliberately delaying the studying of the case file. The circumstances of the case and the applicant\u2019s conduct, relied on by the domestic court it the extension orders, did not leave any doubts that the applicant\u2019s release prior to the delivery of the judgment had not been possible. At the same time the domestic court gave due consideration to the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention, his state of health and other factors which could have had an impact on the court\u2019s decisions as to the preventive measure. The proceedings were conducted in compliance with the \u201cspecial diligence\u201d requirement. The Government concluded, therefore, that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention did not breach the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

He challenged, first of all, the validity of the grounds advanced by the domestic court in the choice of the custodial measure. The applicant submitted, in particular, that he had acquired the status of a suspect in the criminal case on 18\u00a0November 2007 and therefore his business trips prior to that date could not have been viewed by the domestic court as an attempt to abscond from the investigation and trial. Besides, on 1\u00a0November 2007 he gave an explanation to detective officer of the 1st Interdistrict Investigation Department of Tax Crimes Investigation Unit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Belgorod Region, and supplied samples of his handwriting, which disproved the assertion of the domestic authorities to the effect that he had been hiding from the investigation. The applicant explained his failure to appear for questioning as a witness on 12 November 2007 by the fact that the competent authorities omitted to properly notify him of the scheduled questioning. Indeed, no proof to the contrary can be found in the case file. There had also been no credible evidence that he had in any way interfered with the investigation for the court to opt for a custodial measure. The applicant further challenged the validity of the grounds for subsequent extensions of his detention. In particular, the domestic court had failed to take into account the fact that the suspicion of fraud had been abandoned and that no relevant charge had been brought against the applicant on 27\u00a0November 2007, and that from 8 December 2007 the applicant was no longer the Director General of the holding and could therefore not put any pressure on his former employees. The domestic court also remained reluctant to take into consideration the fact that the applicant had positive references, no criminal record, a permanent place of residence, and so on. Finally, the applicant believed that the proceedings had not been conducted with \u201cspecial diligence\u201d as required by Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention.",
