Turkey, no. 74321/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a019-24, 3\u00a0May 2007; Mehmet \u015eah \u00c7elik v. , no.\u00a048545/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a022-31, 24\u00a0July 2007; and Tamambo\u011fa and G\u00fcl v. Turkey, no.\u00a01636/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-29, 29\u00a0November 2007). The Court held, particularly in Ko\u015fti and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 18-19), that only available and adequate remedies had to be tried under Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention and that the burden of proof was on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that a remedy was effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, i.e. that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see also Cennet Ayhan and Mehmet Salih Ayhan v. Turkey, no. 41964/98, \u00a7 65, 27 June 2006). In this regard, the Court referred to certain cases against Turkey where violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention were found based on the fact that, inter alia, the State Security Courts used the same formal reasons for the applicants\u2019 continued detention without explaining their specific relevance in each case, such as in the present application (see, among many others, Hasan Ceylan v. Turkey, no.\u00a058398/00, 23\u00a0May 2006; Pakkan v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a013017/02, 31 October 2006; and Acunbay v. , nos.\u00a061442/00 and 61445/00, 31 May 2005). It considered, accordingly, that an objection against such stereotype reasoning would have had little prospect of success before another instance. Moreover, as a rule, the objection proceedings in question were not adversarial and were decided in the absence of an oral hearing (see Article 302 \u00a7 1 of the CCP). They therefore lacked the guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (Ko\u015fti and Others, cited above).",

However, where a consistent case-law shows that such safeguards fail or are deficient, it would be contrary to the very principle of the Convention and would lead to excessive formalism under Article 35 \u00a7 1 to demand of the applicant that she or he exhaust the inadequate safeguards (see Estrikh v. , no.\u00a073819/01, \u00a7\u00a097, 18 January 2007).",
