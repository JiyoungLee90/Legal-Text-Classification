In a written report he listed his findings, namely that the applicant had been admitted and treated for a broken rib and broken leg the previous night. The report indicated that in a conversation with the applicant conducted during that visit, the latter had told the officer that he could not remember the events in detail, but that he was certain that after the car chase two police officers had beaten and then handcuffed him before taking him to the police station. The applicant also gave a handwritten statement to an officer that day. In it he referred to the car chase, stated that he had wanted to escape as he had felt drunk, that when he had got out of his car the policemen had grabbed him, that one of them had pulled him to the ground and that the other one had handcuffed him.

A number of investigative steps were carried out.

The latter all stated that they had seen the applicant at the police station on the night in question. He had been calm, had smelt of alcohol and been visibly intoxicated, his clothes had been muddy and he had limped. The applicant, his brother and the friend of the brother who had accompanied him to collect the applicant from the police station, were also interviewed.

The forensic medical report, containing a comprehensive and independent assessment, concluded that the three injuries recorded in the medical certificates drawn up in the immediate aftermath of the events (see paragraph 12 above) were incompatible with the applicant\u2019s allegations that the officers had hit him all over his body for a few minutes. In particular, being kicked by someone wearing boots or being hit for several minutes would have left the applicant with many more traces on different parts of his body, not just the three strictly localised injuries mentioned above.

Furthermore, when questioned on 27 March 2014, the applicant had stated that the police officers had started hitting and kicking him after he had left his car voluntarily. When interviewed again on 28 May 2014, he had asserted that the officers had brutally pulled him out of the car and had thereafter only kicked him rather than hit him. He had tried to use his arms to protect his head from the kicks. He had stated that he could not remember or recognise the police officers who had beaten him, whether in a personal confrontation or from pictures. He had also complained that three officers had beaten him, while it had been unequivocally established that there had only been two patrolling officers.

The officers had worn police uniforms that had been clearly visible and identifiable and had been driving a police car with flashing police lights and a siren while chasing the applicant. He had not only refused to stop but had actively avoided being caught.

Of particular importance, in the Court\u2019s view, is that the forensic medical report excluded the possibility that the applicant had sustained his injuries in the manner described by him. They were strictly localised and few in number, which was incompatible with being hit or kicked in an indiscriminate matter over several minutes, as he had submitted (see paragraph 18 above). At the same time, the report concluded that it was possible that the injuries had been sustained after a fall while moving at an accelerated pace, which corresponded to the officers\u2019 submissions during the investigation. Seeing that no cogent evidence has been provided to lead the Court to depart from the domestic authorities\u2019 findings, the Court accepts the version of the events as established by the investigating authorities and confirmed by the domestic courts. In light of the above, it considers that recourse to some physical force had been made necessary by the applicant\u2019s own conduct and that the actual force used by the police could not be considered to have been disproportionate to that conduct. While the applicant undoubtedly suffered as a result of his arrest, the injuries and his associated suffering did not result from the use of excessive force against him. Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention with regard to the alleged ill-treatment by the police on 10\u00a0March 2014.",

Numerous witnesses were questioned, including the two police officers who had allegedly beaten the applicant, as well as the applicant himself, his brother and his brother\u2019s friend. A forensic expert examined the medical documents and the statements collected from all the individuals questioned and came to a conclusion which excluded the possibility that the applicant had sustained his injuries in the manner alleged.

The fact that he was unsuccessful cannot be considered pertinent (see, similarly, J\u00f3zef\u00a0Wo\u015b v. Poland, no. 6058/10, \u00a7 54, 28 June 2016). It is noteworthy that no obvious omission to collect relevant evidence could be attributed to the authorities, in contrast with a number of cases where the Court found a violation of Article 3 on the grounds that the authorities had made a series of crucial omissions during investigations into applicants\u2019 complaints of illtreatment by police officers (see, among many others, Anguelova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2002IV; Biser Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 32662/06, \u00a7 80 and \u00a7\u00a7 83\u201384, 10 January 2012; Nikolay Dimitrov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 72663/01, \u00a7\u00a7 77\u201378, 27 September 2007). Finally, no evidence was allowed to deteriorate in the process and, together with the judicial review at two instances, the investigation was completed within ten months (see, by contrast, Labita, cited above, \u00a7 133, where the only action taken for fourteen months was the taking of photographs of the alleged perpetrators).",
