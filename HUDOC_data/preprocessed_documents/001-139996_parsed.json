The Court considers that this conclusion amounts to an acknowledgment in substance that the death of Murat\u00a0Kasap was in breach of Article\u00a02 of the Convention and makes it unnecessary to determine whether the force used by the police officer was absolutely necessary and justified under Article\u00a02 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention. The Court\u2019s examination of the applicants\u2019 complaint will therefore be limited to ascertaining whether or not the national authorities afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for the violation (see Fadime and Turan Karabulut v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a023872/04, \u00a7\u00a043, 27\u00a0May 2010 and K\u00fclah and Koyuncu v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a024827/05, \u00a7\u00a038, 23\u00a0April 2013) and whether they have complied with their substantive and procedural obligations under Article\u00a02 of the Convention. In this connection the Court notes that, although the officer I.H.Y., who killed Murat\u00a0Kasap, was found guilty of the offences of using disproportionate force and manslaughter by negligence, he was sentenced to one year and eight months\u2019 imprisonment and the pronouncement of the judgment was suspended.",

In order to examine whether that obligation has been satisfied, it is for the Court to review whether and to what extent the national courts, in reaching their conclusions, may be deemed to have submitted the case to the careful scrutiny required by Article\u00a02 of the Convention, so that the deterrent effect of the judicial system that is in place and the significance of the role it is required to play in preventing violations of the right to life are not undermined (see Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a042942/02, \u00a7\u00a062, 8\u00a0April 2008).",

In other words, the trial court concluded that, even though the police officer has not acted with intent to kill, the death of Murat Kasap was unlawful (see paragraph 56 above). However, the Court observes that the domestic law permitted the trial court to suspend the pronouncement of the judgment for the offence of unlawful killing. By this decision, the trial court used its power of discretion to lessen the consequences of a serious criminal act rather than to show that such acts could in no way be tolerated (see Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075). The Court notes that the suspension of the pronouncement of the judgment, regulated by Article\u00a0231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, results in the impunity of the perpetrators. That is because the application of this provision deprives the judgment of all its legal consequences, including the sentence, provided that the offender abides by the supervision order. The Court therefore considers that the impugned court decision suggests that the judges exercised their discretion to minimise the consequences of an unlawful act, rather than showing that such acts could in no way be tolerated (see mutatis mutandis, Eski v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a08354/04, \u00a7\u00a036, 5\u00a0June 2012).",
