Consequently, it held that the pension calculation was to be made on the basis of Italian criteria, even though they were less favourable than the Swiss ones. Indeed, Italian law (decree of 27 April 1968 no. 488) provided for a calculation based on higher contributory rates than those in Switzerland, thus providing a lower pension than that expected by Mr Maggio.",

A change in calculating pensions from the contributory criterion to the remuneration-based one (\u201cretributivo\u201d), was not to the detriment of the financial sustainability of the system. Thus, the changes brought about by the impugned Law sought to bring the relationship between pensionable remuneration and contributions in line with the system in force in  during the same period of time. The Law provided that remuneration received abroad (used as a basis for pension calculations) was to be adjusted by applying the same percentage ratios used for pension contributions paid in  during the same period. Thus, the norm made explicit what had been in the original interpretative provisions. Consequently, there had been no breach of the principle of legal certainty. Nor was the norm discriminatory since the acquired and more favourable rights of earlier pensioners were, by then, unassailable. Furthermore, the Law did not discriminate against people who had worked abroad, because it simply ensured an overall balance in the welfare system, and avoided the situation whereby persons who had made small contributions to a foreign pension scheme could receive the same pension as those who had paid the much higher Italian contributions. The contested Law did not provide for any ex post reductions, as it merely imposed an interpretation which could already have been inferred from the original provisions. Lastly, this system still allowed for a sufficient and satisfactory pension, adequate for the lifestyle of a worker. Accordingly, the claim of unconstitutionality of the said Law was manifestly ill-founded.",

The criteria applied by the INPS to the applicants took into account the low contributions paid by the applicants in , namely 8% of the salary, as opposed to the Italian 32.7%. Otherwise, the applicants as persons having worked in Switzerland would have had greater benefits for the relevant period, which constituted an advantage both vis-\u00e0-vis other Italian citizens who had paid higher contributions, and other Swiss citizens who ultimately received lower pensions. However, a number of affected individuals applied to the domestic courts contesting their pension calculation.

Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Terazzi S.r.l. v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a027265/95, \u00a7\u00a085, 17\u00a0October 2002, and Wieczorek v. , no. 18176/05, \u00a7 59, 8\u00a0December 2009).

As a consequence, according to the first applicant, between the years 1996 when he started receiving his pension and 2009, he received a monthly pension of EUR 873 as opposed to EUR 1,372 which he would have obtained had his proceedings not been interfered with and he had been successful, and for the year 2010 he received a pension of EUR 1,178 instead of EUR 1,900. On the basis of these calculations the Court observes that the first applicant lost considerably less than half of his pension. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant was obliged to endure a reasonable and commensurate reduction, rather than the total deprivation of his entitlements (see, conversely, Kjartan \u00c1smundsson, cited above \u00a7 45).",

Moreover, this reduction only had the effect of equalizing a state of affairs and avoiding unjustified advantages (resulting from the decision to retire in ) for the applicant and other persons in his position. Against this background, bearing in mind the State\u2019s wide margin of appreciation in regulating the pension system and the fact that the applicant only lost a partial amount of pension, the Court considers that the applicant was not made to bear an individual and excessive burden.",

France, no. 12106/03, \u00a7 38, 21 June 2007).

To that must be added non-pecuniary damage, which the finding of a violation in this judgment does not suffice to remedy. Making its assessment on an equitable basis as required by Article 41, the Court awards each applicant EUR 12,000 under this head.",
