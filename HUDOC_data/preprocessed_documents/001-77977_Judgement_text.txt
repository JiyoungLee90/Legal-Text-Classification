The case originated in an application (no. 74154/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Dumitru Braga (“the applicant”), on 2 August 2001.
The applicant was represented by Mr V Nagacevschi, from “Lawyers for human rights”, a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr A. Pârlog.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his right to a fair hearing and his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions were breached as a result of the quashing of the final judgment in his favour of 21 November 2000 and the late enforcement of the judgment of 21 February 2001.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).
On 17 March 2005 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 25 February 1999 the applicant was acquitted of a criminal offence. He initiated court proceedings against the Ministry of Finance claiming compensation for unlawful prosecution.
On 5 May 2000 the Căuşeni District Court found in favour of the applicant and awarded him 951 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 84 euros (EUR) at the time) in compensation for pecuniary damage caused. The claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage was rejected.
On 6 July 2000 the Chişinău Tribunal awarded MDL 40,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused and upheld the District Court’s award in respect of pecuniary damage.
On 21 November 2000 the Court of Appeal reduced the award for non-pecuniary damage to MDL 20,000 (the equivalent of EUR 1,917 at the time) and upheld the rest of the judgment. This judgment was final and enforceable.
On 18 January 2001 the Prosecutor General requested the annulment of all previous judgments and the reduction of the award for non-pecuniary damage, as part of an extraordinary procedure.
On 21 February 2001 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the Prosecutor General’s request and annulled all the previous judgments. It adopted a new judgment whereby it reduced the award for non-pecuniary damage to MDL 2,000.
That judgment was final and enforceable. It was enforced in August 2002 (the applicant received the equivalent of EUR 84 for pecuniary damage and EUR 150 in respect of non-pecuniary damage).
The applicant submitted that Government decision no. 59 of 19 January 1998 (see paragraph 15 below) prohibited the forced execution of judgments against State property unless the Ministry of Finance had given its agreement. The Government have not commented on this statement.
The relevant domestic law has been set out in the Court’s judgment in Roşca v. Moldova (no. 6267/02, 22 March 2005, §§ 16 - 17).
In addition, the relevant provision of Government decision no.59 of 19 January 1998 reads as follows:
