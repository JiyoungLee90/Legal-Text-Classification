In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 282, ECHR 2001-VII (extracts)).

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

Moreover, no arrest report describing the alleged use of force or incident report giving details of the alleged disturbance at the detention facility was prepared.

The minimum standards of effectiveness defined by the Court\u2019s case-law include the requirements that the investigation be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny. It is beyond doubt that a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. A prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 136). When the official investigation has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirement of the prohibition of ill-treatment. While there is no absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow grave attacks on physical and moral integrity to go unpunished (see Okkal\u0131 v.
