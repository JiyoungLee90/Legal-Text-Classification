While the Court accepts that this consideration was \u201crelevant\u201d to the applicant\u2019s case, it finds that, as time elapsed, it was gradually less and less \u201csufficient\u201d. In particular, no reasons \u2013 other than the applicant\u2019s foreign connections \u2013 were advanced at any stage of the proceedings for assuming that he might abscond. Considering the fact that before the pre-trial detention the applicant had been under house arrest for fourteen days and during this period he could have absconded but did not, and moreover no attempt on his part to reach his foreign connections was demonstrated by the authorities, the Court does not find the repeated references to the risk of his absconding satisfactory.",

However, his foreign connections apart, no concrete elements were held against the applicant during this period either \u2013 and this in the face of his age and settled personal circumstances and the absence of criminal record.
