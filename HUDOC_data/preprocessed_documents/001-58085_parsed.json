The main problem with applying the test is constituted by the fact that the concept of \u201cobjective impartiality\u201d is a contradiction in terms. Partiality is in fact a purely subjective approach. Consequently, the application of the objective-partiality test by the Court, after it has found that there are no indications of subjective partiality, makes it necessary for the Court to choose between appearance and reality. Although the Court has emphasised that \u201cin deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive\u201d (see the Piersack v. Belgium judgment of 1 October 1982, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a053, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a031, and the Hauschildt v.

Belgium judgment of 30\u00a0October 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0214-B, p.\u00a032, \u00a7\u00a026).",

                        "content": "It is true that the Court in its De Cubber v. Belgium judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984 considered the fact that a judge has acquired before the hearing a particularly detailed knowledge of the file as a factor which might make his impartiality suspect in the eyes of the accused (Series\u00a0A no.\u00a086, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a029). On the other hand, it held in its Saraiva de Carvalho v.  judgment of 22\u00a0April 1994: \u201cHis detailed knowledge of the case did not mean that he was prejudiced in a way that prevented him from being impartial when the case came to trial\u201d (Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0286-B, p.\u00a039, \u00a7\u00a038). To quote the Commission\u2019s report in the Thomann case: \u201cThe professional training and experience of the judges ensures that their findings in the context of the proceedings in the accused\u2019s absence would not predetermine their taking and evaluation of the evidence and appreciation of all relevant circumstances in the ensuing new examination of the charges in the accused\u2019s presence\u201d (paragraph\u00a071). The same confidence would seem to be justified in the present case. And, indeed, the applicant herself did not claim that Judge S. had actually been biased in her case.",

                        "content": "Even if one were to assume that Judge S. was inevitably influenced by his first decision, as does Commission member Schermers in his concurring opinion, the fact remains that he constituted a minority in the Chamber of\nthree which decided the case after the objection. The mere fact that the two other members of the Chamber were lay judges did not mean per se that Judge S. had a preponderant influence in the Chamber. In fact, given the technical issues involved the contrary may well have been the case. However, this remains a matter of pure speculation. In its Ettl and Others v. Austria judgment of 23\u00a0April 1987 the Court indicated that in cases where issues of great complexity were at issue, the participation of lay judges with special expertise with regard to those issues \u201cenabled them to reach balanced decisions, having regard to the various interests at stake\u201d (Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0117, p.\u00a018, \u00a7\u00a040).",

When the Court takes too casuistic an approach in its objective-impartiality test, basing distinctions on elements the distinctive character of which is not self-evident, it does not serve legal certainty and fails to give the necessary guidance to the national courts and legislatures (see the separate opinion of Judge De Meyer in the above-mentioned Bulut case and the concurring opinion of Judge Martens in the case of Fey v. Austria, judgment of 24 February 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0255-A, p.\u00a016).",
