The applicants complained of non-enforcement to the Human Rights Chamber or to the Constitutional Court. On 9 November 2005 and 8 March 2006 the Human Rights Commission (the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber) found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the cases of Mr Vučanović, Mr Šavija, the Pilipovićs, the Grujićs, the Brkićs and Mr Avramović. On 20 December 2005, 12 April 2006, 9 May 2006, 26 June 2007 and 13 December 2007 the  ruled likewise in the cases of the remaining applicants. The applicants did not claim compensation, but even if they had done so, their claim would have most likely been refused (see, for example, the Constitutional Court’s decisions AP 774/04 of 20 December 2005, § 438; AP 557/05 of 12 April 2006, § 195; AP 1211/06 of 13 December 2007, § 79; and AP 244/08 of 8 December 2010, § 37).
After the extensive information campaign explaining the available options for the settlement of the Republika Srpska’s public debt (including its debt arising from domestic judgments), between 7 April 2008 and 1 March 2010 the applicants informed the authorities that they agreed to be paid only the legal costs in cash and the principal debt and default interest in bonds. Government bonds were then issued on the following dates:
(i)  on 15 December 2008 to the Runićs and Ms Bjeljac;
(ii)  on 30 October 2009 to Mr Gačić;
(iii)  30 October 2009 to Mr Višekruna;
(iv)  30 October 2009 to the Manojlovićs;
(v)  30 October 2009 to Mr Vučanović;

(xxv)  15 June 2010 to Mr Bera;
(xxvi)  30 June 2008 to Mr Stanković; and
(xxvii)  15 December 2008 to the Simendićs.
At least 20 applicants have already sold some or all of their bonds on the Stock Exchange (namely, Mr Dušan Višekruna, Mr Zoran Vučanović, Mr Nikola Šavija, Ms Dobrila Pilipović, Ms Milica Pantić, Ms Slađana Pantić, Ms Jovanka Savić, Mr Milenko Savić, Ms Mira Savić, Mr Milivoje Savić, Ms Božica Alempić, Ms Milijana Jurošević, Mr Milutin Jović, Ms Marija Jović, Ms Gordana Šalipurević, Mr Milorad Šalipurević, Ms Zorica Mišić, Mr Jadranko Zlovolić, Mr Dušan Ćelić and Ms Ilinka Simendić).
Around 9,000 domestic judgments ordering the Republika Srpska to pay war damages (including those under consideration in the present case) became final by 29 November 2005. After a stay of several years on such civil actions under the War Damage Act 2005, a number of new judgments have been rendered since 2010. As pursuant to section 376 § 1 of the Civil Obligations Act 1978 and settled domestic case-law, such claims became statute-barred on 19 June 1999 (that is, three years from the cessation of the state of war), the total number of new judgments should not exceed 2,800 according to information provided by the Government in the context of the leading case concerning this matter (Čolić and Others, cited above). The thousands of cases, which were lodged after that date and were stayed between 2005 and 2010, would eventually be rejected as statute-barred.
Pursuant to the Domestic Debt Act 2004, only legal costs awarded by the domestic judgments in question are to be paid in cash, whereas principal debt and associated default interest are to be paid in government bonds which earn interest at an annual rate of 1.5%. There have thus far been five issues of bonds: on 30 June 2008 (to be amortised in ten annual instalments between 2014 and 2023), on 15 December 2008 (to be amortised in ten annual instalments between 2014 and 2023), on 30 October 2009 (to be amortised in ten annual instalments between 2014 and 2023), on 15 June 2010 (to be amortised in ten annual instalments between 2015 and 2024) and on 9 June 2011 (to be amortised in ten annual instalments between 2016 and 2025). If one is unable or unwilling to wait until the maturity of bonds, he or she may sell them on the Stock Exchange (their current price is around 40% of their nominal value). With the aim of making such bonds attractive, the Republika Srpska has accepted that they may be used to pay direct taxes accrued by 31 December 2007.
