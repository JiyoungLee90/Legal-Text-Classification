Once the existence of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d is no longer enough, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty (see Magee and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 26289/12, 29062/12 and 29891/12, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-89, 12 May 2015).",

The Court has previously held that an extension under Article 165-2 may be justified in particular circumstances where the court requires time to establish the person\u2019s identity and collect other information crucial for taking a decision on his or her pre-trial detention. At the same time, the Court noted that the reasons not to release the person should be compelling (see Barilo v. Ukraine, no. 9607/06, \u00a7 93, 16 May 2013). In the present case no such reasons were advanced by the national court in its decision of 19\u00a0November 2010, in particular, the Sokal Court did not explain why the information concerning the applicant\u2019s personality and health had not been collected during his detention between 16 and 19 November 2010. It follows that the decision of 19 November 2010 must be considered arbitrary and unjustified (see Barilo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 91-98). There was thus a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) in respect of the applicant\u2019s detention between 19 and 26 November 2010.",

The Court accepts that the existence of reasonable suspicion that the applicant beat his mother provided a sufficient ground for his detention (see Jamro\u017cy v.\u00a0Poland, no. 6093/04, \u00a7 37, 15 September 2009).

The Court has dealt with similar situations in the past and found that such practice was incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) (see Kharchenko v. Ukraine, no. 40107/02, \u00a7 98, 10\u00a0February 2011).
