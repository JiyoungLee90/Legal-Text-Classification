Although in the narrative part of the decision of 14\u00a0July 2003 on the setting of a preliminary hearing the court mentioned that the applicant\u2019s measure of restraint must remain unchanged, it gave no order in this respect (see paragraph 20 above). This was in line with the domestic legal practice of the relevant period. The Court has previously noted that the domestic authorities interpreted Article 255 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as permitting the detention of an accused without a court order for up to six months from the date of receipt of the case file by a court. A judicial order was required only if detention \u201cduring the trial\u201d exceeded six months (see Yudayev, cited above, \u00a7 56). The Constitutional Court subsequently condemned that practice as unconstitutional, finding that it was contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 63 above). Since the Town Court delivered no orders concerning the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention in the period under examination, and the legal practice did not require the issuance of such orders, the Court concludes that the applicant had no remedy to make use of.",

It has held that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without a specific legal basis or clear rules governing their situation - with the result that they may be deprived of their liberty for an unlimited period without judicial authorisation - is incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Fursenko v.

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v. France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 273-B, and Toth v. Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series A no. 224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee and Article\u00a05 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison\u00a0Reid v. the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, \u00a7 79, ECHR\u00a02003IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a particular need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because a defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4 October 2001).",
