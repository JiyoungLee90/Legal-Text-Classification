The assize court considered that by chanting the above-mentioned slogans the applicants had disseminated propaganda in favour of the DHKP/C without providing any explanation as to why it considered that chanting of the slogans referred to in the indictment had constituted encouragement of violence, armed resistance or an uprising, or had been capable of inciting to violence. In the Court\u2019s view, given that the slogans in question are well-known and stereotyped leftist slogans and that they were chanted during a concert \u2013 a peaceful public gathering \u2013 they cannot be interpreted as a call for violence or an uprising (see G\u00fcl and Others, cited above, \u00a7 41). Besides, there is nothing in the case file showing that the applicants were involved in any violent acts or had the intention of inciting violence. The Malatya Assize Court, however, does not appear to have given consideration to any of the above factors. In sum, the Court considers that the national courts did not provide \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons for the applicants\u2019 criminal conviction under section 7(2) of Law\u00a0no. 3713.",
