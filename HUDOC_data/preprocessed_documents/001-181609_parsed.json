The Ministry pointed out that it was presumed that no conflict of interests existed, even when evaluators worked in the same institution whose tenders they were evaluating and that this was a common European practice.

It further urged the Administrative Court to decide that it would be awarded funding. It complained that the Ministry had joined the proceedings that had initially been intended for consideration of tenders from private research organisations to the proceedings for consideration of tenders from public research organisations, without issuing a formal decision to that effect. It also complained of errors in the evaluation of the competing programmes, because not all of the criteria specified in the Rules on Quality Assessment and Funding of the Public Research Organisation Programme had been taken into account. It argued, inter alia, that the evaluation procedure had been unfair because some of the evaluators had been biased, as they had been evaluating research programmes which were competing with the very programmes in which they themselves participated. This provoked a distortion of the results of the procedure, as shown by the fact that only those research programmes in which the evaluators were leaders or members of research teams obtained financing. The applicant institute expressly requested a hearing at which witnesses could be heard with regard to the alleged procedural errors in the evaluation of the programmes. Additionally, it submitted a letter of 2\u00a0December 2003 which one of the witnesses, K., had sent to the Minister of Education, Science and Sport and several other addressees. In the letter K. notified them of problems he had detected in the tender proceedings in which he had participated as an evaluator.",

In its decision of 2 February 2011 the court gave an extensive account of the proceedings before the Ministry and the submissions of both parties. The reasons for the decision were given on a single page. Invoking section\u00a071(2) of the Administrative Dispute Act (Zakon o upravnem sporu \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe ADA\u201d, see paragraph 23 below), the Administrative Court chiefly referred to the submissions of the Ministry. It considered, among other things, that the Ministry had not acted unlawfully in joining the proceedings. It accepted the Ministry\u2019s submission that its decision had been dictated by the nature of the research and infrastructural programmes, taking into account the guidelines of the National Research and Development Programme. The court also pointed out that the procedural rules for the evaluation of research programmes adopted by the National Scientific and Research Council clearly defined the stages of the evaluation procedure, the participants in it and their tasks. Regarding the alleged conflict of interests, the court stated that it agreed with the Ministry as to why no such conflict existed and cited section 71(2) of the ADA (see paragraph 23 below). As to the alleged errors in the evaluation of the competing programmes, the court merely disagreed with the applicant institute that not all criteria had been taken into account and again cited section 71(2) of the ADA.",

The Court further recalls that it has recently stated the principles pertaining to the application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in its judgment in the case of Regner v. the Czech Republic ([GC], no. 35289/11, ECHR 2017 (extracts)). It distinguished four different situations where Article 6 \u00a7 1 is applicable, one of them regarding certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, with the law conferring on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which, where they find that the decision was unlawful, may set it aside. In such a case Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is applicable, on condition that the advantage or privilege, once granted, gives rise to a civil right (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0105).",

Switzerland (dec.), no. 46841/99, 31 August 2004; I.T.C. LTD v.\u00a0Malta (dec.), no. 2629/06, 11 December 2007; and S.C. Black Sea Caviar S.R.L. v. Romania (dec.) [Committee], no. 13013/06, 31 May 2016). However, the Court considers the principles stated in Regner to be relevant for the present case, where the applicant institute clearly enjoyed a procedural right to the lawful and correct adjudication of the tenders. Should the tender be awarded to the applicant institute, the latter would have been conferred a civil right. In this connection, it is to be recalled that there has been a shift in Court\u2019s case-law towards applying the civil limb of Article\u00a06 to cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private right belonging to an individual (see De Tommaso v.

In proceedings before two instances, at least one instance must, in general, provide such a hearing if no such exceptional circumstances are at hand (see Salomonsson v. Sweden, no. 38978/97, \u00a7 36, 12 November 2002). This public character protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, an oral hearing in public contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Mehmet Emin \u015eim\u015fek v. Turkey, no.\u00a05488/05, \u00a7 28, 28 February 2012, and Sz\u00fccs v. Austria, 24\u00a0November 1997, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII).",

Germany, no. 44164/14, \u00a7 23, 9 June 2016, and also Jussila v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2006-XIV, which concerned the criminal limb of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention). This does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Miller v. Sweden, no. 55853/00, \u00a7 29, 8 February 2005). The Court has accepted exceptional circumstances in cases where the proceedings concerned exclusively legal or highly technical questions (see SchulerZgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 58, Series A no.\u00a0263; Varela Assalino v. Portugal (dec.), no. 64336/01, 25 April 2002; and Speil v.\u00a0Austria (dec.), no. 42057/98, 5 September 2002). There may be proceedings in which an oral hearing may not be required: for example, where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate a hearing and the courts may fairly and reasonably decide the case on the basis of the parties\u2019 submissions and other written materials (see Jussila, cited above, \u00a7 41, with reference to D\u00f6ry v. Sweden, no. 28394/95, \u00a7\u00a037, 12\u00a0November 2002, which concerned the civil limb of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention).",
