The court found that it would be against the children\u2019s best interests to separate them or to take them away from their established home in Samara. The court also held that there was no evidence of a risk that living with their father might cause the children any physical or psychological harm or undermine their moral development. The fact that S. and C. had started to attend a preschool facility after their removal to Kaluga was insufficient to outweigh the other considerations relating to the best interests of all three children.

The District Court had taken into account that Z. had had to make frequent and long business trips and that after the parents\u2019 separation the children had lived with their father in Samara where all their grandparents and other close relatives also lived. It had also taken into account the degree of the children\u2019s attachment to each of the parents, as determined by psychological experts, and the wishes of the eldest child, K. The Regional Court had analysed the District Court\u2019s findings and disagreed with them. It had held that the District Court had failed to take into account all pertinent information, such as the opinion of the childcare authorities of Kaluga or Z.\u2019s comfortable living conditions. Most importantly, the District Court had not cited any exceptional circumstances warranting the separation of the young children \u2013 who had been six years and four months old at that time \u2013 from their mother.
