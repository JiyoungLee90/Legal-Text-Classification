I would like to underline once again the necessity of taking into account, in cases pertaining to constitutional questions, the interpretative directives derived from the Preamble to the Convention. Firstly, the Preamble refers to a \u201ccommon understanding and observance of human rights\u201d. The Convention should therefore be construed in a way which reflects the common understanding of human rights among the High Contracting Parties. The Court should try to avoid imposing an interpretation which goes against that common understanding. Secondly, the Preamble refers to \u201ca common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law\u201d. An interpretation of the Convention and its Protocols therefore has to duly take this common heritage into account.

It is also important to note that the \u201cfurther realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d is a tool for the achievement of greater unity between the member States of the Council of Europe. From this perspective, the task in question belongs to the High Contracting Parties, which can conclude new treaties for this purpose, whereas the European Court of Human Rights has to \u201censure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto\u201d (Article 19 of the Convention), while bearing in mind that the instrument to be applied was only one of \u201cthe first steps for the collective enforcement of certain of the rights stated in the Universal Declaration\u201d (Preamble to the Convention).",

In that case the Court rightly draw attention to the peculiarities of the provision in question, stressing among other things that \u201cbecause of the relevance of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the institutional order of the State, this provision is cast in very different terms from Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is phrased in collective and general terms, although it has been interpreted by the Court as also implying specific individual rights. The standards to be applied for establishing compliance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 must therefore be considered to be less stringent than those applied under Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention\u201d (see \u017ddanoka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0115). The Court also stated that \u201c[t]he concept of \u2018implied limitations\u2019 under Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 is of major importance for the determination of the relevance of the aims pursued by the restrictions on the rights guaranteed by this provision. Given that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is not limited by a specific list of \u2018legitimate aims\u2019 such as those enumerated in Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention, the Contracting States are therefore free to rely on an aim not contained in that list to justify a restriction, provided that the compatibility of that aim with the principle of the rule of law and the general objectives of the Convention is proved in the particular circumstances of a case\u201d (see \u017ddanoka, cited above, \u00a7 115).",

The Commission also exercises powers in the field of legislation and in particular has a monopoly on initiating legislation in most matters. Legal scholars have widely discussed the problem of the democracy deficit within the European Union and some of them have criticised the organisation on that account. Although the Lisbon Treaty was designed, among other things, to improve the democracy deficit, it was not able to overcome the problem completely.",

It is not clear whether the same requirement should be applied to the two legislative bodies of the European Union, namely the Parliament and the Council. Should both be elected according to the standards enshrined in the Article in question? Will the enfranchisement of those deprived of the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament solve the problem from the perspective of the Convention? Or will the problem persist as long as the other legislative body of the European Union is not directly elected by the people? I will leave these broader questions unanswered in the present dissenting opinion and consider only the narrow issue raised by the applicants, namely the question of their inability to vote in the elections to the European Parliament, on the assumption that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 requires that in the European Union at least the Parliament has to be elected according to the standards of free election enshrined in that provision.",

Under the British law a convicted person, during the time he is detained in a penal institution, is legally incapable of voting at any parliamentary or local election.

In Italy, disenfranchisement lasts five years in cases of sentences imposing a prison term of three to five years and is permanent in cases of sentences imposing a prison term of five years or more. However, in the latter case a convicted person who has been permanently deprived of the right to vote may recover that right. The Court found the system under consideration compatible with the Convention. Although the reasoning refers extensively to the Hirst judgment, it is difficult to see in the Scoppola v. Italy (no. 3) judgment anything other than a partial overruling of the former judgment.",

                        "content": "6.\u00a0\u00a0The approach adopted by the Court in the two above-mentioned cases pertaining to the voting rights of prisoners raises many doubts and objections. Firstly, any general legal rule imposing a restriction ex lege on certain rights applies to a class of persons defined by some criteria. It is always a \u201cgeneral, automatic and indiscriminate restriction\u201d for this class of persons. The notion of a \u201cblanket restriction\u201d is therefore relative. Whether a restriction can be qualified as \u201cblanket\u201d is a matter of perspective. It presupposes the definition of a class of persons that is the point of reference for the assessment. A \u201cblanket\u201d restriction is a restriction which applies to all persons belonging to this class. In this context, the choice of the reference group should be explained rationally by those contesting the permissibility of an allegedly \u201cblanket\u201d restriction. Why should the reference group subject to voting-rights restrictions be persons sentenced to a prison term rather than all persons convicted of a criminal offence or all persons sentenced to a prison term of at least three years? I note that in the UK legislation there is no \u201cblanket\u201d restriction imposed on all convicted persons. The UK legislation carefully differentiates between those detained in a penal institution and other convicted persons. At the same time, if we take as the reference group those sentenced to a prison term of at least three years, then the Italian legislation should be regarded as imposing a \u201cblanket\u201d restriction imposed on this category of persons. The notion of a \u201cblanket\u201d restriction seems to be useless as a tool for identifying \u201csuspicious\u201d restrictions on rights because of its relativity. If the Court means that the personal scope of a restriction was too broad, then it should say so clearly and explain why.",

                        "content": "Secondly, the Court lays emphasis on the need for individualisation of the punishment. In Hirst no. 2 the Court stressed that the restriction of electoral rights applied automatically to prisoners irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances. In Scoppola no. 3 the Court noted that \u201clegal provisions in Italy ... show the legislature\u2019s concern to adjust the application of the measure to the particular circumstances of the case at hand\u201d. It is difficult to agree with these two assessments, which seem to be contradicted by the content of the respective national legislation. In the United Kingdom, the deprivation of the right to vote coincides with the prison term. Its duration therefore varies according to the specific circumstances of each case. There is a therefore a very clear adjustment of the restriction to the specific circumstances of each case. In Italy, the duration of the restriction was determined in a very general way: it was either for five years or for life. Therefore, there was no adjustment at all to the circumstances of the case once disenfranchisement had to be applied. It is impossible to understand why this second system of restrictions is to be viewed as better protecting electoral rights. On this point, I agree with the critical remarks expressed in the dissenting opinion of the judge David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinnson in Scoppola no. 3.",

In that same judgment, the Court rightly recognized that \u201c[f]or a restrictive measure to comply with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, a lesser degree of individualisation may be sufficient, in contrast to situations concerning an alleged breach of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention\u201d (see \u017ddanoka, cited above, \u00a7 115). It concluded that \u201cthe Convention does not exclude a situation where the scope and conditions of a restrictive measure may be determined in detail by the legislature, leaving the courts of ordinary jurisdiction only with the task of verifying whether a particular individual belongs to the category or group covered by the statutory measure in issue. This is particularly so in matters relating to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\u201d (see \u017ddanoka, cited above, \u00a7 125).",

It contested the breadth of the restriction but no real explanation was given as to why the scope of the restriction was considered too broad. The Court refrained from carrying out a true proportionality test and, in particular, it abstained from balancing all the conflicting values. Moreover, an assessment of the proportionality of a criminal-law measure has to take into account the whole set of applicable punishments and all other legal consequences of a conviction.

Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch, 2nd edition, New Haven and London 1986, p. 16 et seq.). The issue is one of the most vividly discussed in constitutional law and political theory. For the purpose of the present opinion, it suffices to note briefly that the provision under consideration guarantees the right to vote in elections to the legislative bodies and to determine - through elections - legislative policies. The elected bodies should have broad legislative powers. Depriving the legislature of its legislative powers infringes the citizens\u2019 right protected by the provision in question. In this context, Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 is the explicit legal basis for the preservation of the margin of appreciation of the States in the implementation of the Convention. This doctrine protects first and foremost the freedom of choice of the people in the democratic decision-making processes and ensures a proper balance between the citizens\u2019 rights to political participation and other rights protected by the Convention and the Protocols thereto.

History teaches us that the parliamentary majority may be tempted to infringe the rights of different vulnerable groups. The right to elect a legislature with effective powers necessarily conflicts with other rights. At the same time, one has to bear in mind that unduly extended rights may erode the substance of the right protected under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. In disputes concerning the scope of Convention rights there should be a \u2013 rebuttable \u2013 presumption that questions on which two or more reasonable persons strongly disagree should be decided by democratic national legislatures rather than by courts, let alone international courts, unless there are serious reasons for a particularly thorough judicial review of the disputed measures.",
