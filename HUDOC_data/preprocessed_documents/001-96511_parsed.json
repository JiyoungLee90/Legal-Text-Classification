In that lawsuit the applicant clearly expressed his intention to seek redress for \u201c10 years of unlawful criminal prosecution\u201d. If the applicant\u2019s claim had not been thus formulated, it would have been for the judge of the domestic court to return the lawsuit to the applicant for rectification.

It followed that the applicant had had access to an effective domestic remedy not only in theory but also in practice within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention. The Government maintained that, taking into account the fact that the applicant\u2019s complaint regarding redress for the allegedly lengthy proceedings was still pending before the domestic courts, his complaints under Articles 6 \u00a7 1 and 13 of the Convention were to be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

(no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 141, ECHR 2006V). This rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 (with which it has a close affinity), that there is an effective domestic remedy available in respect of the alleged breach of an individual\u2019s Convention rights (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \n\u00a7 152, ECHR 2000-XI). Nevertheless, the only remedies which the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, inter alia, Vernillo v. France, 20 February 1991, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 198; Dalia v. France, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 38, Reports 1998-I; Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, ECHR 2002-VIII).",

They further argued that, due to the financial nature of the criminal acts with which the applicant had been charged, the case was complex. The charges against the applicant amounted to 40 counts of fraud, forgery and unlawfully obtaining the property of another. In addition, the case was voluminous; when transferred for trial, it had consisted of 6 volumes with more than 1,500 pages. As to what was at stake for the applicant, the Government noted that throughout the entire criminal proceedings the applicant had not been detained, but was only required not to leave his place of residence. Last but not least, the Government argued that, by submitting numerous unsubstantiated requests to the investigative authorities and the courts, the applicant himself had caused considerable delays to the criminal proceedings and, as a result, had benefitted from their length. In particular, given that under Lithuanian law a civil claim in criminal proceedings is to be resolved upon the adoption of the judgment convicting or acquitting the defendant, the extended length of the criminal proceedings allowed him to delay repayment of his loans. For the Government, the State authorities carried out a thorough examination of the circumstances of the case and acted with the required diligence and without unreasoned delays.",
