He added that it was invalid in the present case to argue that the legislation bore no relation to trade between two EC member States \u2013 especially as, in his opinion, factors of such nature were present \u2013 as justification for finding the provisions inapplicable, referring in this connection to the case-law of the Luxembourg court to the effect that since the fundamental freedoms enshrined in Community law extended in their application to the potential effects of legislation, they could not be considered inapplicable simply because the facts of the specific case were confined to a single member State (CJEC, C-321/94 to C-324/94). He went on to observe that \u201cnational measures capable of hindering or rendering less attractive the exercise of such fundamental freedoms\u201d were admissible only under certain conditions, in particular where they did not go beyond what was necessary to achieve the aim pursued. In the present case, firstly, Article 3 of Royal Decree no. 143 hindered and rendered less attractive the freedom of establishment, the free provision of services and the free movement of capital as regards the operation of clinical biology laboratories; secondly, the measure implemented was disproportionate to the aim pursued \u2013 to avoid over-consumption of clinical biology services \u2013 as that aim could be achieved by means that were less restrictive of freedoms.",

The preliminary question they had sought to have submitted had in fact concerned a different situation: not one where a court would have to re-examine or quash a decision that was incompatible with Community law but where it would take another decision based on the former, and thus breach Community law once again. Absent any Community case-law clarifying which of the above-mentioned principles had to take precedence in such a case, the Court of Cassation could not conclude that the application of Community law was so obvious that there was no reasonable doubt as to how the question should be resolved.

Firstly, the approach by the highest administrative court in this connection had been an isolated one, as the ordinary courts ruling in the present case had not called into question the applicability of those provisions. Secondly, the Conseil d\u2019Etat had failed to follow the position firmly established by its Auditeur, who had found them applicable. Thirdly, it had thus disregarded the guidelines that the Court of Justice of the European Communities had itself given at a colloquium of the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions (sic) of the European Union, held in Helsinki on 20 and 21 May 2002, to the effect that the notion of \u201cpurely internal situation\u201d should be interpreted very narrowly, that the effects of the preliminary reference procedure should be broadened and that the full scope of Community law should be guaranteed. Fourthly, in assuming that Article\u00a03 of Royal Decree no. 143 did not apply in the same manner to Belgian nationals and other Community nationals, the Conseil d\u2019Etat had taken it for granted that the legislature had decided to create reverse discrimination, whereas that had not been its intention.

Whereas the Luxembourg court traditionally considered that Community law could not be applied in a dispute on the merits that was devoid of any extraneous factors, a \u201cpurely internal\u201d situation being one \u201cwhich did not comprise any elements linking it to the scope of Community law\u201d, it had acknowledged in its Pistre and Others judgment of 7 May 1997 (C-321/94 to C-324/94) that it was possible to apply the rules of free movement of goods even to situations that were apparently purely internal, in so far as the national measure at issue was discriminatory and hindered, at least potentially, intra-Community trade: the test as to whether there was a link to Community law thus included any potential effect of the legislation at issue. (In the applicants\u2019 submission, the rejection by the Conseil d\u2019Etat of their preliminary reference request on the ground that the Pistre judgment concerned the free movement of goods and not, as in the present case, free establishment and the free circulation of services and capital, was devoid of justification.) The Court of Justice had subsequently, in the Guimont judgment of 5 December 2000 (C-448/98), confirmed the application of the Pistre case-law to national rules that were applicable \u201cwithout distinction\u201d, and had then extended that reasoning to the free movement of capital (see Reisch, 5 March 2002, C-515/99) and to the free movement of services (see a number of judgments delivered in 2005 and 2006: C-250/03, C-451/03, C-94/04 and C-202/04). Therefore, according to the applicants, under Community law as it stood, whenever national rules were applicable to Community nationals they created a situation which was not purely internal, and this was the case for Article 3 of Royal Decree no. 143, since it hindered the establishment in Belgium of anyone wishing to run a clinical biology laboratory. Moreover, nothing in the wording of that decree suggested that its application was confined to situations involving Belgians alone; neither did the law of 2005 amending the decree make any such distinction between Belgian and foreign nationals.",

In dismissing that argument, the Conseil d\u2019Etat had merely mentioned factors that had no relevance for the application of that notion (the fact the legislation did not itself designate the accredited laboratories, that the accreditation was not reserved for a limited number of laboratories, and that it could be obtained by any laboratory meeting the requisite conditions), and had not even begun to analyse what the notion specifically entailed. Under Community law, the factors to be taken into account in order to determine the existence of an exclusive or special right consisted in the granting of an advantage to certain undertakings that rendered the activity difficult to carry on for others, and in the creation, through a State-initiated measure, of hindrance to market access, in a non-transparent, discriminatory and disproportionate context.
