The right of access, namely the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect of this \u201cright to a court\u201d (see, notably, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7\u00a7 28-36, Series A no. 18). For the right of access to be effective, an individual must have a clear, practical opportunity to challenge an act interfering with his or her rights (see, for example, Bellet v. , 4 December 1995, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 333B). However, this right is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations. These are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. In this respect, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention's requirements rests with the Court. However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce the access left to an individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see, for example, Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 93).",

Therefore, the draft mutual agreement by which the applicant's employer wanted to terminate his employment (see paragraph 5 above) could by no means be considered to constitute such an act. This was clearly admitted by the  in the case of the applicant's colleague (see paragraph 15 above) and by the Government in their observations.
