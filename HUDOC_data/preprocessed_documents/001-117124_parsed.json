Secondly, in the receipt of 19 May 1997 it was not specified whether the money had been borrowed for the needs of the DPRK Embassy or for the personal needs of the Trade Counsellor. The Government observed that it was very rare for a foreign State to borrow money from a private party. Thirdly, the interest for failure to repay the loan in due time was extremely high. The Government also pointed out that the text of the receipt contained numerous spelling mistakes which cast doubt on its authenticity and that it was very difficult to establish whether the letterhead and the stamp were authentic. Lastly, the Government noted that the applicant had applied to the courts six years after the alleged failure to repay the debt \u2013 after the expiry of the three-year statutory time-limit.

He stated that the DPRK Trade Counsellor had offered to pledge the car, which had been manufactured in 1970. However, it had been impossible to perfect the pledge, as under Article 339 of the Civil Code a pledge agreement to secure performance under a different contract is subject to notarial certification. Therefore, the pledge had been null and void and the applicant had never received the car in question.
