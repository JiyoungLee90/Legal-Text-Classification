The Administrative Court relied on those (new) arguments raised by the Municipal Office and even incorporated them in its judgment of 6\u00a0May 2009 dismissing the applicant\u2019s action.

While accepting that argument, the Court, however, notes that the date of lodging the applicant\u2019s claim was not the sole reason for dismissing her administrative complaint. Namely, the Administrative Court put forward additional arguments leading to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s claim before the national authorities was unfounded, thus examining the merits of it (see paragraph 17 above). Furthermore, the Court notes that it must continue the examination of the application even in the absence of any significant disadvantage suffered by the applicant, if respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto so requires or if the case has not been duly considered by a domestic tribunal.

Czech Republic (dec.), no. , 14 December 2010). However, the present case has to be distinguished from Holub, as in that case the domestic authorities did not raise new arguments in their observations. As described in paragraph 49 above, in the present case not only did the Municipal Office raise new arguments in their observations, but the Administrative Court relied on those arguments when rendering its judgment. In this connection, the Court cannot assess the validity of arguments which the applicant had no opportunity to present. It simply notes that the applicant could have reasonably argued in favour of the application of section 383(a) of the State Administration Act to her case (see \u010cepek v. the Czech Republic, no. 9815/10, \u00a7 58, 5 September 2013). Although these arguments would be irrelevant for the outcome of the present case, as the applicant\u2019s claim was in any event time-barred, such practice on the part of the Administrative Court raises a serious issue as regards the principle of equality of arms, enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
