The Court has no reason to doubt that the late applicant and his wife were in a sufficiently close relationship. Accordingly, the Court finds that Mrs Andrushchenko\u00a0has standing to continue the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s stead (see Dalban v.

Even accepting that the text of the impugned articles might have reasonably been perceived as attaining the level of a sufficiently specific risk of violence against individual members of the jury, the material evidence of the impugned offence had already been established in the text of the articles. There is no indication that the applicant actually attempted any assault against those jurors between 2006 and November 2007. In the absence of any reasonable suspicion, he was never charged with any related offence. In any event, as noted by the remand judge, the investigation did not find it opportune to interview any of the jurors between November 2007 and late January 2008.",

Thus, it is appropriate to examine this case in the light of the principles applicable to the protection afforded to the press (see Riolo v. Italy, no. 42211/07, \u00a7\u00a063, 17\u00a0July 2008; T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g a Szabads\u00e1gjogok\u00e9rt v. Hungary, no. 37374/05, \u00a7\u00a027, 14 April 2009; and Butkevich v.

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others, its task is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest. The vital role of the media in facilitating and fostering the public\u2019s right to receive and impart information and ideas has been repeatedly recognised by the Court. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role as \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (see Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 125-26).",

Being a part of the security forces of the State, the police should display a particularly high degree of tolerance to offensive speech, unless such inflammatory speech is likely to provoke imminent unlawful actions in respect of their personnel and to expose them to a real risk of physical violence. It has only been in a very sensitive context of tension, armed conflict and the fight against terrorism or deadly prison riots that the Court has found that the relevant statements were likely to encourage violence capable of putting members of security forces at risk and thus accepted that an interference with such statements was justified (ibid.).",

Seen in this perspective, the statements in question can be understood as a scathing criticism of the current state of affairs in the Russian police (see, in this connection, paragraph 25 above for the findings made in the specialist report adduced by the defence in the domestic proceedings). The phrases used by the applicant amounted to provocative metaphors, which affirmed his emotional appeal for measures to be taken with a view to improving the situation as regards the free exercise of the right of freedom of peaceful assembly and as regards the use of physical force against demonstrators.",

At the same time, the domestic courts failed to explain why that group, in their view, needed enhanced protection; nor did they refer to any factors or context which would show that the applicant\u2019s article could have actually encouraged such a form of \u201cenmity\u201d as physical violence and thus put that group, or any of its members, at risk. In the absence of any such explanation in the domestic courts\u2019 decision or any other evidence which would enable it to conclude otherwise, the Court is not convinced that the applicant\u2019s article was likely to encourage violence capable of putting Russian law enforcement officers at risk. It is noted in this connection that, while the article was disseminated in March 2007, it was only in March 2008 that the authorities considered that it might have had or might have harmful consequences (see paragraph 20 above; compare Erbakan v. Turkey, no. 59405/00, \u00a7 68, 6 July 2006).",

It was also essential for the assessment of a potential influence of a publication to determine the scope of its actual reach to the public. The applicant\u2019s article was published in a newspaper with a distribution figure of 50,000 within the city of St Petersburg and the Leningrad region. While mentioning this fact when describing the offence, and also that the newspaper was freely available for sale, the domestic courts did not draw any further conclusions from that fact as regards the applicant\u2019s guilt, in particular as regards the alleged stirring of enmity or hatred toward law enforcement officers.",

In the present case, although the wording of the impugned statements was such as to \u201coffend, shock or disturb\u201d, it cannot be seen as stirring up base emotions or embedded prejudices in relation to members of a vulnerable social group, as the group in question were \u2013 according to the national courts \u2013 Russian law enforcement officers.

Moreover, although sentencing is in principle a matter for the national courts, the imposition of a prison sentence for an offence in the area of a debate on an issue of legitimate public interest will be compatible with freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been seriously impaired, as, for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see\u00a0Otegi Mondragon v.
