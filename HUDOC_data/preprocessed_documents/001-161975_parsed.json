The overall aim of the operation at 21 Scotia Road was to establish whether the suspects were present in the apartment and to arrest them safely if they came out. Commander McDowall\u2019s strategy for this operation was not recorded; however, it would appear to have been to oversee the premises at Scotia Road through covert surveillance, to follow persons leaving the premises until it was felt safe to challenge them, and then to stop them. In order to implement this strategy, his plan was that a surveillance team from SO12 (Special Branch) should be in attendance at Scotia Road. They were to be supported by a unit from SO19, the Specialist Crime & Operations branch of the MPS. The unit from SO19 consisted of highly trained Special Firearms Officers (\u201cSFOs\u201d) who were usually deployed on pre-planned operations. Although some surveillance officers were armed for their own protection and that of the public, their training did not enable them to be used as a resource to arrest armed suspects. SO19 would normally undertake this task, although armed officers from SO12 could be used for this purpose as a last resort.",

Upon arrival they received a further briefing from DCI C, which commenced at 8.50 a.m. The briefing was not recorded, but it appears that DCI C confirmed the terrorists had the capacity to attach a device to themselves that would be difficult to detect. He described the individuals involved in the bombings as being \u201cdeadly and determined\u201d and \u201cup for it\u201d. The CPS later criticised this briefing as unbalanced, as DCI C had failed to caution the SFOs that not everyone they would stop leaving Scotia Road would be a suicide bomber and that they should not overreact in the heat of the moment.",

The policy, which is described at paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4, was, in essence, one of containment, stop and arrest. What occurred between 07:15hrs and 10:06hrs was a failure of that policy. Between 07:15hrs and 09:33hrs there was no adequate effort to put in place police resources at SCOTIA ROAD that would have enabled the Metropolitan Police to give effect to the policy.

I also considered their explanations of Jean Charles\u2019s movements when they approached him, to see if there was evidence that they had fabricated those accounts to justify their actions. Both refer to Jean Charles getting up and advancing towards them with his hands down by his side before he was tackled by a surveillance officer and forced back into the seat. The [SFOs] then shot Jean Charles. I had to consider whether the prosecution could argue that the restraint meant that no bomb could be detonated and that the firearms officers\u2019 actions were unlawful.

Bringing prosecutions which were likely to fail, even if they could survive a dismissal application and a submission of no case to answer, would have profound consequences for all parties concerned.

As it happens, the nearest bus stop was on Upper Tulse Hill, only a few minutes\u2019 walk from the block. The first obstacle [to this] argument is the difficulty of constructing a positive duty of care at that stage to stop Mr de Menezes close to his home. In my judgment, no such duty could exist. Even if it could, I consider that it would not have been practicable to implement this as a fixed and inflexible tactical plan... In any event, the surveillance control was good: Mr de Menezes was kept continually under surveillance but the covert status of the operation near Scotia Road was maintained. The failure to stop him at an earlier stage was based on an inability of officers to say whether he was identifiable with the suspect. Therefore, his death was not caused by any failure of surveillance control at Scotia Road.",

If there were such a duty, it would only be to keep oneself reasonably well-informed, since it would not be practicable to keep note of the precise position of every officer and car. The thrust of the evidence is that [the DSO] did keep herself reasonably well-informed. She was aware, through the surveillance monitor in the control room, that surveillance officers were following Mr de Menezes and of what they were saying. In any event, as [counsel for the family of Mr de Menezes] accepts, nothing could have been done to stop Mr de Menezes between his getting on the bus at Tulse Hill and his alighting at Stockwell. [The DSO] had [the SFOs] at the proper holding point at the time she wanted to deploy them. In the minutes before she ordered the intervention, she was relying upon information from [her tactical adviser] as to the position and readiness of the [SFOs]. In my judgment, she was entitled to rely upon that information. In all those circumstances, any failure on her part to keep herself informed was not causative of the fatal events in the carriage.",

In my judgment, she probably did owe a duty of care to him at this stage in making decisions and giving directions for an armed stop. However, she cannot fairly be said to have breached that duty. When she became aware that the subject of surveillance had left the bus, she ordered the [SFOs] to perform an armed stop. Upon hearing that they were not in a position to make the stop, she instructed the surveillance officers to do so. That order cannot be characterised as negligent. If there were any slight delay in giving the order, that can probably be explained by the need to take thought before ordering a suspected suicide bomber to be stopped by officers who were not trained for such situations. Once she was told that the [SFOs] were in position, she countermanded the earlier order. It might be possible to say that she made the wrong decision at that point, given where Mr de Menezes was known to be, but these were fast-moving events and her decision cannot be described as negligent. [It was submitted] that using [SFOs] gave rise to a particular risk that lethal force would be used.

HM Coroner for Inner South London ([2006] HRLR 22) the Administrative Court was called upon to consider the compatibility of the law of self-defence in the United Kingdom with Article\u00a02 of the Convention. A police officer had shot and killed Mr\u00a0Bennett, who was, at the time, brandishing a cigarette lighter shaped like a pistol (for further details, see Bennett v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a05527/08, 7 December 2010). At the inquest which followed, the coroner refused to leave the verdict of unlawful killing to the jury. In her summing-up to the jury, she indicated that lawful killing could only occur if the evidence showed that it was probable the deceased died by the deliberate application of force against him and the person causing the injuries had used reasonable force in self-defence or defence of another, even if that force was by its nature or the manner of its application likely to be fatal. In determining whether it was self-defence or defence of another, the coroner directed the jury that the first question to be answered was whether the individual believed, or may have honestly believed, that it was necessary to defend himself or another, having regard to the circumstances which he honestly believed to exist, although the reasonableness of the belief was somewhat relevant because, if the belief on the facts was unreasonable, it might be difficult to decide that it was honestly held. The second question, which arose if the first question was answered favourably to the individual, was whether the force used was reasonable having regard to the circumstances which were believed to exist.",

To kill when it is not absolutely necessary to do so is surely to act unreasonably. Thus, the reasonableness test does not in truth differ from the Article 2 test as applied in McCann [and Others]. There is no support for the submission that the court has with hindsight to decide whether there was in fact absolute necessity.

But, as the decided cases also make clear, the power of review is one to be sparingly exercised. The reasons for this are clear. The primary decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is entrusted by Parliament to the [DPP] as head of an independent, professional prosecuting service, answerable to the Attorney General in his role as guardian of the public interest, and to no-one else. It makes no difference that in practice the decision will ordinarily be taken by a senior member of the CPS, as it was here, and not by the [DPP] personally. In any borderline case the decision may be one of acute difficulty, since while a defendant whom a jury would be likely to convict should properly be brought to justice and tried, a defendant whom a jury would be likely to acquit should not be subjected to the trauma inherent in a criminal trial. If, in a case such as the present, the [DPP\u2019s] provisional decision is not to prosecute, the decision will be subject to review by senior Treasury counsel who will exercise an independent professional judgment. The [DPP] and his officials ... will bring to their task of deciding whether to prosecute an experience and expertise which most courts called upon to review their decisions could not match. In most cases the decision will turn not on an analysis of the relevant legal principles but on the exercise of an informed judgment of how a case against a particular defendant, if brought, would be likely to fare in the context of a criminal trial before (in a serious case such as this) a jury. This exercise of judgment involves an assessment of the strength, by the end of the trial, of the evidence against the defendant and of the likely defences. It will often be impossible to stigmatise a judgment as wrong even if one disagrees with it. So the courts will not easily find that a decision not to prosecute is bad in law, on which basis alone the court is entitled to interfere. At the same time, the standard of review should not be set too high, since judicial review is the only means by which the citizen can seek redress against a decision not to prosecute and if the test were too exacting an effective remedy would be denied. ...\u201d",

If the answer is \u2018yes\u2019, before deciding to prosecute the prosecutor will ask whether the public interest favours a prosecution or if there is any public interest reason not to prosecute.\u201d In Cyprus, even if there is sufficient evidence to pursue a prosecution, there is no legal obligation to do so.",

Cases such as McCann and Others, cited above, indicated that it might be simplistic to attribute an Article 2 breach to the individuals who directly caused the death, especially in a case such as the present where the death resulted from failures in the overall system. In such cases, it would be inaccurate and unfair to ascribe blame to the individuals who happened to form the last link in the chain.

The State must therefore ensure, by all means at its disposal, an adequate response \u2013 judicial or otherwise \u2013 so that the legislative and administrative framework set up to protect the right to life is properly implemented and any breaches of that right are repressed and punished (see Zavoloka v.

Although the failure to comply with such obligation may have consequences for the right protected under Article 13, the procedural obligation of Article 2 is seen as a distinct obligation (see \u0130lhan v.

This conclusion derives from the fact that the Court has consistently examined the question of procedural obligations separately from the question of compliance with the substantive obligation (and, where appropriate, has found a separate violation of Article\u00a02 on that account) and the fact that on several occasions a breach of a procedural obligation under Article 2 has been alleged in the absence of any complaint as to its substantive aspect (see \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015859).",

The authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of the clinical findings, including the cause of death (as regards autopsies, see, for example, Salman v.

Turkey, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 87, Reports 1998-I).

Turkey, no. 8656/10, \u00a7 59, 14 January 2014; A. v. Croatia, no. 55164/08, \u00a7\u00a066, 14 October 2010; and Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v.

It is, however, apparent both from the application of the stated test to the particular facts in McCann and Others itself and from the Court\u2019s post McCann and Others case-law that the existence of \u201cgood reasons\u201d should be determined subjectively. In a number of cases the Court has expressly stated that, as it is detached from the events in issue, it cannot substitute its own assessment of the situation for that of an officer who was required to react in the heat of the moment to avert an honestly perceived danger to his life or the lives of others; rather, it must consider the events from the viewpoint of the person(s) acting in self-defence at the time of those events (see, for example, Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a020196/99, \u00a7 139, ECHR 2005-II, and Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 179 and 188). Consequently, in those Article 2 cases in which the Court specifically addressed the question of whether a belief was perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time, it did not adopt the standpoint of a detached observer; instead, it attempted to put itself into the position of the person who used lethal force, both in determining whether that person had the requisite belief and in assessing the necessity of the degree of force used (see, for example, Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, ECHR 2004XI; Ol\u00e1h v. Hungary (dec.), no. 56558/00, 14 September 2004; and Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7 189).",

The Court was not, therefore, called upon to consider the compatibility of domestic law with the requirement that an honest belief be perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time.

While it is true that there are not frequent prosecutions for police killings in the United Kingdom (as submitted by the third-party intervener at paragraph\u00a0228 above), this can be explained by the extremely restrictive policy on the use of firearms by State agents (see paragraph 221 above). As the Government have pointed out, between 2003/04 and 2012/13, the annual number of police operations resulting in the discharge of weapons has always been in single figures, even though the annual number of operations in which the use of weapons has been authorised has ranged from ten thousand to twenty thousand (see paragraph 221 above).",

Indeed, on the facts of the present case the contrary is so, given that the self-same test was used by the coroner, an independent judicial officer, in deciding whether to leave a verdict of unlawful killing to the jury and, after hearing seventy-one witnesses, he concluded that the test was not satisfied in relation to any of the individual police officers concerned (see paragraphs 103-27 above). That being said, even if individual prosecutions had been possible had the threshold evidential test been the Galbraith test, it would not follow that the threshold in England and Wales was so high as to be in breach of Article 2.",

The Court further noted that it was not its role to micro-manage the functioning of, and procedures applied in, criminal investigative and justice systems in Contracting States which may well vary in their approach and policies. Likewise, in Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 (cited above, \u00a7 233), the Court held that while the intervention of a court or a judge enjoying sufficient statutory safeguards of independence was a supplementary element enabling the independence of the investigation as a whole to be guaranteed, it was not in itself an absolute requirement.",

In twelve countries, the decision of the prosecutor may only be contested before such a hierarchical superior (see paragraph 181 above).

As soon as it was confirmed that Mr\u00a0de\u00a0Menezes had not been involved in the attempted attack on 21 July 2005, the MPS publicly accepted that he had been killed in error by SFOs. A representative of the MPS flew to Brazil to apologise to his family face-to-face and to make an ex gratia payment to cover their financial needs. They were further advised to seek independent legal advice and assured that any legal costs would be met by the MPS. The individual responsibility of the police officers involved and the institutional responsibility of the OCPM were subsequently considered in depth by the IPCC, the CPS, the criminal court and the coroner and jury during the inquest. Later, when his family brought a civil claim for damages, the MPS agreed to a settlement with an undisclosed sum being paid in compensation.",

Indeed, in McCann and Others the Court implicitly recognised that in complex police operations failings could be institutional, individual or both. In the present case, both the institutional responsibility of the police and the individual responsibility of all the relevant officers were considered in depth by the IPCC, the CPS, the criminal court, the coroner and the inquest jury. The decision to prosecute the OCPM as an employer of police officers did not have the consequence, either in law or in practice, of excluding the prosecution of individual police officers as well. Neither was the decision not to prosecute any individual officer due to any failings in the investigation or the State\u2019s tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts; rather, it was due to the fact that, following a thorough investigation, a prosecutor considered all the facts of the case and concluded that there was insufficient evidence against any individual officer to meet the threshold evidential test in respect of any criminal offence. Nevertheless, institutional and operational failings were identified and detailed recommendations were made to ensure that the mistakes leading to the death of Mr de Menezes were not repeated. In its Review Note the CPS clearly stated that Operation THESEUS 2 had been badly handled from the moment it passed from Commander McDowall to Commander Dick; that a lack of planning had led to the death of Jean Charles de Menezes; and that the institutional and operational failures were \u201cserious, avoidable, and led to the death of an innocent man\u201d.",

Substantive criminal law, by defining specific offences, indicates the exact purpose of an investigation into a person\u2019s death and in particular determines the specific issues which have to be investigated. Therefore, the quality of the investigation depends first and foremost on the quality of substantive law. An investigation will be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible only if there are adequate provisions of substantive criminal law. Defective provisions of substantive law can render the investigation ineffective from the perspective of Article\u00a02. In particular, if national provisions of criminal law concerning the use of force by the police do not comply with the Convention standards, the authorities will not be able to investigate whether the use of lethal force by the police was absolutely necessary under Article 2 of the Convention.

At the same time, in our view, Article 2 of the Convention requires the State to criminalise putative self-defence in so far as the factual error was not justified in the circumstances and the perpetrator may therefore legitimately be reproached for it. If acts of killing in putative self-defence based on an unjustified error are not properly criminalised and punished under domestic law, there is a serious danger that the police may use excessive force with lethal effect.",

Acts committed in putative self-defence may be exempted from criminal liability if these two conditions are met jointly. However, in the instant case the majority seem to reinterpret the existing case-law by putting the emphasis on the subjective element and by diminishing the importance of the objective element.

Therefore, the investigation in the instant case had to answer the question whether the police officers involved honestly and genuinely believed that Mr de Menezes was about to detonate a bomb. However, the crucial question which should have been investigated and answered in the instant case was whether the police officers\u2019 belief that a bomb was about to be detonated was justified in the circumstances. The investigation should have established whether the error of each officer involved, including those who directed the whole operation, was justified. Furthermore, the reasonableness of this belief should have been assessed in the context of the police\u2019s duty to exercise the utmost care in preparing operations which may potentially entail the use of lethal force. Because of the content of the relevant substantive law, in the circumstances of the instant case the investigation did not focus on these crucial questions. Therefore, in the circumstances of the case, the use of force by the police officers concerned was not adequately investigated and the investigation was not able to lead to the punishment of those involved in using such force.

It was the duty of the police to devise a realistic plan of action which made it possible to arrest the suspect without using lethal force. It appears that Mr de Menezes could and should have been arrested by the police just after leaving his home. It was the fact that the police officers waited until he entered the underground which caused the situation entailing a putative threat to the lives of a large number of people. In other words, the putative danger arose because of the delay in the reaction by the police. This factor is also of primary importance for establishing personal criminal liability on the part of the individuals involved. Even assuming that Mr de Menezes really was carrying a bomb, the delayed reaction of the police officers could not be considered absolutely necessary, because it appears that the suspect could have been apprehended much earlier.

The majority refer in the reasoning to an interesting comparative-law report on this issue (see paragraphs 176 and 269 of the present judgment). We note in this connection that the analysis of comparative-law data leads to the conclusion that the test applied under English law for prosecution is clearly more stringent than in other States Parties to the Convention. Such a stringent test may prevent the prosecution and conviction of a person who has committed an offence if the prospects of success are not correctly assessed by the prosecutor. There is a serious risk that borderline cases will escape independent judicial assessment. As a result, certain acts involving excessive use of force by the police may be covered by a de facto immunity from prosecution. In our view, for the sake of efficient protection of the right to life, if there are serious doubts concerning the legitimacy of lethal force used by the police in actual or putative self-defence, the final decision on the question of criminal liability should be left to the courts.",

The IPCC\u2019s report acknowledging serious deficiencies in the police operation and the judgment finding the OCPM criminally responsible clearly provided a reasonable basis for investigating possible individual responsibilities for those organisational deficiencies, since organisations do not act independently of their members.",

Independence in itself is not enough to guarantee the existence of an effective investigation. In this case, what is missing are all of the other guarantees deriving from judicial proceedings in which evidence is publicly examined, with the intervention of all the affected parties, so that responsibilities may be ascertained accordingly. This was what the applicant sought when she asked the DPP to review the previous decision not to prosecute: to ensure the conduct of judicial proceedings with all the appropriate procedural guarantees, which go further than the independence of an administrative investigating body.",

The question for our Court was not to rule whether the Manning test conformed to Convention requirements in the abstract, but rather whether the application of that test in this specific case represented a failure to comply with the procedural obligations under Article 2 of the Convention \u2013 that is, whether the CPS\u2019s decision to refrain from bringing criminal proceedings against the individuals involved in the operation disregarded those obligations.",

The responsibility of those two officers is not, however, the only or even the main question in the case, which relates to the responsibilities of all those involved in the police operation and the deficiencies in its planning and execution. Even admitting that there was a subjective perception of grave danger, justifying an honest belief in a situation of legitimate self-defence on the part of the two SFOs, the fundamental question remains concerning the responsibility of the other participants in the operation \u2013 that is, whether the SFOs\u2019 fatal subjective perception was the result of the previous actions or omissions of other individuals, and of the erroneous or deficient instructions they had received as a result of the mismanagement of a serious incident in which human lives were at stake, and in which the SFOs\u2019 briefing had indicated from the outset that \u201ca critical shot could be taken\u201d (see paragraph 26 of the present judgment).",
