He was suspected of having evaded taxes of up to 500 million Austrian Schillings (more than 36 million euros). The article stated that News was in the possession of numerous documents (letters from Mr G.'s lawyers, a court file from Luxembourg, costs calculations and lists of clients of the G. company, etc.) concerning this suspicion which it claimed to have obtained through its own intense research. The most important documents were letters from Mr G.'s lawyers from which it followed that an attempt to murder Mr G. had taken place in  in 1999, which had not come to the attention of the Austrian authorities or of the media at the time. The attempt had possibly been made at the instigation of one of Mr G.'s business partners who, according to his lawyer, had acted as a trustee for him. The article then assumed that the attempt was somehow linked to Mr G.'s network of companies which had been scrutinised by the tax authorities. It quoted an anonymous tax official as saying that according to the investigations dubious companies with a seat abroad had issued invoices for \u201corganisational services\u201d to the G. company in order to reduce its gains in . Still according to that tax official the complex structure of interrelated companies had been chosen to dissimulate the fact that Mr G. was their owner and to avoid the legal consequences of that fact. The article finally said that Mr G. also had close links with the Austrian Freedom Party (Freiheitliche Partei \u00d6sterreichs), of which it gave a few examples, and that thus, the case also had a political dimension.",

The court noted that the applicant was a business magnate. His enterprise was the market leader in equipping police forces with pistols. Although the claimant was well-known in professional circles he was not known to the public at large and his picture had only been published in arms producers' magazines so far. Nevertheless, the subject-matter, namely tax evasion proceedings pending against an industrial magnate whose enterprise was well-known and prestigious in , was of public interest. Referring to Section 7a \u00a7 2 (2) of the Media Act, the court considered that the public interest in receiving such information outweighed the claimant's interest in the protection of his identity. The court concluded that reporting on this topic and publishing the claimant's picture was in principle allowed, as long as it did not violate his right to be presumed innocent (Section 7b of the Media Act) as was the case for the passage of the article quoting the tax official which described the suspicion against Mr\u00a0G. as if it were already proven.",

Thus, there was no public interest in receiving such information together with the picture of the suspect, irrespective of the manner in which the applicant had obtained the information. Even if the applicant had managed to obtain information on the tax evasion proceedings without inciting officials to breach the fiscal secret, the information was meant to be secret and there was no legitimate public interest in receiving it.",

The questions the Court had to answer was exclusively whether the prohibition imposed by the Austrian Supreme Court on the newspaper's use of photos of Mr G (which identified him clearly) to accompany the relevant report (the content of which was uncontested) constituted a violation of Article 10, or whether that prohibition was necessary in order to protect the individual's private life (Article 8).",

That right, covered by Article 10, may extend to aspects of the private life of public figures, particularly where politicians are concerned (see Editions Plon v. , no. 58148/00, ECHR 2004IV) and may include the publication of photographs of the person concerned (see Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7 59).

In fact, Mr G. is the manager of a rather well-known company producing pistols. Does this profession really make him a \u201cpublic figure\u201d? He is known to be a rather shy individual, shunning publicity. As a person he is not known to the public at large. His picture (until the publication of the article by NEWS) had only been printed in specialised arms-manufacturing magazines. In the Austrian court files (in all three instances) he was continually described as an \u201cindustrialist\u201d (Industrieller). The present judgment however has promoted him from \u201cmanaging director of a well-known enterprise producing pistols\u201d (see paragraph 8) to a \u201cbusiness magnate who owns and manages one of the country's most prestigious enterprises\u201d (see paragraph 36), and for that reason concludes that \u201cby his very position in society [he is] a public figure\u201d. In point of fact however Mr\u00a0G. seems to be quite the opposite of a \u201cpublic figure\u201d, as public figures, most of all politicians, must somehow be actively involved in what is commonly called \u201cpublic affairs\u201d, whereas Mr G. seemingly is not (see also the critique by the Court of attempts to describe a person as such as a \u201cfigure of contemporary society \u201cpar excellence\u201d in Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7 72). Finally, it would be fallacious to argue that as a consequence of a reference in a particular newspaper article Mr G. automatically became, and now is, a \u201cpublic figure\u201d.",
