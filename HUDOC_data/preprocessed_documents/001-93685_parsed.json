He stated in this regard that the first-instance court had convicted him without ever hearing him or the prosecutor\u2019s witnesses.

In addition, the applicant maintained that in his case the first-instance court had arbitrarily failed to apply Article 59 of the Criminal Code and that he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer since the Court of Cassation had failed, without reason, to examine the objections submitted by his legal representative.",

However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, a waiver of the right to take part in the trial must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Poitrimol v. France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 277A). Furthermore, it must not run counter to any important public interest (see H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v.

The Court points out that the fact that the applicant raised no objection when the rogatory court took his statement does not signify that he implicitly waived his right to defend himself or to appear before the Izmir State Security Court (see, for example, Kahraman v. Turkey, no. 42104/02, \u00a7 31, 26\u00a0April 2007). Moreover, having regard to the fact that the applicant was not assisted by a lawyer at that hearing and that the rogatory court neither read out his rights, including his right to a lawyer, nor provided information to the applicant regarding the consequences of such a request, the Court considers that the applicant, as a layman, cannot have been expected to appreciate that such a demand would result in his being tried and convicted in his absence. Thus, the circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s decision deprived it of any validity from the point of view of the Convention. In such circumstances, it cannot be said, therefore, that the applicant unequivocally and intentionally waived his rights under Article 6 (see Jones, cited above, and, mutatis mutandis, Pfeifer and Plankl v. Austria, 25 February 1992, \u00a7 38, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0227).",

Belgium, 17 January 1970, \u00a7 25 in fine, Series\u00a0A no. 11), Article 6 of the Convention imposes on every national court an obligation to check whether the defendant has had the opportunity to apprise himself of and participate in the proceedings against him where, as in the instant case, this is disputed on a ground that does not immediately appear to be manifestly devoid of merit (see, mutatis mutandis, Somogyi v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a067972/01, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2004IV). While it is not fully clear from the judgment of the court whether the Court of Cassation only examined the grounds of appeal submitted by the applicant and disregarded those submitted by his legal representative, the Court does not find any indication from the judgment that any scrutiny was exercised by that court, on its own motion pursuant to Article 320 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to determine whether the applicant had unequivocally waived the right to appear at his trial or whether he had been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses against him. In this connection the Court reiterates that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article\u00a06 (see Sadak and Others v. Turkey, nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2001VIII). This is even more so when the witnesses whose testimonies on which the conviction was based have not appeared or given evidence before the trial court which convicted the applicant. In such circumstances the Court is not convinced that the subsequent appeal proceedings remedied the fact that the proceedings before the firstinstance had taken place in the applicant\u2019s absence despite the fact that it had not been established that he had waived his right to appear and to defend himself or that he intended to escape trial.",
