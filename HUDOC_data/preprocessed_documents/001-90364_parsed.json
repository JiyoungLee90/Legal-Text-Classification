However, even assuming that the initial depositions by Mr\u00a0N.L. had provided a basis, among other sources of evidence, for the applicant\u2019s conviction, the use of these depositions was not unfair. In particular, before resorting to the depositions in question as a means of establishing the facts, the authorities had reasonably attempted to locate Mr\u00a0N.L. and bring him before the court. As these attempts had been unsuccessful, the trial court had first consulted with the parties as to whether it was feasible to start the trial in Mr\u00a0N.L.\u2019s absence and, subsequently, whether they had any objections to the examination of his earlier statements. The defence had never objected to these proposals. After all, Mr\u00a0N.L.\u2019s depositions had been read out at a public hearing and the applicant had had every opportunity to challenge them.",

In his cassation appeal, the applicant maintained that save for Mr\u00a0N.L.\u2019s depositions and in the light of other available evidence, the allegation of his pecuniary agreement with Mr\u00a0N.L., the actual payment and the amounts referred to, remained mere speculation.

Malta (dec.), no. 51760/99, 16\u00a0March\u00a02000). On the other hand, the reliability of evidence would be compromised where it was obtained in breach of the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without recourse to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see, inter alia, Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17\u00a0December 1996, \u00a7\u00a068, Reports\u00a01996-VI, and Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100).
