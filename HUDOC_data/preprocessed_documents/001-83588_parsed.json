Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see Akdivar and Others v.

This rule is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard not only to the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the State concerned, but also to the general legal and political context in which they operate, as well as the particular circumstances of the individual case. This means, inter alia, that the Court must examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust available domestic remedies (see Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, \u00a7 67, 28\u00a0March 2006, and Ivanov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), no. 34070/03, 15 February 2007).",

The authorities were thereby made sufficiently aware of the applicant's situation and had an opportunity to offer redress as appropriate (compare with Melnik, cited above, \u00a7 70). Moreover, in so far as it can be discerned from the Government's submissions, they contended that instituting a civil action in the domestic courts was capable of providing adequate redress for the alleged violation in the present case. Although the Court has found previously that a civil action was a remedy theoretically available in Azerbaijan in respect of conditions of detention (see, for example, Mammadov (Jalaloglu) v. Azerbaijan, no. 34445/04, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52, 11\u00a0January 2007, and Kunqurova v. Azerbaijan (dec.), no. 5117/03, 3 June 2005), the applicant's present complaint does not concern the conditions of detention in general, but concerns specifically the lack of adequate medical treatment. However, assuming for the purposes of the present complaint that the civil action was a remedy theoretically applicable to the applicant in respect of his specific complaint, the Court considers, for the following reasons, that he should be deemed to have exhausted it in the practical circumstances of his individual case.",

The applicant's complaint was rejected several times for various formalistic reasons and on 7 May 2004 was remitted for examination to the Sabail District Court, the same court to which the applicant had initially, and properly, submitted his complaint.

More specifically, he topped the Council of Europe's list of \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and, as such, his case was on the international political agenda of the Government for several years. Therefore, the Azerbaijani authorities and courts including the judges of the Sabail District Court were, or at least should have been, very well aware of the fact that, by 10 November 2004, the applicant had already been released from the prison, that his Azerbaijani citizenship had been terminated and that he had to leave the country. Moreover, although the manner in which the applicant lost his citizenship and left the country is outside of the scope of the matters to be examined by the Court in the present case, it appears that he had no other choice but to leave the country immediately after his release and that any attempt by him to return to Azerbaijan on short notice would not be easy.",

In particular, the applicant had no history of tuberculosis prior to his transfer to Bayil Prison. During a medical examination on 8 November 1995 in Investigative Isolator No. 1, it was specifically noted that the applicant was not suffering from tuberculosis. Likewise, no serious diseases were discovered during the period from 28 December 1995 to 3 June 1996 when he was detained in the detention facility of the Ministry of National Security. It was after his transfer to Bayil Prison in June 1996 that the first symptoms of tuberculosis started to appear. The Government did not dispute the applicant's submission that he had been placed in a cell together with other prisoners who were already seriously ill with the active form of tuberculosis. Arguably, starting at least from February 1997, the early symptoms of the disease, such as chest pains and significant loss of weight (see paragraph 33 above), began to manifest themselves. Finally, in April 1997 the applicant was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. Having regard to these factual circumstances of the case as well as the statistical estimations that the incidence of tuberculosis was very high in the Azerbaijani prisons at the material time, with some reports indicating that it was nearly 50 times higher than the country average (see paragraph 80 above), it is apparent that the applicant contracted tuberculosis in Bayil Prison.",

In particular, the evidence put before the Court shows that the applicant was given irregular symptomatic treatment without adhering to a strict medication regime necessary for the tuberculosis therapy. Although he was prescribed a number of antibacteriological medications, the disease was still active for more than a year after the initial diagnosis. The medical records indicate that, subsequently, the disease went into remission in September 1998 but that the applicant's condition severely deteriorated in February 2000. The Court notes that only after the intervention by the representatives of the Azerbaijani National Committee of the Helsinki Citizens Assembly did the prison doctors acknowledge the re-activation of the disease and subsequently hospitalised the applicant. In general, although the applicant's medical records pertaining to this period contain a number of entries, it is not clear from these records whether there were regular check-ups on the applicant's condition, whether he was under constant medical supervision or whether medicines prescribed for the applicant were always correctly administered to him, with regard to the specified dosage, frequency and duration.",

Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the in-patient treatment which, according to the Government's medical records was positive, since the applicant was judged to have recovered, the evidence submitted by the Government is insufficient to establish that the in-patient treatment was adequate. In this respect, the Court also has regard to the HCA Opinion, which concluded that the applicant's in-patient treatment did not correspond to the DOTS standards.",

The available evidence shows that the applicant became ill with the majority, if not all, of these diseases at one point or another during his imprisonment. The fact that the applicant suffered from such a large number of serious ailments and continued to complain about health problems until his release in September 2004 indicates that he still needed regular medical care during the period falling within the Court's competence ratione temporis.",

Thus, for example, appellate proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6 even if there was no public hearing at higher courts (see K.D.B. v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 March 1998, Reports 1998II, p. 630, \u00a7\u00a039). On the other hand, the Court has held that, where an appellate court has to examine a case as to the facts and the law and make a full assessment of the issue of guilt or innocence, the requirement of publicity extends to the appellate hearings as well (see, for example, Tierce and Others v. San Marino, nos. 24954/94, 24971/94 and 24972/94, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2000IX).",

In particular, the applicant was convicted by the court of first instance on 12\u00a0February 1996 and there was no right of appeal available to him at the material time. Only after the adoption of the new Code of Criminal Procedure and the transitional law of 14 July 2000, did the applicant obtain a right to appeal and the appellate proceedings were instituted on 24 January 2002. The Court notes, in this connection, that the question whether the first instance hearings in the present case were public and fair is outside its competence ratione temporis (see Hummatov (dec.), cited above). On the other hand, the Court also cannot accept as a fact that, by the time of the examination of the applicant's case on appeal, the requirement of a public hearing had already been satisfied at the first instance. The primary reason for the re-opening of the applicant's case was to remedy the alleged lack of a fair hearing at the first instance, as the applicant had been recognised as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d upon Azerbaijan's accession to the Council of Europe and  had committed itself to give a \u201cre-trial\u201d to all political prisoners including the applicant. Moreover, the Court of Appeal was a judicial body with full jurisdiction, because it had the competence to examine the case on points of fact and law as well as the power to assess the proportionality of the penalty to the misconduct. For these reasons, the Court considers that a public hearing at the Court of Appeal was needed in the present case in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

Nor did the fact that any potential spectators would have had to undergo certain identity and possibly security checks in itself deprive the hearing of its public nature (see Riepan v. Austria, no. 35115/97, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2000XII).",

The Court considers that a trial complies with the requirement of publicity only if the general public is able to obtain information about its date and place and if this place is easily accessible to them. In many cases these conditions will be fulfilled by the simple fact that a hearing is held in a regular courtroom large enough to accommodate spectators. However, the holding of a trial outside a regular courtroom, in particular in a place like a prison, to which the general public in principle has no access, presents a serious obstacle to its public character. In such a case, the State is under an obligation to take compensatory measures in order to ensure that the public and the media are duly informed about the place of the hearing and are granted effective access (ibid., \u00a7 30). The Court will therefore examine whether such measures were taken in the present case.",

The Court considers that, in such circumstances, as a compensatory measure, the authorities should have provided regular transportation for spectators for the duration of the trial. However, although the Government argued that the Ministry of Justice organised a shuttle bus service to the prison, they failed to provide evidence in support of this allegation. In such circumstances, the Court accepts the applicant's and independent observers' account that there was no regular shuttle bus service provided by the authorities and that, at least for the majority of the hearings, any people wishing to attend the trial had to resort to their own means of transportation (see paragraphs 82 and 83 above). The Court considers that the fact that it was necessary to arrange costly means of transport and travel to a remote destination, as opposed to attending the Court of Appeal's regular courtroom in , had a clearly discouraging effect on potential spectators wishing to attend the applicant's trial.",

The mere fact that, at the time of the examination of his appeal, the applicant was already a prisoner serving a life sentence does not, in itself, automatically imply the necessity of relocation of the appellate proceedings from a normal courtroom to the place of the applicant's imprisonment. The Court reiterates that security problems are a common feature of many criminal proceedings, but cases in which security concerns justify excluding the public from a trial are nevertheless rare (see Riepan, cited above, \u00a7 34). In the present case, it was not shown that there were any such security concerns. Moreover, even if there were any, the Court of Appeal apparently did not consider them serious enough either to mention them in its interim decisions of 23 April and 13 May 2003 or to necessitate a formal decision under Article 392.1.6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure excluding the public.
