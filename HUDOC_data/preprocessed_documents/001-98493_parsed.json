Although that deficiency was noted by the trial court (see paragraph 9 above), it was not relied upon as a ground for it to be rejected as inadmissible. The Court further observes that the applicant was advised by the trial court to pursue, simultaneously with the criminal proceedings, his compensation claim by means of a separate civil action (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above). However, his failure to do so cannot be held to his detriment since the civil courts, as the Government argued, would have been required to wait the outcome of the criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 31 and 34 above). Lastly, for the reasons described in the Atanasova judgment, which likewise apply to this case, the Court considers that the applicant cannot be required to introduce, four years after he made the civil-party complaint and more than ten years after the incident, a fresh action before the civil courts seeking redress for the injuries sustained (see Atanasova, \u00a7\u00a7 37 - 46, cited above).",
