The Court reiterates that the rule concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies set forth in Article 35 \u00a7 1 is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 (with which it has a close affinity), that there is an effective domestic remedy available, in practice and in law, in respect of the alleged violation (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a0152, ECHR 2000-XI, and Hassan and Chaoush v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a030985/96, \u00a7\u00a7 96-98, ECHR\u00a02000XI). The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies requires applicants \u2013 using the legal remedies available in domestic law in so far as they are effective and adequate \u2013 to afford the Contracting States the possibility of putting right the violations alleged against them before bringing the matter before the Court (see, among other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, \u00a7\u00a037, ECHR 1999I). The only remedies which Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied (see, among other authorities, Dalia v.\u00a0France, 19\u00a0February 1998, \u00a7 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I).",

The Court notes that in the present case the Government did not refer to any remedy that would have enabled the applicant to invite the criminal court concerned to find a violation of the presumption innocence from the procedural standpoint. That being so, the claim for damages based on Article 57 of the Civil Code to which the Government referred could only be related to the alleged violation and sufficient in part; it could not fully remedy the alleged infringement of the presumption of innocence.

The Court also points out that the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only by a judge or court but also by other public authorities (see Daktaras v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42, ECHR 2000-X).

It considers that what counts when it comes to the application of the above-mentioned provision of the Convention is the real meaning of the remarks made, not their literal form (Lavents v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a058442/00, \u00a7 126, 28 November 2002). However, whether or not a public official\u2019s remarks breach the principle of the presumption of innocence must be examined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the offending remarks were made (see, among other authorities, Adolf v.

The question thus arises whether the principle of the presumption of innocence could have been prejudiced at that stage of the proceedings. The Court considers that Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention by no means prevented the competent authorities from referring to the applicant\u2019s existing conviction when the matter of his guilt had not been finally determined. Clearly, the applicant\u2019s conviction at first instance is the objective element at the centre of the appeal proceedings. Furthermore, regard being had to Article 10 of the Convention, Article 6 \u00a7 2 can neither prevent the authorities from informing the public about the criminal conviction concerned, nor prevent discussion of the subject by the media or the general public or, as in the present case, in the course of a parliamentary debate (see, mutatis mutandis, Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Papon v.\u00a0France (no.\u00a02) (dec.), no. 54210/00, ECHR 2001XII).

Furthermore, in other cases where the domestic courts had not determined the question of guilt by a final judgment, the European Commission on Human Rights has explained that it is the essence of the principle of presumption of innocence that it can only be invalidated by a final conviction in accordance with the law (see Englert v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a010282/83, Commission\u2019s report of 9 October 1985, Decisions and Reports (DR) 31, p. 11, \u00a7\u00a049, and N\u00f6lkenbockhoff v.

Accordingly, and in the light of the foregoing, it considers that the presumption of innocence cannot cease to apply in appeal proceedings simply because the accused was convicted at first instance. To conclude otherwise would contradict the role of appeal proceedings, where the appellate court is required to re-examine the earlier decision submitted to it as to the facts and the law. It would mean that the presumption of innocence would not be applicable in proceedings brought in order to obtain a review of the case and have the earlier conviction set aside.",

The Court notes in particular that the Deputy Minister of Finance commented \u201cDidn\u2019t you appoint them acting Ministers for the Press, Ministers Plenipotentiary to the Council of Europe, when the Panteion scandals were coming to light?\u201d. It considers that these details made it very easy to identify the applicant as, according to the materials in the case file, none of the other individuals convicted by judgment no.\u00a02444/2007 fitted that description (see Y.B. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a048, and Pandy v.

The Prime Minister called the case an unprecedented scandal of embezzlement of money for personal gain. Speaking before Parliament, the Minister of Justice referred to the \u201cPanteion scandal\u201d, proclaiming that the Greek courts had \u201cboldly and resolutely\u201d convicted all those the opposition had always protected. While those comments did not mention the applicant by name, they nevertheless referred explicitly to the criminal case in question and the people involved in it. The Court further notes that judgment no. 2444/2007 of the  had convicted the applicant and eight others \u2013 that is to say, a well-defined group of people \u2013 at first instance. It also attaches particular importance to the fact that decision no.\u00a01969/2005 of the Indictment Division of the Athens Court of Appeal stated that the applicant had \u201cplayed a major role in the commission of the offences\u201d. What is more, the case was given wide media coverage in Greece and at various times the applicant had occupied the posts of President of Panteion University, acting Minister for the Press and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Council of Europe. These factors suffice for the Court to conclude that because of the applicant\u2019s involvement in the case in question, his status and the posts he had occupied in the past, the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice related to the applicant to a degree that was sufficient to render him identifiable.",

In so doing, he did not restrict himself to merely referring to the applicant\u2019s conviction by the Assize Court\u2019s judgment no.\u00a02444/2007, which would have been keeping with the principle of the presumption of innocence. It should be noted in this regard that as that judgment had not yet been finalised, the Deputy Minister of Finance had made these statements without knowing the exact facts on which the  had based its verdict. In the Court\u2019s opinion, such blunt, imprudent language was likely to influence public opinion as regards the applicant\u2019s guilt. In particular, the word \u201ccrook\u201d illustrated his \u2013 very negative \u2013 personal opinion of the applicant following the Assize Court\u2019s judgment. In addition, the comment \u201cyou even steal from each other\u201d, another implicit but clear reference to the applicant, had all the appearance of a new assessment of the facts the Court of Appeal would be examining in order to deliver the final decision in the matter. In short, the wording used by the Deputy Minister of Finance appears to have reflected his own view of the case, prejudging the future judgment of the Court of Appeal.",

Accordingly, his comments could not be construed as his own, negatively biased appraisal of the applicant\u2019s case. The Minister of Justice did, however, declare that the Greek courts had \u201cboldly and resolutely\u201d convicted those involved in the case. That statement was likely to give the impression that the Minister of Justice was satisfied with the verdict reached in judgment no.\u00a02444/2007 and wanted the Court of Appeal to uphold that judgment. The Court draws attention in particular to the specific political post this government minister occupied at the time. As Minister of Justice he embodied, par excellence, the political authority responsible for the organisation and the proper functioning of the courts. He should therefore have been particularly careful not to say anything that might give the impression that he wished to influence the outcome of proceedings pending before the Court of Appeal. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the words used by the Minister of Justice appeared to prejudge the decision of the Court of Appeal.",

According to the Government, the appeal proceedings were still pending, so the comments made could not possibly influence the Court of Appeal after such a long time. The Court considers that the compatibility of statements with the principle of the presumption of innocence is determined with regard to the time when the statements were made; the time that passes before the competent court examines the merits of the case is therefore not a crucial factor in the assessment of the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. In any event, to accept the Government\u2019s argument would be drawing an unreasonable conclusion for the purposes of the Convention, namely that the longer the criminal proceedings, the more any disregard for the presumption of innocence at an earlier stage of the same proceedings could be minimised.",

The Court pays particular attention to the fact that the remarks were made by high-ranking politicians and even, in the case of the Minister of Justice, by a person of authority whose position required him to show particular restraint when commenting on judicial decisions. The above considerations are sufficient for the Court to be able to conclude that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention in respect of the proceedings pending before the Athens Court of Appeal, on account of the statements made by the Deputy Minister of Finance and the Minister of Justice.",
