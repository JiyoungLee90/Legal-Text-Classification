Denmark (dec.), no. 52620/99, 20 March 2003; Normann v. Denmark (dec.), no. 44704/98, 14 June 2001; and Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0181, 202). While there is no requirement under the existing case-law that the domestic authorities should award the same sum by way of compensation as the Court would be likely to award under Article 41 of the Convention, the level of just satisfaction granted at national level must nevertheless not be manifestly inadequate in the particular circumstances of the case (see Horv\u00e1thov\u00e1 v.

The parties agreed that the applicant had been reimbursed only the fees which would have been payable to his counsel according to these provisions, in particular the Federal Regulation on Lawyers\u2019 Fees, and not the considerably higher fees he claimed to have paid to his counsel in accordance with a fees agreement. However, Article 467 \n\u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure only provides for the reimbursement of a defendant\u2019s necessary expenses, such as lawyer\u2019s fees, as a result of his acquittal. The Court is therefore convinced that the reimbursement of fees to the applicant was a mere consequence of his acquittal, which itself was pronounced for factual reasons unrelated to the length of proceedings. \nThe applicant thus was not granted redress in having been exempted from paying any fees, which he would otherwise have been obliged to pay, only because of the excessive duration of the proceedings against him (compare Normann, cited above, and, by contrast, Hansen and Others, cited above, as well as Ohlen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28-31).",

The Court finds in this respect that for the question whether the applicant lost his status as a victim of a violation of Article 6, it is, however, decisive whether he actually received adequate compensation for the damage caused by the excessive length of the proceedings as such (compare, for instance, Gr\u00e4sser v. Germany, no. 66491/01, \u00a7 49, \n5 October 2006), which is not the case here. In any event, by lodging a request for compensation under sections 2 and 7 \u00a7 1 of the Act on Compensation for Measures of Criminal Prosecution (see paragraphs 41-43 above), the applicant could only have obtained compensation for pecuniary damage incurred as a result of searches and seizures of his property, and this only because he was subsequently acquitted. Thus, this remedy, again, was not capable of affording him redress for the protracted length of the proceedings. As regards official liability proceedings against the Federal State concerned (see paragraphs 44-45 above), the Court refers to its findings in its S\u00fcrmeli judgment, according to which such proceedings could not be considered a remedy capable of affording adequate redress for the length of civil proceedings (see S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7\u00a7 113-114, ECHR 2006-VIII; and also Gr\u00e4sser, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 49-50; and Herbst v. Germany, no. 20027/02, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68, 11\u00a0January 2007). In particular, the relevant courts would not be able to make any award in respect of \nnon-pecuniary damage, whereas in cases concerning the length of civil proceedings the applicants above all sustain damage under that head \n(see S\u00fcrmeli, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113-114; and also Hartman v. Czech Republic, no.\u00a053341/99, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2003-VIII; and Scordino, cited above, \u00a7 204). The Court considers that these findings apply, mutatis mutandis, to the length of criminal proceedings in cases such as the present one, in which redress shall be granted by the payment of compensation. The Court further notes that the Government have not adduced any fresh reasons or decisions of domestic courts which would justify departing from the findings made in the above-mentioned judgments.",
