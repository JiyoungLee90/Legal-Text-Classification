Conversely, the Court of Appeal rejected the C.\u00a0company\u2019s request entirely to prohibit the publication of the footage secretly obtained within its premises. Basing its assessment on the opinions submitted by altogether four experts, the Court of Appeal considered that the way the animals were treated inside the laboratory justified criticism. There was, however, no evidence for cruelty to animals in the legal sense of the word. The Court of Appeal further observed that the film \u201cPoisoning for profit\u201d, through its accompanying commentary and through the way specific scenes were cut together, conveyed the core message that the C. company systematically contravened the law. Similar principles applied to two further short versions already broadcast. The Court of Appeal concluded that the C.\u00a0company\u2019s request was to be granted insofar as it concerned this specific footage. However, the defendant was, in principle, not prevented from using the footage in other ways, as long as he did not convey any misleading message.",

In reaching this conclusion, the Hamm Court of Appeal relied on a number of statements which had been made on the applicant association\u2019s website (see paragraphs 15-16, above). Based on these statements, the Court of Appeal considered, for instance, that the applicant associations had approved of a personal attack against one of the C. company\u2019s business associates. Conversely, the applicant association did not contest that these statements had been made on its website, but merely considered that they had been misinterpreted by the domestic authorities.
