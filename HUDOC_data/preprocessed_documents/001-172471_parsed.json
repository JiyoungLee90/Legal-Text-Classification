The courts could not make a decision on membership rights potentially violated by such action, nor could they substitute the decision of the relevant governing bodies with their own decision.

This right extends only to disputes (\u201ccontestation\u201d in the French text) over \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law, irrespective of whether such rights are protected under the Convention. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play (see, among many other authorities, Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2016).

Thus Croatian law not only mentioned but also afforded judicial protection to the members\u2019 rights stemming from the statute of the association to which they belonged.

Freedom of association is recognised both under the Croatian Constitution and the Convention, which by virtue of Article 134 of the Constitution forms an integral part of the Croatian legal system (see\u00a0paragraph 19 above). The case-law of the former European Commission of Human Rights suggests that expulsion from an association in breach of its rules, decided pursuant to arbitrary rules or entailing exceptional hardship for the member concerned, could constitute a violation of his or her freedom of association (see Cheall v. the United Kingdom, no. 10550/83, Commission decision of 13 May 1985, Decisions and Reports 42, pp. 178 and 186).",

Once the disciplinary commission dismissed the disciplinary action against the applicant, the executive board referred the matter to the general meeting, which twice (first at an extraordinary meeting and then at its annual session) voted to expel the applicant. No reasons were given for such a decision at either session (see paragraphs 8-12 above). The applicant\u2019s attempt to contest before judicial authorities the resolution to expel him as being in breach of the association\u2019s statute failed because the courts declined jurisdiction in the matter (see paragraphs 13-14 and 16 above). Their reasoning seems to suggest that in their view the relevant legislation, namely section 26(1) of the Associations Act, did not provide a legal basis for such action and that the decision to expel a member concerned the association\u2019s internal affairs, which could not be reviewed by the courts (see\u00a0paragraphs 14 and 16 above).",

The Court has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on the ground that the applicant was denied access to a court, that is he was unable to have his dispute with the hunting association decided by domestic courts. The question therefore arises what the applicant, according to the Court\u2019s finding in this judgment, was entitled to challenge before the domestic courts. In my view, it cannot be the expulsion decision as such, since domestic law \u2013 as interpreted by domestic courts \u2013 clearly does not give a member a right to contest the lawfulness of a decision to expel him or her as a member of the association. In other words, what the applicant has a right to challenge before domestic courts as a consequence of the Court\u2019s interpretation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention must be whether the procedure followed in adopting the expulsion order was in conformity with the hunting association\u2019s statute.",

This reasoning seems to indicate that the body competent to adopt a final decision on the exclusion of the applicant as a member of the hunting association was the general meeting. In other words, even if the procedure followed \u2013 as alleged by the applicant \u2013 was not in accordance with the statute of the hunting association (see paragraph 13 of the judgment), the exclusion was finally decided by the competent body, that is the general meeting of the association. Therefore, should the applicant seek a reopening of the domestic proceedings or institute new civil proceedings as a consequence of the Court\u2019s judgment, he will not, irrespective of the Court\u2019s finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the present case, be entitled to challenge the lawfulness of the expulsion decision as such.",

That being said, expelling a member from a private association without procedural guarantees, including judicial scrutiny, may raise an issue under Article 11 of the Convention, a provision that has not been invoked by the applicant nor assessed by the Court in its judgment.",
