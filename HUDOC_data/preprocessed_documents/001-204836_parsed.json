Thus, any such measure should not be arbitrary and should \u201ctake account of proportionality as regards the scope of limitations on individual rights (for instance, as the case may be, freedom of expression or freedom of assembly)\u00a0vis-\u00e0-vis\u00a0the actual necessity arising from the circumstances, as well as the practicability of attaining the aim pursued by the measure\u201d (Ruling no. 8-P of 17 March 2017 by the Russian Constitutional Court in relation to section 13(13) of the Police Act of 2011). After a record of escorting has been compiled and if the grounds for escorting are no longer compelling, the person must be released without delay. Continued retention of the person in that case may become arbitrary, thus violating his or her right to liberty and personal security as protected by Article 22 of the Constitution and Article 5 of the Convention. Individuals have the right to challenge the escorting measure applied to them (ibid.).",

Turkey, no.\u00a034364/08, \u00a7 67, 20 October 2015 and references therein). The Court notes that the reason given for escorting the applicant to the police station was the suspicion that he might have committed the theft of a mobile telephone several months previously. That suspicion appeared to be solely based on the profile indicating \u201ca Caucasian man, around 50\u00a0years of age\u201d. The applicant was 57 years old at the time and is a man of Caucasian origin. However, it remains unclear whether any other, more specific, traits served as a basis for the suspicion against him. In addition, it was confirmed that he was not on any wanted list in relation to the theft or for any other reason. It appears that the police showed an interest in the applicant on account of the content of the message displayed on his placard and that the theft-related justification was put forward later on, apparently during the investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaints (see paragraph 8 above). In the absence of any further material, the Court is not satisfied that the circumstances as established before it disclose a genuine consideration put forward in good faith pertaining to the investigation of a criminal offence. The Court thus considers that the escorting of the applicant to the police station, entailing the termination of his solo demonstration, constituted \u201cinterference\u201d with his freedom of expression in the present case (compare with Novikova and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a025501/07 and 4 others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0178-79, 26 April 2016, and see Dilek Aslan, cited above, \u00a7 68).",

They also argued that the civil limb of Article 6 of the Convention was inapplicable because the applicant had not lodged any civil claim in the course of the criminal investigation or in relation to his application for administrative charges to be brought. When preparing their observations in the present application, in 2014 the Government had sought materials from the \u201ccase file\u201d in the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic; those materials contained no statement of civil claims or any related information. The document submitted by the applicant to the Court bore no official stamp which would normally be added when registering a document. That document referred to case no. 2-387/2004 which was a civil case relating to another person and having no link to the criminal investigation against B. In 2010 the proceedings against B. had been terminated. According to the applicable regulations, the related materials had been disposed of after expiry of the retention period, except for the judgment. In the Government\u2019s view, there was no indication that any (other) \u201ccivil right\u201d or \u201ccivil obligation\u201d pertaining to the applicant had been at stake in the course of the criminal investigation or in relation to the CAO. In any event, the national court had agreed to examine his civil claims and had granted them in part. Thus, the applicant had lost victim status in respect of his complaint about the length of the criminal investigation and the loss of the file concerning the administrative-offence proceedings.",

However, domestic law can provide for a right for the victim of the offence to claim reparation for the damage caused by that offence by means of civilparty proceedings, that is by allowing the victim to join criminal proceedings as a civil party. This is one possible way of providing for a civil action for reparation of the damage (see, as a recent authority, Nicolae\u00a0Virgiliu T\u0103nase v. Romania [GC], no. 41720/13, \u00a7 194, 25 June 2019). Civil-party proceedings come within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 under its civil head unless they are brought for purely punitive purposes. Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 applies to the proceedings involving a civil-party claim from the moment the victim has joined as a civil party, even during the preliminary investigation stage taken on its own (ibid., \u00a7 207).",
