Firearms had been used to stop the VAZ car being driven by the applicant, in which the group members had attempted to escape. The prosecutor found that the officers had acted in accordance with the Police Act. They had not exceeded the limits of the use of physical force, \u201cspecial means\u201d and firearms. The armed attack on the house had been real, and the attackers had possessed loaded firearms. Moreover, in response to the officers\u2019 demand that they cease their unlawful actions, one of the attackers had opened fire, aiming at the police officers. Two suspects had attempted to escape in the VAZ car and had not reacted to repeated police warnings; the police had therefore had to use firearms, in strict compliance with law.",

Secondly, his allegations had been thoroughly examined both by the prosecutor and the courts in the course of the criminal proceedings against him and been dismissed as unfounded.

However, the use of force against the applicant during the arrest was at no stage disputed by the authorities. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that they remained inactive. While no complaint was lodged by any of the co-accused at that moment, as early as on 1\u00a0March 2003 the SOBR and UBOP officers submitted reports to their respective hierarchical superiors and gave explanations to the prosecutor regarding the use of force during the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraphs\u00a022-23 above; also contrast Davitidze v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a08810/05, \u00a7\u00a7 91 and 95, 30 May 2013; and Shevtsova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a036620/07, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, 3\u00a0October 2017). On the basis of those reports, and in the absence of any complaint or information capable of casting doubt on their contents, the prosecutor assessed the context of the police operation, the reality of the risk of human loss and the urgency of the situation. He concluded that the force used against the two persons apprehended in the VAZ car, including the applicant, had been lawful and not excessive, as they had disobeyed the lawful orders of the policemen and had attempted to escape (see paragraph\u00a025 above; also contrast Ryabtsev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a013642/06, \u00a7 72, 14\u00a0November 2013; Annenkov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a031475/10, \u00a7\u00a098, 25 July 2017; and Meshengov v.\u00a0Russia [Committee], no.\u00a030261/09, \u00a7\u00a041, 26\u00a0March 2019). Notwithstanding somewhat summary nature of both the description of the events contained in the reports and the conclusions reached by the prosecutor, the Court notes that those conclusions remained undisputed until 2005.",

Indeed, his submissions throughout the domestic proceedings were rather confined to his assessment of the treatment as \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cruthless\u201d (see paragraphs\u00a013, 30, 41 and 52 above). Furthermore, the Court has regard to certain inconsistencies in his account of events. According to the applicant, he was severely beaten up and strangled by the SOBR officers at the GROVD office. However, the Court doubts that the injuries noted in the medical record \u2013 a bruise on the right cheek and contusion of both lips \u2013 would correspond with the severe ill-treatment lasting for hours alleged by him (see Andreyevskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062, with further references). It is noted that the applicant never complained of the inaccuracy of his medical records or the doctors\u2019 refusal to record signs of ill-treatment (see Goryachkin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a034636/09, \u00a7\u00a065, 15\u00a0November 2016). Those factors damage the credibility of the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment. At the same time, the expert\u2019s conclusion as to the nature, time of infliction and origin of the bruises appears consistent with the domestic authorities\u2019 account of the events, according to which the injuries were the result of the use of force against him during his apprehension.",

The trial court, for its part, questioned the applicant on several occasions about the circumstances of the alleged ill-treatment and the way he had sustained his injuries. It also heard all of those co-accused concerned, studied the medical evidence, and admitted the pre-investigation-inquiry file. The court questioned the SOBR and the UBOP officers who had allegedly been involved in the alleged illtreatment, as well as other witnesses. The applicant was able to crossexamine them (see (see paragraphs 34 and 38 above; see also, in a similar context, Andreyevskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-57). On the basis of that evidence, the court found no reason to depart from the police officers\u2019 initial account of the events \u2013 that is say their account of the use of force against the co-accused concerned during the arrest.

The Court considers that that statement indeed provided the domestic investigating authorities with the framework around which they subsequently built their case. In the absence of either the victim\u2019s body or the murder weapon, the trial court heavily relied on the following items of evidence to secure the applicant\u2019s conviction: statements by two other co-accused, F. and Sal. (which they had retracted at the trial stage); self-incriminating statements produced by the three co-accused at the pre-trial stage; F.\u2019s statement in the courtroom; and the identification record by which Sal. identified R. as the person murdered by the applicant (see paragraph\u00a036 above). Furthermore, while the experts confirmed that the applicant\u2019s car had been assembled from parts taken from R.\u2019s car, (ibid.), this conclusion was of limited probative value in so far as the circumstances of the murder and robbery or, for instance, the co-accused\u2019s respective roles in it were concerned. It is true that the trial court viewed the applicant\u2019s statement of \u201csurrender and confession\u201d in the light of other evidence before it. However, none of that evidence constituted direct evidence. Given those circumstances, the applicant\u2019s statement of surrender and confession can be considered to have constituted an integral and significant part of the probative evidence upon which the conviction was based (compare Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0309; Sitnevskiy and Chaykovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-85; and Fefilov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a063; also contrast Artur Parkhomenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a040464/05, \u00a7\u00a087, 16\u00a0February 2017).",

The subsequent use of such a statement in evidence at the trial could not therefore be contested on the grounds of a lack of legal advice (see Turbylev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a092). Given the legal framework governing the pre-trial proceedings and admissibility of evidence at trial, while the applicant was indeed free to raise the issue before the courts of criminal jurisdiction, there would have been little point in doing so given the non-existence at the time of a domestic-law requirement of access to a lawyer in respect of a statement of surrender and confession (see Turbylev, cited above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Farrugia v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a063041/13, \u00a7\u00a0116, 4\u00a0June 2019).",

Russia, no.\u00a018274/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a036, 22\u00a0January 2009). As regards the domestic remedy introduced by the Compensation Act, the Court reiterates its position that it would be unfair to request applicants whose cases have already been pending for many years in the domestic system and who have come to seek relief at the Court to bring again their claims before domestic tribunals (see, for similar reasoning, Fateyenkov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a044099/04 and 9 others, 18\u00a0February 2016, with further references). In line with this principle, the Court decides to proceed with the examination of the present cases (compare Fakhretdinov and Others v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), nos.\u00a026716/09 and 2\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a032, 23\u00a0September 2010) and, accordingly, dismisses the Government\u2019s non-exhaustion objection.",
