The Party of the Democratic Left (DSP) took part in the poll under the banner of the CHP, a rival party, and by that means managed to win thirteen seats. The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP, pro-Kurdish, left-leaning) presented its candidates as independents using the slogan \u2018A thousand hopes\u2019; it also supported certain left-wing Turkish candidates.

He took the view that this was not a restriction but a prohibition, inasmuch as the Law made it impossible for electors to vote for unaffiliated independent candidates in the polling stations set up at customs posts or for such candidates to engage in electioneering on TRT. The applicant added that the Court\u2019s case-law suggested that electioneering had a more immediate impact when broadcast on television and radio than when published in the press. Moreover, election broadcasts on the State radio and television were free for political parties. Nor could unaffiliated independent candidates, in fact, engage in any advertising of a political nature. Giving the political parties the opportunity to do so would be incompatible with the respondent State\u2019s duty to remain neutral and its positive obligation to keep the electorate informed about candidates standing in elections.",

On the other hand, voters living abroad were not registered on the national electoral rolls and were only permitted to vote in the polling stations set up at customs posts. Those polling stations did not constitute an electoral district for the purposes of electing members of parliament. Considering that there had been 700 independent candidates standing in the 2007 parliamentary elections, it would have been technically impossible to print the names of all the independent candidates on the ballot papers and to make those papers available in the polling stations. This was why only the ballot papers made out in the names of candidates representing political parties had been printed on the ballot papers and used in the said polling stations.

The Court has already had occasion to hold that special importance attaches to the role played by the national legislature in the choice and optimum use of national resources (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7\u00a046, Series A no. 98, and Uzan and Others v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 18240/03, \u00a7\u00a083, 29\u00a0March 2011).

We realise that the exercise of voting rights by electors living abroad raises specific problems (see Shindler v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 19840/09, \u00a7 114, 7 May 2013). However, those difficulties are not insurmountable. In the report on out-of-country voting which it adopted at its 87th session (17-18 June 2011), the Venice Commission pointed out that there were two possible ways of ensuring that the votes of expatriate citizens were taken into account fairly. The first was to allow such electors to participate in the electoral process in ordinary constituencies, which presupposed a system of attaching each voter to a specific constituency. The second was to create one or more specific constituencies for nationals living abroad (see paragraphs 77-84, document CDL-AD (2011) 022). Turkish law provides for a hybrid system which does not attach expatriate voters to any specific constituency or create any specific separate constituency, but tallies their votes at the national level. We are not convinced that a system allowing independent candidates to stand for expatriate electors is technically impossible.",

Apart from the fact that the Government would not appear to have mentioned such a justification, we consider it completely irrelevant. The legislature has granted voting rights to citizens resident abroad. That means that they consider them capable of participating, together with citizens living in Turkey, in choosing individuals apt to govern the country. If the legislature had wished to restrict the influence of voters residing outside the national territory, they would have opted for methods other than prohibiting them from voting for independent candidates, naturally with respect for the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.",

This argument does not convince us. The way to prevent excessive fragmentation of the movements represented in Parliament is to set an electoral threshold (see Yumak and Sadak, cited above, \u00a7 125). In our view, however, simply making it impossible for independent candidates to stand for a section of the electorate is not an appropriate means of achieving that aim.",
