In this connection, the condition of Polish nationality prior to 2004 had played a vital role in directing State support to those in particular need, namely Polish farmers, who had always been financially disadvantaged in comparison to other sectors of society. The Government emphasised that the farmers' scheme was 95% financed from the budget. That constituted a heavy burden on taxpayers and the economy alike. The Government submitted that contributions made by farmers to the scheme constituted only a small fraction of the contributions paid by persons covered under the general social security scheme.

However, the Court finds that the applicant was deprived of the possibility of making contributions towards his retirement pension in connection with the violation found. Without wishing to speculate as to the amount of the future retirement pension to which the applicant would have been entitled and the date on which he could have claimed it, the Court must nonetheless take into account the fact that he undoubtedly suffered some pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage (see Koua Poirrez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070). Making an assessment on an equitable basis, as is required by Article 41 of the Convention, the Court awards him EUR 5,000 to cover all heads of damage.",
