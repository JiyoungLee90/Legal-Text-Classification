However, the general concept of a fair trial, encompassing the fundamental principle that proceedings should be adversarial (see Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, \u00a7 63, Series A no.\u00a0262), requires that all parties to civil proceedings should have the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed or evidence adduced with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision (see Lobo Machado v. Portugal, 20\u00a0February 1996, \u00a7 31, Reports 1996I). Above all, that presupposes that the person against whom proceedings have been initiated should be informed of that fact (see Dilipak and Karakaya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).

The Court cannot see how the applicant could have proved knowledge on the part of the postman regarding her absence. Both attempts to serve her with the claim were made only a few days after her departure, so it is unlikely that there would have been any accumulation of mail in her mailbox to indicate that she was away. Even though the applicant can, on the one side, be criticised for lack of diligence, the Government have, on the other side, not argued, let alone shown, that she was obliged under domestic law to authorise a third party to receive mail on her behalf (contrast Weber, cited above) or to notify the post office of her prolonged absence.",
