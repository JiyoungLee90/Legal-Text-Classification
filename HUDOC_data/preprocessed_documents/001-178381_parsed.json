In a detailed fifteen-page decision he first summarised the investigative measures taken, referring in particular to the interviews of several witnesses, including police officers and the alleged victims, the review of video material from the police and from the internet, the assessment of the applicants\u2019 written observations and of the submitted documents, inter alia, medical certificates, as well as gathered information and reports on past events and applicable guidelines. After assessing all the available evidence, the public prosecutor concluded that the enquiries had shown that several supporters had aggressively approached, insulted and provoked the deployed police officers and that therefore a situation had existed in which the officers could have been justified in using their truncheons. Besides this general conclusion he held that the applicants had neither been able to identify a particular suspect nor to determine whether the suspected police officers had been male or female and that the investigation had not produced other persons who had witnessed the alleged acts against the applicants. Furthermore, he outlined in detail certain \u201cconsiderable discrepancies\u201d in the witness statements of the first applicant and referred to \u201cunspecific\u201d statements of the second applicant. Consequently, according to the public prosecutor, there was insufficient evidence to establish criminal conduct by specific police officers to the detriment of both applicants. He concluded that the investigation had to be discontinued again, since the considerable additional investigative measures had not revealed disproportionate conduct on the part of individual police officers, in particular truncheon strikes against innocent bystanders, which would require criminal prosecution of the respective officers.",

The court interpreted the applicants\u2019 request as an application to force criminal proceedings (Klageerzwingungsantrag) and held that these proceedings were only admissible if the prosecution of one or more identified accused had been requested. An application to force criminal proceedings against an unidentified accused had to be declared inadmissible, since the proceedings were not supposed to identify the accused or replace investigations. Only in a case where a public prosecutor\u2019s office had entirely refrained from investigating a crime had a court the possibility to order an investigation. Under Article\u00a0173 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe CCP\u201d; see paragraph 37 below) a court was only allowed to conduct minor enquiries to fill in remaining gaps in an investigation.

Besides referring to articles of the Basic Law, the applicants also referred in their complaint to Articles\u00a02, 3, and 13 of the Convention.

The court held that the investigations had been conducted diligently, but had not established sufficient suspicion of criminal conduct on the part of specific police officers. Moreover, the remaining gaps and factual uncertainties could not be attributed to omissions in the investigation. The court also found that it had not been necessary to question all the squad members who had possibly been involved. In its decision the Constitutional Court referred to the Court\u2019s case-law concerning the procedural obligation of Article 2 of the Convention and, in particular, to the cases of McCann and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (27 September 1995, Series A no. 324) and Grams v.\u00a0Germany ((dec.), no. 33677/96, ECHR 1999VII).

Even though the authorities had deployed helmeted officers without any identifying insignia, the investigating unit had refused to identify and question the officers at issue. Secondly, the investigation had not been conducted by a sufficiently independent authority. The public prosecutor\u2019s office had not been practically independent, owing to the proximity between the local police force and the local public prosecutor\u2019s office and the fact that the latter had to rely on the local police force for the investigation in every single case. Moreover, for all practical purposes the investigation had been conducted by the Munich police and the Munich public prosecutor had only been informed of the status of the investigation. The investigating unit, however, had been part of the same police force as the officers they had been investigating. Therefore the investigating and the investigated unit had been under the command of the Munich Chief of Police and the investigation could not be considered to have been independent or impartial. Thirdly, the investigation had been neither prompt nor thorough. The investigator had failed to secure the entire video material before it had been deleted, had questioned witnesses only after a considerable time and had never questioned all the deployed police officers, or the paramedic who had treated the first applicant at the stadium.",

It also notices that the applicants described in detail the course and duration of the investigation and the subsequent court proceedings. Consequently, the Court finds that the applicants provided the Constitutional Court with all relevant information to assess the effectiveness of the investigation, which they challenged in their constitutional complaint.",

The certificate also stated that according to the account of the patient, that is to say the first applicant, the laceration was caused by a strike with a truncheon. The second applicant\u2019s medical certificate noted redness in his face, possibly stemming from pepper spray. However, that certificate was issued only on 21 January 2008 and based upon the second applicant\u2019s account and pictures taken, according to him, after the football match. The Court considers that both certificates attest to possible consequences of ill-treatment, namely being beaten with a truncheon on the head and having pepper spray applied to the face from a close distance. However, while confirming the injuries, the certificates do not attest to the specific cause of the injuries. Moreover, the second applicant\u2019s medical certificate was only issued six weeks after the alleged ill-treatment and was not based on an examination of the actual injuries.",

Where investigations are for all practical purposes conducted by the police, the supervision of the police by an independent authority has not been found to provide a sufficient safeguard (see Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, \u00a7\u00a0114, 4 May 2001; Kummer, cited above, \u00a7 87, and Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 337, ECHR 2007II, with further references). Therefore, the Court has to assess whether the unit investigating the alleged police violence was sufficiently independent from the officers of the riot control unit whose operation was under investigation. In that regard the Court notes that the investigation was not conducted by a separate police force but by a division of the Munich police which specialised in offences perpetrated by public officials under the supervision of the public prosecutor\u2019s office. It also observes that the investigating officer was not a direct colleague of the officers of the riot control unit (contrast Ramsahai, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 335-37) and that the only link between these two divisions was their common Chief of Police and the fact that they belonged to the Munich police. While the Court considers it desirable that investigations into the use of force by the police, if possible, be conducted by independent and detached units (see, for example, O\u011fur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7\u00a091, ECHR 1999III and Eremi\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 and Pechov\u00e1, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013539), it finds no sufficient hierarchical, institutional or practical connection between the investigating division and the riot control unit which, by itself, would render the investigation unreliable or ineffective.",

Where, as in the present case, the investigation is conducted by a unit of the same police force and only under the supervision of an independent authority, it is of increased importance that the manner in which it is conducted also gives an appearance of independence so as to preserve public confidence (see Hugh\u00a0Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7 123, 4 May 2001, \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 89, Mihhailov v.

In this respect, the Court observes that the Munich police commenced a preliminary investigation on 2\u00a0January 2008, after they had been alerted by press reports to allegations of police violence in the context of the football match on 9 December 2007. The investigation lasted for nineteen months and was eventually discontinued by the public prosecutor on 4 August 2009. Based on all the documents in its possession the Court detects no particularly long periods of inactivity in the conduct of the investigation. In sum, around forty witnesses were interviewed, video material was reviewed, medical certificates were examined, and further investigative steps were taken.

Such a situation required particular investigative efforts by the investigating authorities to establish the cause of the victims\u2019 injuries, the identities of the persons responsible, whether police officers used force and, if so, whether such force was proportionate to the security situation which confronted the deployed units. The Court reiterates that any deficiency in an investigation which undermines its ability to establish the facts or the identity of persons responsible will risk falling foul of the standard of effectiveness required under the procedural limb of Article 3 (see Hristovi, cited above, \u00a7 86). In the present case, it considers that, for example, the securing and analysis of the original video footage by an independent authority or interviewing other members of the deployed riot control units or other witnesses, such as the paramedic who had allegedly treated the first applicant at the stadium, could possibly have clarified the events after the football match of 9\u00a0December 2007 in Munich, the cause of the applicants\u2019 injuries and the alleged illtreatment by police officers. Since these obvious lines of inquiry were not comprehensively followed, the Court finds that the lack of insignia of helmeted police officers and any difficulties resulting from it were not sufficiently counter-balanced during the subsequent investigation.",

Although those requests were addressed to an entity different from the one where the police officers L. and P. were employed, the fact that an entity within the Ministry of Interior was involved in an investigation concerning employees of that same Ministry is capable of undermining the independence of such an investigation.
