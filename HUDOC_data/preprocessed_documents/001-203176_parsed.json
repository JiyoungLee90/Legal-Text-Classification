In particular, the applicant alleged that a final judgment of 2006 awarding him the equivalent of some 66,000 euros (EUR) and enforced in 2007 had been abusively quashed in 2013 as a result of an appeal lodged out of time. After the quashing and before the Supreme Court of Justice had had a chance to annul the quashing, the enforcement of the above initial judgment was reversed and the defendant quickly disposed of all its property. The Supreme Court of Justice restored the initial judgment, but to no avail because the applicant was never able to recover his money.",

The burden of proof is on the Government to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to show that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (Manic v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 46600/11, \u00a7 80, 13 January 2015).",

The remedy suggested by the Government was not capable of providing redress for the problem raised by the applicant, that is to say overturning the quashing of the final judgment in his favour. It is true that, in theory, if available, an attachment of the goods in dispute could have mitigated the damage caused to the applicant; however, in view of the state of domestic legislation, that appears debatable and, most importantly, irrelevant for the purposes of deciding the admissibility of the present complaint.",
