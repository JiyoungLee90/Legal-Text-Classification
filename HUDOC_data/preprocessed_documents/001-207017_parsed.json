The case had been wrongly presented and she requested that her caring skills be reassessed. As to her earlier rounds of treatment, she emphasised the fact that she had not been subject to treatment since 2006, and that her last treatment had been administered within the context of stress caused by her having undergone an abortion. She had recently moved in with her mother, who had asked to be approved as a foster parent; moreover, the applicant\u2019s brother and sister could assist and support her and her mother.",

It took account of the applicant\u2019s history of hospitalisation. In addition to the above-mentioned medical assessments the Board mentioned, inter alia, an evaluation made following treatment given in 2002, according to which the applicant easily lost control and had expressed aggression. She had asked her then boyfriend to kill a previous boyfriend of hers, and had at one occasion rammed a knife into a pillow next to that former boyfriend while he was sleeping. In 2006 the applicant had first been treated at a hospital after she had undergone an abortion. According to the summary of the medical assessments made at that time, she had destroyed items in the house and physically attacked her mother. At the hospital she had attributed her anger against her family to the fact that they had pressured her to abort her pregnancy. Later that same year, the applicant had again been hospitalised after having become aggressive towards her mother. On that occasion the applicant had stated that she would surely hit her mother again and that she had problems controlling her anger. According to medical observations recorded in 2007, the applicant had not been responsive to therapy and had not understood the necessity of taking medication in the manner prescribed. In 2008 she had been hospitalised after an episode in which, in the presence of her son, she had climbed out of a window and threatened to jump. Moreover, there had been incidents in which she had threatened to use a knife both on herself and on others.",

The nursing and emotional care of the girl would have been deficient, and the emotional development of the girl would have stagnated. This would have been very damaging to the girl, who was of an age at which continuous stimulation and \u201cmirroring\u201d (that is to say actions intended to assure the child having been heard and understood) was entirely decisive for her further development. The conditions for an emergency decision had thus been met on 14 April 2011, when the emergency decision had been adopted. The Board, moreover, considered that the conditions were also met as at the date of its own decision. As to the applicant\u2019s moving in with her mother, it stated that there was still a risk of substantial damage being caused to the child because of the fact that major conflict regularly arose between the applicant and her family, from the effects of which the applicant would probably not be able to protect her daughter. In addition, the applicant\u2019s mother had clearly expressed her opinion that her daughter would be capable of caring for the child without assistance, which indicated that deficiencies in the applicant\u2019s care for her daughter would be overlooked and not reported to the child welfare services. The emergency decision was therefore upheld.",

It found nonetheless that it should be upheld, noting in that regard (i) strange remarks made by the applicant to the effect that the child must have been switched and (ii) the fact that the applicant had criticised the interim foster parents for feeding her daughter so much that she had been unable to recognise her. The Board stated, however, that there was a possibility of the applicant being awarded more extensive contact rights if the applicant were to visit a doctor and start taking appropriate medicines to stabilise her mental functioning. On essentially the same grounds, the Board held that she should not be informed of the whereabouts of her daughter, in accordance with section 4-19 of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph\u00a051 below).",

It additionally noted, among other things, that the applicant\u2019s primary argument was that the placement in public care of her daughter had been due to the fact that she herself had previously been wrongly diagnosed with mild mental retardation, whereas it had later been clarified that she had been suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and thus, at the time of the District Court\u2019s judgment, finally had been receiving appropriate medication and therefore would function better than before, also when it came to providing care for her daughter. The District Court found that those circumstances had not, however, supported the conclusion that the applicant at the time had possessed normal care skills. It also pointed out that the applicant had not taken care of her daughter for three years, had had a small social network and had not properly arranged for her daughter to attend kindergarten or planned leisure activities for her. Similarly, she had similarly few or no plans in respect of her own education or work, and had been unemployed since 2000. She had recently started to have more contact with her son, but that had been at the son\u2019s initiative. In the District Court\u2019s view, that could not be viewed as an indication that the applicant had sufficient care skills. As regards the question of contact rights, the District Court stated that the placement in care of the applicant\u2019s daughter would be long-term and that the purpose of contact was not, therefore, to make a reunification of the family possible by building an attachment between the applicant and her daughter.",

The District Court was of the view that the daughter had a strong need for her care situation to be clarified. She understood the foster parents to be her parents and she was well integrated into their family, enjoying a good and close relationship with both her foster brothers and her extended foster family. As to the applicant, she did not seem to accept that she would never be able to assume the care of her daughter. There were therefore reasons to believe that there would be future proceedings seeking the reunification of the applicant with her daughter or extended contact rights, unless adoption was at that time authorised. While the biological principle should be given considerable weight, the attachment between the applicant and her daughter was nevertheless very limited. As the foster parents had not consented to post-adoption contact visits (under an \u201copen adoption\u201d arrangement), that issue could not be decided.

Accordingly, in the event of the imposition of a public care order that restricts family life, a positive duty lies on the authorities to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible. Moreover, any measure implementing such temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parents and the child. The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the relevant authorities with progressively increasing force from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child. The ties between members of a family, and the prospect of their successful reunification, will perforce be weakened if impediments are placed in the way of their having easy and regular access to each other (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0205 and 208). It is crucial that the contact regime, without exposing the child to any undue hardship, effectively supports the goal of reunification until \u2013 after careful consideration, and taking account of the authorities\u2019 positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification \u2013 the authorities are justified in concluding that the ultimate aim of reunification is no longer compatible with the best interests of the child. Family reunification cannot normally be expected to be sufficiently supported if there are intervals of weeks, or even months, between each contact session (see K.O. and V.M. v. Norway, cited above \u00a7 69).",

The District Court also appointed an expert, who presented a report and evidence during the hearing (see paragraphs\u00a041-42 above); the District Court then delivered a lengthy and detailed judgment (see paragraphs 43-46 above).

That is so since it is in the very nature of adoption that no real prospects of rehabilitation or family reunification exist and that it is instead in the child\u2019s best interests that he or she be placed permanently in a new family (see, for example, R. and H. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a035348/06, \u00a7 88, 31 May 2011). This is why stricter scrutiny is necessarily required in respect of such decisions (see paragraph 81 above). By contrast, domestic authorities are given a wide margin of appreciation in respect of care orders (see paragraph 81 above), as they are in principle temporary measures and do not in themselves entail a complete deprivation of family life. The Court observes that an essentially corresponding distinction is maintained in domestic law (see the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 15 September 2020 cited in paragraph 56 above). It is another matter that care orders may also be supplemented by other measures, such as extensive restrictions on contact between the parent and the child, or measures that completely deprive the biological family of their family life and are inconsistent with the aim of reuniting them to the effect that stricter standards must apply to them (see, for example, A.S. v. Norway, cited above, \u00a7 62; and Johansen v. Norway, 7 August 1996, \u00a7\u00a078, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III).",

The very limited extent of the contact rights was due to the Board having deemed \u2013 owing to its consideration that the applicant\u2019s difficulties in providing emotional care were anchored in her mental functioning and personality traits \u2013 that the care order would be long-term, and the District Court also proceeded on that assumption (see paragraphs 22-23 and 25 above).",

Nor are there any signs that the domestic authorities, at any point in time after the issuance of the care order, attempted in other ways to take positive measures in order to prevent the applicant and her daughter ending up permanently and completely estranged from each other. The Court acknowledges that domestic authorities, after careful consideration and also taking account of their positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification, may be justified in concluding that the ultimate aim of reunification is no longer compatible with the best interests of the child. However, in the instant case that goal appears effectively to have already been abandoned when the County Social Welfare Board first issued the care order in 2011 (see paragraphs 20-23 above). The level of contact was \u2013 apparently as a pure reflection of the overall conclusion that the placement would be long-term \u2013 kept at a minimum, and it transpires that the authorities did not make any genuine efforts to increase it by way of an attempt to seek the development of a family relationship between the applicant and her daughter.

Although there might indeed be instances when repeated legal proceedings, owing to the particular circumstances of a case, may harm the child concerned and therefore be taken into account, a biological parent\u2019s exercise of judicial remedies cannot automatically count as a factor in favour of adoption (see Strand Lobben and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0212 and 223). The Court notes in this regard that biological parents\u2019 procedural rights, including their right to have access to proceedings in order to have a care order lifted or restrictions on contact with their child relaxed, form an integral part of their right to respect for their family life afforded by Article\u00a08 of the Convention.

This is a consequence of the distinctive perspectives attached to each respective role \u2013 the role of the Court being to assess, within the scope of the application lodged with it, whether the organs of the respondent State acted in accordance with the State\u2019s obligations under the Convention. The Court therefore also fully concurs with the emphasis placed by the Supreme Court in its decision cited above (see paragraph 55) on the crucial importance, from the very outset, of the child welfare services, the County Social Welfare Board and, thereafter, the domestic courts, considering all the relevant requirements under Article 8 of the Convention, in order to avoid errors and shortcomings that cannot readily be repaired at a later stage.",
