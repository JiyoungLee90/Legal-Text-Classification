Turkey (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99 et al., ECHR\u00a02010). The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a034932/04, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a026839/05, \u00a7 109, 18 May 2010). Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no. \u00a025803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999V).",

It therefore cannot be said that the remedies in question offered reasonable prospects of success and were effective. As regards the argument that the applicant had failed to raise the question of alleged unlawfulness of his detention in his appeals against his conviction, the Court notes that the appeals in question are of no relevance for the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention since they did not concern his detention but rather his conviction at first instance. In sum, there are no grounds to allow the Government\u2019s non-exhaustion objection.",

The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed, taking account of both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Bannikov v.

The fact that the applicant did not pursue remedies which, as already noted above, had no prospects of success does not suggest that the matter was of no significance to the applicant.

As regards the Government\u2019s second argument, the Court notes that, as opposed to the case of Martirosyan in which the applicant had spent nearly two years in detention during trial without ever requesting the trial court to release him on bail (see Martirosyan, cited above, \u00a7 45), in the present case the applicant\u2019s detention during trial lasted less than a month, namely between 13 May and 11 June 2008. He had previously, on 10 March 2008, appealed against the trial court\u2019s decision to detain him, while the decision of 13 May 2008 was not subject to appeal. The fact that the applicant did not lodge a request for release on bail during that short period is not sufficient for the Court to conclude that he failed to exhaust the domestic remedies in respect of his complaint under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention.
