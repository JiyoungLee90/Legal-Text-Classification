The Court reached that conclusion for two main reasons. First, the national courts had allowed the executive to stretch the notion of national security beyond its natural meaning, as Mr\u00a0C.G.'s expulsion had been justified on the basis of his alleged involvement in unlawful trafficking in narcotic drugs. Secondly, the courts had not examined whether the executive had been able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for their assessments that Mr\u00a0C.G. had presented a national security risk, and had instead rested their rulings solely on uncorroborated averments of the Ministry of the Interior. On that basis, the Court found that the interference with the applicants' family life had not been \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d (see C.G. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 42-47 and 49).",

Examining the notion of \u201cnational security\u201d, as referred to in different domestic legal provisions, the Sofia City Court concluded that this alleged unlawful activity indeed presented a national security risk (see paragraph 11 above). Unlike the case of C.G. and Others, where it found that Mr C.G.'s alleged involvement in drug trafficking could hardly be deemed capable of impinging on the national security of Bulgaria (see C.G. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 43), in the present case the Court is ready to accept the domestic authorities' conclusion that at least one of the activities alleged on Mr Kaushal, namely participation in extremist groups, could pose a genuine threat to national security. It observes in this connection that the notion of \u201cnational security\u201d is a very wide one and that a large margin of appreciation is left to the national authorities to determine what is in the interests of that security (ibid.).

In immigration matters, where there is an arguable claim that expulsion may infringe an alien's right to respect for his or her family life, Article 13 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention requires that States must make available to the individual concerned the effective possibility of challenging expulsion orders and of having the relevant issues examined with sufficient procedural safeguards and thoroughness by an appropriate domestic forum offering adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality (see Al-Nashif, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0133).",

However, the Court does not see how this limited review could satisfy the requirements of Article 13, as set out above (see paragraph 36). It observes that the  failed to take into account highly relevant circumstances, such as the fact that the second, third and fourth applicants had been born in  and had apparently lived there all their lives. At the time of their father's expulsion the third and fourth applicants were thirteen and seven years old (see paragraph 5 above). Therefore, it could be expected that they would encounter serious difficulties in adapting to life in another country. Furthermore, prior to his expulsion the first applicant had also been living in  for many years. He had learned Bulgarian and started his own business (see above), and had apparently created solid social, family and cultural ties with the country.",
