The justice of the peace in charge of each case had examined the evidence gathered by lawenforcement, assessed its admissibility, veracity and relevance. It had been incumbent on the courts to respect the presumption of innocence and to interpret the doubt to the benefit of the defendants. The proceedings had been truly adversarial and the applicants had had ample opportunity to present their case to the court and to challenge the administrative materials submitted by the police. As to Mr Kuratov\u2019s (application no.\u00a024377/15) allegations, the Government submitted that it had been open to the applicant to ask the judge for adjournment, had he been unable to prepare for his defence. The Government did not comment on Mr Tyutya\u2019s (application no.\u00a059025/16) complaint that the same judge had considered both cases against him. Lastly, the Government submitted that it had not been necessary for Mr Sokolov (application no.\u00a061429/16) to confront the police officers in court.

Lastly, it notes that the appeal proceedings have not remedied the deficiencies of the trial. Given the wide statutory scope of review on appeal, the absence of a prosecuting party in the appeal proceedings was a serious shortcoming (see, for the same reasoning, (see Yegorov and Others v.
