It rejected the argument that section 2(1)(b) of the 1969 Law (see paragraph 16 below) was unconstitutional and in breach of Article 6 para. 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention in that it required, in addition to an acquittal, the absence of all suspicion. The court held that the presumption of innocence had to be respected in the proceedings prior to the verdict, but did not confer on every detainee the right to compensation in the event of an acquittal. The impugned provision did not refer to guilt but to continuing suspicion. The finding by a court that suspicions subsisted did not conflict with the presumption of innocence.

The content of this record ... suggests rather that in the jury\u2019s opinion all suspicion had not been removed. However, as the court called upon to rule under the [1969] Law ... is not bound, in its assessment of the position as regards suspicion, by the verdict (of acquittal) at the trial, not even the record of the jury\u2019s deliberations is of decisive importance.",

Indeed, the Linz Court of Appeal decided on 30 April 1986 ... that Sekanina could be kept in detention on remand for up to one year, thereby confirming the strength of the suspicion. In the appealed decision, the finding by the court below that suspicion subsisted was properly founded in particular on the numerous repeated threats made by Mr Sekanina, his acts of violence, his evident satisfaction at his wife\u2019s death, the description of the events given to a cell-mate, the different versions of how the accident happened, the severe financial pressure, his unsuccessful attempts to obtain care and custody of his two children, and his hopes of receiving payment under a life-insurance policy taken out on his wife. With respect to the different versions of the accident related by the appellant to third parties, the Court of Appeal refers in particular to the evidence given at the trial of 28 to 30 July 1986 by the witnesses Gundula Sekanina (pp. 45, 50 and 51 of the transcript of the trial) and Johanna and Kurt Sch\u00f6llnberger (pp. 105, 106, 117 and 119 of the transcript). The appellant told his fellow employee Siegfried Wurzinger that he had been in another room at the time of the fall (Wurzinger, pp. 126, 127), whereas Brigitte Grasb\u00f6ck noticed during the fall that the claimant - wearing a light-coloured vest - was already at the window, the entire upper part of his body being visible. He had been holding a bucket out of the window with outstretched arms and pouring water; in addition when he came down to his wife he had, she thought, been wearing a blue vest (Grasb\u00f6ck, pp. 65 and 66 of the transcript). During his interrogation (which was taken down in writing) by the Linz Federal Police on 2 August 1985 (p. 214, volume 1), the appellant placed on record that shortly before the fall his wife had quarrelled with him. According to the evidence of the witness Egon Werger, the appellant had told him that \u2018during the quarrel he\u2019 - Sekanina - \u2018[had run] towards his wife in a rage\u2019 (pp. 166 and 167 of the transcript). The appellant was described by several witnesses as quick-tempered and violent (pp. 44 and 82 of the transcript). He is said to have made death threats against his wife several times, the last occasion being about a week before her death (pp. 113 and 572 of volume 1, p. 216 of volume 2, and pp. 58, 75, 76, 102, 115, 142 and 143 of the transcript of the trial). Finally, it may also be noted that on 3 July 1985, the day before his wife\u2019s death, the appellant pressed his tailor for a dark jacket he had ordered in 1983, as he now needed it.\"",

In this respect it did not regard itself as bound by the \u2019s acquittal. On the other hand, it referred to its own decision of 30 April 1986 authorising detention on remand for a year (see paragraph 7 above); it saw this as confirmation of the gravity of the suspicions concerning the applicant. After having drawn up a comprehensive list of items of evidence against Mr Sekanina, in its view not refuted during the trial, and after having carefully examined the statements of various witnesses, it concluded: \"The jury took the view that the suspicion was not sufficient to reach a guilty verdict; there was, however, no question of that suspicion\u2019s being dispelled\" (see paragraph 13 above).",

Despite the fact that there had been a final decision acquitting Mr Sekanina, the courts which had to rule on the claim for compensation undertook an assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt on the basis of the contents of the  file. The voicing of suspicions regarding an accused\u2019s innocence is conceivable as long as the conclusion of criminal proceedings has not resulted in a decision on the merits of the accusation.

In particular, an acquittal may cover a wide variety of situations. For example, the deed in question may not constitute a criminal offence under the criminal law, or the accused may have committed an act which was in itself punishable but while he was in a state in which he was not responsible for his actions, or the court may be convinced of the accused\u2019s innocence, or again there may be insufficient evidence to convict (see Article 259 para. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).",

Accordingly, it would seem to me to be difficult to affirm (see paragraph 30 of the judgment) that the finding in a subsequent decision relating to a compensation procedure that suspicion subsists leaves open a doubt as to the correctness of the Assize Court\u2019s decision.",

I do, however, accept that - given the wording of the provision in question - the statement of such grounds compels the court to engage in a balancing act between a lack of adequate reasons and the risk of offending against the presumption of innocence.",
