Turkey [GC], no.\u00a023763/94, \u00a7 70, ECHR 1999\u2013IV). In cases in which there are conflicting accounts of the events, the Court is inevitably confronted when establishing the facts with the same difficulties as those faced by any first-instance court. It is inherent in proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where an individual applicant accuses State agents of violating his rights under the Convention, that in certain instances solely the respondent Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70, ECHR 2000-VI, and Tani\u015f and Others v.

The Court further remarks that it has already found that the provisions of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure do not preclude disclosure of the documents from a pending investigation file, but rather set out a procedure for and limits to such disclosure (see, for similar conclusions, Mikheyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a077617/01, \u00a7\u00a0104, 26 January 2006).

More than three years later, in August 2003, the documents relating to the murders of the applicant\u2019s family members was transferred to the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office with an instruction to carry out a separate investigation. However, on 20 August 2003 the investigator of that office took the view that no crime had been committed, referring to the possibility that the persons had died as a result of shelling. This decision was taken without any other additional investigative steps aimed at elucidating the circumstances of the deaths having been taken.",

The measures taken after April 2004 included such crucial steps as the questioning of other witnesses, inspection of the crime scene, attempts to identify the military units that could have been involved in the murders and the carrying out of a ballistic expert report. It is obvious that these measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and certainly as soon as the investigation had commenced. The Court reiterates that it is crucial in cases of deaths in contentious situations for the investigation to be prompt. The passage of time will inevitably erode the amount and quality of the evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence will cast doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts, as well as drag out the ordeal for the members of the family (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).

The investigation was thus deprived of information about the state of the bodies or the type of injuries sustained, and was unable to establish with any degree of precision the cause of the deaths. The Court notes, in this regard, that the applicant significantly contributed to this failure, because she and her brother had not permitted the exhumation of the bodies, and had even refused to indicate the place of their relatives\u2019 burial. However, it considers that the applicant\u2019s refusal to permit exhumation cannot absolve the authorities from their obligations to obtain detailed information about the cause of deaths of four persons in suspicious circumstances.

The exact cause and circumstances of the applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 deaths have never been established. The applicant did not seek the opinion of a medical doctor before the burial of her relatives\u2019 remains. No official death certificates were produced by the competent authorities such as to suggest that a basic fact-finding exercise had been carried out on the domestic level and at least indicate the dates and causes of the deaths. No photographs were taken and no detailed description of the bodies was recorded before burial, nor did the applicant apply to a domestic court in order to establish the facts and circumstances of her relatives\u2019 deaths (see, by contrast, Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, judgment of 24 February 2005, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30 and \u00a7\u00a7 39-42, and Estamirov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 60272/00, judgment of 12 October 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 20 and 21). Furthermore, in the criminal proceedings the applicant refused to allow the exhumation of her relatives\u2019 remains and the preparation of a forensic expert report, or even to identify the place where they were buried. If such reports had been produced their results could have provided valuable information about the exact manner of the deaths and served to support or undermine the applicant\u2019s allegation.",

The applicant herself was not an eyewitness to the events. No witnesses were identified who could corroborate her statements about the servicemen being responsible for the murders.
