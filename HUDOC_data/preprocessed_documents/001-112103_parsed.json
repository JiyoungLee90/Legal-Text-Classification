According to the domestic law, this initial arrest could not last longer than 72 hours and an arrestee was to be released if that maximum period had expired and the court had not adopted a decision to detain him (Article\u00a0129\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 and Article 132 \u00a7 1(3) of the CCP). The Court notes, however, that on 10 October 2005 at about 8.20\u00a0p.m., that is one and a half hours prior to the expiry of his short-term arrest, the applicant was brought before a judge who was called upon to decide whether to detain him. Thus, the authorities complied with their obligation and brought the applicant before a judge within the 72 hours permitted by law. It is true that the hearing extended beyond 9.50 p.m. on that evening, that is beyond those 72\u00a0hours, and lasted until 5.05 a.m. on the next morning \u2013 the moment that the judge closed the hearing by announcing the decision to detain him (see paragraph 20 above) \u2013, during which there were no recesses announced and the applicant was obliged to stay in the courtroom. The Court, however, considers that, since the applicant was brought before the judge within the 72 hours permitted by law, the requirement that he be present at that hearing until the question of his detention was finally decided by the judge cannot be said to have violated the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Last but not least, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant was represented by ten lawyers who filed numerous motions and objections, which caused significant delays in the proceedings. Thus, the fact that the hearing went beyond 9.50 p.m. on 10 October 2005 cannot be attributable to the judge, who appears to have dealt with the case diligently.",

An accused was entitled to have access to all the materials of the case file only after the completion of the investigation.

Austria, 12 December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series A no. 224). Furthermore, although Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention does not guarantee a right to appeal against decisions on the lawfulness of detention, it follows from the aim and purpose of this provision that its requirements must be respected by appeal courts if an appeal lies against a decision on the lawfulness of detention (see Rutten v.\u00a0the Netherlands, no.\u00a032605/96, \u00a7\u00a053, 24\u00a0July 2001).",

Having regard to the relevant domestic provisions, it indeed appears that both Articles 137 \u00a7 5 and 288\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the CCP, which regulated this issue, prescribed explicitly only a right to appeal to the Court of Appeal and said nothing about the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 60 and 64 above). The same follows from Decision no. 20 of the Council of Court Chairmen of 12 February 2000 which stated that an appeal procedure before the Court of Cassation was not regulated by the CCP and advised that such appeals should, nevertheless, be examined (see paragraph 71 above). Thus, it cannot be said that the applicant explicitly enjoyed in law a right of appeal to the Court of Cassation against pre-trial decisions on detention at the material time.",

We therefore conclude that the applicant was deprived of his liberty in the course of the court hearing from 9.50 p.m. on 10 October 2005 until 5.05\u00a0a.m. on 11 October 2005.

Last but not least, the fact cannot be overlooked that Article 65 \u00a7 4 (6) allows the accused to leave the courtroom when there is a recess. This clearly suggests that the purpose of this provision is to ensure order in the courtroom and the smooth running of the judicial process rather than to deal with questions relating to deprivation of liberty. Article 73 \u00a7 5 (3) of the CCP imposes the same obligation on the defence counsel (see paragraph 51 of the judgment), a fact which also clearly indicates that this requirement has nothing to do with questions of deprivation of liberty.",

However, no explanation was provided by the Government as to why the applicant was brought before the judge only one and a half hours before expiry of the three-day arrest period. Nothing in the case file suggests that any investigative measures were carried out between 8 October 2010 and the time when the applicant was brought before the judge on 10 October 2010. It should be reiterated in this connection that it is for the Contracting States to organise their legal system in such a way that their law-enforcement authorities can meet the obligation to avoid unjustified deprivation of liberty (in the instant case, custody exceeding 72 hours) (see Shukhardin v. Russia, no. 65734/01, \u00a7 93, 28 June 2007; Matyush v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14850/03, \u00a7 73, 9 December 2008; and Asatryan v. Armenia, no. 24173/06, \u00a7 45, 9 February 2010). Therefore, in our view, the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty between 9.50 p.m. on 10\u00a0October 2005 and 5.05 a.m. on 11 October 2005 lacked a proper legal basis.",

Azerbaijan, no. 40900/05, \u00a7\u00a7 44-48, 9\u00a0November 2010, and Farhad Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a037138/06, \u00a7\u00a7 166-169, 9 November 2010, where the Court found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because the applicants\u2019 initial detention exceeded the maximum of 48 hours permitted by domestic law). The fact that the applicant was brought before the judge within the 72-hour timelimit and that the hearing extended beyond those 72 hours does not, in our opinion, alter the presumption that he was deprived of his liberty on the premises of the court while the latter was deciding on the imposition of a preventive measure, and that this deprivation of liberty was unlawful for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention. Where the maximum period of detention is laid down by law and is absolute, the authorities responsible for the detention are under a duty to take all necessary precautions to ensure that the permitted duration is not exceeded (see, K.-F. v. Germany, 27\u00a0November 1997, \u00a7 72, Reports 1997-VII). Therefore, it was not relevant whether the delay was attributable to the judge (see paragraph 86 of the judgment), since the imperative of Articles 129 and 130 of the CCP is clear\u00a0\u2013 an arrest must not exceed 72 hours from the time the person is taken into custody. Furthermore, under Article\u00a0132\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (3) of the CCP, the arrestee must be released if the maximum period of arrest prescribed by that Code has expired (see paragraph\u00a055).",
