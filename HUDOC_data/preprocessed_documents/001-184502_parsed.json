The Court finds no reason to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases, particularly in view of the fact that the applicants faced the threat of a penalty for five years. In the Court\u2019s opinion, that condition entailed a real and effective restraint and had a deterrent effect on the exercise of the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression. The Court hence finds that the criminal proceedings brought against the applicants and the judgment of 18 February 2010 amounted to an \u201cinterference\u201d with the exercise of their freedom of expression and that they therefore do have \u201cvictim status\u201d under Article 10.

The Court has examined the interviews in their entirety and, in its view, their content as a whole cannot be construed as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising, or as being capable of inciting to violence by instilling a deep-seated and irrational hatred against identifiable persons, which are essential elements to be taken into account. The Istanbul Assize Court, however, does not appear to have given consideration to the above. The assize court considered that the interviews constituted propaganda in favour of the PKK merely because the applicants conveyed the opinions of Abdullah \u00d6calan, without making an assessment of those interviews in the light of the principles embodied in Article 10. In sum, the Court considers that the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression was not justified by \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons for the purposes of Article 10 of the Convention.",
