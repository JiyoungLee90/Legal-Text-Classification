The case originated in an application (no. 41564/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Gyulzhiyan Mantayevna Abdulmanova (“the applicant”), on 16 July 2005.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Ms V. Milinchuk, former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 9 May 2007 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Aykhal, a town in Yakutia.
In 1990 the applicant subscribed to a State savings scheme for buying a car. The State failed to provide the car, and the applicant sued the Ministry of Finance.
On 19 August 2003 the Mirninskiy District Court awarded the applicant 138,967 Russian roubles (RUB). This judgment became binding on 6 October 2003, but was not enforced immediately.
On 23 October 2003 the District Court mailed enforcement papers to bailiffs. On 27 November 2003 the bailiffs returned the papers because of formal defects and advised the District Court that the judgment had to be enforced by the Ministry directly. On 15 June 2004 the enforcement papers reached the Ministry.
On the Ministry’s request, on 4 March 2005 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of Yakutia quashed the judgment on supervisory review, having found that the District Court had ignored a key material law.
On 4 February 2006 the Ministry paid to the applicant RUB 40,648.27 under the State program of redemption of in-kind debentures.
Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
