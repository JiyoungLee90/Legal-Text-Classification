The Court has already found that a detention order that mentions no grounds or timelimit for the application of a custodial measure cannot afford the applicant the adequate protection from arbitrariness which is an essential element of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0136-37, ECHR\u00a02005X (extracts), and Belevitskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a072967/01, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, 1\u00a0March 2007). It follows that the decision of 15\u00a0August 2006 did not constitute a \u201clawful\u201d basis for the applicant\u2019s detention in the period from 27 August until his conviction at first instance on 10 October 2006.",
