Belgium, 23 June 1981, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 43), as well as proceedings in which the applicant risked expulsion from a professional association even when that would not have precluded him from practising his profession as such (see A.\u00a0v. Finland (dec.), no. 44998/98, 8 January 2004).

In any event, the Court reiterates that the civil limb of Article 6 \u00a7 1 applies even to disputes involving civil servants if domestic law does not bar their access to a court (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no.\u00a063235/00, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2007II). In the present case, the applicant was granted access to a court to contest her suspension from her post.

In the present case, the Court notes that the appellate court was the only instance at which an oral hearing in the proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s suspension from her post was held (see paragraph 15 above). The judgments of the appellate court were final and not subject to any further appeal (see paragraph 23 above). Moreover, on one of the five above-mentioned occasions, the prosecutor was present at the hearing and made oral submissions in favour of the applicant\u2019s suspension from her post (see paragraph 15 above). As a result, the applicant did not have an opportunity to effectively defend herself and to respond to the prosecutor\u2019s submissions in an oral hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0160ven\u010dionien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02728).",

Russia, no. 5605/04, \u00a7 90, 13 March 2012, and the cases cited therein). In the present case, the decision to suspend the applicant from her position as the head of the kindergarten was based on the possibility that she might use her position to interfere with the investigation\u00a0\u2013 to destroy or fabricate evidence, or attempt to influence witnesses. The applicant argued that her previous conduct and positive evaluation by her employers had indicated that such interference was unlikely (see paragraph 13 above). The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s character and conduct were of great relevance for assessing the risk that she might hinder the investigation and thus the need to order a restrictive measure \u2013 in this case suspension from her post (see, mutatis mutandis, Solovyevy v.

The Court will uphold claims for costs and expenses only in so far as they are related to the violations it has found and will reject them in so far as they relate to complaints that have not led to the finding of a violation, or to complaints declared inadmissible. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 100 covering costs under all heads, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
