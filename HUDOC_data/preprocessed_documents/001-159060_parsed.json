The applicant, after being called by Z.C., had arrived at the bakery at 1.30 a.m. on 21 March 2008.

The court also established that there had been a discussion between the accused and the applicant about the newspaper. After the discussion, the applicant had complained to police officer N.S. that he had been hit by a police inspector, alleging that a stain on his shirt had been blood from his nose. The applicant had no visible facial injuries. The Bitola Court of First Instance further indicated that after the applicant had left the police station at about 3 a.m., he had taken part in a fight with unknown individuals at an unknown place, and at 5.30 a.m. he had asked for medical assistance at Ohrid Hospital. Dr\u00a0L.D.B. had examined him, noting in the medical certificate that the injuries had been sustained in a fight. The applicant had further convinced Z.C. to charge G.S. before the DCPS.

After the investigating judge heard oral evidence from the applicant, G.S. and the eyewitnesses (see paragraphs 17-22 above), the public prosecutor withdrew the charges due to lack of evidence.

The public prosecutor remained passive and took no action or steps in the ensuing proceedings. In this connection, the Court would emphasise that victims of alleged violations are not required to pursue the prosecution of State agents on their own. This is the duty of the public prosecutor, who is better placed in that regard (see Kitanovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 15191/12, \u00a7 90, 22 January 2015, and Andonovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 24312/10, \u00a7 90, 23 July 2015).

The first remittal order concerned the investigating judge of the trial court\u2019s decision to discontinue the proceedings launched on the basis of the applicant\u2019s subsidiary indictment (see paragraph 26 above). After 1 June 2010, when the Bitola Court of First Instance obtained jurisdiction to decide the case, it was remitted for reconsideration on four occasions. In all four rounds the Bitola Court of Appeal found that the first-instance court had failed to establish relevant facts regarding the applicant\u2019s injuries. The proceedings are still pending before the Bitola Court of First Instance, notwithstanding that it is more than seven years since G.S. was indicted. In this connection, the Court reiterates that repeated remittal orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see, mutatis mutandis, Wierciszewska v. Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25\u00a0November 2003, and Pavlyulynets v. Ukraine, no. 70767/01, \u00a7 51, 6\u00a0September 2005, in the context of Article 6 of the Convention). The first-instance court\u2019s reluctance to follow the higher court\u2019s instructions not only affected the length of the proceedings, but also stripped the system of its effectiveness. In this connection, the Court observes that the accumulated delay caused the statutory time-limit for charges of bodily injury to expire (see paragraph 46 above), a development which put the proceedings, in that part, at variance with the respondent State\u2019s procedural obligations under Article 3 (see, mutatis mutandis, Aleksandr Nikonenko, cited above, \u00a7 45,).",

In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government (see Orhan v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 25656/94, \u00a7 274, 18 June 2002).",

As to the former, the Court notes that N.S. was the police officer responsible for foreigners to whom the applicant had complained, as established by the domestic courts, at the police station immediately after allegedly being punched in the face. Whereas N.S. did not witness the alleged incident in M.G.\u2019s office, his testimony was of direct importance as to whether the applicant had sustained any injuries while at the police station. In this connection, the Court notes that N.S. gave evidence to the DCPS (on three occasions), the investigating judge of the Resen trial court and the Bitola Court of First Instance. In his statements to the investigating judge and during his first examination in the Bitola Court of First Instance, N.S. clearly stated that he had seen a blood stain on the applicant\u2019s shirt (see paragraphs 21 and 29 above). These statements, in particular the statement to the investigating judge, were made soon after the alleged incident. In his further statements in the Bitola Court of First Instance N.S. was unable to confirm whether he had seen a blood stain on the applicant\u2019s shirt (see paragraphs 31 and 40 above). However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that these statements were given at a later date, in particular the statement of 30 March 2013, which was given five years after the alleged incident. In this connection, it reiterates that over such a long time the memories of witnesses can fade. The Court is unable to refer to N.S.\u2019s statements given in the context of the DCPS internal inquiry because the Government did not present it with a copy of the official police notes (see paragraph 14 above). However, given that the DCPS confirmed N.S.\u2019s statement in this context and did not list his name among the police officers who had denied that any force had been used against the applicant at the police station (see paragraph 13 above), the Court considers that it is only reasonable that N.S. confirmed, to the DCPS also, that he had seen blood on the applicant\u2019s shirt.",

The Government argued that the DCPS had not made any conclusion of fact in the report, but had merely summarised the statements made by the complainants, the accused and the witnesses. In this regard they had relied on the findings of the Bitola Court of First Instance (see paragraph 43 above). However, the Court is not persuaded by this argument. From the wording used and the way the report was drafted it is clear that the DCPS not only presented an outline of the relevant evidence, but went further to establish the facts that corroborated the applicant\u2019s account (see paragraph 13 above). For this reason, the public prosecutor considered this report to be a criminal complaint against G.S. (see paragraph 24 above).",
