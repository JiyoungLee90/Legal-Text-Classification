As regards the nature of the surcharges, the relevant provisions of the AMA Act showed, in the Government\u2019s view, that a surcharge was primarily a lump-sum payment intended to cover the cost of the additional work that had to be performed by AMA upon non-payment of a contribution, namely conducting formal administrative proceedings, and could not therefore be regarded as a penalty.

According to the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 must be construed in the light of the principle laid down in the Article\u2019s first sentence. Consequently, an interference must achieve a \"fair balance\" between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, including the second paragraph: there must therefore be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued (ibid, \u00a7\u00a062). That balance will be lacking where the person concerned has to bear an individual and excessive burden (see Wieczorek v. Poland, no. 18176/05, \u00a7\u00a059, 8 December 2009).",
