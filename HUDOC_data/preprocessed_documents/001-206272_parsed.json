Italy [GC], nos. 1828/06 and 2 others, \u00a7 292, 28 June 2018), the Court reiterates that, when speaking of \u201claw\u201d, Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 alludes to the same concept that is to be found elsewhere in the Convention (see G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others, ibid, and Gu\u0163\u0103 Tudor Teodorescu v. Romania, no. 33751/05, \u00a7 42, 5 April 2016). This concept requires firstly that the impugned measures should have a basis in domestic law. It also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it be accessible to the persons concerned, precise, and foreseeable (see Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2000-I, and Batkivska Turbota Foundation v. Ukraine, no. 5876/15, \u00a7 56, 9 October 2018). Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. The issue of whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights only becomes relevant once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary (see Rafig Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a045875/06, \u00a7 119, 6\u00a0December 2011, and Fedulov v. Russia, no.\u00a053068/08, \u00a7 75, 8 October 2019).",

However, the Court notes that in the instant case it cannot accept the reasons provided by the domestic courts as relevant and sufficient for the purpose of justifying the interference in question. It observes that the domestic courts refrained from addressing the applicant\u2019s arguments that the seizure of his books in the first place had been effected contrary to the legislative requirements, namely in the absence of any court decision whatsoever; nor did they attempt to provide any interpretation of the legislation or rely on any existing or accessible jurisprudence that could be interpreted, in a precise and foreseeable manner, as being applicable to the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s property. Instead, in their decisions, the courts confined themselves to examining the lawfulness of the Committee\u2019s refusal to return the books in question to the applicant. In doing so, they reasoned their findings by reference to Article 9.2 of the Regulation and the need to prevent the applicant from distributing the seized books. However, both the domestic courts and the Government, in their submissions before the Court, failed to provide any explanation as to how Article 9.2 of the Regulation could be applied in respect of the applicant, who was a private individual whose responsibility for distributing religious literature had never been examined or established in any proceedings, judicial or otherwise.",

This aspect of the right set out in the first paragraph of Article\u00a09, to hold any religious belief and to change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However, as further set out in Article 9 \u00a7 1, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one\u2019s belief alone and in private, but also to practise in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25\u00a0May 1993, \u00a7\u00a031, Series A no. 260A, and Leyla \u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0105). Since the manifestation by one person of his or her religious belief may have an impact on others, the drafters of the Convention qualified this aspect of freedom of religion in the manner set out in Article\u00a09 \u00a7\u00a02. This second paragraph provides that any limitation placed on a person\u2019s freedom to manifest religion or belief must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of one or more of the legitimate aims set out therein (see Eweida and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a048420/10 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a080, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).",

However, while both Article 22 of the Law and paragraph 9.2 of the Regulation gave the Committee the rights to control various aspects concerning religious literature in respect of religious communities, Article 22 of the Law clearly provided for the rights of individuals to freely obtain and use religious literature. In this regard, the Court also refers to its findings in paragraph 33 above concerning the domestic courts\u2019 failure to provide any legal assessment in respect of the applicability of Article 9.2 of the Regulation to the applicant\u2019s case, as he was a private individual who had never been involved in the distribution of religious literature.
