The properties formed part of the \u201cshort life\u201d property of Lambeth, meaning that they were scheduled for demolition, redevelopment or works. Following aggressive squatting, which exacerbated the poor condition of the properties, and an increase in responsibilities on local housing authorities to provide shelter for homeless people, Lambeth began to consider a scheme under which housing associations would take over short life property and find and manage tenants until the property was required by Lambeth for demolition or redevelopment. In around 1977, Lambeth began informally licensing short life property to the  and Quadrant Housing Trust (\u201cLQHT\u201d), a charitable housing trust, in order that the latter could provide temporary accommodation for homeless people to whom Lambeth owed a statutory duty to arrange accommodation. However, some of the short life property could not be made suitable for use by homeless families and so, in a separate arrangement in 1979, Lambeth began to pass properties to LQHT and other bodies to use as housing for those to whom no statutory duty was owed and who would not generally be allocated housing by Lambeth. This was called the \u201csingles scheme\u201d. The applicants were all provided with housing under the singles scheme.",

In 1995, the licence arrangement was replaced by individual ten-year leases of each property granted to LQHT by Lambeth. The leases were subject to a break clause allowing either party to terminate the leases early on just over six months' notice. One purpose of the grant of the individual head leases was to allow LQHT to replace its licences to the applicants with assured shorthold tenancies, which would prevent them from acquiring security of tenure under the Housing Act 1985 (\u201cthe 1985 Act\u201d).

The possession orders sought by Lambeth engage the article 8 right to respect for the home of the respective occupiers from whom possession was sought.

There was nothing discriminatory or unusual about the statutory and common law framework that produced that result nor about the absence of any statutory protection given to the occupiers by the housing legislation. I respectfully agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill's remarks in para 36 of his opinion that the balance required by article 8(2) to be struck was struck by the general law, that the public authority owner had a right to manage and control its property within the bounds set by statute, that the occupier acquired only a limited right to occupy and that on due determination of that right, a claim by the owner must ordinarily succeed. The appellants ... could not resist Lambeth's possession applications on article 8 grounds unless either they mounted an article 8 attack on the legal framework that entitled Lambeth to possession or they attacked on article 8 grounds Lambeth's decision to seek possession. The first attack was not attempted, and, if it had been, would in my opinion have been bound to fail. There is nothing the matter, from an article 8 standpoint, with a common law rule which gives the owner of property, which is occupied as a home by a person who has no right as against the owner to remain there, the right to recover possession of the property. Parliament's omission to provide any statutory security of tenure for home occupiers in the position in which the [appellants] found themselves is well within the wide margin of appreciation referred to in Blecic.",

The successful article 8 defence in Connors was founded on a combination of Mr Connors inability to enjoy the security of tenure advantages afforded by statute to occupiers of privately owned caravan sites and on the Strasbourg court's perception (which I think was an unjustified perception) of a lack of sufficient procedural safeguards enabling him to dispute the grounds which had led the council to terminate his site licence.\u201d",

My opinion is rather, and at this stage I state it very broadly, that although article 8 is clearly engaged in every home repossession case, its requirements are satisfied provided only and always, first, that the substantive domestic law under which the order is sought strikes an acceptable balance between the competing needs and rights at stake and, secondly, that that law is properly applied by the domestic court with the occupier being given a fair opportunity to invoke any defence available to him under it. If either of those two conditions is not satisfied then, I accept, a complaint would properly sound under article 8.

(1) It is not necessary for a local authority to plead or prove in every case that domestic law complies with article 8. Courts should proceed on the assumption that domestic law strikes a fair balance and is compatible with article 8. (2) If the court, following its usual procedures, is satisfied that the domestic law requirements for making a possession order have been met the court should make a possession order unless the occupier shows that, highly exceptionally, he has a seriously arguable case on one of two grounds. (3) The two grounds are: (a) that the law which requires the court to make a possession order despite the occupier's personal circumstances is Convention-incompatible; and (b) that, having regard to the occupier's personal circumstances, the local authority's exercise of its power to seek a possession order is an unlawful act within the meaning of section 6. (4) Deciding whether the defendant has a seriously arguable case on one or both of these grounds will not call for a fullblown trial. This question should be decided summarily, on the basis of an affidavit or of the defendant's defence, suitably particularised, or in whatever other summary way the court considers appropriate. The procedural aim of the court must be to decide this question as expeditiously as is consistent with the defendant having a fair opportunity to present his case on this question. (5) If the court considers the defence sought to be raised on one or both of these grounds is not seriously arguable the court should proceed to make a possession order. (6) Where a seriously arguable issue on one of these grounds is raised, the court should itself decide this issue, subject to this: where an issue arises on the application of section 3 [of the Human Rights Act 1998] the judge should consider whether it may be appropriate to refer the proceedings to the High Court\u201d.",

The appellants fall outside the categories to which Parliament has extended a measure of protection.

In para 208 Lord Brown too acknowledged that this was a quite different basis from that which the Act provides upon which a public authority's claim for possession could be challenged. In para 110 of my own speech I described this as a challenge that would be made at common law, on the ground that the decision was one that no reasonable person would consider justifiable. In para 114 I said that the grounds on which the decision to claim possession could be judicially reviewed were whether it was arbitrary, unreasonable or disproportionate.",

The court is not bound to make the order if the decision to seek it can be challenged on the ground that it was an improper exercise of the respondent's powers. In this respect the two routes, or 'gateways', may be said to work together to address the incompatibility due to the lack of a procedural safeguard, which is the fundamental point that is at issue in this case. Gateway (a) addresses the question whether the court can read and give effect to the statutes in a way that is compatible with article 8. If it cannot do this, it will be open to the defendant by way of a defence to argue under gateway (b) that the order should not be made unless the court is satisfied, upon reviewing the respondent's decision to seek a possession order on the grounds that it gave and bearing in mind that it was doing what the legislation authorised, that the decision to do this was in the Wednesbury sense not unreasonable. This route offers a procedural protection under the common law. If taken, it will enable the grounds on which the respondent based its decision to be scrutinised. It might, on the facts of this case, provide the appellant with an effective defence to the making of the possession order. The fact that it is available as a defence seems to me to strengthen the argument, should it be needed, that it also provides him with the protection which he seeks against an infringement of his Convention right.",

But in a case in which it is not reasonably arguable on the face of the pleadings, or from the contents of the affidavits that have been filed, that that is so, the judge can be expected to make a summary order for possession. The adjective 'summary' in this context does not mean that the judge would not have considered the proportionality of the requested possession order. It means that the article 8 case put forward by the defendant for a conclusion that a possession order would be disproportionate is not, in the opinion of the judge, capable of being sustained by serious argument. The notion that a defence based on an article 8 right to respect for a home requires the case to proceed to a full trial even though it is apparent that the defence cannot succeed is clearly absurd.

Doran would however suggest that in conducting a review of the council's decision Doherty has held that something wider than the Wednesbury rationality test was appropriate.

They argued that such an application would ordinarily be dealt with by consideration of the pleaded material and oral argument. They contended that in their cases, the proportionality issue should have been determined by the court hearing the possession proceedings after it had carried out a fact finding exercise: the authority would advance reasons for seeking possession and the applicants would refer to facts which they alleged rendered the decision to seek possession disproportionate. The factual issues likely to be raised by the applicants included their lengthy occupation of the properties, the improvement works carried out by them, their personal and family circumstances, the factual correctness (or otherwise) of the authority's reasons for seeking possession and whether there was a need for vacant possession. However, in their cases no oral evidence was given and there was no cross-examination or determination of the facts relevant to the Article 8 issues. The county court had simply to accept the facts as found by the public authority landlord. The applicants argued that the Government's contention that it was sufficient that there existed the possibility for a court to consider whether a local authority had come to a decision which no reasonable authority would consider justifiable did not accord with this Court's decisions in Connors v. the United Kingdom and McCann v. the United Kingdom, both cited above.",

They pointed to their witness statements which they argued set out in sufficient detail why their personal circumstances were such that to make a possession order in their circumstances would be disproportionate. The witness statements were filed in the county court proceedings and were also before the Court of Appeal, although they were not before the House of Lords in light of the nature of those proceedings. The witness statements highlighted in particular that Ms Barnett, Mr Constantine, Mr Gorman and Mr Greenhalgh had received no offer of alternative accommodation, despite having been advised that an offer would be made. In Mr Kay's case, he had not pursued the offer of alternative accommodation because it was clear that such offer would exclude his partner, even though they were living together and she was pregnant with his child. Mr Cole and Mr Breschinsky had refused offers and provided reasons for their refusal which were never addressed, and no further offer was made. Had these matters been considered in evidence, they might have been relevant to the question of the proportionality of the decision to seek possession in their cases. The applicants further argued that it was speculative for the Government to say that no disputed issues of fact arose in the present case, because the facts did not reach the stage of being put in issue. It was therefore impossible to tell whether a dispute existed. In light of Baroness Hale's assertion in the House of Lords that all of the appellants had been offered alternative accommodation (see paragraph 24 above) it would appear that there was a dispute in this respect at least.",

Although the distance between conventional judicial review grounds and Human Rights Act grounds appeared to be narrowing, the extent to which conventional judicial review grounds could be said to encompass proportionality remained unclear. Accordingly, the scope of the defence that the Government allege was open to the applicants remained uncertain even after Doherty. In the applicants' view, the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Doran and  had added to the general confusion at domestic level as to the approach to be taken in possession cases. They pointed to the different approach taken by Waller LJ in Taylor, compared to Toulson LJ's approach in Doran, as regards the relevance of personal circumstances and the extent to which the public authority was required to inquire before seeking a possession order (see paragraphs 38 to 43 above). They emphasised that the lower courts were required to apply both of these decisions, notwithstanding the divergent approaches. In any event, clarifications in post-Kay judgments were of limited assistance and relevance to consideration of the applicants' cases.",

Unlike McCann, cited above, the present case did not involve a disputed issue of fact but turned on whether the decision by Lambeth to seek possession orders pursued a legitimate aim and whether it was proportionate.

The Government further argued that the decision in Doran v. Liverpool City Council demonstrated that the category of circumstances that would be relevant to whether a defence should succeed was not closed, that the relevant circumstances could include the personal circumstances of the occupiers (and all other matters that would be material to any issue arising under Article 8) and that the principles which underpinned the application of the common law defence were strongly influenced by those which underpinned the Convention. In many situations, the question whether the decision by the public authority to seek repossession was unreasonable at common law would yield the same answer as the question whether the decision was a disproportionate interference with an individual's Article 8 rights.",

They argued that they were entitled to adopt a general legislative scheme applicable to specific types of occupation which balanced the interests of the occupiers and owners of properties and made provision for the conditions which had to be satisfied before the owners could recover possession of their properties. The legislative schemes in place provided specific protection for tenants and the fact that the applicants fell outside these schemes would itself be a weighty factor in support of the conclusion that any interference with the applicants' Article 8 rights was justified. In the present case, there was no factual dispute and, accordingly, the court was right to conclude that pursuant to the legislation in force, the application for repossession was a justified interference. The Government concluded that where it had been decided not to provide statutory protection, it would only be in a highly exceptional case that it would even be arguable that Article 8 provided a defence to possession proceedings.",

The EHRC supported the approach of the minority of the House of Lords in Qazi and Kay. It agreed that where the law gave a social landlord (i.e. a local authority landlord or a registered social landlord) an unqualified right to possession, it would be only in exceptional cases that the eviction was not proportionate. Proportionality was most likely to be an issue in respect of occupants who were vulnerable as a result of mental illness, physical or learning disabilities, poor health or frailty. Such individuals were less likely to seek legal advice or attend court. In these cases, proportionality might require local authorities to justify why they were not securing suitable alternative accommodation, an obligation which merely required them to satisfy the court that they were complying with their public law duties. Further, the EHRC argued that it was for the court to ensure in every case that the proportionality of the eviction had been properly considered: examination of this question should not depend on the defendant raising the issue.",

However, in the cases of individuals who had occupied social housing for substantial periods but did not have security of tenure, in joint tenancies which could be determined by a notice to quit served by one tenant only and in cases involving family members without a statutory right of succession following the death of the entitled tenant, difficulties had arisen.

On the other hand, in spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the planning context where the Court has found that \u201c[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation (Buckley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 26 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1292, \u00a7 75 in fine). The Court has also stated that in spheres such as housing, which play a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, it will respect the legislature's judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Mellacher and Others v. Austria, judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 169, p. 27, \u00a7\u00a045, Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, ECHR 1999-V, \u00a7 49).

As set out above (see paragraph 31), Lord Hope in Doherty explained that the majority view in Kay was that the personal interests safeguarded by Article 8 must be taken to have been sufficiently safeguarded by the fulfilment of the requirements for the recovery of possession by the landowner laid down by the statute or by the common law. He emphasised that it was on this point that the majority in Kay differed from the minority, referring to ground (3)(b) in paragraph 39 of Lord Bingham's opinion (see paragraph 28 above).\u00a0\u00a0Lord Scott also noted that the only proposition in Lord Bingham's test in Kay which was in any respect inconsistent with the majority opinions was in Lord Bingham's wider gateway (b), which according to Lord Scott attributed to the occupier's personal circumstances a central importance that the majority opinions did not accept.",

However, notwithstanding these developments, the Court considers that at the time that the applicants' cases were considered by the domestic courts, there was an important distinction between the majority and minority approaches in the House of Lords, as demonstrated by the opinions in Kay itself. In McCann, the Court agreed with the minority approach although it noted that, in the great majority of cases, an order for possession could continue to be made in summary proceedings and that it would be only in very exceptional cases that an applicant would succeed in raising an arguable case which would require a court to examine the issue (see McCann, cited above, \u00a7 54). To the extent that, in light of Doherty, the gateway (b) test set out by Lord Hope in Kay should now be applied in a more flexible manner, allowing for personal circumstances to be relevant to the county court's assessment of the reasonableness of a decision to seek a possession order, the Court emphasises that this development occurred after the disposal of the applicants' proceedings.",

Moreover, the vulnerability of the applicant as a member of a minority gypsy community was an important factor in that case.",

It is far from clear from the applicants' submissions that, had a domestic tribunal been in a position to assess the proportionality of the eviction, the possession order would not still have been granted. The Court therefore considers that the present applicants are closer to the situation in McCann. The applicants were deprived of their homes without the opportunity to obtain a ruling on the issues under Article 8 and as a result suffered some non-pecuniary damage, in particular feelings of frustration and injustice, not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention (see McCann, cited above, \u00a7 59).\u00a0Accordingly, it considers that the sum of EUR 2,000 in respect of each applicant would be an appropriate award under this head.",
