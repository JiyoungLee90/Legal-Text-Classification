In respect of the grounds of nullity under Article 281 para. 1 (5), the Supreme Court found that the complaints were an attempt to challenge the assessment of the evidence made by the trial judges and as such inadmissible and insufficient to constitute a ground of nullity.  Notwithstanding the applicant's assertion to the contrary, the Supreme Court also found that there had in fact been a confrontation between the two witnesses and the applicant's brother.  The appeal on grounds of nullity was rejected.  The Supreme Court remitted the applicant's appeal against sentence to the Innsbruck Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht).  ",

In the present case, the presiding judge had informed the defence before the trial that one of the members of the court had taken part in the investigation proceedings.  He had then invited the applicant's lawyer to say whether he wished to challenge that judge on that account.  The applicant's lawyer had not replied (see paragraph 9 above).  At the hearing, before the court began to take evidence, the presiding judge had again enquired whether the parties had any objection to Judge Schaumburger's participation. The record of the trial showed that the parties had waived their right to raise this point as a ground of nullity (see paragraph 10 above).  No request was filed for an amendment or rectification of the record of the trial. Contrary to what occurred in the case of Pfeifer and Plankl v. Austria (judgment of 25 February 1992, Series A no. 227, pp. 16-17, paras. 35-39), in which the Court took the view that the waiver was invalid, the offer of waiver in the present case, as the record of the trial shows, was accepted by experienced legal counsel in an unequivocal manner.

Otherwise, the Commission agreed with the main thrust of the Government's arguments and found that the applicant was entitled to, and validly did, waive his right to challenge Judge Schaumburger.  ",

However, it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see, mutatis mutandis, the Casado Coca v.  judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 285-A, p. 18, para. 43).  In the instant case the Court observes that both the  and the Supreme Court interpreted the law as meaning that a waiver could lawfully be made (see paragraph 15 above).

In the instant case the fear that the trial court might not be impartial was based on the fact that one of its members had questioned witnesses during the preliminary investigation.

However, whether these misgivings should be treated as objectively justified depends on the circumstances of each particular case; the mere fact that a trial judge has also dealt with the case at the pre-trial stage cannot be held as in itself justifying fears as to his impartiality (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, pp. 21-22, paras. 49-50, and the Nortier v. the Netherlands judgment of 24 August 1993, Series A no. 267, p. 15, para. 33).  ",

In fact, it has not been established that he had to take any procedural decisions at all.  His role was limited in time and consisted of questioning two witnesses.  It did not entail any assessment of the evidence by him nor did it require him to reach any kind of conclusion as to the applicant's involvement. In this limited context, the applicant's fear that the  lacked impartiality cannot be regarded as objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, the Nortier judgment cited above, p. 16, para. 37).  In any event, it is not open to the applicant to complain that he had legitimate reasons to doubt the impartiality of the court which tried him, when he had the right to challenge its composition but refrained from doing so. There has therefore been no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention as far as the applicant's first complaint is concerned. ",

It further notes that the Supreme Court rejected Mr Bulut's appeal pursuant to Article 285d para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 20 above).  Under this provision the Supreme Court, in summary proceedings, may refuse further consideration of an appeal which it unanimously regards as manifestly lacking any merit.  The nature of the review can therefore be compared to that of proceedings for leave to appeal.  Moreover, the Court is not satisfied that the grounds of nullity under Article 281 para. 1 (4) and (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as formulated by the applicant (see paragraph 13 above), raised questions of fact bearing on the assessment of the applicant's guilt or innocence that would have necessitated a hearing.  They essentially challenged the trial court's assessment of the available evidence, a challenge which the Supreme Court considered inadmissible. Accordingly, the Court finds no violation as regards the Supreme Court's failure to hold a hearing.  ",

However, this obligation did not apply in cases like the one at issue, where the prosecution merely opposed the appeal without giving any reasons.  In that case, it was assumed that there was no need for the accused to amend his appeal. The Government further submitted that in the instant case the Attorney-General merely expressed the opinion that it was appropriate to deal with the appeal in the manner prescribed in Article 285d of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 14 above).  These observations were of a purely procedural nature; they contained no arguments as to the merits of the appeal.

In those circumstances, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) was seen to require that the rights of the defence and the principle of the equality of arms be respected.

As to the Government's plea that the Attorney-General's observations merely requested that the case be dealt with under Article 285d of the Code of Criminal Procedure without giving any reasons (see paragraph 14 above), it is perhaps worth pointing out that in the Lobo Machado case cited above, the Court, in the less stringent context of a social dispute, did not consider it admissible for the Attorney-General's representative to submit a final statement which briefly requested that the appeal court's decision should be upheld.  In the present criminal appeal, the submission of the observations allowed the Attorney-General to take up a clear position as to the applicant's appeal, a position which was not communicated to the defence and to which the defence could not reply.  In any event, as the Commission rightly pointed out, the principle of the equality of arms does not depend on further, quantifiable unfairness flowing from a procedural inequality.  It is a matter for the defence to assess whether a submission deserves a reaction.  It is therefore unfair for the prosecution to make submissions to a court without the knowledge of the defence.  ",

The instant case gave the Court an opportunity to decide the issue.  Yet it has not considered it appropriate to do so, despite both parties' allegations.  The Government alleged that Mr Bulut had not exercised his right to challenge Judge Schaumburger (paragraph 27) and the applicant expressly stated that such a waiver would be impossible in law (paragraph 26); the national courts had interpreted Austrian law (paragraphs 18-20) as meaning that a waiver could lawfully be made.

I cannot concur in this reasoning.  Mr Bulut, a 21-year-old waiter of Turkish nationality, was not under an onus to prove what role had been played by Judge Schaumburger in the investigation of the case. The onus lay exclusively on the Austrian Government to show that the steps carried out by Judge Schaumburger were of no significance in the proceedings, and the failure to discharge it should not in any way benefit the Government; on the contrary, they should suffer the consequences of that failure.",

Since the extent of Judge Schaumburger's intervention in the preliminary investigation is not known, I cannot concur in the majority's reasoning here either.  But it is clear that for the investigating judge to be able to question witnesses, he must have a knowledge of the case and take an active role which inevitably entails an assessment of the evidence and of the witnesses that could lead him to prejudge the accused's guilt or innocence.  It is precisely for this reason that a judge who has taken part in the investigation by carrying out such steps must never try the case.  The trial judge's view must be formed exclusively by evidence produced \"in the presence of the accused at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument\" (Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 78).",

In the instant case, for example, having regard to Mr Bulut's personal circumstances and the offence with which he was charged (paragraph 8), this omission could also have been explained by a fear that making such a challenge might be prejudicial to him.  At all events, the objectiveness of his doubts and Article 68 para. 2 of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure (paragraph 18) required that Judge Schaumburger withdraw of his own motion in accordance with our Court's case-law (see the following judgments: Piersack v. Belgium, 1 October 1982, Series A no. 53, pp. 14-15, para. 30; De Cubber, previously cited, p. 14, para. 26; and Hauschildt, previously cited, p. 21, para. 48): \"... any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw.
