For this to hold true, the authorities must have acknowledged and afforded adequate redress for the alleged breach of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Morby v. Luxemburg (dec.), no. 27156/02, 13 December 2003). In the instant case, the domestic courts acknowledged that the authorities' failure to deliver an apartment had been unlawful and awarded the applicants non-pecuniary damages (see paragraph 13 above). However, their judgments only concerned the period before 2000 whereas the present complaint covers the period up to 2007 when the applicants received an apartment. Furthermore, the applicants did not receive any pecuniary damages. The Court thus considers that the applicants did not lose their status of victims of the alleged breach of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1.",

Furthermore, as the applicants could not have predicted when the authorities would fulfil their obligation to build and deliver the apartment, they would have been periodically forced to lodge new actions and seek further compensation.

In Kirilova and Others and in Lazarov the Court found that the fair balance required under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 had not been achieved due to the long delays in providing the apartments, the authorities' passive attitude, and the long period of uncertainty endured by the applicants. Therefore, the applicants had to bear a special and excessive burden (see Kirilova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 123, and Lazarov, cited above, \u00a7 32). As the circumstances of the present case are identical, the Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion. In particular, it does not consider that the eventual delivery of an apartment to the applicants, after a delay of more than sixteen years, and the partial compensation awarded in respect of the period up to 2000, could be seen as sufficient and timely steps capable of restoring the fair balance under Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 (see Lazarov, cited above, \u00a7 32).",
