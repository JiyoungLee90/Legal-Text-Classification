The criminal investigation had related to alleged arbitrary access to the EDS database. It had never been disputed that poor security had made the access possible.

In the present case, irrespective of whether the identity of the applicant\u2019s source was discovered during the search, as found by the Ombudsman, or at the very least confirmed during that search, as submitted by the applicant, it nevertheless remains that the seized data storage devices contained not only information capable of identifying her source of information, pertaining either to \u201cthe factual circumstances of acquiring information\u201d from her source or to \u201cthe unpublished content\u201d of that information, but also information capable of identifying her other sources of information.

Indeed, in accordance with the ordinary procedure under section 180 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the investigating judge weighs the potential risks and respective interests prior to authorising a search.

The distinguishing feature lies not, as the Government suggested, in the fact that I.P.\u2019s identity had been known to the investigating authorities prior to the applicant\u2019s search, which fact does not remove the applicant\u2019s protection under Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraphs 78-83 above). The Court has already held that a search conducted with a view to identifying a journalist\u2019s source is a more drastic measure than an order to divulge the source\u2019s identity (see the above-cited cases Roemen and Schmit, \u00a7 57, and Ernst and Others, \u00a7 103). The Court considers that it is even more so in the circumstances of the present case, where the search warrant was drafted in such vague terms as to allow the seizure of \u201cany information\u201d pertaining to the crime under investigation allegedly committed by the journalist\u2019s source, irrespective of whether or not his identity had already been known to the investigating authorities. As the Court has already noted in Roemen and Schmit and Ernst and Others, investigators who raid a journalist\u2019s workplace or home unannounced and are armed with search warrants have very wide investigative powers, as, by definition, they have access to all the documentation held by the journalist. The Court reiterates that limitations on the confidentiality of journalistic sources call for the most careful scrutiny by the Court.",

The Government have submitted to the Court that the investigating authorities were faced with the task of classifying the crime allegedly committed by I.P. and establishing the applicant\u2019s role.

It is not insignificant that, around the same time, legislative amendments were being drafted to make information concerning salaries in public institutions available to the general public (see paragraph 39 above). In addition, the applicant\u2019s broadcast also exposed security flaws in the database of the State Revenue Service, which had been discovered by her source. Admittedly, the actions of her source are subject to a pending criminal investigation. The applicant herself, however, for the purposes of this investigation was questioned as a witness; it appears that her procedural status remained unaltered throughout this investigation. The Court emphasises that the right of journalists not to disclose their sources cannot be considered a mere privilege to be granted or taken away depending on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of their sources, but is part and parcel of the right to information, to be treated with the utmost caution (see Tillack, cited above, \u00a7 65). Given the multiple interests in issue, the Court emphasises that the conduct of the source will merely operate as one factor to be taken into consideration in carrying out the balancing exercise required under Article\u00a010 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Financial Times Ltd and Others, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

According to the investigator, since that date there had been no further communication between the applicant and her source. In this respect, the Court notes that when the investigating authorities, almost three months after the broadcast and after the applicant had agreed to testify, decided that a search at her home was necessary, they proceeded under the urgent procedure without any judicial authority having properly examined the relationship of proportionality between the public interest of investigation, on the one hand, and the protection of the journalist\u2019s freedom of expression, on the other hand.",

In the present case, although the investigating judge\u2019s involvement in an immediate post factum review was provided for in the law, the Court finds that the investigating judge failed to establish that the interests of the investigation in securing evidence were sufficient to override the public interest in the protection of the journalist\u2019s freedom of expression, including source protection and protection against the handover of the research material. The scarce reasoning of the President of the court as to the perishable nature of evidence linked to cybercrimes in general, as the Ombudsman rightly concluded, cannot be considered sufficient in the present case, given the investigating authorities\u2019 delay in carrying out the search and the lack of any indication of impending destruction of evidence. Nor was there any suggestion that the applicant was responsible for disseminating personal data or was implicated in the events other than in her capacity as a journalist; she remained \u201ca witness\u201d for the purposes of these criminal proceedings. If the case materials did include any indication in that regard, it was the investigating judge\u2019s responsibility to carry out the necessary assessment of the conflicting interests, which was not done.",
