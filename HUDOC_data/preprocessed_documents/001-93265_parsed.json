The applicant association has sought the review of the Federal Court\u2019s judgment without explaining the extent to which this is necessary following the European Court\u2019s judgment of 28 June 2001. VgT evidently assumes that the Strasbourg Court\u2019s decision against Switzerland in itself makes the reopening of the proceedings necessary, but that is not the case. The mere fact that the Court, ruling on an individual application, has found a violation of the Convention does not mean that the Federal Court judgment in issue must automatically be reviewed in accordance with domestic law (see judgment 2A.363/2001 of 6 November 2001 in the Boultif case, point 3a/cc; Martin Philip Wyss, \u2018EMRK-Verletzung und bundesrechtliche Revision nach Art. 139a OG\u2019, in recht 1999, p. 100; Sch\u00fcrmann, op. cit., p. 100; Hottelier, op. cit., p. 749; BBl 1991 II 465, p. 529). Being a subsidiary remedy, reopening is justified only if it appears to remain necessary notwithstanding the compensation awarded by the European Court of Human Rights and constitutes the only means of obtaining redress (see Sch\u00fcrmann, op. cit., p. 102; Wyss, op. cit., p.\u00a099). The application to reopen the proceedings must give at least a broad indication of how redress may be obtained only by this means (see judgment 2A.363/2001 of 6\u00a0November 2001 in the Boultif case, point 3b/cc).",

By taking this action, VgT itself proves that it is not continuing to suffer any practical adverse effects that can only be redressed by reopening the proceedings. It does not claim that it still has an interest in having the original commercial broadcast; it is, moreover, unlikely that this is the case, since VgT\u2019s primary objective is no longer (solely) to encourage a decline in meat consumption and to denounce the conditions in which animals are reared (which are also likely to have changed in the almost eight years since the commercial was intended to have been broadcast), but to publicise the Court\u2019s finding of a violation of its freedom of expression. It is thus no longer the same commercial that is under discussion today. The consequences of the Convention violation committed at the time were redressed as a result of the judgment against Switzerland and the award of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention; the new agreement which VgT now wishes to conclude must form the subject of separate proceedings.",

The European Court of Human Rights did not share this view and held that there was no justification in a democratic society for refusing to broadcast a commercial on the ground that it constituted political advertising, which was banned on television. The Court did not express an opinion on whether and to what extent Switzerland, by not ensuring that the commercial could be broadcast, had breached any positive obligations resulting from the extension of the Convention safeguards to relations between private entities (see paragraph 46 of the Court\u2019s judgment). The subject of the Federal Court\u2019s judgment was the finding by the authorities that VgT\u2019s commercial could be considered \u2018political\u2019 within the meaning of the Radio and Television Act and that the refusal to broadcast it could be justified on this public-law ground alone. The judgment did not deal with the question whether the Swiss Radio and Television Company had boycotted VgT, whether the company dominated the advertising market and whether, on that account, it would have been under an obligation to conclude an advertising agreement. These (civil law) aspects of an obligation to contract must be addressed in the appropriate form of civil proceedings (concerning cartel law, competition law or the general law relating to personality rights) and not under the law governing trading licences. This argument, which Switzerland put forward, was not contested by the European Court.",

The rules of competition and cartel law or the possibility of asserting a civil-law obligation to contract are intended to encourage a means of implementing fundamental rights that is fair and strikes a balance between the various interests at stake in the sphere of economic relations between private entities. VgT is free to use this legal remedy in seeking to have its commercial broadcast, provided that, contrary to what has been said above, it still has a real interest in the broadcast; in that eventuality, due regard will have to be had in the proceedings to its constitutional rights and the principles enshrined in Article 10 of the Convention (see Article 35 of the Federal Constitution). The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights does not conflict with this view; however, all that can be inferred from the judgment is that the classification of the commercial as \u2018political advertising\u2019 did not justify refusing to broadcast it, or that the broadcasting of the commercial by the Swiss Radio and Television Company, on the basis of Article\u00a010 of the Convention, should not have had any consequences for the broadcaster under the law relating to trading licences. The Swiss Radio and Television Company rightly points out that the judgment cannot be construed as requiring it to broadcast the commercial in issue in breach of the existing legal rules (such as the provisions of the Federal Unfair Competition Act), since the European Court did not address the corresponding questions, limited itself to examining the issue of \u2018political\u2019 advertising and did not state any position on the Swiss Radio and Television Company\u2019s \u2018negative\u2019 freedom of expression. Since the Court\u2019s judgment simply finds that the prohibition of political advertising on television must not stand in the way of broadcasting the commercial, VgT must seek to have it broadcast through recourse to the civil courts and not through the reopening procedure, should the Swiss Radio and Television Company, or rather Publisuisse SA, still refuse to broadcast it (see Ulrike Preissler, Die Zul\u00e4ssigkeit ideeller Werbung im Fernsehen, dissertation, Bonn 1994, pp. 113 et seq.; Martin Dumeruth, \u2018Rundfunkrecht\u2019, in Koller/M\u00fcller/Rhinow/ Zimmerli (eds.), Schweizerisches Bundesverwaltungsrecht, Basle 1996, note 126; Rolf H.

The applicant association had requested the Federal Office of Communication to issue a declaratory order to the effect that, under Article 10 of the Convention, VgT was entitled to have its commercial broadcast (\u2018right to broadcast advertising\u2019). The Federal Court acknowledged from a procedural point of view that a right to have such an order issued existed (section 25 of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act in conjunction with Article 13 of the Convention) but ruled in the instant case \u2013 wrongly in the European Court\u2019s view \u2013 on the basis of section 18(5) of the Federal Radio and Television Act that there was no right of access to television for political advertising. If the Federal Court had decided in the same way as the European Court, it would have had to limit itself to finding that the Swiss Radio and Television Company had not been entitled to refuse to broadcast the commercial on the ground that it was political in nature, or rather that reliance on this ground for the refusal was contrary to Article 10 of the Convention. On the other hand, given the lack of legal basis, the Federal Court could not have ordered the Swiss Radio and Television Company to broadcast the commercial in the context of proceedings governed by broadcasting legislation (see Dumermuth, op. cit., note 491). VgT is now seeking such an order solely by way of the reopening procedure, but it cannot obtain it in relation to the decision to be reviewed. The Federal Court cannot make an order, following a judgment of the Strasbourg Court, that it was not empowered to make in the original proceedings (see judgment 2A.232/2000 of 2 March 2001 in the Amann case, point\u00a03b/bb, published in EuGRZ 2001, p. 322).",

The mere fact that there has been a breach of the Convention does not mean that the decision referred to the European Court has to be reviewed. This follows from the very nature of the reopening procedure, which is an extraordinary remedy. Accordingly, if there is another ordinary remedy that could afford redress, that remedy should be used first. The answer to this question depends on the nature of the Convention violation that has been found. Where only material interests remain at stake, the proceedings cannot in principle be reopened. However, where the unlawful situation persists despite the European Court\u2019s finding of a violation of the Convention, a review is possible. The proceedings are then reopened within the limits of the relevant ground (see, with reference to the Federal Judicature Act, judgment 2A.232/2000 of 2 March 2001, point 2b/bb, published in: Pra 2001 no. 92, p. 538, and the judgments cited; and, with reference to the Federal Court Act, Elisabeth Escher, in Basler Kommentar BGG, Basle 2008, note\u00a06 on section 122; judgment 1F_1/2007 of 30 July 2007, point 3.2).",

An action to that end could not, according to the European Court\u2019s case-law, be regarded as an effective remedy on the basis of which a plea of inadmissibility could be raised against the applicants for failure to exhaust domestic remedies. The European Court also held that the adopter and the adopted person\u2019s mother could not be required to marry in order to restore the adopted person\u2019s relationship with her mother. In the Court\u2019s view, it is not for the national authorities to take the place of those concerned in reaching a decision as to the form of communal life they wish to adopt. The concept of family under Article 8 of the Convention is, moreover, not confined to marriage-based relationships. Accordingly, unless the mother-daughter relationship is restored and an amendment to that effect is made to the civil-status register, it must be acknowledged that the unlawful situation will persist.",

In other words, if it was accepted that the Convention did not oblige States Parties to institute procedures for the fresh examination of a case, it should also be accepted that States that had opted for such procedures were free to determine the formal and substantive conditions governing them and, where they applied, to examine whether those conditions had been met. As with any interpretation of domestic law, the Court\u2019s role was limited to ensuring that the examination by the national authorities and courts was not tainted by arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness.

Switzerland, no. 24699/94, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2001-VI). The Federal Court subsequently dismissed the applicant association\u2019s application to reopen the proceedings on the ground that the association had not provided a sufficient indication of its position as to the nature of \u201cthe amendment of the judgment and the redress being sought\u201d, as it was formally required to do by section 140 of the former Federal Judicature Act (see paragraph 29 above). On this point, the Grand Chamber shares the view expressed in paragraph 62 of the Chamber judgment that this approach is overly formalistic in a context in which it is clear from the circumstances as a whole that the association\u2019s application necessarily concerned the broadcasting of the commercial in question, which had been prohibited by the Federal Court itself on 20\u00a0August 1997.",

As the Chamber observed in paragraph 62 of its judgment, the Federal Court thereby took the place of the applicant association, which alone was competent at that stage to judge whether there was still any purpose in broadcasting the commercial. The Grand Chamber shares that view. It further observes that the public interest in dissemination of a publication does not necessarily decrease with the passing of time (see, to similar effect, Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2004IV). Moreover, the Federal Court did not offer its own explanation of how the public debate on battery farming had changed or become less topical since 1994, when the commercial was initially meant to have been broadcast. Nor did it show that after the Court\u2019s judgment of 28 June 2001 the circumstances had changed to such an extent as to cast doubt on the validity of the grounds on which the Court had found a violation of Article\u00a010. Lastly, the Court must also reject the argument that the applicant association had alternative options for broadcasting the commercial in issue, for example via private and regional channels, since that would require third parties, or the association itself, to assume a responsibility that falls to the national authorities alone: that of taking appropriate action on a judgment of the Court.",

The reopening procedure was not an appropriate remedy in the present case for securing the broadcasting of the commercial, even in its original version, since the Federal Court could not in any event have ordered it to be broadcast in the context of such a procedure (see paragraph 39 of the judgment).

If the applicant association complains that its Article 10 rights were violated, this is a complaint that partly concerns a fresh interference. Even in the case of the original, unaltered commercial there would have been cause for consideration by Publisuisse SA, given the impact of the changes in the broadcasting market. Seven years had passed since the original request had been made. In seven years the political context and the context of the debate may have changed; the broadcasting market may have become more or less diverse, with more or fewer opportunities to communicate ideas, as a result of which the commercial interests of broadcasters would have changed accordingly. In the context of mandated broadcasting of commercials, special considerations apply which require independent judgment and judicial scrutiny. The duty to broadcast commercials imposed on private entities imposes restrictions on the private property and informational interests of broadcasters. \u201cMust carry\u201d rules impinge on the core of freedom of expression. Editorial freedom may suffer through the imposition of a \u201cmust carry\u201d duty in a changed environment. Given that the imposed broadcasting of commercials, even (and in particular) with political content, is a far-reaching interference with the freedom of expression of the broadcaster/editor for the alleged sake of other people\u2019s commercial and expressive interests, the utmost care is needed. Here, contrary to a court order to execute a pecuniary obligation, automaticity cannot be the rule. The positive obligations of the State with regard to the enforcement of Article 10 have to be construed with the utmost care when it comes to the imposition of an obligation to broadcast commercials of any nature, notwithstanding the laudable intent to diminish the difference between \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d speakers. It will be for the State, the most powerful speaker, and, for that matter, a non-neutral one, to determine who is the favoured \u201cweak\u201d speaker, or which position demands preferential access. The obligation to broadcast is, per se, not only an interference with the right to speak but in fact it is a form of constrained speech, even if the indication that this is a commercial allows, in principle, some distinction to be drawn between the broadcaster\u2019s position and the viewpoint of the commercial that was broadcast.",

Firstly, I am of the view that the complaint in relation to the ongoing refusal to broadcast the commercial in question is inadmissible ratione materiae having regard to the provisions of Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b). Secondly, in so far as there has been a fresh interference in the applicant association\u2019s right to freedom of expression by the refusal to broadcast its additional comment and criticisms, there has been a failure to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

I do not share the majority\u2019s view that the Federal Court\u2019s rather brief comment on the applicant association\u2019s current interest in broadcasting the commercial which was made in the context of its dismissal of an application to reopen proceedings for failure to comply with the requirements of domestic law was, in itself, sufficient to constitute a fresh interference with the applicant association\u2019s freedom of expression. To my mind, the Federal Court\u2019s comment did not raise an essentially \u201cnew\u201d issue and does not constitute a sufficiently solid basis for this Court\u2019s examination of the original complaint for a second time.",

In October 2001, it applied to Publisuisse SA for permission to broadcast the same television commercial which had been the subject of this Court\u2019s judgment of 28 June 2001. However, in addition thereto, the applicant association also sought permission to impart to the public additional and important information in respect of which there can be little doubt but that the public had an interest in receiving. This additional information consisted of a comment informing the public of this Court\u2019s judgment together with the applicant association\u2019s criticisms of the conduct of the Swiss Radio and Television Company and the Swiss authorities (see paragraph 19 of the judgment). That application was refused on 30 November 2001. The next day, the applicant association applied to the Federal Court for a reopening of its earlier judgment of 20 August 1997 which had dealt, solely, with the original refusal to broadcast the commercial.",

The applicant association was entitled to know what, if any, legitimate aim was being pursued in restricting its right to impart this information to the public and what, if any, \u201cpressing social need\u201d existed which could possibly justify such a serious interference with its right to freedom of expression. However, the Convention lays down clear rules on admissibility, one of which provides that this Court may only deal with a matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted (Article 35 \u00a7 1). The principle of subsidiarity recognises that the Strasbourg Court is a supervisory body of last resort and that the primary responsibility for remedying violations of the Convention lies with the Contracting Parties. Thus, in so far as there was a second and serious interference with the applicant association\u2019s freedom of expression it ought to have instituted fresh proceedings in relation thereto and it was obliged, legally, to exhaust all domestic remedies within such proceedings before raising its complaint before this Court.",

However, instead of awaiting the outcome thereof, it sought to have its complaint concerning this second interference in its freedom of expression examined by having it subsumed, retrospectively, into a review of the Federal Court\u2019s earlier judgment. I accept the respondent State\u2019s argument that it is self-evident that the reopening procedure in relation to the original refusal to broadcast the commercial was not an appropriate context for determining whether this further refusal by Publisuisse SA to broadcast new and additional information was consistent with the applicant association\u2019s right to freedom of expression. In its decision of 29 April 2002, the Federal Court noted that the appeal before the Federal Office of Communication was \u201cstill pending\u201d. The applicant association, nevertheless, proceeded to lodge its complaint before this Court on 25 July 2002 some eight months prior to the delivery of the decision of the Federal Office of Communication and certainly before the domestic courts had any opportunity to rule on the \u201cnew\u201d interference. It thus failed to exhaust domestic remedies, as required. Accordingly, having regard to the provisions of Article 35 \u00a7 1, this complaint has to be declared inadmissible.",
