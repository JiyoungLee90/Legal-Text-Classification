In addition, it is not apparent that the grievance arising from the conditions of detention was capable of constituting a criminal offence, which could be attributable to any public official and would thus require, in the context of Article 3 of the Convention, a criminal inquiry or even a full-fledged investigation (see, for comparison, Canali v. France (dec.), no. 26744/05, 13 September 2007). Moreover, in the absence of any pending criminal proceedings the applicant did not have victim status, nor could he raise any civil claims. The Court reiterates in that connection that the Convention does not confer any right to \u201cprivate revenge\u201d or to an actio popularis. Thus, the right to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence cannot be asserted independently: it must be indissociable from the victim's exercise of a right to bring civil proceedings in domestic law, even if only to secure symbolic reparation or to protect a civil right (see Perez v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 47287/99, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2004I).",
