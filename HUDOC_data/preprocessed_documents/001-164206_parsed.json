Namely, in the framework of two separate sets of criminal proceedings, the domestic courts had imposed on the applicant a compulsory outpatient treatment measure, which had regularly been reviewed with his participation (unlike in the case of Beiere v. Latvia, no. 30954/05, \u00a7\u00a049, 29 November 2011, and in the applicant\u2019s previous case O.G. v. Latvia, no. 66095/09, 23\u00a0September 2014). At the material time, decisions regarding his compulsory treatment had still been enforceable, and the applicant had been well aware of them and of the consequences in the event of non-compliance. According to the Government, this could be proved by the fact that in May 2009, when the compulsory outpatient treatment measure had first been imposed, the applicant had signed the information leaflet provided by the Riga psychiatric hospital, which had explained his rights and obligations (see paragraph 7 above). Moreover, on 28\u00a0May 2010 the doctor had contacted the applicant and reminded him that he had to attend appointments with his doctor and that the police would be informed in the event of non-compliance (see paragraph 13 above). In any event, police officers had clearly informed the applicant about the court orders. Next, the Government contended that the applicant had not evidenced any restrictions preventing him from complying with the compulsory measure. They emphasised that, against this background, the doctors at the psychiatric hospital had had concerns that, as a result of a prolonged period in 2013 where he had failed to visit a doctor, the applicant\u2019s health might have deteriorated.",

The compulsory measure had been revoked on the basis of the medical report soon after the report had been considered (see paragraphs 17-18 above).",
