It stated that while Article 479 of the Code of Civil Procedure established a norm whereby \u201cforeign States [and] diplomatic and consular representatives and diplomats of foreign States enjoy[ed] immunity from the jurisdiction of Lithuanian courts\u201d, that rule guaranteed State immunity only for \u201clegal relations governed by public law\u201d. The Supreme Court pointed out that when deciding whether or not a case containing an international element fell within the jurisdiction of Lithuanian courts, the court in question had to consider whether its judgment would be recognised and enforced in the foreign State concerned or whether it would refuse to do so. If the case also fell within the jurisdiction of a foreign court, the forum court would be entitled to relinquish jurisdiction and instruct the claimant to take proceedings in the court of the foreign State where the judgment should be enforced.",

It found that \u201cdespite the fact that the Kingdom of Sweden had not enacted any legislation on State immunity, it could nevertheless be seen from the case-law of the domestic courts that Sweden recognised the doctrine of restrictive State immunity\u201d. In that case it was considered that the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property, adopted on 2\u00a0December 2004, could be taken into account, even though they were not binding, since they reflected a certain trend in international law in matters of State immunity. The Supreme Court further observed that the case-law of the courts of both States \u2013 Lithuania and Sweden \u2013 being based on common practice in international relations, confirmed that they had been adhering to a restrictive approach to State immunity, whereby a State could not claim immunity from jurisdiction if the dispute was of a private-law nature. In such cases  could not therefore object to the case being heard by the Lithuanian courts. However, the Supreme Court held that the dispute between the parties had arisen from a public-law relationship and was not an employment relationship under private law.",

Following an inquiry, the Ombudsman reported that the applicant was indeed a victim of sexual harassment (see paragraph 13 of the judgment). She fell ill because of the tension she was experiencing at work and was on sick leave for about two months, after which she was dismissed for being absent from work (see paragraphs\u00a014 and 15). It was then that the applicant brought a claim of unlawful dismissal before the courts, but did not, however, request reinstatement to her post at the embassy (see paragraph 16). As noted in the judgment \u201cit should not be overlooked that the applicant\u2019s dismissal and the ensuing proceedings arose originally from acts of sexual harassment\u201d (see paragraph 72).",

She probably still has an interest in obtaining such a decision. In these circumstances, I am of the opinion that only the reopening of the proceedings would enable the applicant to obtain full satisfaction.",

For this reason, it would have been desirable to include an operative provision covering the applicant\u2019s right to seek the reopening (or rather, in this case, the opening) of domestic proceedings.",
