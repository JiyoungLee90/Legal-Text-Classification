As an \u201cobjective obstacle\u201d to such identification the authorities cited the fact that the police officers concerned were wearing helmets and had no identification markings on their uniform. The Court accepts that the wearing of helmets and a lack of identification markings on the police officers had complicated the identification of the perpetrators. It also observes that during the investigation the third applicant and the eye-witnesses involved in the case submitted that they could not identify the police officers responsible for the attacks as the officers had been wearing closed helmets and their uniforms had had no identification markings. At the same time, the first applicant and a witness provided photos featuring policemen that could be possible perpetrators. The investigator checked the version suggested by the first applicant, while the materials submitted by the witness were considered irrelevant. It further appears from the decision of 29\u00a0April 2011 that the investigators questioned some police officers responsible for cordoning during the rally and examined other photo and video materials (see paragraph 23 above). However, the file contains no details concerning those officers (their identities, location and role at the time of the ill-treatment) or their submissions. Neither does it contain a description or analysis of the video and photo materials referred to in the decision of 29\u00a0April 2011. It does not follow from the case-file that the investigating authorities took any steps apart from the mentioned above in order to establish the identities of the police officers responsible for the attacks, or that the applicants were duly informed of the substance of the investigation (see Chitayev v.

The Court, therefore, considers that the intervention by the police and the ill-treatment constituted an interference with the applicants\u2019 right under Article 11 of the Convention (\u0130zci v.

However, given its above findings as regards the ill-treatment in respect of the first and the third applicants, and the findings of the domestic courts as regards the excessive use of power by police during the public assembly on 15\u00a0April 2007, the Court considers that the intervention of the police and the force applied were disproportionate and not necessary within the meaning of Article\u00a011 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention. In the Court\u2019s view, the use of force by police could have had a chilling effect and discouraged the applicants and others from taking part in similar meetings.",
