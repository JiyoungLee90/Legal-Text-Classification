Such first application would in principle interrupt the running of the six-month time-limit.

The date of the submission of the completed application will therefore be considered as the date of its introduction (see Yartsev v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 13776/11, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22, 26 March 2013).",

As regards the complaint under Article\u00a05, the Court reiterates that a person alleging a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention with respect to the length of his or her detention is complaining of a continuing situation which should be considered as a whole (see Kokoshkina v.

The windows were not fitted with metal shutters or other devices preventing natural light from entering the cell. Even if two windows were located high up, that arrangement could not significantly reduce the provision of natural light to the cell (compare Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, \u00a7 82, 12 June 2008). The cells were additionally equipped with artificial lighting, heating and ventilation. The lavatories in the cells were separated from the living space, although the partition did not reach the ceiling. It must be noted that the frequency of showers limited to once per week has been considered by the Court as manifestly insufficient for maintaining proper bodily hygiene (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 158, 10\u00a0January 2012 with further references). However, the applicant did not complain about the other practical arrangements for showering, such as a limited number of functioning showerheads or a lack of privacy due to the fact that inmates were taken to shower halls in groups (ibid.). The Court has also taken note of the photographs showing the interior of the remand prison cells and their sanitary facilities, which do not appear to be in an especially bad state of repair or cleanliness.",

The domestic courts considered that the applicant, faced with the risk of prison, was likely to abscond, influence witnesses, or interfere with the administration of justice. In addition, they relied on the fact that the applicant\u2019s father was living in Ukraine as a reason to believe that the applicant might flee to avoid the investigation and trial.",

Those include, in particular, the character of the person involved, his morals, his assets, his links with the State in which he is being prosecuted and his international contacts (see Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2003IX (extracts)). It was not disputed that the applicant had a permanent residence in Moscow Region and was studying at the university. The authorities did not indicate any circumstance, other than his father\u2019s residing in Ukraine, to suggest that, if released, the applicant would abscond. In the Court\u2019s view, this fact in itself cannot speak in favour of a danger of absconding, given that the applicant had strong links with the country in which he was prosecuted. Moreover, the risk of flight necessarily decreases with the passage of time spent in detention (see Melnikova v. Russia, no.\u00a024552/02, \u00a7 82, 21 June 2007). By the time the case was submitted to the court, the risk had waned owing to the probability that the length of detention would be deducted from (or would count towards) the term of imprisonment which the applicant could expect if convicted (see Shteyn (Stein) v. Russia, no. 23691/06, \u00a7 112, 18 June 2009). Lastly, the courts gave no valid reasons for dismissing the applicant\u2019s requests for an alternative preventive measure to be applied.",

The Court noted, in particular, the domestic courts\u2019 reliance on the gravity of the charges as the main factor for the assessment of the potential to abscond, reoffend or obstruct the course of justice, and their reluctance to pay proper attention to a discussion of each applicant\u2019s personal situation or to have proper regard to factors in favour of release. It also noted the use of collective detention orders, without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each co-defendant and a failure to thoroughly examine the possibility of applying a less rigid measure of restraint, such as bail.",

However, with the passage of time the nature and the seriousness of the offence as grounds for the applicant\u2019s continued detention inevitably became less and less relevant (see Kovyazin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 85, and Artemov v.

In this case, the Court notes that the police officer in respect of whom the applicant was found guilty of assault only testified that the applicant had been pulling his helmet from his hands, and the same testimony was given by another police officer. The judgment did not specify what evidence corroborated its finding that the applicant had punched another police officer, who remained unidentified. However, even assuming that the prison sentence of one year, under Article\u00a0318 of the Criminal Code for using violence against a public official, was justified, it is noteworthy that it was more lenient than the partly concurrent three-year prison sentence for participation in acts of mass disorder under Article 212 of the Code.",

In so far as the applicant was found guilty of having thrown pieces of tarmac, it is normal that such conduct would be punishable; however, the sanction for those acts should be proportionate and, in particular, should reflect the actual damage caused by the acts. In this case, there was nothing to suggest that the applicant had hit anyone with those pieces of tarmac. As regards obstructing the police with metal barriers, the Court observes that there were no witnesses to the applicant handling the barriers, and that he denied his involvement in that. It can be discerned from the applicant\u2019s submissions that other protestors could have used the barriers to protect themselves from the use of force by the police. However, the domestic courts did not examine to what extent the barriers could have been used, by the applicant or anyone else, to stay out of the scuffle.",

According to the photographs submitted by the applicant, he had multiple injuries resembling traces of truncheon blows on his back. The allegation of beating was also supported by the results of the applicant\u2019s examination at the hospital (see paragraph 10 above). In such circumstances it was indispensable for the proper administration of justice that the trial court assessed the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment in the context of determining the criminal charges against him (see, mutatis mutandis, Annenkov and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a031475/10, \u00a7 98, 25 July 2017, and Stepanov v. Russia, no. 33872/05, \u00a7\u00a049, 25 September 2012). However, the domestic courts dismissed his arguments about use of force by the police, merely referring to the previous refusal to open a criminal case in relation to the conduct of the police. Even though the applicant\u2019s trial was not an appropriate avenue to establish the accountability of individual police officers, the facts and allegations relating to the authorities\u2019 role in the onset of clashes and the extent of the use of force by the police were directly relevant to the determination of the charges of mass disorder levelled against the applicant. It was therefore incumbent on the court to evaluate those elements as part of its assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt.",

As far as can be discerned from the indictment and the judgment, the applicant was not among those responsible for the initial acts of aggression which contributed to the deterioration of the assembly\u2019s initial peaceful character (an element considered relevant in Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, \u00a7 179). At the height of the clashes, the applicant threw pieces of tarmac, and his confrontation with the police took place when they were already arresting protesters. While the applicant\u2019s overall conduct degenerated from peaceful to violent, it was sporadic in nature and appeared to be a spontaneous reaction to the force used by the police against the protestors, the majority of whom were peaceful. It therefore did not attain the degree of aggression which the Court has found in other cases to amount to violence calling for lengthy prison terms (see, by contrast, Primov and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a017391/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015663, 12 June 2014, and Osmani and Others v. the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no.\u00a050841/99, 11 October 2001).",
