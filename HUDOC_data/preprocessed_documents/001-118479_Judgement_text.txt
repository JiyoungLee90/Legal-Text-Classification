The judgment became final at first instance as no appeal had been filed against it.
Subsequently, the defendant appealed on points of law outside the statutory time-limit alleging that the first-instance court had not observed the guarantees of a fair trial in his respect. He claimed that he had been convicted in absentia and that he had not benefited from legal representation.

On 12 September 2008 the Galaţi District Court granted the motion of withdrawal of charges and thus terminated the criminal proceedings. The judgment became final.
