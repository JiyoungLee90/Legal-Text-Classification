The Court accepts that the interference had a legal basis in domestic law and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the City of Moscow (as the owner of the flat) and the rights of individuals in need of housing. The central question in this case is, therefore, whether the interference was proportionate to the aim pursued and thus \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

Subsequently, in McCann v. the United Kingdom (no. 19009/04, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR 2008), the Court held that the reasoning in the case of Connors was not confined to cases involving the eviction of Roma or to cases where the applicant had sought to challenge the law itself rather than its application in his particular case, and further held as follows:",

However, even assuming that those were the people on the waiting list for social housing, they were not sufficiently individualised to allow their personal circumstances to be balanced against those of the applicants. Therefore, the only interests that were at stake were those of the City of Moscow. However, the domestic courts did not weigh those interests against the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their home. Once they had found that the transactions leading to the applicants acquiring the right to reside in the flat had been unlawful and had had to be annulled, they gave that aspect paramount importance, without seeking to weigh it against the applicants\u2019 arguments. The national courts thus failed to balance the competing rights and therefore to determine the proportionality of the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their home.",
