His actions should have been recharacterised as a murder committed as a result of exceeding the limits of necessary defence under Article 108 of the Criminal Code (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d below, paragraph 23), because S. had threatened him with an axe. He further submitted that the trial court had wrongly applied to him a rule on repetition of crimes, which had resulted in a heavier sentence. Finally, he complained that two women had been removed from the hearing of 22 March 2002. In his additional grounds of appeal the applicant submitted that the trial court had removed from the hearing people who had come to support him and left only the relatives and friends of the victims. He requested the appeal court to quash his conviction of premeditated murder and adopt a new judgment. When lodging his appeal the applicant did not expressly state that he wished to take part in the appeal hearing.",

They are empowered to examine the evidence and additional materials submitted by the parties directly. As a result of the examination, the appeal courts may dismiss the appeal and uphold the judgment, quash the judgment and terminate the criminal proceedings, quash the judgment and remit the case for a fresh trial, or amend the judgment. They may reduce the sentence but cannot impose a more severe penalty or apply a law of a more serious offence.

The applicant requested the appeal court to quash his conviction and adopt a fresh decision in his case.

Consequently, the Court observes that in the instant case the issues to be determined by the appeal court in deciding the applicant\u2019s criminal liability were both factual and legal.
