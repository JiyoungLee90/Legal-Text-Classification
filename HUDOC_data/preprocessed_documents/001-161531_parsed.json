The existence of a preventive remedy is indispensable for the effective protection of individuals against the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. Indeed, the particular importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court\u2019s view, that the States Parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put a rapid end to any such treatment. Were it otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would legitimise particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention (see Vladimir Romanov v.

The Court therefore finds that the applicant took the necessary steps to draw the attention of the authorities to the issue of the medical care afforded to him in detention, and thus provided them with an opportunity to put right the alleged violations. This has been sufficient for the Court on many occasions to dismiss a Government\u2019s objection of non-exhaustion (see, for instance, Gurenko v.

In this connection, the Court has on many occasions examined the effectiveness of the domestic remedies suggested by the Government in cases of applicants complaining of ongoing inadequate medical treatment, such as in the present case. It found, in particular, that in deciding on a complaint concerning breaches of domestic regulations governing the provision of medical care to detainees, the prison authorities would not have a sufficiently independent standpoint to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a035 of the Convention (see Dirdizov v. Russia, no.\u00a041461/10, \u00a7\u00a075, 27\u00a0November 2012 and Koryak v.\u00a0Russia, no. 24677/10, \u00a7\u00a079, 13 November 2012). The Court also stressed that even though review by a supervising prosecutor played an important part in securing appropriate medical care in detention, a complaint to the supervising prosecutor fell short of the requirements of an effective remedy, because of the procedural shortcomings that had been previously identified in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Koryak, \u00a7 80-81, cited above). Having assessed a civil claim for compensation under the tort provisions of the Civil Code, the Court considered that such a claim could not offer an applicant any other redress than a purely compensatory award, and could not put an end to a situation where there was an ongoing violation, such as inadequate medical care (see Reshetnyak v. Russia, no. 56027/10, \u00a7\u00a7 65-73, 8 January 2013). Moreover, the Court found that such a remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities, which was extremely improbable in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed the application of a certain measure, for instance certain conditions of detention or the level of medical treatment (see A.B. v. Russia, no. 1439/06, \u00a7\u00a096, 14\u00a0October 2010).",

Accordingly, the respondent State had an obligation to ensure the availability of an effective remedy to deal with the substance of his complaint. Taking into account the circumstances of the present case and the aforementioned case-law, the Court sees no reason to depart from its previous findings on the issue. It concludes that the legal avenues put forward by the Government did not constitute an effective remedy that could have been used to prevent the alleged violations or their continuation and provide the applicant with adequate and sufficient redress for his complaints under Article 3 of the Convention.",

After a series of tests, the examination was performed on 8 December 2011. Whilst the examination could have been carried out more quickly, the Court has not been provided with any material which could suggest that the delay in providing this diagnostic (rather than curative) measure, even if taken cumulatively with the occasional interruptions in the applicant\u2019s drug therapy mentioned in the previous paragraph, could lead to a conclusion that the medical assistance rendered to him in detention was ineffective and inadequate.",

His chronic illness did not exhibit significant signs of progress, save for a kidney disease that progressed to the next stage during his detention (see paragraph 36 above). Taking into account the difficulties in treating chronic diseases, particularly in detention where the process is complicated by inevitable negative factors, including stress, the Court is satisfied with the outcome of the applicant\u2019s treatment.
