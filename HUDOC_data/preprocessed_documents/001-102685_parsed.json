Poland, no. 33079/96, \u00a7 93, 22 February 2001). The absence of the risk of collusion was reflected in the domestic court decisions given during this period, in which references were made only to the danger of the applicant's absconding. In the latter respect, however, the Court is not persuaded by the Government's arguments.",

Neumeister v. Austria, 27 June 1968, \u00a7\u00a010, Series A no. 8). Instead, they insisted on the danger of the applicant's absconding, reiterating the sole consideration related to the potential imposition of a very severe sanction (cf. Letellier v. France, 26\u00a0June 1991, \u00a7\u00a043, Series A no. 207), without however indicating in any manner how the results of the investigation had substantiated this eventuality (cf. Stepuleac, loc. cit.). The Court notes in this connection that the applicant was eventually acquitted of those charges which would have potentially entailed life imprisonment (see paragraph 14 above). Nor did the authorities give any reason for not countering the risk of the applicant's absconding by a measure less stringent than pre-trial detention, such as house arrest, as proposed by the applicant's lawyer (cf. Ambruszkiewicz v. Poland, no.\u00a038797/03, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 33, 4 May 2006). While it is true that the applicant was eventually released on bail on 30\u00a0November 2006, the Court considers that the domestic authorities should already have embarked on a more thorough examination of his situation, once the investigation had been terminated on 12 June or at the latest after the indictment on 10 August 2006 and, moreover, should have shown a more proactive attitude in balancing the arguments for and against his continued detention, especially in view of the fact that bail had been offered as early as on 9 February 2006 (see paragraph 8 above).",

At this stage, the judge deciding on pre-trial detention should have sufficient information so as to make reasonable and reasoned decisions concerning the necessity of deprivation of liberty. The reasoning of the decision ordering detention is therefore a relevant factor in determining whether a person's detention must be considered as arbitrary (see Mooren, cited above, \u00a7 79). The Court considers that, in that rather advanced phase of the proceedings, the mere fact that the authorities adopted formally valid decisions prolonging the applicant's detention with reference to the danger of absconding did not as such suffice to secure protection from arbitrariness, notably because the underlying reasons were not supported by adequate factual elements (see, mutatis mutandis, Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2003IX (extracts)). The Court would further reiterate that formally valid detention orders do not necessarily fulfil the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 if not underpinned by sufficient reasons (see, mutatis mutandis, Gajcsi v. Hungary, no. 34503/03, \u00a7\u00a7 18-21, 3 October 2006).",
