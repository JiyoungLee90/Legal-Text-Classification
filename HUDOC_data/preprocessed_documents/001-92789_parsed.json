The Court reiterates that under the international law the term \u201cState organisation\u201d is not limited only to organs of the central Government. In cases where State power is decentralised it extends to any national authority which exercises public functions (see, for example, Mikryukov v. Russia, no.\u00a07363/04, \u00a7\u00a021, 8\u00a0December 2005 with further references). It follows that the actions and/or omissions of the local authorities are attributed to the respondent State and for these reasons the Court concludes that the latter is accountable for the debts of municipal enterprises to the same extent as it is accountable for the debts of State-owned enterprises.
