Further factors include the purpose for which the illtreatment was inflicted, together with the intention or motivation behind it, although the absence of an intention to humiliate or debase the victim cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3. Regard must also be had to the context in which the ill-treatment was inflicted, such as an atmosphere of heightened tension and emotions. Ill-treatment that attains such a minimum level of severity usually involves actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering. However, even in the absence of these aspects, where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for or diminishing his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual\u2019s moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition set forth in Article 3. It should also be pointed out that it may well suffice that the victim is humiliated in his own eyes, even if not in the eyes of others (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a085-86, with numerous further references).",

That being so, the Court does not question the doctors\u2019 statements that the applicant could be moved in a wheelchair under medical supervision without risking his life (see paragraphs 70, 73 and 76 above). The Court notes, however, that, in spite of the judicial ruling to that effect, there was no forensic medical examination of the applicant giving a clear answer to the question whether he was fit enough to participate in court hearings. Although a forensic medical expert was present during the applicant\u2019s examination on 27\u00a0December 2015, he abstained from answering that question (see paragraph 76 above). In any event, even if the applicant had been found fit enough to participate in court hearings, that finding could not be interpreted as giving the green light to the unlimited duration of such hearings.",

It observes, in particular, that the previous day, immediately after the applicant\u2019s transfer from the intensive-care ward to an ordinary ward late in the evening, he had had a visit from the investigator, who had tried to serve him with a copy of the application for his detention (see paragraphs 61 and 64 above).

Holding that the presence of any other purpose by itself contravenes Article 18 would not do justice to that fundamental difference, and would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 18, which is to prohibit the misuse of power. Indeed, it could mean that each time the Court excludes an aim or a ground pleaded by the Government under a substantive provision of the Convention, it must find a breach of Article 18, because the Government\u2019s pleadings would be proof that the authorities pursued not only the purpose that the Court accepted as legitimate, but also another one (ibid., \u00a7 303).",

The first aspect of that approach is that, as a general rule, the burden of proof is not borne by one or the other party because the Court examines all material before it irrespective of its origin, and because it can, if necessary, obtain material of its own motion. The second aspect of the Court\u2019s approach is that the standard of proof before it is \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. That standard, however, is not co-extensive with that of the national legal systems which employ it. First, such proof can follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Secondly, the level of persuasion required to reach a conclusion is intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made, and the Convention right at stake. The third aspect of the Court\u2019s approach is that the Court is free to assess not only the admissibility and relevance but also the probative value of each item of evidence before it. There is no reason for the Court to restrict itself to direct proof in relation to complaints under Article 18 of the Convention or to apply a special standard of proof to such allegations. Circumstantial evidence in this context means information about the primary facts, or contextual facts or sequences of events which can form the basis for inferences about the primary facts. Reports or statements by international observers, non-governmental organisations or the media, or the decisions of other national or international courts, are often taken into account to, in particular, shed light on the facts, or to corroborate findings made by the Court (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 311 and 314-17).",

Moreover, on 15\u00a0September 2014 the President of Ukraine awarded him an Order for Courage \u201cfor his commitment, active civic stance and high professionalism in carrying out his official duties\u201d (see paragraph 8 above). Subsequently, on 25 February, 7 August and 1 October 2015 further sets of criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a014-16 above). However, it was only on 31 October 2015 that the investigating authorities notified the applicant of their suspicions in that respect and arrested him (see paragraph 17 above). His arrest took place with the involvement of a special forces unit, which broke through the entrance door to the applicant\u2019s flat (see paragraph 18 above). All of a sudden, without any apparent reason, the applicant\u2019s arrest and criminal prosecution became a matter of particular urgency and zeal for the prosecuting authorities. In the absence of any convincing explanations from the authorities, it was broadly perceived by political parties, mass media and civil society as selective justice (see paragraphs\u00a088-93 above).",

The applicant suggested that the whole legal machinery had been misused at the whim of a friend and political ally of the President.

His identity was known to the public and he was labelled as a leader of a criminal organisation involved in a number of serious criminal offences (see paragraphs 82-87 above). As such, those statements could not but have encouraged the public to believe the applicant guilty before he had been proved guilty according to the law.",

Based on how the Chamber has decided to approach the applicant\u2019s case and given the content of the impugned domestic judgments and the elements on which they were based, I cannot agree. As is clear from \u00a7\u00a7 27 \u2013 30 of the Chamber judgment, the investigating judge was examining, on the one hand, the investigator\u2019s application of 2\u00a0November 2015 on pre-trial detention and, on the other, the applicant\u2019s complaints of 2\u00a0and 3 November regarding the lawfulness of his arrest, re-arrest and the pre-trial detention flowing therefrom. The judge referred to the gravity of the charges, and the seriousness of the potential sanctions, examined in detail the applicant\u2019s personal, family situation as well as his professional activity, standing in society and positive assurances provided by members of parliament. She concluded, however, that although it was not necessary to hold the applicant in pre-trial detention, a lesser preventive measure was justified in the circumstances. The investigating judge, when ordering this less restrictive measure was clearly concentrating on explaining why the pre-trial detention sought by the prosecution was unnecessary. In the circumstances of the case, and given the material before her, it is difficult to understand what was not relevant and insufficient about the decision she took. Her decision was examined on appeal and confirmed, but again the Chamber judgment looks only at what it considers the investigating judge and appeal court did not do, rather than the relevance and sufficiency of what was done in the circumstances.",

The applicant was, as explained earlier, a very wealthy and well-connected businessman.

The investigating judge of the Dniyprovsky District Court this time heard and granted his application on the date it was lodged. He was from that point onwards no longer subject to an electronic tracking device. The applicant\u2019s family circumstances, the gravity of the charges against him, the fact that several investigative measures were ongoing and \u201cthe risks established earlier\u201d were all cited by the investigating judge as grounds in favour of removing the applicant from pre-trial detention while maintaining a preventive measure, less intrusive still than the previous house arrest. It should be remembered that, during this period, the applicant, who pleaded guilty to kidnapping, was negotiating a friendly settlement with his victim, which finally led to him receiving a suspended sentence and paying only damages. The applicant claimed that his admission of guilt was coerced, an argument the Chamber ignores entirely. Having done so, it is difficult to see the arbitrariness or insufficiency of reasons which underpin the finding of a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 in relation to this second period of house arrest.",

                        "content": "16.\u00a0\u00a0Extracts from Buzadji are transposed by the Chamber without more to demonstrate that the applicant, who had applied for house arrest to replace pretrial detention, cannot be said to have waived his rights. It is quite clear that the placement of the applicant under house arrest did not equate to his release from detention such that Article 5 \u00a7 3 requirements continued to apply to that placement. However, a number of factors distinguish the present case from Buzadji. Unlike in Buzadji, the domestic courts in the present case had not dismissed habeas corpus applications made by the applicant on numerous occasions (compare Buzadji, cited above, \u00a7 108). As indicated in \u00a7 50 of the judgment, when the applicant applied to be removed from pre-trial detention due to the existence of new facts, those facts were considered by the investigating judge as part of his overall assessment and house arrest without electronic tracking was applied immediately. Furthermore, whereas in Buzadji the Court criticized the domestic courts for failing to assess the applicant\u2019s character, morals, his assets and links to the country, as well as his behaviour since the initiation of the criminal investigation, it is clear from the first and second house arrest decisions that the same cannot be said of the two investigating judges whose decisions on house arrest are impugned. There was no evidence either of a presumption operating in Ukraine at the relevant time in favour of pre-trial detention and/or house arrest when an accused might face a sentence going beyond a certain threshold (compare Nikolova v. Bulgaria (no 2), no. 40896/98, 30 September 2004). In previous cases, the period of detention at issue was much longer than the seven months and seven days at issue in the instant case; four and a half months of which consisted of house arrest (see Nikolova, cited above, \u00a7 60 (over 2 years and 5 months); Qing, cited above, \u00a7 60 (over 1 year and seven months), or Podeschi v. San\u00a0Marino, no. 66357/14, 13 April 2017, \u00a7\u00a0126 (over 1 year and\u00a04\u00a0months)). The passage of time, which would require that the weighty relevant and sufficient reasons initially supporting a deprivation of liberty would become even weightier, could thus not be a decisive or even significant factor in this case. As regards the absence of progress or diligence in taking investigative measures, this appeared to be a problem during the period of pre-trial detention, in relation to which a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 is found, but not during the period spent under house arrest.",

On the contrary, as the investigation proceeded the relevant judges intervened promptly to reduce pre-trial detention to house arrest with tracking, followed by house arrest without a tracking device and finally an undertaking not to abscond. Finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 was justified in relation to the period spent in pre-trial detention but not in relation to the periods under house arrest.",

Furthermore, the measures depriving the accused of his liberty were relaxed by the investigating judges as time passed, and the overall length of detention was under that which generally raises the Court\u2019s concern.",

The answer to that different question might have been in the affirmative. The Chamber has instead opted for a normal judicial analysis of a case in which the circumstances were far from normal.
