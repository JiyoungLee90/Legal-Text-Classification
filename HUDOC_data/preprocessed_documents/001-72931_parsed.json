It did, however, have power to find that a decision of the lower courts was inconsistent with the correct interpretation of the law or contained grounds that were illogical or contradictory.

Instead, the Government asked the Court to lay down guidelines regarding damage or authorise the courts to continue using guidelines that were totally different from those used by the Court so that they could carry on running the Italian system without introducing any changes to expedite proceedings. The applicant argued that the Government erred in its assessment of the position as it was not for the European Court of Human Rights to avoid giving judgments that conflicted with national law but, on the contrary, the national law (including the Pinto Act) that should not conflict with the Convention. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the Government could not properly argue that in some cases delays in legal proceedings gave applicants an advantage if they held out with unfounded arguments during proceedings, or if the stakes involved in the dispute were less than the just satisfaction awarded. The value of the application in question was of no relevance to the right to a hearing within a reasonable time and Article 6\u00a0did not require an applicant claiming the right to just satisfaction to have been successful. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s reasoning was one that was expressed with hindsight at the end of proceedings, and it was never possible to say beforehand what the outcome would be. If a case was lost after twenty years of proceedings the non-pecuniary damage incurred was all the greater, since if the person had known earlier that they would lose they would probably have arranged certain aspects of their life differently.",

It might appear paradoxical that, by imposing various taxes \u2013 payable prior to the lodging of an application or after the decision \u2013 the State takes away with one hand what it has awarded with the other to repair a breach of the Convention. Nor should the costs be excessive and constitute an unreasonable restriction on the right to lodge such an application and thus an infringement of the right of access to a tribunal.

The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, reasoned in part, supports this conclusion moreover since, in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, it held that despite the adjournments that were not attributable to the State the proceedings had been excessively long. The Court reiterates that the stakes involved in the dispute cannot be assessed with regard only to the final outcome, otherwise proceedings that are still pending would have no value. Regard has to be had to the overall stakes involved in the dispute for the applicant. It would appear that in awarding EUR\u00a03,500 for seven years\u2019 delay, the rate per year is EUR\u00a0500. The Court observes that the amount awarded is approximately 27 % of what it generally awards in similar Italian cases.

The remaining period, of more than two years and five months, is sufficient in itself to amount to a second breach of the same set of proceedings (see Rotondi v.

The annual reports of the Committee of Ministers on the excessive length of judicial proceedings in  (see, inter alia, CM/Inf/DH(2004)23 revised, and Interim Resolution ResDH(2005)114) scarcely seem to reflect substantial changes in this area. Like the applicant, the Court does not see how the introduction of the Pinto remedy at domestic level has solved the problem of excessively lengthy proceedings. It has admittedly saved the Court the trouble of finding these violations, but the task has simply been transferred to the courts of appeal, which were already overburdened. Furthermore, given the occasional divergence between the case-law of the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 25-32 above) and that of the Court, the latter is again required to give a decision as to the existence of such violations.",

The Court was not expected to define a precise formula by which the amount awarded for non-pecuniary damage flowing from the protractedness of proceedings could be calculated or to determine precise amounts. It was, in their view, more important that the Court gave sufficient justification in its decisions for the manner in which the criteria to which regard was had when assessing the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings were then taken into account to determine the amount awarded for non-pecuniary damage arising from the delays in the proceedings.

The Court notes that the applicant also omitted to itemise particulars of all his claims and provide the necessary supporting documents as required by Rule 60 of the Rules of Court. Accordingly, it decides to make no award under this head. Regarding the proceedings before the Court, given that a legal team was formed for the various cases being examined concurrently (see paragraph 9 above), the Court considers that the case is distinguishable from the case of Scozzari (cited above) and that the claim by the lawyers of the defence team should not be granted. In the present case, having regard to the evidence before it, the above-mentioned criteria and the length and complexity of the proceedings before the Court, it considers that the amount awarded by the Chamber should be confirmed for the proceedings before it, that is, EUR 2,000, and the applicant awarded EUR\u00a03,000 for the work done before the Grand Chamber, that is, a total sum of EUR 5,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
