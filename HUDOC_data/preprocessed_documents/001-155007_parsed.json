The Government\u2019s claim that they had no information about anyone being ill-treated in Uzbekistan appeared to be false in the light of the recent reports by Amnesty International about the destiny of Mr Khamidkariyev who had been abducted in Russia and forcibly returned to Uzbekistan where he faced an unfair trial based on his confessions obtained by torture (see paragraph 33 above and the facts of application no. 42332/14). The mere fact of ratification of international human rights treaties by Uzbekistan does not in itself provide sufficient safeguards against ill-treatment because of the absence of any control mechanisms in relation to the country\u2019s compliance with its commitments (here the applicant referred to the Court\u2019s findings in: Ermakov v. Russia, no.\u00a043165/10, \u00a7 204, 7 November 2013, and Khodzhayev v. Russia, no.\u00a052466/08, \u00a7 98, 12 May 2010). The applicant deemed illogical the Government\u2019s argument that his extradition had been refused in respect of some of the charges. What is important is that it was authorised for the offence of participation in an extremist organisation which put him in a vulnerable group systematically subject to torture. In view of the recent publications by international human rights organisations, the applicant submitted that there were no improvements in the sphere of human rights in Uzbekistan and that torture of persons suspected of prohibited religious activities had remained a widespread practice. However, the applicant\u2019s allegations of an increased risk of torture were not examined at any stage of the domestic proceedings.",

No evidence has been presented by the Government to demonstrate that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office made any effort to evaluate the risks of extradition to the State where, according to reputable international sources, the use of torture is commonplace and defence rights are routinely circumvented. Furthermore, the Prosecutor General\u2019s unqualified reliance on the assurances provided by the Uzbek authorities was at variance with the Court\u2019s established position that in themselves these assurances are not sufficient and that the national authorities need to treat with caution the assurances against torture given by a State where torture is endemic or persistent and whose assurances did not provide for any monitoring mechanism (see, among others, Kasymakhunov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0127, and Yuldashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a01248/09, \u00a7\u00a085, 8 July 2010, with further references).

The Court finds it difficult to reconcile the authoritative directions given by the Supreme Court to the lower courts in its Ruling no.\u00a011 of 14\u00a0June 2012 to engage in a thorough and comprehensive review of the serious claims of ill-treatment and the restricted scope of inquiry it had adopted in the present case.

Nothing in the material in the Court\u2019s possession gives reason to believe that the Regional or Supreme Courts, confronted with substantial grounds for believing in a real risk of illtreatment amply supported by various international sources, honoured this claim with due and sufficient attention.",

The representative emphasised that the Government failed to provide any explanation of the applicant\u2019s disappearance or to put in place a legal mechanism capable of preventing his forcible transfer to Uzbekistan. Despite the available information that he might be sent to Uzbekistan on the Tashkent-bound flight, no measures had been taken in order to prevent it from happening or at least to check the flight and the passenger manifest. Finally, the representative submitted that the investigation conducted by the Russian authorities into the disappearance had been ineffective. Neither his counsel, nor his wife, nor the Court were informed about the progress of the investigation or given access to its materials. Some obvious steps were not taken: the FMS officers were not interviewed and the passenger lists were not examined.

It is beyond any doubt that the Russian authorities were well aware \u2013 or ought to have been aware \u2013 of these incidents and, in the light of their experience and knowledge, must have reasonably considered that the applicant faced a similar risk of disappearance and irregular transfer after his release from custody on 11\u00a0March 2014.

The applicant\u2019s next-of-kin were told later on that day that he had been released and the same was asserted by the supervising prosecutor in his reply to the applicant\u2019s counsel and by the Government in their observations. However, by contrast with the Mamazhonov case, there is no evidence of his release from custody.

The Court called on the Russian Government to take urgent and robust action to further improve domestic remedies and to prevent their unlawful circumvention in extradition matters (ibid., \u00a7 261).",

Thus, on 3\u00a0December 2013 Mr Azimov, in whose case the Court had previously found that a forced return to Tajikistan would give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see Azimov v. Russia, no.\u00a067474/11, 18 April 2013), was taken away from the migrants accommodation centre by five individuals who introduced themselves as police officers. On 29 April 2014 Mr Yakubov, also a former applicant before the Court whose planned removal to Uzbekistan was found to be in breach of Article 3 (see Yakubov v. Russia, no. 7265/10, 8\u00a0November 2011), was intercepted by the police on his way to an interview at the Russian office of the UNHCR and loaded onto an unmarked van. Finally, in the night of 22\u00a0July 2014 Mr Isakov disappeared without trace; in his earlier application, the Court also held that his extradition to Uzbekistan would be in breach of Article 3 (see Abdulazhon\u00a0Isakov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14049/08, 8 July 2010). In connection with Mr\u00a0Yakubov\u2019s disappearance, the Committee of Ministers noted with concern that the incident cast doubt on the soundness of the protective arrangements set up by the Russian authorities and that there had been no information about any progress in the investigation into similar previous incidents (see paragraph 36 above).",

However, they did not discharge the burden and their assertion of the applicant\u2019s release cannot be verified owing to serious shortcomings of the domestic investigation and to its restricted scope.

Furthermore, Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, in guaranteeing to persons detained a right to institute proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of their detention, also proclaims their right, following the institution of such proceedings, to a \u201cspeedy\u201d judicial decision concerning the lawfulness of detention. The Court has previously found the delays of 36, 29 and 26 days to be incompatible with Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 96, 1 June 2006).",

This argument was undeniably an essential condition for determining the lawfulness of his deprivation of liberty in the period after 30 December 2013. However, both courts treated the argument as irrelevant and disregarded it in their decisions. The Regional Court first examined the merits of the applicant\u2019s grievance and ordered his release only on 11 March 2014, that is seventy days after his detention had ceased to be lawful. It follows that the scope of the judicial review was manifestly inadequate and that the proceedings were not \u201cspeedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention.",

In some of those cases, it indicated that the respondent State must secure payment of just satisfaction by facilitating contact between the applicants, their representatives and the Committee of Ministers (see Muminov v. Russia (just satisfaction), no. 42502/06, \u00a7 19 and point (c) of the operative part, 4 November 2010, and Kamaliyevy v.
