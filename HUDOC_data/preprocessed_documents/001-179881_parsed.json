This had been confirmed by the Constitutional Court in several judgments (see, among other authorities, judgment no. 186/2000 of 10\u00a0July\u00a02000). According to the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law, an employer\u2019s right to adopt organisational arrangements and act as a disciplinary authority had to be weighed against an employee\u2019s fundamental right to privacy recognised under Article 18 of the Constitution. In cases where there were substantiated suspicions of theft, special circumstances justified interference with an employee\u2019s right to privacy, which was considered to be appropriate to the legitimate aim pursued, necessary and proportionate. Following this case-law, the Employment Tribunal, having regard to the evidence before it, found that the employer had had sufficient grounds to conclude that the applicants\u2019 conduct amounted to a \u201cbreach of contractual good faith and abuse of trust\u201d and thus declared both dismissals fair in conformity with Article 54.2.d of the Labour Regulations.",

While acknowledging that it was possible that the employer could face an administrative sanction for not informing its employees and the staff committee in advance of the installation of the cameras, that fact alone had no relevance from a constitutional point of view, since from that perspective the covert video surveillance had been justified (in that there had been reasonable suspicions of theft), appropriate to the legitimate aim pursued, necessary and proportionate.

The court concluded that the applicants had signed the settlement agreements freely and voluntarily with the clear purpose of avoiding criminal proceedings for the alleged thefts they had been accused of (and to which they had already confessed). Further evidence as to the lack of any threat or coercion was the fact that other employees in the same situation as the applicants (such as the first and second applicants) had refused to sign the settlement agreements. Accordingly, the settlement agreements were declared valid under Article 1.809 of the Civil Code and, consequently, the Employment Tribunal ruled against the third, fourth and fifth applicants. As the signing of the settlement agreements rendered their dismissals fair, the use and analysis of the impugned videos as evidence in the proceedings was deemed unnecessary.",

In it the court analysed the use of a covert surveillance camera system installed on the ceiling of a clothing and shoe section of a company, only focusing on three cash registers and the counter. In that case the Constitutional Court held that the measure at stake had to pass a three-fold test to be considered acceptable: there had to be a legitimate aim (\u201ca suitability test\u201d), necessary (\u201ca necessity test\u201d) and proportionate (\u201ca strict proportionality test\u201d) \u2013 that is to say, to determine whether a fair balance had been struck between the interference with a fundamental right and the importance of the legitimate aim pursued.

In this case the company had detected some irregularities in the cash register allegedly committed by one of its employees. It temporarily installed hidden cameras zoomed in on the area where the cash register was located. The employer had placed a sign indicating in a general manner the presence of video surveillance, as well as a document containing the text of section 5 of the Personal Data Protection Act, as required by Article 3 of the Instruction 1/2006 of 8 November issued by the Spanish Data Protection Agency (hereinafter \u201cInstruction no. 1/2006\u201d). According to the Constitutional Court, one of the reasons why Article 18.4 of the Constitution had not been infringed was the fact that the employer had installed a sign in the shop window indicating the installation of video surveillance, in accordance with section 5 of the Personal Data Protection Act as well as Instruction\u00a0no.\u00a01/2006.

The salient question is therefore not whether evidence that was obtained unlawfully or in breach of the Convention should or should not have been admitted, but whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair. This involves an examination of the unlawfulness in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see, inter alia, Khan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a034; and P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 76).",

Matters to be taken into account are whether the applicant was able to challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use, whether the evidence was of sufficient quality \u2013 which entails an inquiry as to whether the circumstances in which it was obtained could cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy \u2013 and whether it was supported by other material (see Schenk v.\u00a0Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 4648; Khan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 77; Allan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 48539/99, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43; and Bykov [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 8890). Lastly, the Court will attach weight to whether the evidence in question was or was not decisive for the outcome of the proceedings (compare, in particular, Khan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 37).",

One might say that the interference in the case of K\u00f6pke was more serious because there had only been hidden cameras and the employee had at no stage been notified of any surveillance. Nevertheless, the Court found the complaint ill-founded. In the K\u00f6pke decision the Court accepted the domestic courts\u2019 view that there had been no other equally effective means to protect the employer\u2019s property rights which would have interfered to a lesser extent with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her private life. Having regard to the circumstances of the case, the Court agreed with this finding because the stocktaking carried out in the drinks department could not clearly link the losses discovered to a particular employee.
