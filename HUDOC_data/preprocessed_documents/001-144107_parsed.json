The court noted that although the evidence concerning M.M.\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident was not conclusive, the National Railway Company\u2019s employee should nevertheless be held liable because she had not fulfilled her professional duties. The court further noted that, according to one of M.M.\u2019s colleagues who had occupied the same position as M.M., and to her job description (\u201cFi\u0219a Postului\u201d), it had been M.M.\u2019s duty to handle the customs documentation for the customs agent and also to supervise the shunting of the relevant wagons in the railway station. The court also found that under the applicable law on the application of the common transit system in Romania, the National Railway Company had been obliged to be actively involved in the customs inspection of the wagons. However, the company had observed its obligations superficially through its employees.
