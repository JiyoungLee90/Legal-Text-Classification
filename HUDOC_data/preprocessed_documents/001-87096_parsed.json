It remains open to speculation whether the proceedings upon such application should terminate within that time-limit.

The case was reconsidered on seven occasions, three of which fall within the Court\u2019s competence ratione temporis. The domestic courts thus cannot be said to have been inactive. However, although the Court is not in a position to analyse the quality of the decisions of the domestic courts, it considers that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings may disclose a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Pavlyulynets v. Ukraine, no. 70767/01, \u00a7\u00a051, 6\u00a0September 2005 and Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7 46, 25\u00a0November 2003). In this context, the Court recalls that it is for the Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can guarantee everyone\u2019s right to obtain a final decision on disputes relating to civil rights and obligations within a reasonable time (see Kostovska v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 44353/02, \u00a7\u00a041, 15 June 2006).
