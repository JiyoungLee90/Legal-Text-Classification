The case originated in an application (no. 41694/07) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Ms Suzana Isaković Vidović (“the applicant”), on 18 September 2007.
The applicant was represented by Odvetniška družba Gregorovič & Pungartnik, a law firm based in Šentjur, Slovenia. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
The application concerned a statute-barred prosecution for severe bodily harm allegedly caused to the applicant by her neighbour.
On 4 June 2012 the application was communicated to the Government. On 1 February 2014 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was thus assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant, a medical doctor by profession, was born in 1967. She currently lives in Celje, Slovenia, having lived in Šabac, Serbia, at the material time.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 2 September 1997 the applicant and her neighbour P.V. confronted each other in front of their houses following a verbal conflict between P.V. and the applicant’s mother. While the applicant allegedly shouted obscenities at him, P.V. allegedly punched her in the face, causing her to fall down and lose consciousness. The medical records from the emergency ward showed that the applicant had sustained a number of injuries to her head. She was released from hospital the next day upon her own request.
On an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a criminal complaint (krivičnu prijavu) in respect of this event.
On 16 September 1997 P.V. and his wife brought a private criminal action (privatnu krivičnu tužbu) against the applicant for insult and defamation (zbog uvrede i klevete) and against both the applicant and her mother for making serious threats (zbog ugrožavanja sigurnosti).
On 2 March 1998 the Šabac Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment (optužnicu) against P.V. with the Šabac Municipal Court for the crime of severe bodily injuries (zbog nanošenja teških telesnih povreda).
On 20 March 1998 the Municipal Court joined the two sets of proceedings.
At some point in 2000 the applicant lodged a civil compensation claim within the criminal proceedings (istakla imovinsko-pravni zahtev).
Between 14 April 1998 and 31 May 2000 a total of thirteen hearings were held or adjourned.
At the hearing of 11 January 2000 a medical expert stated that, based on the available documentation, on 2 September 1997 the applicant had sustained a concussion as well as a contusion. She had also continued receiving medical treatment for another two months.
On 15 June 2000 the Municipal Court convicted both the applicant and P.V. as charged and sentenced them to a fine and four months imprisonment, respectively, both sentences suspended for a period of one year. The court instructed the applicant to pursue her civil claim in a separate civil suit. The applicant’s mother was acquitted.
On 20 June 2001 the Šabac District Court quashed the convictions and ordered a new trial, but upheld the acquittal.
On 12 January 2004 a new hearing was scheduled for 25 February 2004.
On 25 February 2004 the Municipal Court terminated the proceedings against the applicant as time-barred, while the proceedings against P.V. continued.
On 2 April 2004 the main hearing started anew due to changes to the composition of the bench. Following the applicant’s testimony, the proceedings were adjourned for an indefinite period, as the Municipal Court had to obtain certain missing medical documentation.
At the next hearing of 18 May 2005, the Municipal Court heard P.V., as well as three witnesses. The court further decided to request the Belgrade Forensic Medicine Institute to give its opinion as regards the applicant’s bodily injuries allegedly sustained at the material time. No new hearing was scheduled.
On 19 December 2005 the Municipal Court received the relevant medical opinion dated 16 September 2005. The opinion stated that the attack had caused the applicant severe bodily injuries (loss of consciousness, a concussion and a contusion of the zygomatic bone).
On an unspecified date the Municipal Court scheduled the next hearing for 22 May 2007. This hearing, however, was further adjourned on two separate occasions, because of P.V.’s or the trial judges’ absence.
On 11 July 2007 the Municipal Court dismissed proposals for the examination of additional witnesses. On the same occasion the defendant requested that the entire trial bench be replaced by another. The case-file was subsequently forwarded to the President of the court for a decision.
On 5 September 2007 the Municipal Court terminated the proceedings against P.V. as time-barred.
The applicant never filed a separate civil compensation claim in respect of the underlying incident.
In 2008 the applicant and her family moved to Slovenia.
Articles 53, 67, 92 and 93 provided for the crimes of severe bodily injury, making threats, defamation and insult, respectively.
Article 53 § 1 provided that whoever perpetrated the crime of severe bodily injury could be sentenced to a prison term of between six months and five years.
Articles 103 and 104 provide, inter alia, that a prosecution of the crime defined in Article 53 § 1 of the Criminal Code 1977 shall become time-barred when more than ten years elapse since its commission.
Articles 19, 20, 46 and 235, read in conjunction, provide, inter alia, that formal criminal proceedings (krivični postupak) may be instituted at the request of an authorised prosecutor. In respect of crimes subject to prosecution ex officio the authorised prosecutor shall be the public prosecutor personally. His authority to decide whether to press charges, however, is bound by the principle of legality which requires that he must act whenever there is a reasonable suspicion that a crime subject to prosecution ex officio has been committed. It makes no difference whether the public prosecutor has learnt of the incident from a criminal complaint filed by the victim or another person, or indeed even if he has only heard rumours to that effect.
Article 53 provides that in respect of certain crimes subject to prosecution ex officio the public prosecutor may only press charges at the explicit request of the victim (po predlogu oštećenog). In respect of yet another group of crimes, of somewhat lesser gravity, the authorised prosecutor may only be the victim personally (privatni tužilac).
Article 61 provides that should the public prosecutor decide that there are no bases to press charges, he must inform the victim of this decision, who shall then have the right to take over the prosecution of the case on his own behalf, in the capacity of a “subsidiary prosecutor” (u svojstvu oštećenog kao tužioca), within eight days from the notification of that decision.
Unless specifically provided otherwise in the Criminal Code, all crimes are subject to prosecution ex officio (see Komentar Zakonika o krivičnom postupku, Prof. dr Tihomir Vasiljević and Prof. dr Momčilo Grubač, IDP Justinijan, Belgrade, 2005, p. 110, paragraph 4).
Articles 199 and 200 provide, inter alia, that anyone who has suffered fear, physical pain or mental anguish as a consequence of a breach of his “personal rights” (prava ličnosti) shall be entitled, depending on their duration and intensity, to sue for financial compensation in the civil courts and, in addition, to request other forms of redress “which may be capable” of affording adequate non-pecuniary satisfaction.
Article 376 §§ 1 and 2 provide that a claim based on the above-mentioned provisions may be brought within three years of the date on which the injured party learnt of the damage in question and identified the person responsible, but that such a claim must in any event be lodged within a maximum of five years as of the event itself.
Article 377 § 1 further provides that if the damage at issue has been caused as a result of the commission of a criminal offence, the civil limitation period may be extended so as to correspond to the applicable criminal statute of limitations.
The Civil Procedure Act 2004 (Zakon o parničnom postupku, published in OG RS nos. 125/04 and 111/09) was in force from 22 February 2005 until 1 February 2012. Article 13 of the Act provided that if a victim of a criminal offence had brought a civil action for damages against the offender, the civil court was bound by a final decision, if any, of the criminal court finding the offender guilty. The civil courts have, however, also consistently interpreted that provision in such a way that a criminal conviction was not a precondition for a damages award in a separate civil compensation suit (see, for instance, judgment Gž. 1739/06 of the Kragujevac District Court of 29 September 2006; judgment Gž. 1257/11 of the Novi Sad Appeals Court of 2 June 2011; judgment Gž. 3273/11 of the Novi Sad Appeals Court of 16 November 2011; judgment Gž. 146/12 of the Novi Sad Appeals Court of 5 April 2012; judgment Gž. 5676/11 of the Belgrade Appeals Court of 2 August 2012; and judgment Gž. 4357/12 of the Novi Sad Appeals Court of 26 October 2012; in which civil courts awarded non-pecuniary damages for injuries sustained during an arrest operation and/or in police custody in the absence of a criminal conviction against any police officer).
The Civil Procedure Act 1977 (Zakon o parničnom postupku, published in the OG SFRY nos. 4/77, 36/77, 6/80, 36/80, 43/82, 72/82, 69/82, 58/84, 74/87, 57/89, 20/90, 27/90 and 35/91, as well as in OG FRY nos. 27/92, 31/93, 24/94, 12/98, 15/98 and 3/02), which was in force until 22 February 2005, contained the same provision (see Article 12 § 3 thereof).
