There had been Russian military checkpoints at the roads leading to and from the village. The armed men who had abducted Zurab Iriskhanov had Slavic features and spoke Russian without an accent, which proved that they were not of Chechen origin. The men had arrived at the applicants' house late in the evening, which indicated that they had been able to move around past curfew. They had arrived in APCs, the military vehicles which had been deployed at the time only by State representatives. The men acted in a manner similar to that of special forces carrying out identity checks. They were wearing specific camouflage uniforms, were armed and had portable radios. The men fired a number of shots without fear of being heard by law enforcement agencies located in the village. The officer who had come out to the applicants and their neighbours from the local military commander's office had confirmed that Zurab and Gilani Iriskhanov had been detained in their office. All the information disclosed from the criminal investigation file supported their assertion as to the involvement of State agents in the abduction. Since their son had been missing for a very lengthy period, he could be presumed dead.

The investigation in case no. 63045 was instituted on 24 June 2002, that is five days after Zurab Iriskhanov's abduction. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were delayed and were eventually taken only several years after the events or not at all. It follows from the submitted documents that the investigation questioned a number of witnesses to the abduction only in May-June 2005, that is three years after the events in question. Furthermore, the district prosecutor's office failed to take such basic investigating steps as to establish the identity of the owners of the military vehicles used by the abductors and question their drivers, or to try to identify and question the servicemen who had been manning the checkpoints in Samashki about the passage of the APCs on 19 June 2002; they failed to question the local military commander about the possible involvement of his staff in the abduction of the applicants' sons and the subsequent detention of Zurab and Gilani Iriskhanov in his office building; they failed to verify a number of concurring witness statements concerning the helicopter's involvement in the transportation of the abducted men to Khankala and Gilani Iriskhanov's allegations concerning his detention in the military commander's office, Khankala and in the RUBOP in Grozny. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation had begun. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own accord but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged the acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the suspension or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to adjourn were made without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
