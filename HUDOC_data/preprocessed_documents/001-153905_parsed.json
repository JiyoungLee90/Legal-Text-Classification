He further pointed out that according to the extracts from the logbook of the OCD\u2019s temporary detention facility he arrived at the detention facility at 4 p.m. on 27 September 2008 following a decision of the Narimanov District Court, however he was brought before a judge of that court only at 9 p.m. on 27 September 2008.
