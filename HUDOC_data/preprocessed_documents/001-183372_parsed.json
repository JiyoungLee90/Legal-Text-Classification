Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or brought before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling suspicions which provide the grounds for detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of the criminal investigation (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300A).",

The words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d mean the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence. What may be regarded as \u201creasonable\u201d will depend upon all the circumstances (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no.\u00a0182).

(compare Mu\u015fuc v. Moldova, no. 42440/06, \u00a7\u00a032, 6 November 2007). It is also undisputed that none of these documents or statements were accompanied by any evidence supporting the prosecution authorities\u2019 charges against the applicants. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that any evidence was ever presented by the prosecution authorities to the domestic courts ordering and extending the applicants\u2019 pre-trial detention in support of the requests to remand them in custody (compare Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a096-99, and Yagublu, cited above, \u00a7 60). In this regard, the Court also notes the decision of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of 3 November 2009. That decision required domestic courts to subject prosecution authorities\u2019 applications for remand in custody to close scrutiny and to verify the existence of a suspicion against the accused by making use of their power under Article 447.5 of the CCrP to request and review the \u201cinitial evidence\u201d in the prosecution\u2019s possession (see paragraph 77 above).

In any event, all previous decisions ordering and extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention had been based solely on the original charges under Article 228.3 of the Criminal Code, and the new charges were therefore of no significance as regards assessing the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the applicants\u2019 detention during the period falling within the scope of the present case, and the Government have not expressly argued otherwise (compare Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7 131).",

But it is equally possible that a restriction is applied both for an ulterior purpose and a purpose prescribed by the Convention; in other words, that it pursues a plurality of purposes. In these circumstances, a restriction can be compatible with the substantive Convention provision which authorises it because it pursues an aim permissible under that provision, but still infringe Article\u00a018 because it was chiefly meant for another purpose that is not prescribed by the Convention; in other words, if that other purpose was predominant. Conversely, if the prescribed purpose was the main one, the restriction does not run counter to Article 18 even if it also pursues another purpose. Which purpose is predominant in a given case depends on all the circumstances. In assessing that point, the Court will have regard to the nature and degree of reprehensibility of the alleged ulterior purpose, and bear in mind that the Convention was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society governed by the rule of law (see Merabishvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 292, 305 and\u00a0307).",

It is also clear from the above-mentioned statement that from the very beginning of the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the fact that narcotic substances and twenty-two Molotov cocktails were found in the flats of S.N. and B.G., the law-enforcement authorities had tried to link the alleged possession of Molotov cocktails by two members of NIDA to their membership in the group by stating, without any reservation, that \u201csince mid-2012 all three individuals, being addicted to narcotic substances and becoming members of NIDA through the Internet, had actively participated in a number of illegal activities of the organisation\u201d (see paragraph 8 above).",

In that connection, it observes that the prosecution authorities intended to show NIDA and its members to be \u201cdestructive forces\u201d and an organisation carrying out \u201cillegal activities\u201d, solely relying on the fact that narcotic substances and Molotov cocktails were found in the flats of NIDA\u2019s two members. However, there is nothing in the case file to show that the prosecution authorities had any objective information giving rise to a bona fide suspicion against NIDA and its board members at the time when they made those statements (compare Ilgar\u00a0Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 141).",

In that connection, the Court also attaches weight to the timing of the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicants, following a series of demonstrations against the government in which members of NIDA actively participated. The Court further notes that the Government\u2019s argument that the applicants had been arrested and detained strictly for the purpose of the investigation of the criminal offences allegedly committed by them is contradicted by the special treatment given to their case by the lawenforcement authorities. Indeed, although under domestic law the investigation of a criminal case instituted under Article 228 of the Criminal Code should be conducted by the police (see paragraph 76 above), in the present case, however, the investigation was carried out by the Serious Crimes Department of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office with the involvement of the MNS.",
