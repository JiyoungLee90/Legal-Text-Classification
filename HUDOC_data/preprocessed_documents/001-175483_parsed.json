Indeed, the Court has accepted the possibility of amendments to social-security legislation which may be adopted in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance, and also to the evolution of individual situations (see Wieczorek v. Poland, no. 18176/05, \u00a7\u00a067, 8\u00a0December 2009)\u201d (see B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy, cited above, \u00a7 88). The Court would stress that, in present-day conditions, these considerations play a primordial role in assessing complaints concerning the impairment of social welfare rights; and they undoubtedly provide the State with a wide margin of appreciation in rationalising their social-security systems.",
