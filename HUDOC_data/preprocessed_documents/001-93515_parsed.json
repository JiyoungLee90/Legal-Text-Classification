Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Khudoyorov v.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005).

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court observes that it was not until 25 July 2003 that the District Court for the first time made reference to the risk of interference with the witnesses. Apart from a bald reference to the applicants\u2019 being likely to influence witnesses, the District Court did not mention any specific facts warranting their detention on that ground. In its subsequent detention orders the District Court merely repeated the same conclusion of the collusion risk without citing any reasons why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicants in support of their requests for release, it considered the risk of interference with the witnesses to exist and to be decisive. Furthermore, the Court has not lost sight of the fact that throughout the entire period of the pre-trial investigation and the trial proceedings leading to their conviction on 9 April 2003 the applicants were not in custody. The domestic courts did not make any reference to inappropriate or unlawful behaviour by the applicants during that period. The Court is therefore not convinced that the domestic authorities\u2019 findings that the applicants were likely to pervert the course of justice had a sufficient basis in fact.",

They took no notice of the arguments in favour of the applicants\u2019 release pending trial, such as their family situation and their behaviour during the two years since the criminal proceedings had been initiated. It is of particular concern to the Court that the Russian courts persistently used a stereotyped summary formula to justify extension of detention for the applicants. In addition, the District Court, while issuing separate detention orders in respect of the two applicants, used identical or similar wording to extend their detention. The Court has already found that the practice of issuing collective detention orders without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each detainee is incompatible, in itself, with Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Korchuganova, cited above, \u00a7 76; and Dolgova v. Russia, no.\u00a011886/05, \u00a7\u00a049, 2 March 2006). The Court considers that this conclusion is not altered in the present case. While extending the applicants\u2019 detention by means of identically or similarly worded detention orders the domestic authorities had no proper regard to the applicants\u2019 individual circumstances. Furthermore, the Court finds it particularly striking that two of the five detention decisions issued by the domestic authorities in respect of the two applicants did not indicate any reason for their continued detention. These detention orders merely mentioned that the applicants should remain in detention.",
