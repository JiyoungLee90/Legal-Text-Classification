Nevertheless, under this provision the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and wellbeing are adequately secured.

Italy, judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p.\u00a033, \u00a7\u00a092). The Court must look behind appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of (see Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, judgment of 24 June 1982, Series A no. 50, p. 20, \u00a7 38). Finally, the right to liberty is too important for a person for him or her to lose the benefit of the protection of Article 5 for the single reason that he or she gave himself or herself up to be taken into detention (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 36, \u00a7 65).",

The salient issue is whether he was in fact deprived of his liberty before 3.30 p.m. on 2 February 1998. In this connection, the Court notes that the investigator's order for the applicant's preliminary detention of 2 February 1998 stated that his de facto arrest had taken place immediately after the commission, on 31 January 1998, of the offence alleged against him (see paragraph 14 above). Even taking account of the fact that apparently the applicant voluntarily appeared for questioning (see paragraph 12 above) and assuming that he was not handcuffed, placed in a locked cell, or otherwise physically restrained while on the premises of the police during the period in question, it would be unrealistic to assume that he was free to leave, particularly bearing in mind that the competent authorities apparently considered him as having been arrested and were carrying out investigative actions in the criminal proceedings which were instituted against him the day after his questioning, 1 February 1998 (see paragraphs 13 and 84 above). In these circumstances, the Court concludes that between 11.55 p.m. on 31 January and 3.30 p.m. on 2 February 1998 the applicant was deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

Since under Article 5 \u00a7 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (ibid., p. 753, \u00a7 41).",

There is no indication, and it has not been argued by the Government, that on 31\u00a0January 1998 or thereafter the applicant was placed under police arrest. The applicant's preliminary detention for twentyfour hours started at 3.30\u00a0p.m. on 2 February 1998 (see paragraph 14 above) and was extended to three days on 3 February 1998 (see paragraph 15 above). Finally, the applicant was placed in pretrial detention at 3 p.m. on 5 February 1998 (see paragraph 16 above). It thus seems that the applicant's detention between 11.55 p.m. on 31 January 1998 and 3.30 p.m. on 2 February 1998 did not come within the ambit of any of these provisions.",

It must also be noted that the order for the applicant's preliminary detention stated that the twentyfour hour period, during which such detention is permitted when initially ordered by an investigator, started to run at 3.30 p.m. on 2 February 1998, not earlier. It thus appears that the applicant's deprivation of liberty between 11.55 p.m. on 31 January 1998 and 3.30 p.m. on 2 February 1998 had no legal basis in domestic law.",
