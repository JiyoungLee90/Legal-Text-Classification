The applicants made use of the request for transfer of jurisdiction once in 1989, approximately one year after the partition proceedings had been opened. The Government argued that the applicants should have made more extensive use of this remedy, in particular in respect of the Regional Land Reform Board\u2019s decision of 26\u00a0March\u00a02008 to interrupt the proceedings. However the Court has already held in similar cases that a detailed examination as to whether the applicants could have made more efficient use of that remedy by using it at other stages of the proceedings, would overstretch the duties incumbent on applicants pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kern v. , no. 14206/02, \u00a7 49, 24 February 2005 and Klug\u00a0v. Austria, no.\u00a033928/05, \u00a7 31, 15 January 2009, both concerning land consolidation proceedings during which the applicants had successfully made use of the request for transfer of jurisdiction once or twice, respectively, and the Government had argued that, in addition, they should have done so at other stages of the proceedings). The Court sees no reason to reach another conclusion in the present case. In any event the Court notes that the applicants sold their shares of the agricultural association in 2008, the same year in which the Regional Land Reform Board took its decision to interrupt the proceedings. It would be illusionary to expect an applicant at this stage to file a further request for transfer of jurisdiction. The Court therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s objection on non-exhaustion.",

In respect of the domestic proceedings the Court notes that this condition is fulfilled only in respect of the costs of the request for transfer of jurisdiction. As the bills of the applicants\u2019s lawyers submited by the applicants to the Court failed to itemize these specific costs, the Court cannot calculte the respective amounts and make an award. The Court accepts, however, that unreasonable delays in proceedings may involve an increase in an applicant\u2019s costs (see Klug, cited above, \u00a7 50; Kern, cited above, \u00a7 70 both with reference to Bouilly v.

In respect of the Convention proceedings, the bills submitted by the applicants also did not itemize the exact costs incurred by them in the Convention proceedings. However, noting that in the proceedings before the Court the applicants were represented by counsel and did not have the benefit of legal aid, the Court considers that the applicants must have incurred expenses for the fees of their legal representation before the Court. Having regard to the sums usually awarded in similar cases the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicants jointly EUR 2,000. In sum, the Court awards the applicants EUR\u00a03,000 under the head of costs and expenses.",
