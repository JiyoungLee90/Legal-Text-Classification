Even if the applicant had been successful, it is unclear how the claim for damages could have afforded him immediate and effective redress.

In the present case the applicant's requests for leave to appear were denied precisely on the ground that the domestic law did not make provision for convicted persons to be brought from correctional colonies to the place where a civil claim concerning them was being heard. The Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court but rather a more general right to present one's case effectively before the court and to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. Article 6 \u00a7 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, ECHR 2005-II).",

Given the obvious difficulties involved in transporting convicted persons from one location to another, the Court can in principle accept that in cases where the claim is not based on the plaintiff's personal experiences, as in the above-mentioned Kovalev case, representation of the detainee by counsel would not be in breach of the principle of equality of arms.",

Since the option of legal aid was not open to the applicant (see paragraphs 67-71 above), the only possibility for him was to appoint a relative, friend or acquaintance to represent him in the proceedings. However, as is clear from the domestic courts' decisions, the court did not even consider the issue of the applicant's effective participation in the proceedings. They did not enquire whether the applicant was able to designate a representative and in particular whether, having regard to the time which he had already spent in detention, there was still someone willing to represent him before the domestic courts and, if so, whether he had been able to contact that person and give him or her authority to act. Moreover, the applicant did not learn that he had been refused leave to attend the hearing until he found out about the judgment in which the civil claims against him were examined on the merits and accepted (see paragraphs 48-50 above). Thus, the applicant was obviously unable to decide on a further course of action for the defence of his rights until such time as the decision refusing him leave to appear was communicated to him (see Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7\u00a0107, 23 October 2008) and the appellate court did nothing to remedy that situation.",
