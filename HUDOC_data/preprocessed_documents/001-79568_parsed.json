This is the conclusion reached by A.S [name in full], professor at the , in his expert opinion on constitutional matters which had been commissioned by the Carinthian SP\u00d6. Haider, by acting on his own authority, has violated the Carinthian Government's Rules of Procedure and has, thus, breached the law and the Constitution. The expert opinion mentions as an aggravating factor that Haider has 'deliberately mislead the Regional Government and ignored the Regional Constitution and the Regional Government's Rules of Procedure'. According to the expert opinion it is therefore possible to institute impeachment proceedings against Haider. If the  convicted Haider, he would be threatened with dismissal from office. The SP\u00d6 leader Helmut Manzenreiter has now given Mr Haider an ultimatum: either the supervisory board should be appointed afresh by the Regional Government as a whole or there should be a tripartite agreement on transforming Kelag into a holding company. Otherwise, the SP\u00d6 would institute impeachment proceedings against Mr Haider before the elections to the National Assembly. Mr Manzenreiter also called on the \u00d6VP not to 'cover up' Mr Haider's breach of the law. In the Regional Parliament the FP\u00d6 reacted vehemently to the report. The leader of the FP\u00d6's parliamentary group, Martin Strutz, announced that a second opinion would be commissioned. Mr Haider himself could not hide his anxiety. He leaned back in a relaxed fashion only when the leader of the \u00d6VP's parliamentary group, Klaus Wutte, made clear that the \u00d6VP would not support his impeachment. Although the \u00d6VP intends to await the findings of an 'independent' expert opinion, Mr Wutte nonetheless hinted at the party's strategy: 'Not punishment but rectification of Haider's breach of the law.' In so doing, he both foiled his colleague Georg Wurmitzer and confirmed the viewpoint that there is a 'tacit coalition' between the \u00d6VP and the FP\u00d6.'",

Furthermore, the article contained statements which were not supported by the expert opinion, namely that Mr Haider had deliberately misled the Regional Government and the reference to the possible impeachment of Mr\u00a0Haider.

The Government referred in this regard to the domestic courts' findings which they considered relevant and sufficient. The Government in particular pointed out that, while the underlying expert opinion in itself basically was a value judgment, the impugned article did not refer to the matter as a legal dispute but built the expert opinion up to an irrevocable verdict on the Carinthian Governor. Thus, the article did not mention the existence of a counter-expert opinion. Moreover, as regards the distortion of the expert opinion, the applicant company could not prove that it had complied with its obligation to safeguard journalistic diligence as it had relied on a press release prepared by a political party whose views were known to be often contrary to those of the Carinthian Governor without examining the truth behind these statements.

The article contained true statements of fact and thereupon based value judgments, namely statements concerning the legal classification of Mr Haider's acts. The article correctly reflected the main conclusions of the expert opinion which constituted a permissible value judgment about Mr Haider's acts. The domestic courts falsely found that the question whether there had been a breach of the Constitution was only for the  to decide and had not considered that this legal question finally remained controversial. The domestic courts' and the Government's finding that the article constituted an independent attack on Mr Haider's reputation was not true as the article took account of Mr Haider's position. The article explicitly referred to the announcement of counter-expert opinions by FP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP politicians. The applicant company finally argued that it had complied with its obligation of journalistic diligence as it had based the article at issue, in addition to the press release, also on the expert opinion.

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see, for instance, Feldek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76; Jerusalem v. , no. 26958/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2001II; De Haes and Gijsels v.

The Court further notes that Article 10 of the Convention does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. By reason of the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism. Furthermore, special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations (see, as a recent authority, Pedersen and Baadsgaard v.  [GC], no. 49017/99, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2004..., with further references).",

They referred in this regard, firstly, to the wording of the article's headings and to the fact that the article had not published any comment of Mr Haider and had not mentioned the existence of another, more favourable expert opinion.

This subject being of considerable public and political interest, the most careful scrutiny on the part of the Court is called for when, as in the present case, the measures taken by the national authorities are capable of discouraging the participation of a daily newspaper in such a debate. In this context the Court further recalls that freedom of the press affords the public one of the means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders, and also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation. The Court, therefore, considers the argument that the applicant company's report was one-sided and partial as it had not been placed sufficiently in context in itself not relevant to justify any restrictions on the applicant company's freedom of expression.

(see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.  [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR 1999III). The Court, like the domestic authorities, is not convinced by this argument. It has serious doubts whether the statements of political opponents of Mr Haider can be compared to the official report drawn up by a Government appointed expert in the Bladet Troms\u00f8 case. Furthermore, unlike in that case, the applicant company in the present case did not refer to the underlying allegedly incorrect source, namely the press release, but expressly quoted the expert opinion. The Court notes that this opinion of some seven pages was available to the applicant company. Having regard to the seriousness of the accusation against Mr Haider, the Court finds that the applicant company should have consulted this opinion itself in order to comply with the obligation of journalistic diligence instead of relying without any further research on the Socialist Party's press release.",

Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his words and deeds by journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lingens v.

Admittedly, the article was presented in an abridged and one-sided manner, leaving aside details which would have shown Mr Haider's conduct in a more favourable light. However, it should be reiterated that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see, amongst many other authorities, Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no.\u00a0313, p. 19, \u00a7\u00a038). In this context, we further consider that articles in the press are naturally shaped by political convictions and should not be subject to requirements of comprehensive scientific essays. Against this background, the article's statement that impeachment of Mr\u00a0Haider was possible also appears to be within the limit of acceptable interpretation of the expert opinion which had mentioned this option in the abstract.",

However, this statement was based on an incorrect press release issued by the Socialist Party. Therefore we are of the opinion that the applicant company was entitled to rely on the contents of that release (see, mutatis mutandis, Bladet\u00a0Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.  [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR\u00a01999III). We note in this regard that press releases constitute an important source of information for the media. Furthermore, in the present case the Socialist Party had commissioned the expert opinion and it thus appears only natural that this party summarised and presented it to the public. We note finally that the applicant company's misunderstanding of the expert opinion could easily have been rectified if Mr Haider had requested the applicant company to publish a counter-statement. We are not convinced that in a case like the present one the immediate recourse to the Media Act and civil proceedings against the journalists constituted a proportionate response. On the contrary, alternative methods for resolving disputes, such as publication of a counter-statement, should be favoured at least as a first step in such a case.",

Bearing in mind that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest, we find that the domestic courts overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation accorded to Member States, and that the interference was disproportionate to the aim pursued and was thus not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
