Subsequent attempts to administer antiretroviral treatment in April and May\u00a02010 were also discontinued for the same reason. In July 2011 the applicant consented to another course of antiretroviral therapy. However, no treatment was administered until September 2012. The choice of medication was made correctly and the applicant had been undergoing the treatment to date. The only interruption in the treatment occurred between 12 and 22\u00a0June 2013. The irregular nature of the treatment provoked the development of other diseases, such as tuberculosis, inflammation of the lymph nodes, gallbladder polyposis and tonsillitis. He did not receive proper treatment for tuberculosis, with which he had been infected while in detention. In particular, there was a gap in medical supervision and treatment from December 2011 to May 2012, which resulted in further development of the disease. The applicant underwent anti-tuberculosis in-patient treatment from 23\u00a0September to 2\u00a0December 2011. Following his discharge from hospital, nothing was done as regards his tuberculosis infection until May 2012.",

Armenia, no.\u00a034334/04, \u00a7 114, 15 June 2010).
