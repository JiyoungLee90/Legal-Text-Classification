If the respondent State does not make such delivery within three months, it must pay the applicant a sum corresponding to the current value of the flat (see Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria (just satisfaction), nos.\u00a042908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, \u00a7 27, 14 June 2007). As to that value, the Court, taking also into account information available to it as to the property market in Pernik, considers that the amount indicated in the expert report mentioned in paragraph 28 above is just. Accordingly, the Government should pay in compensation that amount, namely EUR\u00a026,122, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",

Firstly, the \u201cperiod of damage\u201d did not start in 1979, but on 7 September 1992, when Protocol No. 1 came into force in respect of Bulgaria. Secondly, it is unclear whether the applicant would have let the flat out, seeing that she did not own other dwelling and had to live in her parents\u2019 flat (see paragraph 11 above). Thirdly, the applicant would have inevitably experienced some delays in finding suitable tenants, would have incurred expenses to maintain the property, and would have been subject to taxation on any rent. Lastly, it is unclear how the eventual rent of BGN\u00a0550 was estimated, and, moreover, in view of the economic realities in Bulgaria, it is unrealistic to assume that rent throughout the period since 7\u00a0September 1992 would have been equal to that charged at present (see Kirilova and Others (just satisfaction), \u00a7\u00a7 28-30, and Dichev, \u00a7 43, both cited above).",
