However, this is dependent on the circumstances of each case. In medical negligence cases, the scope of the redress and the State\u2019s positive obligations in this field have been discussed by the Court primarily in the context of alleged violations of the right to life. In that respect the Court has stated that in the specific sphere of medical negligence, which does not involve intentional infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity, it is not necessary that criminal proceedings have to be brought in every case; it may be sufficient that domestic legal systems afford victims a remedy in the civil courts, enabling any liability on the part of the medical doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress to be afforded, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision; disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (see, for example, Vo v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 53924/00, \u00a7\u00a090, ECHR 2004VIII, with further references).",

In view of the facts of the case and the domestic criminal-law provisions (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above), her recourse to criminal proceedings, which would also ensure the determination of her civil claim, does not appear to be unreasonable.

The Court, having regard to the available material, considers that such a lengthy period was not justified by the circumstances of the case. The applicant\u2019s further appeals in the criminal case, in which she complained of the court\u2019s failure to determine her civil claim, were dismissed as unfounded.

Therefore, the effectiveness of this remedy cannot be considered in isolation. By contrast, assessing the overall length of both sets of proceedings cumulatively, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to carry out a prompt examination of the applicant\u2019s civil claim. Taken overall, the domestic legal procedures offering civil redress to the applicant lasted for an inadequately long period of time and were therefore ineffective in the present case.",
