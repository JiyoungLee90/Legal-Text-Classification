On the issue of family visits, Article 8 requires the States to take into account the interests of the prisoner and his or her family members and to evaluate them not in terms of broad generalities but in application to the specific situation (see Andrey Smirnov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a048). In the present case, however, Judge K. made no attempt to justify the decision to refuse a visit by the applicant\u2019s wife and children beyond a generic reference to the fact that his wife was a witness in the case and that the Defendants\u2019 Detention Act made no express provision for visits by children. The letter did not give any weight to the applicant\u2019s and his family members\u2019 right to respect for their family life or explain why the procedural status of the witness prevented the applicant\u2019s wife from seeing him even after the taking of evidence had been completed and the conviction pronounced. Moreover, the Defendants\u2019 Detention Act does not restrict the right to prison visits to adult family members, and the refusal of a visit by the applicant\u2019s children on the ground that children were not expressly mentioned in the Act was arbitrary.",

It expressed the view that a reasoned decision refusing an application for a prison visit should be amenable to a judicial review. A court carrying out such a review should decide whether or not the refusal was justified in the light of factual elements of the case. Even though the Constitutional Court formulated that position as early as 1998 and affirmed it in subsequent decisions (see paragraph 17 above, and also Vlasov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a075 and 152), the requirement to issue a reasoned decision and to provide for its judicial review has not been incorporated in the Code of Criminal Procedure or the Defendants\u2019 Detention Act. In the absence of a specific requirement, the courts of general jurisdiction did not consider themselves bound by the case-law of the Constitutional Court and rejected applications for prison visits by means of non-procedural letters without giving relevant and sufficient reasons (compare Chaldayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 15). This is what happened in the instant case. The applicant\u2019s request was rejected in generic terms by means of a non-procedural letter which was not amenable to a judicial review. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant did not have an effective remedy for his complaint about the restriction on family visits.",
