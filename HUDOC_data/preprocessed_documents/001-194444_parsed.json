Italy, no.\u00a052763/99, \u00a7\u00a0118, 9 May 2003, and R.M.S. v. Spain, no. 28775/12, \u00a7 89, 18 June 2013). The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the responsible authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child (Kutzner v. Germany, no.\u00a046544/99, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 2002I). When a considerable period of time has passed since the child was first placed in care, the child\u2019s interest in not undergoing further de facto changes to its family situation may prevail over the parents\u2019 interest in seeing the family reunited (see K.A. v.\u00a0Finland, no.\u00a027751/95, \u00a7\u00a0138, 14 January 2003).",

Effective respect for family life requires that future relations between a parent and child be determined solely in the light of all relevant considerations, and not by the mere passage of time (see Ignaccolo-Zenide v.\u00a0Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2000I; D\u2019Alconzo v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a064297/12, \u00a7 64, 23 February 2017; and Barnea and Caldararu v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a037931/15, \u00a7 86, 22 June 2017). If they are not, there will be a failure to respect their family life, and the interference resulting from the decision will not be capable of being regarded as \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a08. In this connection, the Court has further clarified that in cases concerning a parent\u2019s relationship with his or her child, there is a duty to act swiftly and exercise exceptional diligence, in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter (see, mutatis mutandis, Kautzor v.

The children were placed in the care of the S. Municipality in November 2005, with a view to ensuring their temporary protective placement, for such time as necessary in order to carry out an assessment of the family situation (see paragraph 11 above). From this date onwards social services tried out several temporary placement solutions, including the children\u2019s placement with grandparents and placement in a supervised residential unit with the mother (see paragraphs\u00a015 and 23 above). In May 2007 the initial care order was made more stringent, as the court confirmed the need to formally separate the children from the biological parents and place them with a family of alternative carers (see paragraph 30 above). The children were placed with the alternative carers in August 2007 (see paragraph 31 above). From this date onwards the care measure was coupled with restrictions on contact between the children and their biological parents. During certain periods of time all contact with the parents was suspended (see paragraphs\u00a029,\u00a030 and\u00a057) and during other periods contact was limited to sessions every month or every three weeks (see paragraphs 5458 above).",

The Court notes that in the context of such a legal framework, in the present case the care measures themselves were envisaged as temporary, as they were grounded on a legal basis foreseen for temporary measures which may be taken in cases of urgent necessity (see paragraphs 6569 above). The temporary character of the measures was also stressed by the Government in their submissions. The Court further notes that the domestic decisions do not indicate that there was any expectation of longterm care outside the family, nor do they indicate that there was separation with a view to ultimately placing the children for adoption. The fact that the first applicant was never definitely divested of her parental authority, as also emphasised by the Government, constitutes additional evidence of the temporary nature of those measures. The Court notes, in addition, that in the November 2005 decision, which set the care process into motion, the G. Youth Court left it up to the Municipality, in coordination with social services, to decide on the most appropriate kind of placement for the children, and whether such a placement should be made within the family context or outside the family (see paragraph 11 above). The Court notes with concern that this element of delegation discloses the wide latitude afforded to social services by the G. Youth Court in the present case.",

The initial decision of November 2005 did not take a position as regards the existence of actual harm or danger to the children, but considered that the problems reported by the first applicant\u2019s mother and S. were allegations warranting precautionary action, and highlighted that a further assessment of the situation was required (see paragraph 11 above). The Court notes that, in the context of the parallel proceedings concerning the legal separation of the first applicant and S., in February 2006 the S. District Court stated that assessments by social services had not been carried out, and that for that reason it had to confirm the November 2005 order (see 19 above). The Court finds the confirmation and consequent extension in time of the care order on such a basis problematic, especially in the light of the seriousness of the \u2013 until then uncorroborated \u2013 allegations regarding the first applicant\u2019s conduct.",

District Court appointed an independent expert to carry out an assessment of the parents\u2019 capacity to perform their role, and gave the expert a time frame of ninety days (see paragraph 25 above). The report was submitted following a considerable delay, that is ten months after the expert\u2019s appointment and six months after the deadline had passed.\u00a0The Court does not call into question the need to suspend proceedings in order to obtain an expert opinion. Nor does it doubt the need for the expert in the instant case to take \u201ca certain [amount of] time\u201d, as contended by the Government, due to the \u201cwide spectrum of aspects\u201d characterising the case. Nevertheless, it is not entirely persuaded by the Government\u2019s arguments in this regard, as the fact that the domestic court gave a ninetyday time frame for the submission of the report appears, in the Court\u2019s view, to be significant and indicative of the urgency of the matter being considered. The Court further notes that concerns over the delays in submitting expert reports and the lack of documented reasons for such delays were also expressed by the Regional Independent Authority in their assessment of the case (see paragraph\u00a064 above).",

The Court reiterates that as of August 2007 the children were placed with the alternative carers (see paragraph\u00a031 above). In the Court\u2019s view, managing the proceedings swiftly and with exceptional diligence was even more crucial from this moment onwards, given the physical removal of the children from the biological parents and the possibility of the children forming bonds with their alternative carers.\u00a0Such a possibility, with its potentially farreaching repercussions on the applicants\u2019 family life, was even more concrete in the light of the children\u2019s young age when placed with the alternative carers, coupled with the limitations on contact with the biological parents (see paragraph\u00a094 above, in fine).",

The G.

The Court by no means wishes to underestimate the complexity of the situation faced by the domestic authorities and the challenges inherent in balancing the conflicting interests at stake in the present case. It further appreciates the complexity of the childcare proceedings at issue, as highlighted by the Government. Nevertheless, the Court considers that three years \u2013 during which the young children remained with their alternative carers \u2013 to reach a judicial decision dismissing an urgent application in the context of temporary measures does not appear to be a reasonable time frame.",
