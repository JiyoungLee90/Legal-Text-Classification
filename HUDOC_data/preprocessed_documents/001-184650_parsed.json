The Court notes that the case-law example provided by the Government in the present case was adopted on 11\u00a0April 2013\u00a0\u00a0almost two years after the final judgment in the present case had taken effect. Hence, it cannot be invoked to conclude that the existence of this particular domestic remedy had been sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice at the time the applicant\u2019s proceedings were concluded (compare mutatis mutandis Meln\u012btis v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a030779/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-53, 28 February 2012).
