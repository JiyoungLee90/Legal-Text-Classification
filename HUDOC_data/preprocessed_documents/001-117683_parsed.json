Beyond any doubt such an inquiry constituted a matter of significant public interest. It is the fundamental role of the press in a democratic society to deal with such matters, provide coverage of the events for the public, and contribute to discussion. In fulfilling its role as a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d, the press is entitled to address openly and directly such events of general interest, and the margin of appreciation afforded to a State is significantly narrower in these cases (see, mutatis mutandis, Fatullayev, cited above, \u00a7 82, with further references). Therefore a certain degree of journalistic exaggeration, provocation, and even immoderate language had to be tolerated (see paragraph 29 above).",
