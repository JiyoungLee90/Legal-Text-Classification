Even if the district mayor had some misgivings about the management of the hospital it could not be inferred from that that he had specific knowledge about the corruption. The trial court noted that allegations of covering-up corruption were of immense gravity and that the applicant had published them without having them verified. It underlined that shortly after having received the applicant\u2019s letter of 2 June 2005 the district mayor referred the matter of corruption allegations to the prosecution service. In the court\u2019s view, the applicant had flagrantly breached the journalistic principles of diligence and objectivity. The court further noted that in none of the impugned articles had the applicant referred to the uncertain nature of the presented information. The applicant, as an experienced journalist, should have been particularly cautious with the information received from the disgruntled businessman as he had been aware of a sharp conflict between him and the hospital management. However, he had failed to display particular diligence and had exploited that information for sensational purposes in making the district mayor and his alleged cover-up of the corruption the central part of his articles. The trial court referred to section 12 of the Press Act which obliged journalists to display particular diligence in gathering and using the information, and, in particular, to verify the truthfulness of obtained information.",

France, no.\u00a053984/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2004II; Lindon, OtchakovskyLaurens and July, cited above, \u00a7 59; D\u0142ugo\u0142\u0119cki v. Poland, no. 23806/03, \u00a7 47, 24 February 2009), the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account, because they must not be such as to dissuade the press or others who engage in public debate from taking part in the discussion of matters of legitimate public concern (see, Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7 111).",

The domestic courts found that the amount of the fine was proportionate to the applicant\u2019s financial situation, the gravity of the offence and the degree of his guilt. The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise, considering that the domestic courts, when setting the amount of the fine, took into account the relevant factors, such as the profits made by the applicant as a proprietor of one of the most widely read newspapers in the region (compare and contrast, Kwiecie\u0144, cited above, \u00a7 56). That assessment is not affected even if the costs of proceedings that the applicant had to bear were to be taken together with the amount of the fine (compare and contrast, Kasabova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071, in which the aggregate amount of fine, damages and costs imposed on the applicant was equivalent to more than thirty-five times her monthly salary). The domestic courts also had regard to the fact that the applicant had deliberately infringed the reputation of the district mayor and had failed to respect professional journalistic standards.",
