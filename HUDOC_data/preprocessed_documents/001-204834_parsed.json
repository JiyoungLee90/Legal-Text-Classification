Such rules manifest the national legislature\u2019s concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes for such concerns. In addition to ensuring the absence of actual bias, they are directed at removing any appearance of partiality and so serve to promote the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Accordingly, a failure to abide by these rules means that the case has been heard by a tribunal whose impartiality was recognised by national law to be open to doubt. Provided they are not based on arbitrary assumptions, the Court will take such rules into account when making its own assessment whether a tribunal was impartial and, in particular, whether the applicant\u2019s fears can be held to be objectively justified (see Me\u017enari\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a071615/01, \u00a7 27, 15 July 2005).",

In the present case, the only reason on which Judge A. had relied in his request to be replaced in the criminal case was that he had already dealt with an analogous matter in proceedings against the applicant. The statement made in his withdrawal request represented a simple statement of fact (see paragraph 10 above). It was neither alleged nor shown that Judge\u00a0A. had in fact made any statements or conducted the proceedings in a manner that gave rise to doubts as to his personal impartiality (see Vogl and Vogl v.\u00a0Austria (dec.), no. 50171/99, 23 October 2001).",

There is no general rule resulting from the obligation to be impartial that a higher court which sets aside an administrative or judicial decision is bound to send the case back to a different jurisdictional authority or to a differently composed branch of that authority. The mere fact that a judge has made previous decisions concerning the same case cannot be held as in itself justifying fears as to his or her impartiality (see Ringeisen v.\u00a0Austria, 16 July 1971, \u00a7 97, Series A no. 13, and Thomann v.

In such circumstances, the fact that the judge who had been challenged on such grounds decided on that applicant\u2019s challenge does not raise legitimate doubts as to his impartiality (see Debled v.

The applicant referred to important elements which it was necessary to take into account when assessing the judge\u2019s impartiality (see paragraph 13 above). His challenge for bias could not have paralysed the respondent State\u2019s judicial system and be considered an abuse of process or irrelevant, the grounds for impartiality indicated in the challenge being sufficiently specific (see A.K. v.
