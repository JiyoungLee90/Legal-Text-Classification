As already explained above (see the preceding paragraph), the Government emphasised that the applicant\u2019s case had not concerned the termination of the applicant\u2019s career in the civil service owing to the commission of a criminal offence. Had it been so, the presumption of the applicant\u2019s innocence would have been the crucial factor in a decision to dismiss him. Furthermore, if the domestic authorities had considered him guilty of a criminal offence he would not have been able to remain in the civil service, let alone be transferred to another position, because his service would have been terminated by operation of law. Rather, the applicant had been removed from his position of Head of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County State Administration Office on the basis of section 52(3) of the State Administration System Act because the Government of Croatia had considered, within its discretionary powers, that the mere institution of criminal proceedings against him and the adoption of a non-final judgment of 18 December 2003 were circumstances which could harm the probity of the civil service by casting doubt on the diligent and lawful operation of the State administration office he had been running.",

The Court considers that there is nothing in the language used that would call his innocence into question.
