On 29\u00a0July 2003 the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Forensic Institute delivered its reports on the applicant and F.\u00c7., which stated that they were unfit for work for ten and seven days respectively. On 31 July 2003 the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Public Prosecutor filed an indictment against the applicant and F.\u00c7. for assault occasioning bodily harm. The indictment was not served on the applicant or F.\u00c7. On 21\u00a0November 2003 the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Magistrate\u2019s Court issued a penal order without holding a hearing and found the applicant and F.\u00c7. guilty as charged. The court fined each of them 462,377,000 Turkish liras. In doing so, it relied on the \u201csimplified procedure\u201d stipulated in Article 386 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for relatively minor offences. On 14 January 2004 the applicant challenged this decision before the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Criminal Court. On 30 January 2004 the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Criminal Court dismissed the objection without holding a hearing.",

The Court recalls that it has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present applications (see, inter alia, Karahano\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 74341/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03539, 3 October 2006; Evrenos \u00d6nen v. Turkey, no. 29782/02, \u00a7\u00a7 29-33, 15\u00a0February 2007; Nurhan Y\u0131lmaz v.

It finds no reason to depart from such a conclusion in the present case.
