It is true that the applicant was transferred from one correctional institution to another on several occasions and the Court was not informed accordingly of the change of his address. Admittedly, the dispatch of the letters to the applicant\u2019s previous address contributed to the risk of their non-delivery. Even though, under the domestic regulations, it was incumbent on the correctional institutions to forward the letters to the applicant after the change of his address (see paragraph 45), the Court is prepared to accept that some of these letters might have been lost through malfunctioning of the postal service. However, the total number of the letters lost is too high to be viewed as merely accidental. Furthermore, the Court notes that the two letters that had been sent by registered mail were not lost. The first letter of 28\u00a0June 2007 arrived at correctional institution IK-4 when the applicant was no longer detained there. Nevertheless, the authorities made sufficient efforts to forward the letter to his new place of detention. The other letter of 8\u00a0January 2008 was returned to the Court with a postal note stating that the applicant could not be found at the address indicated. In this respect the Court notes that the Government did not provide any explanation as to why the administration of IK-4 had failed to comply with their obligation to forward the letter to another correctional institution where the applicant was detained at the time.",
