That court must then make a decision that is sufficiently reasoned on this point, in order to enable the Court to verify that those questions have been effectively examined. These factors must be evaluated in the light of Article 8 of the Convention (see X v. Latvia, \u00a7\u00a0106).

Corporal punishment against children cannot be tolerated and States should strive to expressly and comprehensively prohibit it in law and practice (see D.M.D. v. Romania, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50-51). In this context, the risk of domestic violence against children cannot pass as a mere inconvenience necessarily linked to the experience of return, but concerns a situation which goes beyond what a child might reasonably bear (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7 116).",

In fact, it can be inferred from the reasoning of the Bucharest Court of Appeal that that court accepted that if such a risk reoccurred, the Italian authorities would be able to react and to protect the children from any abuse of their rights, but only \u201cif the risk was brought to their attention and supported by evidence\u201d (see paragraph 14 above).",

Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). That Regulation, which builds on the Hague Convention, is based on the principle of mutual trust between EU member States (see Royer v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a09114/16, \u00a7 50, 6 March 2018). However, in the Court\u2019s view, the existence of mutual trust between child-protection authorities does not mean that the State to which children have been wrongfully removed is obliged to send them back to an environment where they will incur a grave risk of domestic violence solely because the authorities in the State in which the child had its habitual residence are capable of dealing with cases of domestic child abuse. Nothing in the Hague Convention or in the Brussels\u00a0II\u00a0bis Regulation allows the Court to reach a different conclusion.",
