Where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4\u00a0December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336; see also, mutatis mutandis, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII). Otherwise, torture or ill-treatment may be presumed in favour of the claimant and an issue may arise under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v. , 27\u00a0August 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 108-11, Series A no. 241A, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999-V). The Court further recalls that, while it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and cautious about taking on the role of a first\u00adinstance tribunal of fact, it is nevertheless not bound by the findings of domestic courts and may depart from them where this is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, Matyar v. Turkey, no. 23423/94, \u00a7 108, 21 February 2002 and, by contrast, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, \u00a7 34, Series\u00a0A no. 247B, and Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 34, Series A no. 235B).",

Thus, the Court is not convinced that, despite his reliance on numerous statements made by the police officers as noted in the relevant decisions, the investigator really questioned the witnesses, rather than simply collecting their statements. It appears that no effort was made to clarify the inconsistencies between the statements of various witnesses. The most glaring example of such conduct is the fact that two police officers, S. and T., vaguely mentioned the use of force in respect of the applicant in their depositions of 3 September 2004 (see paragraph 28) and that the competent investigator made no additional inquiries into this episode at all, either during those interviews or at any later date (see paragraphs 27-30, 33 and 35-36). The Court, however, is mindful of the important role which investigative interviews play in obtaining accurate and reliable information from suspects, witnesses and victims and, ultimately, the discovery of the truth about the matter under investigation. Observing the suspects\u2019, witnesses\u2019 and victims\u2019 demeanour during questioning and assessing the probative value of their testimony forms a substantial part of the investigative process.",
