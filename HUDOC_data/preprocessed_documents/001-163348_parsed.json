The prosecutor held that no crime had taken place and that the applicant\u2019s husband had died of a heart attack, when \u2018the ship was on a voyage in the Atlantic Ocean near the Brazilian port of Imbituba\u2019. The prosecutor also relied on the testimony given by an expert, V.A. during the hearing in April 2008 before the Klaip\u0117da Regional Administrative Court (see paragraph 49 below). On the basis of V.B.\u2019s medical record of 15\u00a0June 2001 that expert had testified that V.B. had a partial blockage of the nerve in the heart which makes the heart contract. If the nerve did not work properly, heart arrhythmia could occur, which could in turn cause a heart attack. The position of V.B.\u2019s body was typical of someone who had died of a heart attack. According to that expert, fire could cause a heart attack if a person had been in a smoky environment or a closed space, and there had been a lack of oxygen. However, a heart attack would happen at a slower pace than a person would die of suffocation. Death from a heart attack caused by a fire could not take a day or week to happen.",

It emphasised that what was at issue was a criminal investigation into charges of a violation of requirements to protect health and safety at work. Having examined the pre-trial investigation material, the regional court concluded that the kind of breaches alleged by the applicant had not been properly examined during the criminal investigation. Furthermore, as could be seen from the SLI\u2019s report of 27\u00a0March 2008, the inquiry performed by that body had not been sufficiently comprehensive either (see paragraph 17 above). Accordingly, it could not be stated that the pre-trial investigation into the circumstances of V.B.\u2019s death had been performed thoroughly. In the opinion of the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court, it was therefore vital to continue the pre-trial investigation and to eliminate the doubts raised by the applicant as to the reliability of the results of the medical examination of V.B.\u2019s body, and to establish whether V.B. had indeed worked in harmful conditions during the voyage, including whether regulations on hours of work had been observed. Should breaches of working conditions be established, it was also necessary to order a forensic expert to perform an objective investigation and to establish whether such breaches had had any impact on V.B.\u2019s death. Without a comprehensive examination of those aspects, it had not been reasonable or lawful to discontinue the pre-trial investigation.",

As to the request for legal assistance, there had been objective reasons for it taking several months to send it out after it had been prepared. Firstly, because of the specific rules on asking for legal assistance, and, secondly, because of the need to translate the documents into Portuguese, when there were few competent translators for such work in Lithuania. In addition, the investigators had also relied on the findings of the domestic administrative courts, which had separately looked at the issue of whether the applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s death could be recognised as a workplace accident. In the view of the Government, if the administrative courts had had any doubts about V.B.\u2019s death being due to natural causes, then those courts would have stayed proceedings until the criminal case, pending at the time of the administrative court proceedings, had been decided.",

Be that as it may, the Court has already recognised that instances of the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by a State to include cases involving the activities on board of ships registered in, or flying the flag of, that State (see Bankovi\u0107 and Others v. Belgium and Others (dec.) [GC], no.52207/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059-61, ECHR 2001XII, and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no.\u00a03394/03, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2010). In the instant case the Court observes that the Vega belonged to a Lithuanian company Limarko, the ship was registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailed under a Lithuanian flag (see paragraphs 6, 33, 44 and 53 above). Under Lithuanian legislation, the Vega\u2019s captain exercised exclusive control over the ship while it was on a voyage (see, mutatis mutandis, Medvedyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67). The relations between the ship\u2019s crew and the captain, including those related to safety at work, were determined by Lithuanian laws (see paragraph 53 above). The Court therefore considers that the special features of this case do not absolve Lithuania from an obligation to carry out an effective investigation (see Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, no.\u00a025965/04, \u00a7\u00a7 243-247, ECHR 2010 (extracts)).",

However, even in such situations, those concerned are entitled to an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to its effectiveness (see Jasinskis v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a045744/08, \u00a7 73, 21\u00a0December 2010, and the case-law cited therein). In that regard, the Court would point out that this is not an obligation of result, but of means (see, among other authorities, Emars v. Latvia, no. 22412/08, \u00a7 76, 18 November 2014; Mulini v. Bulgaria, no. 2092/08, \u00a7 42, 20\u00a0October 2015), and that Article\u00a02 does not entail the right to have others prosecuted or sentenced for an offence, or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a094 and\u00a096, ECHR 2004-XII). Nevertheless, in this context the Court also recalls that the authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see Kalicki v. Poland, no. 46797/08, \u00a7\u00a051, 8 December 2015). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or persons responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard (see Olszewscy v. Poland, no. 99/12, \u00a7 68, 3\u00a0November 2015). Whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see Rantsev, cited above, \u00a7 232).",

In light of the ambiguous and unexplained circumstances surrounding V.B.\u2019s death and the allegations of fires and leaks of gases on the Vega in the period leading up to his death, the Court observes that a procedural obligation of effective criminal inquiry did arise in respect of the Lithuanian authorities to investigate the circumstances of V.B.\u2019s death (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). By necessity, the investigation was required to consider not only the immediate circumstance of V.B.\u2019s heart attack but also the broader context of V.B.\u2019s working conditions on the Vega, in order to assess whether there was a link between the allegations of hazardous working conditions and V.B.\u2019s death.",

It is true that the administrative proceedings dealt with the question of whether the death of the applicant\u2019s husband could be considered as a work accident. Those proceedings terminated with the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s conclusion of 5 February 2009, dispelling the applicant\u2019s version of events (see paragraph 50 above). That being so, for the Court it is sufficient to note that on 20 March 2009, when the administrative court proceedings were already over, the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court held that the criminal investigation as to the true cause of V.B.\u2019s death had not been thorough. In fact, to dispel any remaining doubts, the prosecutor was ordered to continue the pre-trial investigation, and a number of investigative measures were conducted afterwards (see paragraphs 23 and\u00a024 above).",

The following day, the Brazilian police took statements from the captain and the chief engineer (see paragraph 7 above). Aside from those actions, as the applicant rightly noted to the Lithuanian criminal court (see paragraph 21 above), her husband\u2019s body was quickly embalmed the same day without her being asked whether she wished any further investigative actions to be taken. As a result, the experts could subsequently only discuss hypothetical possible causes for V.B.\u2019s death, given that the lack of an autopsy prevented them from stating with certainty that he had died of a heart attack (see paragraphs 40-42 above). On this point the Court also notes that the ship\u2019s captain performs the role of an investigative officer if a criminal act takes place on his ship (see paragraph\u00a053 above). Whilst acknowledging that it was mostly not within the captain\u2019s competence to decide what investigative measures the Brazilian authorities should have undertaken before embalming the body, it cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that a heart attack as the cause of death was opportune in the face of the overall suspicions of hazardous work conditions on that ship. That being so, and whilst any possible failure to undertake investigative measures on 24 or 25 October 2007 on Brazilian territory is mostly not down to the Lithuanian ship\u2019s captain and thus not down to the Lithuanian authorities (see paragraph 53 above), it also transpires from the facts of the case that there were numerous deficiencies once the investigation into the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s death was conducted in Lithuania.",

It is particularly striking to note the SLI\u2019s answer that they had not inspected the ship after V.B.\u2019s death, which had taken place nearly two years before (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above). Although the applicant strongly believed that her husband had not died of natural causes, but had been a victim of poisoning by combustion gases, and abundant evidence about those gases and fires on the ship had been brought to the attention of the Lithuanian authorities as early as in spring 2008 (see paragraphs 15-17 above), the Lithuanian authorities made no effort to instruct the Limarko company to bring the ship back to Lithuania, where it could be properly examined, whereas Article 76 of the Code of Criminal Procedure appears to grant the prosecutor exactly that right (see paragraph 52 above). In that connection, the Court further notes that documents and medical experts have established, on the one hand, that the applicant\u2019s husband was healthy, and that there were no obstacles to him serving on board a ship; on the other hand, those experts also concluded that in the absence of documents about the gases it was not possible to say that those gases were not the cause of V.B.\u2019s death (see paragraphs 19 in fine, 30 and 40 above).",

The prosecutor ignored her requests, which was recognised by the Klaip\u0117da City District Court (see paragraph 22 above). Furthermore, although the applicant had as early as July 2009 alerted the prosecutor to the fact that Limarko intended to sell the Vega, and had asked the prosecutor to make sure that relevant documents would not be lost, her request again did not receive a timely response from the Lithuanian authorities. As a result, when half a year later the Klaip\u0117da Seaport Police finally asked Limarko to submit documents regarding the Vega\u2019s machinery section, the company confirmed that the ship had been sold to a third party, and the relevant logbooks had been destroyed (see paragraphs 28, 33 and 34 above). That being so, the Court finds that the Lithuanian authorities failed to secure all the relevant evidence, given the value of such evidence in helping to clarify matters which were central to the investigation. The Court also considers that even if the applicant had been granted victim status at the beginning of the criminal investigation, her participation appears to have been limited to being able only to gain access to the investigation file (see paragraphs\u00a012,\u00a020 and 32 above). Accordingly, the Lithuanian authorities failed to ensure that the applicant was able to participate effectively in the proceedings, despite her constant and strenuous efforts to remain involved.",

In any case, given that the request was sent more than three\u00a0years after the death and after the opening of the pre-trial investigation, it is not astounding that no relevant information was received from the Brazilian authorities (see paragraph 38 above). That notwithstanding, the Court cannot but hold that the Lithuanian prosecutors once again simply accepted the lack of information as a fact, without considering whether it was necessary, for example, to submit another request for legal assistance to their Brazilian colleagues (see, mutatis mutandis, Rantsev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0241).

Experts ruled out the possibility of a causal link between the heart attack and the gas leak. This was the uncontested finding of the administrative courts.

We find that the available forensic evidence enabled the establishment of the cause of death (natural causes) as required by the case-law, and the additional deficiencies of the investigation (e.g. failure, due to delays, to obtain relevant logbooks to enable the authorities to determine the possibility of fumes which could not have caused the heart attack) had no bearing on the elements which had to be determined under the Kalicki test (Kalicki v. Poland, no. 46797/08, \u00a7\u00a051, 8 December 2015).
