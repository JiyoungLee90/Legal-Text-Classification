The case originated in an application (no. 52159/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mühyettin Ernekal (“the applicant”) on 19 February 1999.
The applicant was represented by Mr Mesut Beştaş and Ms Meral Beştaş, lawyers practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.
On 18 March 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the applicant's complaint concerning the alleged denial of his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. In a letter of 25 March 2004, the Court informed the parties that, in accordance with Article 29 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention, it would decide on both the admissibility and merits of the application.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Siirt.
On 20 December 1990 the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways expropriated three plots of land belonging to the applicant.
Following the applicant's request for increased compensation, on 8 September 1998 the Baykan Civil Court of First-instance awarded him additional compensation of 114,180,000 Turkish liras (TRL), plus interest at the statutory rate applicable at the date of the court's decision. In order to calculate the amount of increased compensation, the court consulted several experts.
The General Directorate of National Roads and Highways appealed against the judgment of 8 September 1998.
On 19 October 1998 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment.
According to the order of the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways, the amount of TRL 248,595,000 was paid to the applicant on 22 December 1998. The applicant claimed that he was paid on 4 January 1999.
The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the Aka v. Turkey judgment of 23 September 1998 (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, pp. 2674-76, §§ 17-25).
