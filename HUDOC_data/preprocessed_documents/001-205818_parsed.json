The court also noted that C. and two other prosecution witnesses, who were police officers, had given different accounts of the moment when the applicant and C. had met and, in particular, of the manner in which the bribe money had been passed over. In that respect the court noted that, according to C. and witness M., the money had been inserted by C. into the applicant\u2019s file, which had been placed on the bench between the two men, while according to another witness, C.V., the money had been given by C. directly into the applicant\u2019s hands. One of the witnesses (C.M.), who had been positioned directly in front of C. and the applicant during the undercover operation, had not seen the money being passed over at all. The court also found contradictions in the accounts concerning the applicant and C. shaking hands and the fact that the applicant had been made to sign a paper with a pen lent by one of the officers who had previously manipulated the marked money. The court also gave weight to the fact that the video of the undercover operation had been interrupted precisely during the meeting between the applicant and C. and considered that fact to plead in favour of the applicant\u2019s version of events.",

In so far as the presence of traces of special powder on the applicant\u2019s fingers was concerned, the court considered that it could not be ruled out that the traces had appeared as a result of his shaking hands with C. or using a pen lent to him by the police to sign the arrest report.

However, the Court is called upon to assess whether the proceedings were conducted fairly and in a given case were compatible with the Convention, including whether the domestic courts provided reasoning that satisfied the requirements of a fair trial under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Murtazaliyeva v.\u00a0Russia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a036658/05, \u00a7 149, 18\u00a0December 2018, and, in the context of a first-time conviction on appeal, J\u00fal\u00edus \u00de\u00f3r Sigur\u00fe\u00f3rsson v.

Spain, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, Series A no. 303-A). Thus, it must be clear from the decision that the essential issues of the case have been addressed (see\u00a0Boldea\u00a0v. Romania, no.\u00a019997/02, \u00a7\u00a030,\u00a015 February 2007). The requirement of a reasoned decision obliges the judges to base their assessment on objective arguments and to preserve the rights of the defence. Moreover, for the requirements of a fair trial to be satisfied, the accused, and indeed the public, must be able to understand the verdict that has been given; this is a vital safeguard against arbitrariness (see Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 91-92, ECHR 2010). The reasoned decision is, moreover, important so as to allow an applicant to usefully exercise any available right of appeal (see Hadjianastassiou v.

The Court considers that those who have the responsibility for deciding the guilt or innocence of an accused ought, in principle, to be able to hear witnesses in person and assess their trustworthiness.

The Court\u2019s judgment from 2011 might also have been expected to inspire some caution when the Court of Appeal once again was about to find the applicant guilty without having heard all the witnesses. Moreover, the assessment of the evidence had become even more complex than it had been in 2006, because of the time factor itself, the disappearance of the video recordings of the applicant\u2019s meeting with C. in the park, the death of C. and what appear to be significant developments in the testimonies of the three police witnesses C.C., C.M. and C.V., who were all reheard by the Court of Appeal in 2013 during the second set of proceedings.",

The Court has found that if sufficient reasons are given and adequate safeguards are in place, an appeal court\u2019s overturning of the acquittal of an accused at first instance, and his or her conviction without the re-hearing of witnesses, is not necessarily in breach of Article 6 of the Convention (see Kashlev v.
