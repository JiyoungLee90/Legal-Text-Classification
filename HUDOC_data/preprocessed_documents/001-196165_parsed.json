However, in the Court\u2019s view, what is most important is the fact that the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention for more than two years was contrary to Article 25 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution, which limited the duration of pre-trial detention to twelve months (see Savca v. the Republic of Moldova, no.\u00a017963/08, \u00a7 50, 15\u00a0March 2016).
