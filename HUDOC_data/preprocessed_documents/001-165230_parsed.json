In that case, the Court found proven the fact that the bruising on the applicants\u2019 faces had resulted from a slap inflicted by the police officers while they were under police control (ibid., \u00a7 98). This reversal of the burden of proof in cases where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found injured at the time of release can also be explained by the fact that it is usually difficult for the applicant to furnish sufficient evidence to convince the Court of police misconduct.",

It is obvious that the same standard should be adopted when the burden of proof is reversed, as in the present case. I believe that the principle that the Convention is a vital and living instrument should apply \u2013 and the Bouyid case is a good example of this \u2013 not only in relation to the substantive law but also in relation to the procedural law and the law of evidence, and the development of all these aspects should be in parallel. The judgment in the Bouyid case not only contributed to furthering the guarantee of the right under Article 3 to be protected from ill-treatment, but also elucidated the issue of the evidential proof in such matters by leaving no doubt about it. If in the reversal mechanism the standard of proof were to retreat or diminish, then there would be no justification to talk about reversal. This view is supported, by analogy, by the clear jurisprudence on the matter in relation to the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention. In Velikova v. Bulgaria (no. 41488/98, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2000VI) the Court clearly held that, where an individual was taken into police custody in good health and was later found dead, there was a reversal of the burden of proof and the State, on which it lay, had to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation based on the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. This principle applies also, a fortiori, in relation to Article 3, because unlike the right under Article 2, the Article 3 right is absolute, applying always without any exceptions or possible defences for the State.",

On the one hand, and similar to what was alleged by the respondent State in Sam\u00fct Karabulut (cited above), the Government in the present case averred that the applicant\u2019s injury was caused by the measures used to overcome his resistance during his arrest. The applicant, on the other hand, contended that during his preliminary questioning at the county police station he had been beaten and slapped on the face by police officers, and submitted that his injuries did not correspond to the coercive means which the Government declared to have been used on him, i.e. forms of restraint. In paragraph 59 of the judgment, the majority find the explanation offered by the Government a plausible one, and accordingly, they consider that it has not been established that the applicant was actually exposed to slapping on the face during his preliminary questioning.",

A plausible or possible explanation does not reach the evidential standard or measure required by the jurisprudence, which requires that the explanation be convincing. A plausible explanation has only the appearance of truth or reasonableness as opposed to a convincing explanation, which is effective as proof or evidence, containing the element of conviction or firm persuasion as to the truth of an explanation by rejecting any other. In other words, a plausible argument can be defeated by a convincing one. At paragraph 72 of their judgment the majority, while dealing with the allegations of a violation under the procedural limb of Article 3 of the Convention, rightly consider that the allegations of ill-treatment of the applicant \u201cwere sufficiently credible to give rise to an obligation on the part of the authorities to investigate them in compliance with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention\u201d. Also in paragraph 71 of the judgment the Court, again while dealing with the allegations of a violation under the procedural limb of Article 3, rightly says that it is of the opinion that, \u201cin assessing the credibility of the applicant\u2019s allegations, it must take into account that the applicant was a minor and that there were misgivings as to the regularity of his detention and as to whether his legal guardians had properly been notified of his custody, especially as all of those factors must have been known to the authorities at the relevant time\u201d.",

There should be some consistency and coherence in the findings of the Court in relation to allegations which are relevant when examining both limbs of Article 3. One wonders how the explanation given by the Government would reach the standard required by the jurisprudence such as to be \u201cconvincing\u201d when that explanation was found by the majority only to be \u201cplausible\u201d, while the explanation given by the applicant was found by the Court to be \u201csufficiently credible\u201d. How, after all, could the Government\u2019s explanation be \u201cconvincing\u201d when it was found by the Court that there was a lack of a proper investigation into the matter by the authorities, thus violating Article 3 in its procedural limb?

Received a slap on the right half of a cheek\u201d. Immediately after, probably describing the finding of the doctor (\u201cObj.\u201d) the report goes on as follows: \u201cno haematoma present, palp.

The next sentence, probably referring to the diagnosis of the doctor: \u201cDg.: contusio faciei 1.sins\u201d, is not in the Slovakian language and is of unknown meaning to me. At the end of the report it is stated: \u201cRecommended cold compress\u201d. To the bottom right of the medical report there are, in handwriting, two sentences, the meaning of which is undecipherable, apart from the two abbreviated words \u201corient. neurolog.\u201d probably referring to \u201cneurologick\u00e9 orient\u00e1cia\u201c, in English \u201cneurological orientation\u201d. On basis of the above reference to the neurological orientation and our inability to understand the context in which it is used, I do not share the certainty of the majority\u2019s observation in paragraph 54 of the judgment that the doctor\u2019s findings \u201ccontain no elements, such as a state of shock (see, a contrario, Bouyid, cited above \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 93), fatigue, dehydration or anything else to corroborate his allegations\u201d.",

But such a finding is not expressly stated in this report. It would be odd for a medical report not to say anything about the specific complaint, i.e. as to what the doctor did or did not find on the applicant\u2019s right cheek, and instead to state only what the doctor found on the applicant\u2019s left cheek or what the doctor did not find on the applicant\u2019s eyes and nose. I believe that the most probable meaning of the doctor\u2019s findings in the first report is this: \u201cNo haematoma. A sensitive to palpation right cheek. A swollen left cheek. Nose and eyes without discharge\u201d. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the word \u201clica\u201d meaning \u201ccheek\u201d, is used twice in the doctor\u2019s findings in the first report: in the first place it must refer to the right cheek and in the second to the left cheek. It is not proper, I believe, for important issues such as the alleged violations to be decided on uncertainties and ambiguities of documents and to draw conclusions from them that are adverse for an alleged victim. In case of doubt, I believe that the Court has a duty, under the Convention, to safeguard and secure the core of the substantive right of the alleged victim, i.e. his right to be free from degrading treatment, by following the principle in dubio in favoram pro libertate.",

Answers to only five of the questions, however, are given by the doctor, the rest remaining unanswered. The answers given by the doctor to questions 1, 2, 4, 8 and 11 are the following. As to the first question, probably on the findings of the doctor, the answer was: \u201cA bruised cheek on the left\u201d. As to the second question on the patient\u2019s submission about the origin and manner of infliction of the injury, the answer was: \u201cAllegedly beaten by a police officer\u201d.

I also take seriously the fact that the answer given to question 2 does not confine the applicant\u2019s complaint to any particular cheek. It is to be noted also that in the first report it is stated, apart from the applicant\u2019s specific complaint about a slap on the \u201cright half of a cheek\u201d, that he was beaten by the police officers, without any further explanation. In paragraph 55 the majority note \u201cthat there is no indication in the doctor\u2019s conclusions or otherwise that [the applicant\u2019s injury] could only have been caused by a slap in the face as alleged by the applicant or, conversely, that it could not have been caused by the means referred to by the Government\u201d. For me, however, what is more important is the opinion of the doctor that the injury could have been sustained as alleged by the applicant (answer to question 4 of the second medical report). The doctor\u2019s finding about the left cheek in answering question 1 is, I believe, in line with what the doctor said in answering questions 2 and 4. It is quite probable that what the doctor said in answering the first question is his main finding, avoiding here the additional mention that the other cheek was found to be sensitive \u2013 a minor finding perhaps for the doctor, but certainly an important one for the Court. A sensitive cheek does not necessarily have to be swollen. On the other hand, there would be no need to describe the same cheek as both swollen and sensitive. It can be argued, in any event, that the first report, dealing with the \u201cfinding\u201d, carries more weight than the second, which is preliminary in nature.",

I do not therefore see that there is any inconsistency in regard to this part of his story as the majority so assess. Besides, the doctor who examined him had found, according to the most reasonable \u2013 in my view \u2013 interpretation of his first report, that something happened to both of his cheeks: the right cheek was sensitive and the left cheek was swollen and bruised.

Here one cannot therefore jump to the conclusion that the applicant had not suffered a slap on his right cheek, simply because no hematoma or bruising was found on it. Apart from the physical strength of the assaulter and the forcefulness of the slap, for a slap to leave signs of its appearance on a face, many other factors could probably be relevant, e.g. the anatomy of the victim\u2019s face, whether the victim was young with a soft face, whether the slap landed mainly on the bone or the flesh, the manner or method of slapping used and the training of the assaulter to use violence without leaving signs on the body.",

Even if there were some degree of exaggeration in the applicant\u2019s story as to the degree of his maltreatment, which, in any event, can be understood, taking into account his psychological condition due to the circumstances of his arrest and detention, what happened to him does not seem to be an illusion or a lie.
