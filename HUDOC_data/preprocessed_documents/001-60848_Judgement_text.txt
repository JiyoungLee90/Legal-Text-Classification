The case originated in an application (no. 34454/97) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mrs Fabrizia Fleres (“the applicant”), on 5 October 1996.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Albanesi Ginammi, a lawyer practising in Rome. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, and by their co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that she had been unable to recover possession of her flat within a reasonable time. Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, she further complained about the length of the eviction proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr. V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of Italy, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government appointed Mr. G. Raimondi as ad hoc judge to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 2).
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Rome.
The applicant is the owner of an apartment in Rome, which she had let to G.S.
In a registered letter of 2 November 1983, the applicant informed the tenant that she intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1983 and asked him to vacate the premises by that date.
In a writ served on the tenant on 11 December 1984, the applicant reiterated her intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Rome Magistrate.
By a decision of 6 February 1985, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises must be vacated by 10 January 1986.
On 19 December 1986, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises.
On 27 January 1987, she served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 13 March 1987.
Between 13 March 1987 and 27 January 1989, the bailiff made twelve attempts to recover possession.
On 12 May 1989, the applicant made a statutory declaration that she urgently required the premises as accommodation for her family.
Between 19 May 1989 and 14 July 1999, the bailiff made sixty-three attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession.
On 25 February 2000, the tenant vacated the premises.
The relevant domestic law is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.
