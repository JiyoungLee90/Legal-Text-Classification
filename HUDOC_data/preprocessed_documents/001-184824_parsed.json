However, the absence of voluntary compliance measures significantly diminished the possibilities for cooperation with the obstructing parent. Although, admittedly, the voluntary execution is always preferable, the Court observes that the entrenched positions often taken by the parents in such cases can render such voluntary execution difficult, making it necessary, in appropriate cases, to have recourse to proportionate coercive measures.",

Apparently, when introducing his second claim on the same matter after many years of the child living with her mother, the applicant had to provide weighty reasons for changing the child\u2019s place of residence to his home. Those reasons would have to be based on the need to ensure \u201cthe best interests of the child\u201d and would have to be substantiated by the relevant evidence. However, the domestic courts did not consider that such reasons had been established. Having regard to the wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by the domestic authorities on custody rights, the Court, on its part, finds that the domestic courts, which were better placed to assess the evidence, struck a fair balance between the competing interests, and the decision to keep the child\u2019s place of residence with her mother ensured the child\u2019s best interests (see Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a041615/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0134 and 135, ECHR 2010). The Court also accepts that the domestic courts had sufficiently addressed the applicant\u2019s arguments which were not supported by any substantive evidence (see, in particular, paragraphs 22-25 above). There is no indication of arbitrariness or failure to respect the procedural rights of the applicant. Accordingly, the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention is manifestly ill-founded.",
