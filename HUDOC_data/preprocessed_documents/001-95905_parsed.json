By another decree of 27\u00a0March\u00a02003 the Government allowed the company to sell a large portion of its property and ordered that the proceeds be put towards paying off the company's debts owed to the State budget (see paragraphs 25 above).

However, the decision ordering the seizure and sale of the company's property \u2013 apparently for the purpose of enforcement of the relevant court judgments \u2013 was not taken by the bailiff's service but by the Government.

Admittedly, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances. However, it may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V).",
