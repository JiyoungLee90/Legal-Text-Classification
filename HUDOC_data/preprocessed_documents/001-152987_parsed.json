Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which an issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Tomasi v. France, 27\u00a0August 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 108-11, Series A no.\u00a0241A). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3.
