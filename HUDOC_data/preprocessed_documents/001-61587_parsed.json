These examinations did not show any signs of tuberculosis. The applicant and Mr Yusev subsequently shared a cell from 3\u00a0February to 4 July 1997. On 4 July 1997 a regular medical examination revealed that Mr Yusev had pulmonary tuberculosis without growth of micro-bacteria. Then the applicant started displaying some symptoms and there was a strong suspicion that he also had tuberculosis. That was confirmed by an X-ray examination of 18\u00a0September\u00a01997. We would like to ask you a very important question and we will have to check this with the medical files. Between the initial X-ray examination in 1995 and the examinations which led to the discovery of tuberculosis, first in Mr Yusev and second in the applicant, were the half-yearly regular obligatory X-ray examinations carried out in respect of the two prisoners?\u201d the witness stated: \u201cNot every six months, but once a year.\u201d There had been a difference between the normal prisoners and the death row inmates, who had been subjected to stricter conditions during the period from 1995 to 1996. According to him, conducting half-yearly X-ray examinations could not help prevent the spread of tuberculosis as it was not possible to avoid infection. He said that the applicant and Mr Yusev were the only two cases in which inmates had contracted tuberculosis in the prison.",

The second period during which the applicant and Mr Yusev had shared a cell had lasted from 4 November 1997 to 9 June 1998, that is to say four months after Mr Yusev had been found to be suffering from tuberculosis and his treatment had started, and one and a half to two months after the applicant had been found to be infected with tuberculosis and his treatment had started. In the period when the two inmates were placed in separate cells, Mr Yusev had been subjected to intensive chemotherapy. Moreover, for the first six weeks during which intensive chemotherapy was administered to the applicant, positive progress had been achieved (X-ray examination of 24\u00a0November 1997). Therefore, during the period in which the convicts shared the same cell, there would have been a very insubstantial possibility of repeated infection of the applicant by Mr Yusev. The intensive chemotherapy administered to Mr Yusev during the first two months halted bacillus excretion \u2013 that is to say, eliminated the epidemiological threat in 90-100 per cent of bacteria producers.",

It was most probable that the origin and manifestation of pulmonary tuberculosis in the applicant was connected with the poor state of his health and the stress caused by having committed a crime, being imprisoned and, finally, being sentenced to capital punishment. In addition, the applicant and Mr\u00a0Yusev suffered from two different forms of tuberculosis (the applicant suffered from focal tuberculosis, while Mr Yusev suffered from infiltrative tuberculosis).",

The Report noted that certain changes had occurred since the previous visit. In particular, the cells had natural light and were better furnished and the prisoners had an hour of exercise per day in the open air, although it was observed that there was insufficient space for real physical exercise (paragraphs 34-35). The Report further recorded that important progress had been made in the right of prisoners to receive visits from relatives and to correspond (paragraph 36).

Moreover, life-sentence prisoners were confined in their cells for 23 \u00bd hours a day with no form of organised activities and, by way of activities outside their cells, were entitled to only half an hour outdoor exercise, which took place in unacceptable conditions. There was virtually no human contact: since the entry into force of the July 2000 instruction, visits from relatives had been forbidden and prisoners were only allowed to send one letter every two months, although there were no restrictions on receiving letters (paragraph 70).",

However, on the latter date a de facto moratorium on executions was declared by the President of Ukraine; on 29 December 1999 the Constitutional Court held the provisions of the Criminal Code governing the use of the death penalty to be unconstitutional; and on 22 February 2000 the death penalty was abolished by law and replaced by a sentence of life imprisonment (see paragraph 19 above). The applicant was sentenced to death in February 1996, over 12 months before the moratorium came into effect. The Court accepts that, until the formal abolition of the death penalty and the commutation of his sentence, the applicant must have been in a state of some uncertainty, fear and anxiety as to his future. However, it considers that the risk that the sentence would be carried out, and the accompanying feelings of fear and anxiety on the part of those sentenced to death, must have diminished as time went on and as the de facto moratorium continued in force.",

While it cannot establish with complete clarity the conditions of detention to which the applicant was subjected prior to the Court Delegates\u2019 visit, certain facts are beyond dispute and clearly established. The Court views with particular concern that, until at earliest May 1998, the applicant, in common with other prisoners detained in the prison under a death sentence, was locked up for 24 hours a day in cells which offered only a very restricted living space, that the windows of the cells were covered with the consequence that there was no access to natural light, that there was no provision for any outdoor exercise and that there was little or no opportunity for activities to occupy himself or for human contact. In common with the observations of the CPT concerning the subjection of death row prisoners in Ukraine to similar questions, the Court considers that the detention of the applicant in unacceptable conditions of this kind amounted to degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court further finds that the applicant\u2019s situation was aggravated by the fact that he was throughout this period subject to a death sentence, although, as noted in paragraphs 19 and 168 above, a moratorium had been in effect since 11 March 1997.",

In particular, the coverings over the windows of the cells were removed, daily outdoor walks were introduced and the rights of prisoners to receive visits and to correspond were enhanced.

Moreover, the economic problems faced by Ukraine cannot in any event explain or excuse the particular conditions of detention which it has found in paragraph 178 to be unacceptable in the present case.",

The record does not fully accord with the evidence of the applicant who told the Delegates that he had been detained with Mr\u00a0Yusev from 3 February to 4 July 1997 (see paragraph 34 above) or with that of the Governor of the prison, who appeared to assert that the two inmates had shared a cell until 4 July 1997, when a regular medical examination revealed that Mr Yusev was suffering from tuberculosis (see paragraph 53 above). To the extent that the oral evidence and the contemporaneous prison record conflict, the Court prefers to rely on the latter as likely to be the more accurate and thus finds that the applicant was detained in a separate cell from Mr Yusev from 23 April 1997. The Court further does not consider to be reliable the applicant\u2019s evidence that, during the period that they were detained in the same cell, Mr Yusev was already ill. In fact, the latter\u2019s X-ray examination of 14 February 1997 showed no pathological changes in his lungs. It was only on 4 July 1997 that an X-ray examination revealed an infiltration in his upper right lung (ibid.). One week later, on 11 July 1997, the diagnosis that Mr Yusev had pulmonary tuberculosis was confirmed and on 23 July 1997 he began intensive chemotherapy (ibid.). The Court underlines in this connection that Mr\u00a0Yusev\u2019s tuberculosis was diagnosed more than two months after he had been detained together with the applicant. It would theoretically be possible for Mr Yusev to have been suffering from tuberculosis while sharing a cell with the applicant and before the pulmonary tuberculosis was officially diagnosed on 11 July 1997. The Court notes that according to the conclusions of the independent medical commission, Mr Yusev and the applicant suffered from two different types of tuberculosis and Mr Yusev was not suffering from an active form of tuberculosis (see paragraph 91 above).",
