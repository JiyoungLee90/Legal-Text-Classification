Greece [GC], no.\u00a050385/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a057-59, ECHR 2004XI, and Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a096, ECHR\u00a02005VII). Furthermore, the national law regulating policing operations must secure a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force and even against avoidable accident (see Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). In particular, law-enforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the pre-eminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97).",

As the servicemen fired back, the car was set on fire and the three members of illegal armed groups in it were killed. The letter of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the  of 7 April 2002 stated in this connection that on 9 March 2002 a VAZ 21099 car had approached a checkpoint of military unit no. 3179 situated about 4 km away from the outskirts of Stariye Atagi on the road between Chechen-Aul and Stariye Atagi. In response to the order to stop the car and produce identity papers, shots had been fired from the car. During the shoot-out four passengers had been killed and the car had been burnt.

The Court accepts that the opened fire must have posed a danger to the lives of the servicemen at the checkpoint and might have warranted the use of arms in response. However, the information available does not permit it to establish conclusively which weapons were used by the servicemen and which particular actions led to the death of the applicants\u2019 relatives, thus precluding the Court from finding that the use of lethal force was in compliance with Article 2 of the Convention. It notes, in particular, that it follows from the decision of the Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the UGA of 9 September 2006 that the car with several persons in it, which had already been shot at and set on fire, was crushed by an APC, which is further supported by photographs of the car submitted by the applicants.

Furthermore, the investigation was resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves a number of times due to the need to take additional investigative measures (see, in particular, paragraphs 93 and 119). However, they still failed to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations properly. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative steps that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on, including the possibility to appeal against the decision of 26 March 2007 to discontinue the investigation, would have had any prospects of success. Therefore, the Court finds that the remedy relied on by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and rejects their preliminary objection in this respect.",
