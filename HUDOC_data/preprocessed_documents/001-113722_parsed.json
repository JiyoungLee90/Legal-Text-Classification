The applicant was not free to leave the institution without the management\u2019s permission. Nor could the applicant himself request leave of absence from the home, as such requests had to be made by the applicant\u2019s official guardian. Accordingly, and as in the Stanev case, although the applicant was able to undertake certain journeys and to spend time with his family the factors mentioned above lead the Court to consider that the applicant was under constant supervision and was not free to leave the home without permission whenever he wished (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 128). Moreover the Court notes that it would appear that the applicant\u2019s extended visits to his family were only authorised during the last few years of his stay in the Ruda R\u00f3\u017caniecka Home.",

The Court reiterates that the fact that the applicant lacked de jure legal capacity to decide matters for himself does not necessarily mean that he was de facto unable to understand his situation (see Shtukaturov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a044009/05, \u00a7\u00a0108, ECHR\u00a02008). Whilst accepting that in certain circumstances, due to the severity of his or her incapacity, an individual may be wholly incapable of expressing consent or objection to being confined in an institution for the mentally handicapped or another secure environment, the Court finds that this was not the applicant\u2019s case. The documents presented to the Court indicate that the applicant subjectively perceived his compulsory admission to the Ruda R\u00f3\u017caniecka Home as a deprivation of liberty. On a number of occasions the applicant requested the courts to start proceedings to quash his legal incapacitation order, submitting that this would allow him to leave the home. For many years he has been consistently complaining about his placement in the care home, to the courts, the prosecutor and the District Family Centre. Also, in his correspondence with the Court between 2007 and 2012 the applicant consistently asked for help to leave the social care home where he had been placed and was being kept against his will. The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s argument relating to the applicant\u2019s own declaration made when interviewed by the experts on 7\u00a0April 2009 (see paragraphs\u00a032 and\u00a052 above). However, the Court would rely on the assessment of this statement made by the experts themselves who disregarded it as being in clear contradiction to the applicant\u2019s real intentions, consistently expressed so far (see paragraph\u00a033 above).",

However, in the present case the courts were not involved in deciding on the applicant\u2019s placement in the care home at any moment or in any form. It appears that, in situations such as the applicant\u2019s, Polish law does not provide for automatic judicial review of the lawfulness of admitting a person to, and keeping him in, an institution such as a social care home (see paragraphs\u00a041 and 59 above). In addition, a review cannot be initiated by the person concerned if that person has been deprived of his legal capacity. In sum, the applicant was prevented from independently pursuing any legal remedy of a judicial nature to challenge his continued involuntary institutionalisation.

In the latter judgment the Court observed that eighteen of the twenty national legal systems studied in 2011 provided for direct access to the courts for any partially incapacitated individuals wishing to have their status reviewed. In seventeen States such access was open even to those declared fully incapable (see Stanev, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a095 and\u00a0243).

Also, under those circumstances, refusing the applicant\u2019s requests for the incapacitation order to be changed on at least three occasions between March and October 2007 cannot be seen as justified enforcement of a legitimate procedural limitation on the applicant\u2019s right of access to court (see Angel Angelov v.
