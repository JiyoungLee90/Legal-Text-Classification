The sums were then withdrawn and distributed to other entities, all traceable to the applicant. Furthermore, in order to hide the illicit origins of the money, other sums were transferred, hidden and replaced through other named companies, only to eventually be transferred to the applicant (and others) personally. The inquiring judge noted that those instances formed the basis of the second and third charge of money laundering. In particular, the factual circumstances, inter alia, suggested that there existed a criminal organisation made up of politicians, civil servants, entrepreneurs and bankers. The applicant appeared to have had a key role as a politician who had served in various posts and in the inquiring judge\u2019s view he was particularly well placed to accumulate money which he then concealed behind various companies located in San Marino and abroad.",

More than eleven million euros had been deposited but no trace of it could be found in the accounts. Discretion in the exercise of decision-making by political powers, as well as bureaucracy, gave the opportunity to \u201cinvestors\u201d to pay millions of euros in bribes to the Foundation in order for it to allow, for example, construction in areas identified by local plans as zones where development was forbidden. The investors knew the money would eventually get to the applicant, who was in a position to influence the approval of such projects, which could only come about by bending the rules. The inquiring judge observed that further investigations were necessary to understand the reasons behind a transfer into the Foundation of three million euros by a certain A.S., one million of which reached the applicant in cash.",

The judge noted the substantial flow of money managed by the applicant, which was not compatible with his income. In view of the various evidentiary elements he concluded that it could be held with reasonable certainty that the financial transfers had been made in connection with the relations the applicant had with the co-accused, as a result of and during the time he had been a State representative. The evidence suggested that he had the ability to organise and benefit from adequate support to facilitate a further dispersion of funds, as a result of a mutual covering up with other associates, by means of the direct or indirect acquisition of the management of economic activities and of positions in public office in order to obtain unjust profit and advantage. The seriousness of the applicant\u2019s particular conduct indicated his specific role in the organised criminal group. In addition, the speed with which certain transfers of millions of euros had taken place demonstrated the network of mutual assistance from which the applicant and the criminal organisation benefited and continued to benefit within the institutional and economic system in San\u00a0Marino. According to the inquiring judge, the danger presented by the applicant had not diminished simply because he had quit public office. Indeed, in 2013 the applicant had sold an apartment, which had already been subject to leasing and payment for which had been made (accreditati) from Foundation funds, which showed that his contacts with the relevant entities remained in place. Furthermore, the inquiring judge considered that the systematic concealment of funds through fictitious payment descriptions (causali fittizie), the use of frontmen (prestanome) and of shell companies (societa schermo) rendered the risk of tampering with evidence a real one. According to the inquiring judge, that risk persisted, given the evidence existing both in San Marino and abroad, because of the wide support network. That meant that less restrictive measures could not be considered as appropriate when trying to make sure that the applicant (and his coaccused) did not commit further acts of money laundering.",

Contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertions, the existence of this risk remained. The inquiring judge considered that the results of the investigation as well as the behaviour of the applicant, both during the interviews and while in detention, confirmed that view. He noted that the applicant\u2019s co-accused had tried to make contact with other people, namely, a private doctor, on the pretext of being ill, even though state doctors had not found any signs of illness. Furthermore, both of the accused had attempted to involve relatives in interfering with and altering documents. The inquiring judge referred to the applicant\u2019s ability to create ad hoc documents which looked real, with the intention of having them admitted as evidence. He also highlighted the applicant\u2019s participation in the manipulation of the truth and the artificial reconstruction of facts and the dissimulation of the real functions of the accused. According to the inquiring judge, such factors meant that the court could not exclude that there would be attempts to tamper with evidence.

Similarly, the first-instance court\u2019s finding on the attempt to involve third parties in tampering with evidence had been based on the fact that the applicant had transferred property into his daughter\u2019s name and the apparent complicity of M. (against whom proceedings had been instituted) who owed allegiance to the applicant in exchange for favours he had received.

Dismissing the applicant\u2019s arguments, the court found that it was therefore not necessary to repeat the earlier factual basis for the order or to give new reasons, as requested by the applicant, because the previous reasons were still valid, as also confirmed at various levels of jurisdiction. Furthermore, in so far as the applicant had claimed that the decision of 18 September 2014 had been based on elements (concerning his behaviour) that had not been found in the file, the court noted that a judge could ex officio take factors into consideration which had occurred after the issuance of the detention order. Indeed, in the present case, to make sure that there were no reasons to warrant a change in the applicant\u2019s pre-trial conditions, the judge had used information which, although having come to his knowledge by other means, was also found in the public domain (in the press and in publicly available judicial documents concerning the proceedings against M.). He further noted that the requirements of adversarial proceedings at the pre-trial stage, such as the non-disclosure and publication of documents, were different from those in a trial since pre-trial proceedings required a level of secrecy that enabled further investigations if necessary, including international assistance. While equality of arms had to be respected in connection with the debate concerning the measure imposed, the applicant could not obtain the declassification of documents by reiterating the same arguments. That was all the more so when the detention order had to a large extent been based on the fact that there was a risk of tampering with evidence. The applicant\u2019s request had to be seen in the light of the need to preserve the evidence as well as the proper administration of justice. \u00a0The necessity to maintain the classification of certain information was all the more important when that information concerned crimes for which charges had not yet been brought. It followed that the applicant\u2019s detention could not be revoked nor could further information be declassified. The court also noted that in 2009 Article 5 of law no. 93/2008 had been amended to include a suspension of the time-limit in the case of requests for letters rogatory. In the case at hand requests for judicial assistance had been made, thus in view of the applicable suspension the time-limits had not yet expired.",

The order of 18 September 2014, apart from relying on the evidence in the proceedings against M., had been based on other, more significant and relevant reasons. The impugned decision of 6 March 2015 had stated that the reasons to deny his application \u201calso\u201d included his attempts to communicate with others. The decision of 13 October 2014 had also stated that the measure had been justified by much more important reasons. Lastly, the decision of 6 November 2014 had also referred to other grounds for his detention. It followed that none of the decisions in question had been based solely on the supposed collaboration of M.

Added to those factors were other elements collected through investigations of suspicious financial operations, as well as witness testimony resulting from questioning and the large amount of documents that had been seized. The investigation as a whole concentrated on the overlap between political and economic activity and criminal activity. Referring to various evidentiary conclusions the court considered that in relation to the further charges of money laundering against the applicant, the evidentiary scenario was robust and exhaustive.

They had shown further money transfers between clearly identified people (including the applicant), as well as the origin of the funds and were connected to the facts behind the first set of accusations. In so far as the applicant had claimed that there had been no proof of conspiracy or of the illicit origin of the funds, and thus that there had been no substantiation of the charge of money laundering, the court held that the original decision of 23 June 2014 had highlighted the existence of a general agreement with permanent effects (constituting the pactum sceleris) between representatives of the State and the business world, as well as the details of its aims and functionalities. It further noted that final judgments confirming that a crime had generated certain funds were not needed to establish money laundering, but that it was enough to have a number of factual elements indicating the supposed crime which generated those funds. In other words the burden of proof to be satisfied was one where the illicit origin of the funds emerged from a logical and coherent interpretation of the evidence. The first-instance decision, based on the transfer of huge amounts of money, through the creation of ad hoc offshore companies and the dispersion of such sums in parcelled and undetectable amounts had therefore been reasonable.",

Under the Convention, the Court cannot therefore deal with any application which has already been investigated or is being investigated by such an international procedure (see Celniku v. Greece, no. 21449/04, \u00a7 39, 5 July 2007). The term \u201canother procedure\u201d refers to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings similar to those set up by the Convention (see Lukanov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a021915/93, Commission decision of 12 January 1995, DR\u00a080A, p. 108). The Court must therefore determine whether the nature of the supervisory body, the procedure followed thereby and the effects of its decisions are such that Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) precludes the Court\u2019s jurisdiction (see, in respect of the \u201c1503 procedure\u201d before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Mikolenko v.

The Prison Standards developed by the CPT make specific mention of outdoor exercise and consider it a basic safeguard of prisoners\u2019 wellbeing that all of them, without exception, be allowed at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day and preferably as part of a broader programme of outofcell activities (see Ananyev and Others, cited above,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0150).

He was not subject to the regime of isolation as intended in law (see paragraph\u00a076 above) pursuant to an intentional decision by the authorities. Rather, the situation was the consequence of concomitant circumstances. Indeed, the limitation on the applicant\u2019s contact with the outside world only concerned his co-accused, and the fact that he could not, in practice, speak to anyone else (except for guards or visitors) was merely the result of the fact that there were no other detainees (save for his co-accused). While that situation may have affected the applicant to a certain extent, it was sufficiently attenuated by the possibility of contact with other persons and other activities available to him (see paragraph 103 above). In particular, he was allowed family visits and visits by his lawyer, as well as a priest and a doctor. The Court notes that any restrictions on the conditions in which those visits took place (see paragraph 99 in fine), in the circumstances of the present case, have no bearing on his complaint of conditions of detention. In the Court\u2019s view the restriction imposed on the applicant, namely to avoid contact with his co-accused, was circumscribed. While it lasted over a number of months, there was no intention to punish the applicant who could still have contact with the guards, family members and his lawyers (contrast with Lors\u00e9 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 63 et seq.). Moreover, according to the applicant\u2019s medical visits he does not appear to have suffered any physical or psychological consequences from this de facto situation.",

It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task (see Raducki v. Poland, no. 10274/08, \u00a7\u00a039, 22\u00a0February 2011). In those circumstances, the Court considers that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources, including from abroad, and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-accused, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention during the period necessary to terminate the investigation.",

Thus the domestic courts pointed to aspects of the applicant\u2019s behavior to justify their conclusion that he presented such a risk (see, a contrario, \u0160o\u0161 v.

While such a danger usually diminishes with the passing of time (see Wemhoff v.\u00a0Germany, 27 June 1968, \u00a7 14, Series A no. 7), in the present case it was only at a later stage that that reason was invoked by the domestic court. Nevertheless, the Court notes that, in the present case, the reasoning given for the existence of that risk, namely that the applicant\u2019s link to San Marino was diminishing, as well as the actions of one of the alleged international accomplices (see paragraph\u00a050 above), cannot be considered unreasonable in the context of money laundering on an international scale given the connections of the applicant, which the courts repeatedly found to have persisted throughout.",

Nevertheless, the Court takes note of the fact that shortly after the indictment on the first five charges, the relevant domestic court discontinued the applicant\u2019s detention on remand in connection with those charges, and that he remained in detention only in connection with further charges which were still being investigated and for which detention remained necessary for the reasons already invoked. The Court considers that the reasons in the ensuing decision, namely that of 15 October 2015 (see paragraph 64 above), which reiterated the basis of the decision of 9\u00a0March 2015, albeit in relation to the remaining charges, were also relevant and sufficient.",

As noted by the authorities, the investigation was additionally complicated by the need to obtain evidence from abroad since the applicant and other accomplices had operated in a number of countries (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above). Despite this complexity, the applicant was brought to trial in connection with some of the charges less than a year and a half after the charges were issued. From the information available, the Court cannot identify any periods of inactivity in the proceedings other than those occasioned by the need to gather evidence by way of letters rogatory.

Indeed the latter has the role of a magistrato requirente (see paragraph 70 above) who may at any stage of the proceedings make submissions and pleas (see Law no.\u00a093/2008) and may lodge a challenge before the appeals court and the third-instance court (see paragraphs 73 and 74 above), if he deems fit, but does not act as a \u201cprosecutor\u201d as understood in continental legal systems.

In Ozerov (\u00a7\u00a053 of the judgment) the Court found that by examining the case on the merits and convicting the applicant without the prosecutor the District Court confused the roles of prosecutor and judge and, thus, gave the grounds for legitimate doubts as to its impartiality. In Krivoshapkin (\u00a7\u00a044 of the judgment) the Court also considered that the trial court had not preserved the guarantees of the adversary nature of the criminal proceedings and had confused the functions of prosecutor and judge: it had taken up the prosecution\u2019s case, examined the issues, determined the applicant\u2019s guilt and imposed a sanction. Drawing inspiration from the above, the Court considers that in a system such as that of San Marino, where at pre-trial stage, for the purposes of whether an accused person should or should not be kept in detention, the judge assumes to a large extent also the role of the prosecutor, it cannot be said a priori that the principle of equality of arms between the parties, in so far as it concerns the disclosure of documents, does not come to play. On the contrary the Court considers that an accused in such circumstances must in principle have access to the evidence relied on by the judge deciding or confirming such measures.",

This independent judicial authority could examine all the relevant evidence, both closed and open, and was well placed to ensure that no material was unnecessarily withheld from the detainee (see A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 219). Subsequently, if necessary, such decision could also be appealed before the third-instance judge (see paragraph 74 above). Thus, the applicant benefited from a three-tier assessment in relation to his challenges concerning disclosure. The applicant in the present case repeatedly took these courses of action, and the respective judicial authorities confirmed the previous decisions and at times ordered the release of further documentation (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a024 and 41 above). In this connection the Court cannot but note that documents were declassified with the passage of time, as the interests of protecting the investigation diminished in relation to certain aspects. In consequence, the effectiveness of these appeal procedures was not only one in law but also in practice.",

However, as the domestic courts explained, it was not necessary to have confirmation of the illicit origins of the funds in order to suspect money laundering, but that it was enough to have a number of factual elements indicating the supposed crime which generated those funds, such as in the present case, the information relating to the entire scenario, in particular the substantial flows of money received and managed by the applicant, which was not compatible with his income (see paragraph 11 and 55 above). The information summarised in those decisions was also enough to bring into play the charges of conspiracy (see paragraph 55 above). Although the applicant argued that information about the crime of conspiracy was only disclosed in May 2015, the Court is ready to accept the domestic court\u2019s explanation that the previous information disclosed, seen in context, was sufficient to enable the applicant to challenge his detention.",

In that connection the domestic courts held that it sufficed for a judge to take into consideration matters in the public domain (see paragraph 44). The Court considers that while it may be acceptable for courts to base decisions on general knowledge, in the present case the domestic courts, on two occasions (see paragraph 39 and 41), based their decisions on elements found in the case file of separate proceedings (against\u00a0M.). While it is true that the case file may have been public, the domestic court itself in its decision of 13 October 2014 considered that such matters would be clarified once the documents had been declassified (see paragraph 41 above). None of that material had been specifically included in the applicant\u2019s file, or provided in any other way to him. However, the Court observes that the facts mentioned by the domestic court in its decision (see paragraph 39 above) were sufficiently detailed to enable the applicant to contest them as being a basis for his detention.",

The Court can accept that in the complex and serious crimes related to money laundering - which implies an ability to conceal funds of illegal origin and subsequently to surreptitiously reintroduce them into the legal financial system - there may exist a general risk of tampering with evidence, or reoffending, flowing from the very nature of organised crime (see paragraphs 147 and 149 above). Further, the reference to the applicant\u2019s behaviour while in detention - the evidence of which was not disclosed to the applicant - was only a supplementary argument to a corollary ground of detention, unrelated to the unabated reasonable suspicion (see paragraphs 148 \u2013 150 above). In view of the foregoing the fact that in the decision of 18\u00a0September 2014 the authorities partly relied on elements, which were not included in the applicant\u2019s casefile, does not suffice in itself to find a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4",
