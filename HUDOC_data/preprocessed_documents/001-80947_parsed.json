The principle of equality of arms \u2013 one of the elements of the broader concept of a fair trial \u2013 requires that each party should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case under conditions that do not place him or her at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his or her opponent (see A.B. v. , no.\u00a041784/98, \u00a7\u00a055, 4 March 2003). As the Court has previously found, the principle of equality of arms would be devoid of substance if a party to the case were not notified of the hearing in such a way as to have an opportunity to attend it, should he or she decide to exercise a right to appear established in domestic law (see, mutatis mutandis, Yakovlev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a019). Furthermore, from the Convention standpoint, a hearing may be held to have been \u201cunfair\u201d and in breach of Article 6 even in the absence of proof of actual prejudice (see P., C. and S. v. the , no.\u00a056547/00, \u00a7\u00a096, ECHR 2002VI, with further references). Finally, the Court reiterates that, in determining issues of fairness of proceedings for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention, it must consider the proceedings as a whole, including the decision of the appellate court (see C.G. v. the , no.\u00a043373/98, \u00a7\u00a035, 19\u00a0December 2001).",
