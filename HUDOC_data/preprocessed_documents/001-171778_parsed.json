The psychiatrist further noted that in 2005 the applicant had been subjected to a prolonged, psychologically traumatic experience at the nursery school. Against the background of that prolonged, traumatic experience, the incident of 7 November 2005 involving the use of violence had served as a trigger for his present neurological disorder. An allergic reaction to the eye drops could have also contributed to the development of the disorder. The psychiatrist concluded that there had been a causal link between the traumatic experience suffered by the applicant in the nursery school from September 2005 to November 2005 and his persistent neurological disorder.",

He affirmed that his tics were aggravated each time that he remembered, or had to discuss, the treatment to which he had been subjected in the nursery school. The experts confirmed that the aggravation of the tics was indeed related to the applicant\u2019s memories of the nursery school. The experts found that before November 2005 the applicant had not suffered from any psychiatric disorder. There had been a causal link between his nervous disorder and the prolonged, psychologically traumatic experience to which he had been subjected in the nursery school from September to November 2005. Many years later he still continued to suffer from nervous tics. He had therefore suffered damage of medium severity to his health. The experts further noted that the applicant did not suffer from any memory or intellectual disorder and that his intellectual development corresponded to his age; he was therefore capable of understanding and relating the relevant events accurately. However, his ability to remember the events had decreased with time. If in 2006 he had been still capable of remembering the events in question accurately, with the passage of time his memory of the events had become unrealistic and distorted.

The court also noted that although, according to the experts, the statements that the applicant had given after 2006 were unreliable, the statements that he had given before then could be taken into account in the assessment of evidence. The City Court also criticised the District Court for the delays in the examination of the complaint lodged by the applicant\u2019s mother on 9\u00a0October 2012 and the resulting excessive length of the judicial proceedings.",

In particular, the State authorities opened nursery schools, appointed their directors and certified them as meeting the formal official requirements of curriculum. Nursery schools were regularly inspected for compliance with the law and were financed from the State budget.

The applicant argued that the examples of case-law submitted by the Government showed that the offence of cruel treatment of minors was punished very leniently in Russia. He considered the sentences imposed in those cases to have been disproportionate to the suffering and damage caused to the children concerned. Secondly, even after the authorities had learned about the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment by the teachers, they had not taken any measures to protect the other pupils at the nursery school from similar treatment.

In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question of whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see V.\u00a0v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999IX).",

It is supported in part by the statements by the assistant teacher and by some of the parents of other pupils who confirmed the incident of 7\u00a0November 2005 and described some of the punishments used by the teachers against the applicant and some other pupils (see paragraphs 60 and 65 above). A panel of experts found on 14 January 2011 that the applicant had been subjected to a prolonged, psychologically traumatic experience at the nursery school between September and November 2005 that had resulted in a persistent neurological disorder (see paragraph 75 above), thereby confirming earlier findings to the same effect made by specialist doctors (see paragraphs 80 and 81 above). The domestic authorities found it established, on the basis of that evidence, that the teachers had subjected the applicant to battery and cruel treatment of minors but discontinued the criminal proceedings against them as time-barred (see paragraphs 83 and 111 above). The authorities also found it established that the teachers had caused damage of medium severity to the applicant\u2019s health but decided against prosecuting them because the investigation had failed to prove an intent to cause damage to health, such intent being an essential element of the offence of premeditated infliction of damage to health of medium severity (see paragraphs 106, 108 and 110 above). The Court finds the above elements sufficient to establish to the standard of proof required in Convention proceedings that the staff of the nursery school subjected the applicant to the treatment complained of.",

He had been told that if he complained to his parents he would be subjected to further punishment, which must have exacerbated his feelings of fear and vulnerability. The teachers had moreover used physical force (which had resulted in a bruise on his face) to administer eye drops to the applicant without his parents\u2019 consent and without any medical prescription having first been obtained or indeed any medical necessity having first been established by a medical professional. The Court has regard to the applicant\u2019s extremely young age at the time (four years). It also takes note of the fact that the applicant was subjected to such treatment for at least several weeks and that many years afterwards he continues to suffer from its consequences, in particular in the form of a post-traumatic neurological disorder (see paragraphs 124-128 above). Moreover, the above acts were perpetrated by teachers in a position of authority and control over the applicant and some of them were aimed at educating him by humiliating and debasing him. The Court considers that the cumulative effect of all the above-described acts of abuse rendered the treatment sufficiently serious as to be considered inhuman and degrading within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",

The Court observes at the outset that nursery schools in Russia are incorporated as separate legal entities in the form of public or municipal institutions. Such institutions have very strong institutional and economic links with the State or the municipality respectively (compare Saliyev v. Russia, no. 35016/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a064-68, 21\u00a0October 2010). In particular, their real estate and equipment belong to the State or the municipality, they are bound by legal constraints attached to the use of their assets and property, and they receive State or municipal funding (see paragraphs 145146 above). It is also significant that by virtue of the law the State or the municipality respectively bears subsidiary liability for any debts and obligations of such institutions (see paragraph\u00a0147 above). The Court notes in this connection that it has already found on a number of occasions that the debts of Russian public and municipal institutions are to be regarded as State debts (see, for example, Yavorivskaya v. Russia, no.\u00a034687/02, \u00a7 25, 21 July 2005; Gerasimova\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia (dec.) no.\u00a024669/02, 16 September 2004; and the relevant judgment of Gerasimova v.

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which seriously undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. In cases under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time. Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements, the length of time taken for the initial investigation and the unjustified protraction of the criminal proceedings resulting in the expiry of the statute of limitations (see C.A.S. and C.S. v. Romania, no. 26692/05, \u00a7 70, 20\u00a0March 2012, and S.M. v. Russia, no. 75863/11, \u00a7 68, 22 October 2015). The victim should be able to participate effectively in the investigation in one form or another, in particular, by having access to the materials of the investigation (see Buntov v. Russia, no. 27026/10, \u00a7 125, 5 June 2012, with further references).",

Russia that in cases of credible allegations of treatment proscribed under Article 3 of the Convention, it was incumbent on the authorities to open a criminal case and conduct an investigation, a \u201cpre-investigation inquiry\u201d alone not being capable of meeting the requirements of effective investigation under Article\u00a03 of the Convention. It held that the mere fact of the investigating authority\u2019s refusal to open a criminal investigation into credible allegations of illtreatment was indicative of the State\u2019s failure to comply with its obligation under Article 3 to carry out an effective investigation (see Lyapin\u00a0v. Russia, no. 46956/09, \u00a7\u00a7 133-40, 24 July 2014). In the subsequent case of Razzakov v.

The police did not take any action in respect of the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s complaint either.

It is significant that very few investigative measures were carried out within the framework of the preinvestigation inquiry during that period and that there were lengthy periods of inactivity between them: in particular, the investigator questioned the applicant and several witnesses in the first week of November 2006, a witness in January 2007, several witnesses in February 2008 and a witness in August 2008. Ultimately, the police department decided to open a criminal investigation on 19 January 2009, that is more than three years after the first complaint about ill-treatment.

Indeed, by the time the investigation was opened, prosecution for the offences under Articles\u00a0116 and 156 of the Criminal Code (battery or other violent acts causing physical pain and cruel treatment of minors) had already become time-barred. The investigation in respect of those offences was therefore discontinued, even though the domestic authorities found it established that the teachers had subjected the applicant to violent acts causing physical pain and cruel treatment (see paragraphs 45, 83 and 111 above). The Court has already found in a number of cases where the authorities\u2019 failure to show diligence resulted in the prosecution becoming time-barred that the effectiveness of the investigation was irreparably damaged and the purpose of effective protection against acts of ill-treatment was frustrated (see, among many other authorities, Beganovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a046423/06, \u00a7 85, 25 June 2009; Nikiforov\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a042837/04, \u00a7 54, 1\u00a0July 2010; Ablyazov v.

That attempt turned out to be futile because, in contrast to the offence of cruel treatment of minors, an essential element of that offence was the intent to cause damage to health. As the prosecuting authorities were unable to prove such intent, the investigation was ultimately discontinued for lack of evidence (see paragraphs 106, 108 and 110 above). It is also noteworthy that the investigation under Article\u00a0112 was remarkably slow, as acknowledged by the Government (see paragraphs 114 and 161 above), and lasted for almost six years, until October 2014, even though prosecution for that offence had also become time-barred by the end of 2011.",

The experts found in April 2009 and then again in January 2011 that, given the applicant\u2019s young age at the material time and the time that had elapsed since the alleged ill-treatment, he could no longer remember the events accurately and his statements could not be relied upon in the criminal proceedings. The delay in opening an investigation therefore resulted in the applicant\u2019s statements being discarded as unreliable evidence (see, for example, paragraphs 83 and 106 above).",

An award may still be made notwithstanding the large number of imponderables involved in the assessment of future losses, though the greater the lapse of time involved the more uncertain the link between the breach and the damage becomes. The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, in respect of either past or future pecuniary loss, which it is necessary to award to an applicant, and is to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable (see Mikheyev v. Russia, no. 77617/01, \u00a7 158, 26 January 2006, and Denis\u00a0Vasilyev v. Russia, no. 32704/04, \u00a7 166, 17 December 2009, with further references).",
