Given the applicant\u2019s history of unsuccessful tuberculosis treatment, there was a vital necessity to perform that test. In particular, it was impossible to choose the appropriate treatment for the applicant without testing him for drug resistance. The Court has already condemned delays in recommending and performing drug susceptibility tests in the initial stages of the diagnostic process (see Ivko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0105; Kushnir v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a042184/09, \u00a7\u00a0146, 11 December 2014; Makharadze and Sikharulidze v.

As a result of the authorities\u2019 failure to arrange that vital test, the prospects of success of the first ten months of the tuberculosis treatment were undermined. The Court also considers that it was unacceptable that even though they had learned of the resistance of the applicant\u2019s tuberculosis to the treatment being used, the medical authorities did not change it within a reasonable time, but continued to use it for the next two months.",
