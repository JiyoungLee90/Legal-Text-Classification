Italy [GC], no. 24952/94, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2002-X). The Government did not provide any explanation as to why they had omitted to raise their de minimis objection in their observations of 29\u00a0July 2013, and there are not any exceptional circumstances which would exempt them from their obligation to raise any objection to admissibility in a timely manner (see Khlaifia and Others v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a016483/12, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2016 (extracts)).

The Court is further satisfied that the interference in question was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d, in particular Article 152 of the Civil Code, and \u201cpursued a legitimate aim\u201d, namely \u201cthe protection of the reputation or rights of others\u201d, within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.

Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, \u00a7 132, ECHR 2015), Article 10 of the Convention affords journalists protection, subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism (see Pentik\u00e4inen v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2015). A high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities therefore having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, is normally accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest (see B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7 49). Politicians and civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v.\u00a0Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001III, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2004XI). A careful distinction needs to be drawn between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no.\u00a033348/96, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2004XI, and Morice, cited above, \u00a7 126). When examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of \u201cprotecting the reputation ... of others\u201d, domestic authorities must strike a fair balance when protecting two conflicting values that are guaranteed by the Convention, namely, on the one hand, the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 and, on the other, the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see, among many other authorities, Med\u017elis Islamske Zajednice Br\u010dko and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos.\u00a017224/11, \u00a7 77, 27 June 2017). In order for Article 8 of the Convention to come into play, however, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and its manner must cause prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v. Norway, no. 28070/06, \u00a7 64, 9\u00a0April 2009, and Axel Springer AG v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7 83, 7 February 2012).",

Furthermore, they observed that the retainer agreement between the applicant and her representative had fixed an hourly rate of EUR 40 while the itemised schedule had been based on an hourly rate of EUR 50. The Government concluded that these claims had not been supported by appropriate documents.",

In the present case, the applicant did not enclose any document as evidence of payment of the judicial award. Accordingly, the Court rejects this part of the claim. As to the remainder of the claims, the Court notes the discrepancy between the hourly rate stipulated in the retainer agreement and the one appearing in the final invoice. This discrepancy, in its view, may be attributed to a clerical error or may be the result of a change in the agreement. In any event, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, while satisfied that the applicant incurred certain legal costs in connection with her application, the Court considers it reasonable not to award the amount claimed in full. It thus awards the sum of EUR 850 for the proceedings before the Court.",
