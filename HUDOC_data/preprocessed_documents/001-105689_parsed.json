Consequently, the relevant deduction from sentence does not in principle deprive the applicant of his status as an alleged \"victim\", within the meaning of Article 34, of a breach of Article 5; it is a matter to be taken into consideration solely for the purpose of assessing the extent of any prejudice he may have suffered. The position might be otherwise if the deduction from sentence had been based upon an acknowledgement by the national courts of a violation of the Convention (see, among other authorities and mutatis mutandis, De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, \n22 May 1984, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 77, and Pavleti\u0107 v.

Such, however, is not the case here; in fact, inclusion of the time spent in custody in the overall time to be served by the applicant was not in any way connected to the alleged violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (or Article 5 \u00a7 4) of the Convention but followed directly from the operation of Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 above; compare Lebedev v.
