It rejected the remainder of the applicant company\u2019s complaint. It found the seizure lawful and, on this point, considered that a publisher/journalist could not, as such, be regarded as enjoying the privilege of non-disclosure (verschoningsrecht) under Article 96a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Statutorily, the persons referred to in Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and acknowledged as enjoying the privilege of non-disclosure were, amongst others, public notaries, lawyers and doctors. It considered that the right to freedom of expression, as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention, included the right freely to gather news (recht van vrije nieuwsgaring) which, consequently, deserved protection unless outweighed by another interest warranting priority. It found that, in the instant case, the criminal investigation interest outweighed the right to free gathering of news in that, as explained by the public prosecutor during the hearing, the investigation at issue did not concern the illegal street race, in which context the undertaking of protection of sources had been given, but an investigation into other serious offences. The Regional Court was therefore of the opinion that the case at hand concerned a situation in which the protection of journalistic sources should yield to general investigation interests, the more so as the undertaking to the journalistic source concerned the street race whereas the investigation did not concern that race. It found established that the data stored on the CD-ROM had been used for the investigation of serious offences and that it had been made clear by the prosecutor that these data were relevant to the investigation at issue as all other investigation avenues had led to nothing. It therefore concluded that the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity had been complied with and that the interference had thus been justified. The  did not find that the seizure had been rash, although more tactful action on the part of the police and the public prosecutor might have prevented the apparent escalation of the matter.",

On that date, it handed down a judgment in which it found that a journalist, when asked as a witness to disclose his source, was obliged to do so unless it could be regarded as justified in the particular circumstances of the case that the interest of non-disclosure of a source outweighed the interest served by such disclosure. This principle was reversed by the Supreme Court in a landmark judgment of 10 May 1996 on the basis of the principles set out in the Court\u2019s judgment of 27 March 1996 in the case of Goodwin v. the United Kingdom (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II). In this ruling, the Supreme Court accepted that, pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention, a journalist was in principle entitled to non-disclosure of an information source unless, on the basis of arguments to be presented by the party seeking disclosure of a source, the judge was satisfied that such disclosure was necessary in a democratic society for one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (NJ 1996, no.\u00a0578). In a judgment given on 2 September 2005 concerning the search of premises of a publishing company on 3 May 1996 (Landelijk Jurisprudentie Nummer [National Jurisprudence Number] LJN AS6926), the Supreme Court held inter alia:",

Luxembourg, judgment of 25 February 2003 [ECHR 2003IV]). An interference with the right freely to gather news \u2013 including the interest of protection of a journalistic source \u2013 can be justified under Article 10 \u00a7 2 in so far as the conditions set out in that provision have been complied with. That means in the first place that the interference must have a basis in national law and that those national legal rules must have a certain precision. Secondly, the interference must serve one of the aims mentioned in Article 10 \u00a7 2. Thirdly, the interference must be necessary in a democratic society for attaining such an aim. In this, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality play a role. In that framework it must be weighed whether the interference is necessary to serve the interest involved and therefore whether no other, less far-reaching ways (minder bezwarende wegen) can be followed along which this interest can be served to a sufficient degree. Where it concerns a criminal investigation, it must be considered whether the interference with the right freely to gather news is proportionate to the interest served in arriving at the truth. In that last consideration, the gravity of the offences under investigation will play a role.\u201d",

Court H.R., Goodwin v. the , 27 March 1996, para. 39). Journalists may receive their information from all kinds of sources. Therefore, a wide interpretation of this term is necessary. The actual provision of information to journalists can constitute an action on the side of the source, for example when a source calls or writes to a journalist or sends to him or her recorded information or pictures. Information shall also be regarded as being \u2018provided\u2019 when a source remains passive and consents to the journalist taking the information, such as the filming or recording of information with the consent of the source.\u201d",

In Nordisk, a request for disclosure of journalistic materials made by the Danish police in the context of an investigation into sexual assaults upon children was heard before the Copenhagen City Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court.

What occurred in this case, in my opinion, is not far removed from (and in certain respects goes beyond) the type of \u201cdrastic measure\u201d previously criticised by this Court in finding a violation of Article 10 of the Convention. The absence of any statutory requirement for prior judicial involvement in a case such as this, is, in my view, somewhat more than \u201cdisquieting\u201d (as the majority considers) and the actions of the police are a great deal more than \u201cregrettable\u201d (paragraphs 62-63).",

To my mind, great caution should be exercised before the law draws too sharp a distinction between such matters. The purpose of the legal protection of sources is founded upon an important point of principle. This protection is granted to ensure that those who (for reasons of fear or otherwise) disclose, secretly, to journalists matters that are of public interest are not discouraged from so doing by the risk that their identities may be revealed. If legal protection is to be limited, strictly, to non-disclosure of \u201csources\u201d then such sources may suddenly \u201cshut up\u201d, fearful that their identities will be ascertainable once the journalist to whom confidential data has been given is no longer its sole custodian. Such a risk of indirect disclosure is likely to discourage an otherwise courageous \u201csource\u201d from bringing matters of vital interest into the public domain. In my view, it is not of pivotal significance that the intention behind a given interference is to identify evidence rather than individuals. It is the fact of interference (with its attendant risk of source identification) that undermines and weakens the worth of a journalist\u2019s undertaking. Thus, this Court imposes a high threshold of \u201cnecessity\u201d before finding that such interference can be compatible with Article 10.",

Without confidential sources, journalists would be fettered in the discharge of their important function as \u2018public watchdog\u2019. Disclosure is always contrary to the public interest and the question for consideration in any given case is whether there is an overriding alternative public interest, amounting to a \u201cpressing social need\u201d, to which the need to keep press sources confidential should yield. To establish that a \u201cpressing social need\u201d exists, sufficient reasons for the otherwise unlawful interference must be shown. The respondent State, to my mind, has failed, entirely, to show that the police would not have been able to identify the vehicle in any other way. No evidence has been adduced to indicate that even one alternative effort was made (such as a search of motor taxation records or ongoing surveillance of suspects or questioning on suspicion of involvement) in order to obtain the evidence they required. It would appear that once the police had lost the car chase earlier in the day, their first port of call was to the applicant company\u2019s offices with their \u201cimmoderate\u201d demand for the surrender of photographic and other materials. Because of the importance of the principle at stake, the journalist should be the last, rather than the first, means of arriving at evidence required.",

Their provisions on the seizure of journalistic material might best be described as draconian (\u201cThe police may, on the instructions of a public prosecutor ... or not as the case may be, arrest a journalist on suspicion of a criminal act and seize everything he has with him on the spot.\u201d). With effect from 1 April 2002, some two months after the events in this case, those provisions were replaced by a new Directive on coercive measures by the police in respect of journalists. This Directive contained extensive reference to this Court\u2019s case law and provided, inter alia, that where \u201cthe protection of a journalist\u2019s source is at issue, the use of coercive measures must be in accordance with Article\u00a010\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02\u201d. These facts confirm me in my view that the actions of the police in this case were in violation of Article 10 of the Convention.",

To my mind the judgment will render it almost impossible for journalists to rest secure in the knowledge that, as a matter of general legal principle, their confidential sources and the materials obtained thereby are protected at law.",
