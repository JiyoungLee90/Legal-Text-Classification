She said that while they were sleeping at home, some police officers came to their house and asked about her brother Mehmet \u015eah. When her father explained to the police officers that Mehmet \u015eah was staying at his uncle's house, the police officers left the house, taking Halil with them. Some time after, the police officers came back and arrested everyone in the house, including the witness. They were first taken to \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Police Station and then to the police headquarters. The witness explained that she had not seen Mehmet \u015eah in the \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Station but she had seen him at the police headquarters. When they arrived at the police headquarters, they walked upstairs and were taken into a hall. Their eyes were not covered but they were forced to hold their hands behind the back of their necks. They were made to stand facing the wall. When the witness glanced over her shoulder, she saw that Mehmet \u015eah was standing next to her. This was the last time she saw him. However she recalled hearing his voice at the Rapid Intervention Force, which was the third place they were taken to. He was moaning. She was kept in a cell, together with Makbule, Nefise, Adile, Bilge and Sabriye \u0130kincisoy. At some point, Sabriye and Makbule were taken out of the cell and when they came back they were shivering. They therefore requested a blanket from the guardians and the guardians gave them a brown leather jacket which belonged to Mehmet \u015eah.",

He recalled that after receiving information from Feyzi Tatl\u0131, a person who was under custody, that Mehmet \u015eah had been aiding and abetting the PKK, an operation was prepared. Feyzi Tatl\u0131 was asked to point out the house of Mehmet \u015eah to a group of five police officers, including the witness. On 22 November 1993 at about 1 a.m. they arrived at the apartment of Abdurrazak, the father of Mehmet \u015eah. Abdurrazak1 told them that his son was staying at his uncle's house. Accordingly, taking a young person with them to show them the way, and leaving one police officer in the house of Abdurrazak1, they left. When they arrived at Mehmet \u015eah's uncle's house, one police officer remained near the patrol car, and the witness stayed outside the building. Two police officers went upstairs. A few minutes later the witness heard gun shots from upstairs. One of the police officers, Mustafa H\u00fcnerlit\u00fcrko\u011flu, came downstairs, holding someone by the wrist. He told the witness that the third police officer, Ali\u015fan, had been shot. The witness entered the building to help his colleague. At that time Mustafa went outside, still holding the detainee by the wrist. The witness then heard footsteps and he hid under the stairs. A person fired a Kalashnikov rifle at the witness and wounded him in the abdomen. The witness fired back and killed the person who had fired at him. He then went out of the building to get help. When officer Mustafa saw that the witness was wounded, he left the detainee and ran towards him. The person who had been in custody ran away. The witness was subsequently taken to hospital, where he underwent an operation. When he regained consciousness in the hospital, his colleagues asked him to sign the incident report they had prepared. The public prosecutor further took his statement while he was still in intensive care. The witness accepted that there had been a mistake in the names that appeared in the incident report. He agreed that instead of Hanefi \u0130kincisoy, the name should have read Mehmet \u015eah \u0130kincisoy. The witness further explained that he had not been involved in the arrests or interrogations of the people who had been in the house at the time of the incident.",

Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a028883/95, 4 April 2000). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court's task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic authorities and, as a general rule, it is for those authorities to assess the evidence before them (see Klaas v. Germany, judgment of 22\u00a0September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, \u00a7 29). Though the Court is not bound by the latter's findings, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact they have reached (ibid., p. 18, \u00a7 30). In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Ireland v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, \u00a7 161).",

The respondent state accepted that on 22\u00a0November 1993 a police team composed of five police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Diyarbak\u0131r Security Directorate conducted a search in the first applicant's apartment. Their aim was to find Mehmet \u015eah \u0130kincisoy and to take him to the police headquarters for interrogation in connection with an ongoing investigation. When they were informed that Mehmet \u015eah was staying at his uncle's house, the police officers took the second applicant as a guide and left the first applicant's apartment. The Government further agreed that when the officers had arrived at Abd\u00fclkadir \u0130kincisoy's apartment, one of the police officers stayed at the entrance of the building and two officers went inside the apartment together with the second applicant. They were informed that Mehmet \u015eah was there, together with his two friends. The two officers then started to interrogate them in a room and one of the men who was staying with Mehmet \u015eah shot and killed one of the police officers. These facts are also in conformity with the testimonies of Abdurrazak, Halil, Nas\u0131r and Garip\u015fah \u0130kincisoy before the Delegates. The Court has carefully examined these testimonies and compared them with the statements taken from the two police officers who had participated in the operation. Accordingly, it accepts the above account as the true facts of the case until the killing of the first police officer.",

The \u0130kincisoy family members, who were in Abd\u00fclkadir's apartment, stated that subsequent to the shooting of the police officer, the second officer grabbed Mehmet \u015eah and dragged him downstairs (see paragraphs 45 and 47). This fact is also confirmed by officers H\u00fcnelit\u00fcrko\u011flu and Akay, who maintained that officer H\u00fcnerlit\u00fcrko\u011flu used Mehmet \u015eah as a shield. However it is maintained that when the second officer was shot, Mehmet \u015eah had escaped (see in this respect paragraphs 49-50). The witnesses and the custody records submitted by the Government revealed that subsequent to the shooting, all family members who had been present in Abd\u00fclkadir's and Abdurrazak's apartments had been taken into custody (see paragraphs 25, 43, 45, 47 and\u00a048). Although the \u0130kincisoy family members argued that they were first taken to the \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Police Station and then to the Rapid Intervention Force (see paragraphs 43, 46 and 48), the officers denied this submission, insisting that the arrested persons had been directly taken to the Rapid Intervention Headquarters for interrogation (see paragraphs 52 and 54).",

The Court notes that the testimony of the applicants and their witnesses essentially reiterated the content of their written statements. They submitted important details such as a description of his clothes and of the place where they had last seen him. On the other hand, the Government denied that Mehmet \u015eah had been detained by the police officers. They argued that he had escaped after the shooting of the second officer and died the day after in an armed clash. The Government witnesses further referred to the custody records which did not contain the name of Mehmet \u015eah, whereas it contained the names of all the rest of the \u0130kincisoy family members who had been detained that night. The Court must therefore examine whether these custody records can be regarded as irrefutable evidence that Mehmet \u015eah had not been detained. It recalls both its own findings and those of the Commission as to the general inadequacy and unreliability of custody records (see \u0130rfan Bilgin v. Turkey, no. 25659/94, \u00a7 130, ECHR 2001VIII, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.

Concluding that such records cannot in general be relied upon to prove that a person was not taken into custody, the Court considers that the fact that Mehmet \u015eah \u0130kincisoy's name was not in the custody record at the Diyarbak\u0131r Security Directorate does not itself prove that he was not in custody.",

The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention.

It has examined these elements and has not disclosed any manifestly unreasonable or arbitrary conclusions drawn by the competent authorities from them. It thus sees no reason to doubt that the elements of which the authorities disposed were sufficient to believe, at that time, that the applicants had been involved in an offence.",

No violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 can arise if the arrested person is released \u201cpromptly\u201d before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, p. 25, \u00a7\u00a052, and Brogan and Others, cited above, pp. 31-2, \u00a7 58). The Court finds that the release of the first applicant, who was held in police custody for no more than three days, may be regarded as \u201cprompt\u201d for these purposes. Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in his case.",
