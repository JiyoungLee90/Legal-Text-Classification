Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant\u2019s release or transfer to a different type of detention regimen, either within or outside the facility, would put an end to the \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d (Ananyev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a042525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 78, 10 January 2012). In the absence of a description whatsoever of the conditions of detention while in Timi\u0219oara Prison (application no. 54609/15) or in Dej Prison Hospital (applications nos. 49735/16 and 54650/16), the Court cannot conclude that the applicants were detained in identical or substantially similar conditions. Thus, it finds that the periods mentioned above, notwithstanding their short duration, interrupted the continuous situation of the applicants\u2019 detention (see Abdilla v. Malta, no.\u00a036199/15, \u00a7\u00a028, 17 July 2018). Given this interruption, and taking into account the dates on which the applications were lodged with the Court, the applicants complaints about the conditions of their detention before 30 January 2012 (application no. 54609/15), 14\u00a0January 2016 (application no. 49735/16) and 18 December 2015 (application no.\u00a054650/16) respectively, are belated (see Abdilla, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027-29, and Eskerkhanov and Others v.
