The existence of positive relations between staff and prisoners, based on the notions of secure custody and care, is a decisive factor in this context; this will depend in large measure on staff possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills. Further, management must be prepared fully to support staff in the exercise of their authority. Specific security measures adapted to the particular characteristics of the situation encountered (including effective search procedures) may well be required; however, such measures can never be more than an adjunct to the above-mentioned basic imperatives.

Indeed, the vulnerability of individuals in circumstances comparable to those of the applicant in the prison environment is specifically acknowledged by the special protective measures envisaged by section\u00a011\u00a0(5) of the Law on the Detention Procedure (see paragraph\u00a026 above), although it was not directly applicable to the applicant\u2019s situation. In its case-law, the Court has consistently held that the obligation on the High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken together with Article 3, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see Kova\u013ckovs v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a035021/05, \u00a7\u00a047, 31\u00a0January 2012). These measures should provide effective protection, in particular, of vulnerable persons, and include reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (see \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 v. , no. 52442/09, \u00a7\u00a0102, 19 July 2011, with further references).",

Initially, the Court held that \u201cthe mere feeling of stress of a detained person\u201d (I.T. v. Romania (dec.), no.\u00a040155/02, 24\u00a0November 2005) and \u201cthe mere fear of reprisals from the [applicant\u2019s] cell-mates\u201d (Golubev v.  (dec.), no.\u00a026260/02, 9\u00a0November\u00a02006) were not, by themselves, sufficient to bring the situation within the scope of Article\u00a03. Soon afterwards, the Court found that \u201cthe cumulative effect of overcrowding and the intentional placement of a person in a cell with persons who may present a danger to him may in principle raise an issue under Article\u00a03 of the Convention\u201d (Gorea v. Moldova no. 21984/05, \u00a7 47, 17 July 2007). In two more recent cases (Rodi\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina, no.\u00a022893/05, 27 May 2008, and Alexandru Marius Radu v. Romania, no.\u00a034022/05, 21 July 2009) the Court has gone one step further and held that \u201cthe hardship the applicants endured, in particular the constant mental anxiety caused by the threat of physical violence and the anticipation of such ..., must have exceeded the unavoidable level inherent in detention\u201d. Therefore, a breach of Article 3 of the Convention was found.",

The Court notes that the applicant initially shared a cell with another prisoner in a situation similar to hers. Subsequently, she explicitly consented in writing to being moved to another cell that she had to share with other convicts. The Court does not share the applicant\u2019s opinion that the use of a pre-typed form automatically gives rise to a presumption that the person signing such a form has been tricked or forced to do so (see paragraph 34 above). In the absence of any other indications whatsoever that the applicant was forced to record her consent to her transfer to a larger cell, the Court finds that her transfer was voluntary.",

The expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d not only necessitates compliance with domestic law, but also relates to the quality of that law (Niedba\u0142a v. , no. 27915/95, \u00a7\u00a079, 4 July 2000, and Gradek v.\u00a0Poland, no. 39631/06, \u00a7 42, 8 June 2010).
