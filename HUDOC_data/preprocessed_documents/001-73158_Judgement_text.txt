The case originated in an application (no. 28137/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Şahin Çağdaş1 (“the applicant”), on 25 March 2002.

The applicant alleged that his detention for two months and twenty three-days contravened Article 5 §§ 1 and 5 of the Convention. He complained under Article 6 of the Convention that the written opinions which the Principal Public Prosecutors submitted to the  and to the Court of Cassation on the merits of his claim and appeal, respectively, had never been served on him, thus depriving him of the opportunity to put forward his counter-arguments.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 15 March 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. In a letter of 18 March 2005, the Court informed the parties that, in accordance with Article 29 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention, it would decide on both the admissibility and merits of the application.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

On 2 November 2000 the Izmir State Security Court discontinued the prosecution against the applicant, holding that the five year statutory time-limit laid down in Articles 102 § 4 and 104 § 2 of the Criminal Code had expired. The court noted that the offence in question had allegedly been committed in March 1995, whereas the indictment had been filed on 23 May 2000, i.e. more than five years after the commission of the alleged offence. It further found that the applicant had not been involved in any illegal activity during this time.
On 16 March 2001 the applicant filed a complaint under Law no. 466 with the  (Ağır Ceza Mahkemesi) against the Treasury, requesting 10,500,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) by way of compensation for his detention between 10 May and 3 August 2000.

On 28 March 2001 the  dismissed the applicant's claim for compensation, considering that he was not entitled to compensation under Law no. 466. The court held that section 1 of Law no. 466 provided an exhaustive list of situations for an award of compensation and that the applicant's circumstances did not fall within any of these categories.
On 1 October 2001 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation.
