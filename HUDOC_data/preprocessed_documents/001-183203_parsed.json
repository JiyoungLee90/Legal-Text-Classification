Importantly, the applicant had contributed to the length of the investigation by refusing to submit the requested X-rays to the police for verification by the medical commission (see paragraph 19 above). Since in the meantime the quality of those X-rays had deteriorated, it had been necessary to undertake a fresh X-ray examination, which had taken up further time. After 7 April 2009, when he had been re-examined, the applicant had lost interest in the case and had failed to appear before the investigator, despite having been invited by telephone to appear and despite a summons having been sent to him.

Moreover, as found by the investigating judge (see paragraph 23 above), the investigator failed to inform him of his right to submit the X-rays directly to the Centre so as to avoid giving them to the police or the prosecutor.

The Court notes that the reasons given for the final decision of the prosecutor to discontinue the investigation (see paragraph 27 above) and the reasons for which the investigating judge confirmed that decision (see paragraph 28 above) were in both cases essentially the same as those for which all previous similar decisions had been adopted (see paragraphs 21, 23 and 24 above). The only new element relied on was the medical expert\u2019s opinion given in the report of 9 December 2009 that the injury was situated in a part of the body accessible to the applicant, a fact which did not exclude the possibility of self-mutilation.",

The fact that after an initial decision not to open an investigation (see paragraph 15 above) it was discontinued three times before the final decision on the matter was taken (see paragraphs 21, 23 and\u00a024 above) raises questions as to the effectiveness of that investigation. Moreover, the reasons for the annulment of the decisions to discontinue the investigation reveal serious shortcomings, such as a failure to question important witnesses (notably doctors who had seen the applicant after the incident of 27 December 2006) or to properly involve the applicant in the investigation by informing him of his right to pose questions to the medical experts (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). A prosecutor even found the investigation to have been \u201cextremely superficial\u201d and \u201ctendentious [and] unilateral\u201d (see paragraph 23 above). Moreover, the prosecutor appears to have engaged in the same shortcomings, prompting first a judge and then a higher-ranked prosecutor to annul his decisions essentially for the same reasons (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the repeated failure to take specific steps which the domestic authorities themselves considered essential for a proper investigation raises additional questions concerning the quality of the investigation.",
