She continued walking. She was stopped by police officers, who asked her to show them what was in her bag. She refused and they took the poster out. There was a slogan on it (see paragraph 4 above). They then asked her to leave the square and proceed to a bus. She refused and they told her to get into a police car. She refused and sat down on the tarmac. Three unidentified police officers lifted her and carried her to the car. She tried to resist by putting her feet on the car door sill. The police officers, however, placed her in the car and took her to the bus. She was apprehended by the police officers at around 11.45 a.m., and remained in the bus until 3 p.m. Those placed in the bus were not allowed to leave. The applicant was then taken in the bus to the Avtozavodskiy district police station. She stayed there from 4 p.m. until 4.57 p.m., when she was taken away in an ambulance following a hypertensive crisis.

In respect of a person who is deprived of his or her liberty, or, more generally, is confronted with lawenforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Bouyid v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7\u00a7 100 and 101, 28\u00a0September 2015).

Even in the absence of actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering, where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for or diminishing his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual\u2019s moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition set forth in Article 3. It should also be pointed out that it may well suffice that the victim is humiliated in his or her own eyes, even if not in the eyes of others. Indeed, it has previously been established that, although a person does not undergo serious physical or mental suffering, an assault on his or her dignity and physical integrity may constitute degrading treatment (see Bouyid [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 88, 90 and 112).",

The Court has held, however, that the mere carrying out of a preinvestigation inquiry, not followed by an investigation proper, in which the whole range of investigative measures may be carried out, including the questioning of witnesses, confrontations and identification parades, is insufficient for the authorities to comply with the requirements of an effective investigation into credible allegations of ill\u2011treatment by the police under Article 3 of the Convention (see Lyapin v. Russia, no. 46956/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0132-137, 24 July 2014, and, more recently, Samesov v. Russia, no.\u00a057269/14, \u00a7\u00a051, 20 November 2018). The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The authorities responded to the applicant\u2019s promptly lodged (see paragraphs 25 and 35 above) credible allegations of treatment proscribed by Article 3 by carrying out a preinvestigation inquiry and refused twice to institute criminal proceedings and carry out a fullyfledged investigation. As a result, police officer V.S., for example, gave divergent \u201cexplanations\u201d (see paragraphs 29 and 36 above), which did not commit him in the same way as being examined as a witness in the context of criminal proceedings and did not entail the necessary safeguards inherent in an effective criminal investigation, such as criminal liability for perjury. No confrontation was ever held between the applicant and V.S. Police officer A.F. was never questioned (see paragraphs\u00a028-29 above). There is nothing in the case-file to indicate that efforts were made to establish the specific roles of police officers V.S. and A.F. in the incident, as well as the identity of other police officers involved, despite the video recording of the incident by the police.",
