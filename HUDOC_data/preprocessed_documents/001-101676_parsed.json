The applicant was not represented by a lawyer and failed to specify the exact period of such detention and/or its classification under Article 5 of the Convention. The Court considered it as falling under Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 of the Convention \u2013 purpose and lawfulness of deprivation of liberty under the national law \u2013 and limited its consideration of the length of detention in the absence of a court order to the period which ended on 25\u00a0January 2002 with the order of the Town Court. In my view the question whether the applicant substantiated the exact hour (before or after 3 p.m. on 25 January 2002) when the first order was issued appears irrelevant for the actual period of detention without a court's order, since on this date the Town Court did not adopt any such decision.",
