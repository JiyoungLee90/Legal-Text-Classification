Indeed, the Court has previously considered that notification, and even authorisation procedures, for a public event do not normally encroach upon the essence of the right under Article 11 of the Convention as long as the purpose of the procedure is to allow the authorities to take reasonable and appropriate measures in order to guarantee the smooth conduct of any assembly, meeting or other gathering. However, regulations of this nature should not represent a hidden obstacle to freedom of peaceful assembly as protected by the Convention (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 147 et seq.).",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that a demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life (see Nurettin Aldemir and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 32124/02, 32126/02, 32129/02, 32132/02, 32133/02, 32137/02 and 32138/02, \u00a7 43, 18\u00a0December 2007; Budah\u00e1zy v.

It notes in particular that the applicant planned to organise a demonstration with an anticipated 200 participants. Even assuming that the eventual number of those present would have exceeded the volume initially envisaged, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s explanation to the effect that Venyige Street, a road of five or eight metres in width, with a broad service lane adjacent, could not have helped to accommodate the demonstration without serious traffic disruption. Indeed, their arguments appear not to take into account that the street is a dead end; and the through traffic is thus of limited importance. For the Court, however, this fact cannot be overlooked. Moreover, the Government\u2019s contention that the situation could have developed into blocking the major thoroughfare nearby is largely a matter of speculation.",

Hungary, no. 5529/05, \u00a7 42, 7 October\u00a02008).",
