At the same time, the Court ordered the applicant's counsel to file a pleading no later than 21\u00a0October 1998, stating the applicant's amended claim and providing an account of her income situation and medicine expenses. During the hearing the parties also discussed whether to hold a separate hearing of parts of the case and adjourn other parts while awaiting a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice in another case before the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret). Thus, the City Court ordered that counsel for the applicant in his pleading specify which parts of the case he wanted to be heard and adjudicated separately, and which parts he wished adjourned awaiting the European Court of Justice. The City Court indicated that when the applicant's pleading had been filed, it would impose a fairly short time-limit on the counsel for the  to reply. Moreover, the City Court suggested that the parties expedite the proceedings as much as possible and indicated that the court expected the pre-trial procedures to be complete by the end of 1998. Finally, the case was set down for trial on 22\u00a0and 23 February 1999.",

As the applicant's previous request that the National Board of Industrial Injuries determine her degree of disablement and loss of working capacity had presumed liability for her reduced ability to open her mouth the City Court found that it was necessary to require supplementary information from the National Board of Industrial Injuries in order to obtain an assessment of the applicant's degree of disablement and loss of working capacity in which her reduced ability to open her mouth was disregarded.",
