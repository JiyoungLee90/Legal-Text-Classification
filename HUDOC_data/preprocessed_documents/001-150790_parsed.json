It notes with satisfaction that the domestic civil court duly examined the applicant\u2019s case, established the State\u2019s liability for his ill-treatment and awarded him compensation. However, in cases of wilful ill-treatment by State agents in breach of Article\u00a03, the Court has repeatedly found that two measures are necessary to provide sufficient redress. Firstly, the State authorities must have conducted a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Secondly, an award of compensation to the applicant is required where appropriate or, at least, the possibility of seeking and obtaining compensation for the damage which the applicant sustained as a result of the ill-treatment (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2010). In cases of wilful ill-treatment by State agents, a breach of Article 3 cannot be remedied only by an award of compensation to the victim because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful ill-treatment by State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no. 41461/02, \u00a7 78, 24\u00a0July 2008, and G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 119).",

To have subjected the applicant to electric shocks, tied him up and hung him in painful positions required a certain preparation and knowledge on the part of the police officers and the use of special devices. The applicant endured the sequence of these abhorrent acts of physical and psychological violence during a prolonged period of time, between being taken to the police station sometime in the afternoon of 26\u00a0April 2009 and the following morning, that is, for at least twelve hours. The illtreatment left the applicant with numerous bruises on his body and a broken rib (see paragraphs 14-17 above). The police officers acted intentionally with the aim of making him confess to the murder of D. The applicant \u2013 who was unlawfully deprived of his liberty and denied all the rights of a person detained on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence (see paragraph 37 above), including access to a lawyer and an interpreter, notification of his detention to a third party or access to a doctor\u00a0\u2013 was entirely vulnerable vis\u00e0vis the police officers.

It held that the mere fact of the investigative authority\u2019s refusal to open a criminal investigation into credible allegations of serious illtreatment in police custody was indicative of the State\u2019s failure to comply with its obligation under Article 3 to carry out an effective investigation (see Lyapin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a046956/09, \u00a7\u00a7 128-40, 24 July 2014).",

On the facts, the Court notes that the data which the investigative committee assessed as sufficient for opening a criminal case on 8 October 2009 were in the committee\u2019s hands shortly after the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment (see paragraph 21-22 above). Hence, nothing can explain the five months\u2019 delay in commencing the criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaint. The Court considers that such a delay could not but have had a significant adverse impact on the investigation, considerably undermining the investigative authority\u2019s ability to secure the evidence concerning the alleged illtreatment (see Indelicato v. Italy, no. 31143/96, \u00a7 37, 18\u00a0October 2001; Kopylov v. Russia, no. 3933/04, \u00a7 137, 29 July 2010; Eldar Imanov and Azhdar Imanov v.

In particular, the significant lapse of time must have diminished the applicant\u2019s ability to identify the alleged perpetrators or made the possibility of identification unrealistic (see paragraph 30 above). The Court notes that the judicial remedy under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was inaccessible to the applicant for his complaints against the investigative committee\u2019s refusal to open a criminal case. The investigative committee repeatedly revoked its decisions before the court hearings had taken place, only to issue new such decisions thereafter (see paragraphs 24-25 above).",

As regards individual liability, the investigative committee considered that evidence insufficient for the prosecution of the two police officers identified by the applicant and suspended the investigation for failure to establish the identity of the alleged perpetrators. It appears that in doing so the investigative committee had unreservedly relied on the statements of the police officers who had denied their involvement in the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment (see paragraph 30 above).

The Court will therefore examine whether, for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention, the applicant can still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged violation of his rights secured by Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In this connection, it reiterates that an applicant is deprived of his or her status as a victim if the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for, a breach of the Convention (see, for example, Sergey Vasilyev v. Russia, no. 33023/07, \u00a7 45, 17\u00a0October 2013).",

On 22 March 2012 the Voronezh Regional Court upheld the Leninskiy District Court\u2019s judgment following the examination of the appeals lodged by the respondent authorities. No appeal was lodged against the District Court\u2019s judgment by the applicant (see paragraph 39 above). It can therefore be presumed that he was satisfied with the amount of compensation awarded by the District Court. In these circumstances, there are no grounds for the Court to verify whether the sum awarded was reasonable in comparison with awards made by the Court in similar cases (see Kopylov, cited above, \u00a7 144). It considers that the compensation in the circumstances of the present case amounted to appropriate and sufficient redress for the alleged violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01.",
