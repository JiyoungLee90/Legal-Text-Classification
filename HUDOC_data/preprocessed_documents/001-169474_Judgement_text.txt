The case originated in an application (no. 17614/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Ivan Nikolayevich Nazarov (“the applicant”), on 18 February 2008.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights
On 5 November 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1976 and, prior to his arrest, lived in Oblivskaya, Rostov Region.
On 22 October 2007 the applicant, a police officer at the time, was arrested on suspicion of drug dealing.
On 24 October 2007 the Leninskiy District Court of Rostov-on-Don authorised the applicant’s remand in custody. He remained in custody pending investigation and trial. Referring to the seriousness of the charges and the applicant being a police officer, the courts extended his pre-trial detention on the grounds that he might abscond, or interfere with the administration of justice, or put pressure on witnesses and other defendants.
The applicant lodged appeals against the detention orders. On 4 January and 22 February 2008 the Regional Court upheld the decisions of 29 December 2007 and 6 February 2008 in the applicant’s absence. The applicant and his lawyer were informed about the hearings but the applicant was not granted leave to attend. The applicant’s lawyer attended the hearing on 22 February 2008. The prosecutor was present and made submissions to the court.
On 17 December 2008 the District Court found the applicant guilty of several counts of illegal drug dealing and sentenced him to fourteen years’ imprisonment.
On 10 June 2009 the Regional Court quashed the judgment of 17 December 2008 on appeal and remitted the matter to the trial court for fresh consideration. The court ordered that the applicant remain in custody.
On 15 July 2009 the District Court scheduled a preliminary hearing of the case and ordered that the applicant remain in detention. On 18 November 2009, 29 January and 29 April 2010 the District Court adjourned the hearing of the case. It further extended the applicant’s detention on the ground that he was charged with grievous criminal offences and might abscond.
.  On 6 May 2011 the applicant was found guilty.
