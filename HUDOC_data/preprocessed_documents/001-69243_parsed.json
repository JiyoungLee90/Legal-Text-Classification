Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made \u2013 at least in substance \u2013 to the appropriate domestic bodies, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law. However, the only remedies which Article\u00a035 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied. Moreover, the application of this rule must make due allowance for the context. Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case (Henaf v.

In this respect the Court observes that the  had examined the constitutionality of Article\u00a0209 of the Criminal Code in a judgment of 3 October 1989 and had found that this provision was in conformity with the Austrian Constitution. Subsequently, on 29 November 2001, the Constitutional Court dismissed a request by the Innsbruck Court of Appeal for a fresh review of the constitutionality of Article 209 of the Criminal Code finding that the issue was res judicata (see as to the development of the Constitutional Court's case-law L. and V. v. Austria, nos. 39398/98 and 39829/98, 9\u00a0January\u00a02003, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a023-28). It was only a few days later, on 3 December 2001, that the applicant was convicted of the offence under Article 209 of the Criminal Code.

The Court would in such circumstances take that fact into account and follow the award made in the leading case. The Court is free to adjust the amount it awards following the particular circumstances of a case. Still, if deciding to award an excessive sum when deciding on non-pecuniary damage given in equity it should explain the reasons which prompted it to depart from its own established case-law.
