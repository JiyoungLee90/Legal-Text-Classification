The applicant\u2019s lawyer had agreed to the reading out of the victims\u2019 statements in the course of the retrial (see paragraph\u00a018 above). Thus the applicant can be regarded as having waived his right to examine those witnesses in the course of the retrial. Admissibility and assessment of evidence were primarily matters for regulation by domestic law and domestic courts. There was no evidence that the applicant had been entrapped into committing the offence (citing Gorgievski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a018002/02, \u00a7\u00a053, 16 July 2009).",

The Court has already been confronted with a similar situation in Palchik v.\u00a0Ukraine (no. 16980/06, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15, 17, 36 and 39, 2 March 2017). In that case the defence initially had not objected to some witness statements being read out but then, once they had been read out, insisted that the witnesses in question be called because they believed that, following the reading-out of those statements and examination of other evidence, inconsistencies in the statements had been revealed. The witnesses were not called. The Court found that there had been no waiver in respect of those witnesses. The situation is entirely similar in the present case (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above) and the Court, likewise, does not consider that the applicant waived his right to examine the victims (contrast Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], no. 36658/05, \u00a7\u00a7; 122-27, 18\u00a0December 2018).",

Following exclusion of the video evidence from the file, there was no direct evidence, other than those witnesses\u2019 evidence, which would show that the applicant had solicited and received money for a bribe and not, as he claimed, for legal fees.
