As regards the lawfulness, the Government argued that the decision of 11 September 1997 had been given in accordance with the Development Land Act 1986.

However, the Court\u2019s case-law is not always consistent on this point. In some cases concerning a State\u2019s failure to comply with a final and binding domestic decision concerning property rights, the Court has assessed the State\u2019s inaction as an interference with the applicant\u2019s property under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see, for example, Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 55, ECHR 1999II; Antonetto v.\u00a0Italy, no. 15918/89, \u00a7 34, 20 July 2000; Frascino v. Italy, no. 35227/97, \u00a7\u00a032, 11 December 2003; and Paudicio v.

However, as the Court has stated in many cases, the principles to be applied are the same (see, for example, Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7\u00a0144, ECHR 2004V) and, therefore, had the Court decided to assess the case as a question of interference or negative obligations, the reasoning might have been different but the outcome of the case would have been the same.",
