Although the domestic courts had found that the applicant had not been detained in her workplace and that the officers had merely asked her to accompany them for a simple conversation, the assessment of the officers\u2019 actions did not correspond to the reality and should be viewed critically. As determined by the Ombudsman, the actions of the SBGS officers could not be regarded as an invitation for an interview because they did not comply with Article 182 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. That provision indeed provided that a person could be summoned orally. However, it did not restrict his or her decision whether to attend; the legal consequences of such measures were listed in Article 182 \u00a7 1. In the instant case it was clear that the applicant had not had any freedom of choice or the right to refuse the SBGS officers\u2019 order. Moreover, she had been obliged to accompany them in their car, without the opportunity to use a mobile telephone or contact a lawyer.

Above all, the Court notes the appellate court\u2019s conclusion to the effect that the applicant\u2019s failure to appeal against the prosecutor\u2019s decision did not bar her from lodging a civil complaint so that the alleged misconduct of the investigating officers could be assessed in the framework of civil litigation (see paragraph 36 above). In this context the Court also lends considerable weight to the case-law of the Lithuanian Supreme Court, which held that the decisions of investigating officers in criminal proceedings, unlike those of a court, were not binding upon the courts of civil jurisdiction adjudicating a claim for damages (see paragraph 51 above). Lastly, given that in her application to the Court the applicant argued, inter alia, that her reputation had been tarnished by her arrest at her workplace, and complained under Article 5 \u00a7 5 that she had not received pecuniary compensation for her suffering, the Court sees no ground to hold that, in the light of the facts pertinent to the present case, there was a particular reason for the applicant to pursue, till the end, a criminal law remedy in addition to a civil law one, the effectiveness of which, all the more so, has not been disputed by the Government (see paragraph 84 below).",

In this context the Court notes that during the civil proceedings the applicant\u2019s colleagues at the \u201cFortas\u201d restaurant testified that \u201cthe applicant was arrested\u201d, \u201cthe applicant was taken away quickly\u201d, the officers \u201cshowed identification of some kind\u201d and \u201cdemanded that the applicant went with them\u201d, and \u201cthe officers took the applicant with them\u201d. Even though in their decisions the civil courts did not mention that evidence, the Court finds that it gives certain credibility to the applicant\u2019s argument that there was an element of coercion which affected the applicant\u2019s liberty and that she was arrested already at her workplace. Furthermore, the fact remains that from the moment the applicant was taken to the SBGS\u2019s premises, the investigators questioned her about the insurance fraud. This element was acknowledged by the Head of the SBGS Vilnius Office (see paragraph 22 above). It has not been contended by the Government, and it would be unrealistic to assume, that during that period of her questioning and until her \u201cofficial\u201d arrest at 3 p.m. the applicant was free to leave the SBGS\u2019s Vilnius headquarters at will, particularly bearing in mind that the Service officers apparently believed that she had been G.B.\u2019s accomplice and were carrying out investigative measures in the criminal proceedings that had been instituted against her two days before her questioning (see Osypenko, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

In proclaiming the \u201cright to liberty\u201d, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person; its aim is to ensure that no one is deprived of that liberty in an arbitrary fashion. The Court also points out that paragraph 1 of Article\u00a05 makes it clear that the guarantees it contains apply to \u201ceveryone\u201d. Subparagraphs\u00a0(a) to (f) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds on which persons may be deprived of their liberty, and no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds. Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is at issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law.

The Court has already found that during the time at issue the applicant was questioned by the investigators, yet no record of her questioning was drawn up. Accordingly, the applicant did not have her rights explained to her, in accordance with Articles 183 and 187 of the CCP (paragraph 47 above), either as a witness or as a suspect. In this context the Court notes that a record of the applicant\u2019s questioning as a suspect was not drawn up until the following day at 4.15 p.m. (see paragraph 14 above). The Court finds this particularly troubling, given that the investigating officers appear to have relied on tactics where someone was first brought to their premises to testify as a witness or even in an unspecified capacity, while in reality they considered that person to be a suspect. Such approach may deprive the alleged suspect of the procedural guarantees that follow from the requirements of fair trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Salduz v.

The absence of a record of such details as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Fedotov v. Russia, no. 5140/02, \u00a7 78, 25 October 2005; Menesheva v. Russia, no. 59261/00, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2006III; and Belousov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 1748/02, \u00a7 72, 2 October 2008). In the instant case the Court has already concluded that as of 10.30 a.m. on 25 May 2005 the applicant was under the control of the Service officers. Whilst acknowledging that the record of her provisional arrest was drawn up some four hours later, the Court nonetheless observes that that document indicated the applicant\u2019s arrest time as 3 p.m. The lack of a proper record of the applicant\u2019s arrest is therefore sufficient for the Court to hold that her confinement for that time was in breach of Article 179 of the CCP (paragraph 45 above), which provides that each investigative action must be documented, and contrary to the requirements implicit in Article 5 of the Convention for the proper recording of deprivations of liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Anguelova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038361/97, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2002-IV; Menesheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a087-89; and Belousov, cited above, \u00a7 73). Given the SBGS officers\u2019 intentional omission to apply the relevant legislation correctly, the Court also finds that the applicant\u2019s detention until 3 p.m. was \u201carbitrary\u201d (see Mooren, cited above, \u00a7 78).",

As the Supreme Court held in case no.\u00a03K7183/2006, a court of civil jurisdiction could apply that legal provision irrespective of whether the procedural actions which had allegedly caused damage to the plaintiff had been challenged in criminal proceedings. Furthermore, even if in criminal proceedings it had been established that the actions of the pre-trial investigators were lawful, a civil court was free to find that those actions had caused damage to the claimant if all the circumstances examined in the civil proceedings so proved (see paragraph\u00a050 above). Likewise, the Court draws attention to ruling no.\u00a03K3-506 by the Lithuanian Supreme Court, in which it held that the decisions of the investigative officers and prosecutors did not have a prejudicial value when assessing whether particular actions by the investigating authorities had been lawful (see paragraph 51 above). The Court notes that in the instant case the applicant\u2019s civil claim for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages was dismissed as unfounded. Yet the Court is reluctant to find that this fact, in itself, is sufficiently conclusive to hold that no legal procedure was envisaged for bringing proceedings in order to seek compensation for the deprivation of liberty found by the Strasbourg Court to be in breach of one of the other paragraphs of Article 5 (see, for the opposite conclusion, Klishyn v. , no. 30671/04, \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 98, 23\u00a0February\u00a02012).",
