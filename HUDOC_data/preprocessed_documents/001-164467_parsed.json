The foregoing ruling also meant that courts should likewise admit for consideration complaints about other procedural actions, decisions or inaction on the part of investigative authorities, which could result in irreparable or grave damage to an individual\u2019s constitutional rights if their judicial review were to be delayed. The Supreme Court further noted that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that the applicant had been substantially affected by the criminal proceedings at issue \u2013 in particular, with regard to the search of his premises and the seizure and retention of his belongings. It stated that the proceedings appeared to be protracted without any justification and instructed the lower courts to verify whether the conduct of the investigative authorities could indicate ulterior motives aimed at concealing unlawful actions on their part.",

If no remedies are available or if those available are judged to be ineffective, the six-month period in principle runs from the date of the act complained of (see, among other authorities, Vladimir Polishchuk and Svetlana Polishchuk v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a012451/04, \u00a7\u00a038, 30\u00a0September\u00a02010).

In this connection, the Court reiterates that in order to comply with Article\u00a08\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02, the interference must, among other things, be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d; that is, it should have some basis in domestic law and be compatible with the rule of law (see, among other authorities, Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a030562/04 and\u00a030566/04, \u00a7\u00a095, ECHR 2008, and Belousov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104). In matters affecting fundamental rights, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see, among other authorities, Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a04158/05, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR\u00a02010 (extracts), with further references). The existence of specific procedural safeguards is material in this context. What is required by way of safeguard will depend, to some extent at least, on the nature and extent of the interference in question (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a044787/98, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR\u00a02001-IX). In various contexts of Article\u00a08 of the Convention, the Court has emphasised that measures affecting human rights must be subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review in a timely fashion the reasons for the decision and the relevant evidence (see, as a recent authority, Kotiy v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a028718/09, \u00a7\u00a068, 5\u00a0March 2015).",

The only relevant document obtained by the applicant from the police in justification of the visit \u2013 the \u201cdeed of inspection and seizure\u201d \u2014 did not refer to any legal provisions serving as a basis for the visit and determining the scope of the powers of the officers involved (see paragraph\u00a08 above). The applicant\u2019s efforts to obtain subsequent judicial review of the lawfulness of the measure were unsuccessful. In particular, as follows from the judgment of 24\u00a0December 2004 taken by the Court of Appeal, the relevant complaint could only be brought within the framework of the criminal trial of the case initiated by the police following the disputed visit, in the event that the investigative authority ever brought the case to that stage. In the meantime, by the time the applicant lodged the present application, the relevant criminal proceedings had remained stagnant for several years, and the applicant had not been able to obtain any procedural status in these proceedings, in spite of his numerous efforts. The Court notes that in its recent judgment in the case of Kotiy (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-70) it has already found that a situation where the only possibility for the applicant to challenge the investigator\u2019s conduct had been under Article\u00a0234 of the CCP (after the criminal case against him had been committed for trial) was incompatible with Article\u00a08.",

At the same time, there must also be a reasonable relation of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measures applied by the State, including those designed to control the use of the individual\u2019s property. That requirement is expressed by the notion of a \u201cfair balance\u201d that must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights (see, for example, Edwards v.

However, by the time the application was lodged in January 2006, no formal charges had been pressed against him after the proceedings had been formally pending for a period exceeding four years. Furthermore, by that time the authorities had explicitly stated on a number of occasions that there were no sufficient grounds for suspecting the applicant of having committed any offence (see paragraphs\u00a019-21). As of March\u00a02006 no investigative measures concerning the applicant had been ordered (see paragraph\u00a022). In their subsequent correspondence, the parties never informed the Court of any further developments in those proceedings (see paragraph\u00a023 above).
