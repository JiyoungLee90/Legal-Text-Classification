Relying on its own settled case-law, the court observed that a waiver of the right to appeal could not be revoked, rescinded or withdrawn. The Court of Justice did not find it necessary to establish whether the waiver had been part of a negotiated agreement, as this fact did not call into question the validity of the waiver as such. The waiver had to be measured by different standards: notably, whether the accused had retained the freedom to either accept a judgment against him or lodge an appeal had to be verified. This freedom had to be preserved, even if the judgment had been based on an objectionable agreement and the waiver had constituted honouring such an agreement. Notwithstanding any procedural defect in the alleged agreement, the accused may have pursued his interests in an autonomous and appropriate way. The only decisive factor was whether the accused had been unduly influenced when waiving his right to appeal. In the present case, there was no indication that there had been such undue influence. The applicant\u2019s submissions neither disclosed an error or misunderstanding on the applicant\u2019s part, nor any deceit or false information given by the court, nor any impairment of the interests of the defence.",

Furthermore, the Federal Court of Justice had failed to consider the fact that his wife, who had not been involved in the trial, had also been asked to waive any rights she had to the confiscated assets. This procedural method had been arbitrary, had not been in accordance with the statutory provisions governing the confiscation of assets in criminal proceedings and had also constituted a violation of the right to an effective remedy. On 20 November 2003 the Federal Constitutional Court (file no.\u00a02\u00a0BvR 1339/01), relying on the relevant provisions of its rules of procedure, refused to admit the constitutional complaint for examination without giving further reasons.

It considered such agreements, in which the criminal courts make a binding declaration on the maximum penalty to be imposed in exchange for the defendant\u2019s confessing to (part of) the offences he has been charged with, to be compatible with the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Basic Law if certain conditions are met.",

The agreement is not allowed to concern the legal qualification of the acts the defendant has been charged with. The penalty proposed by the court still must reflect the defendant\u2019s guilt and the penalty which, according to the court, could be expected without a confession may not be disproportionately severe in order to subject the defendant to undue pressure to confess. The court is only allowed to agree a maximum penalty (as opposed to a specific penalty) and may only exceed that penalty if relevant factual or legal issues have been overlooked and if it has previously advised the defendant at a hearing of its intention to set a higher penalty.
