The court dismissed his allegations that he had been unable to repay the debt.

Moreover, the debt was of minor value.

It also found that there was no reason to suggest that the applicant\u2019s family would end up on the street, although their standard of living might worsen as a result of the sale of their house. Lastly, the court referred to Constitutional Court decisions nos.

The circumstances in which adjournment can be requested are further specified in section 71 and include a pending objection to an enforcement decision or proceedings aimed at establishing the impermissibility of the enforcement. They also include undefined particular circumstances justifying adjournment, but in such situation enforcement proceedings can be adjourned for a maximum of three months and only once. Under section 72 the proceedings can be adjourned also at the request of the creditor under certain conditions. Section 74 provides that if an adjournment is requested pending a decision on a remedy, it should last until such decision has been delivered. In other circumstances the court sets out the duration of the adjournment, depending on the circumstances. Thereafter, the proceedings continue automatically (section 75).

Up-35/98 and Up-77/04 of 2 April 1998 and 11\u00a0October 2006 respectively, the Constitutional Court examined constitutional complaints concerning an issue of a revocation of award decisions following the discontinuation of enforcement proceedings. Decision no.\u00a0Up-35/98 concerned a debtor\u2019s complaint against the Higher Court\u2019s decision to dismiss her appeal against the award decision. The complainant argued that the award decision should not have been upheld because the creditors had withdrawn their application for enforcement before the award decision had become final. The Constitutional Court explained that the award decision was one of the legal facts leading to the ownership of the immovable property bought at public auction. It held that an award decision must be followed by a decision transferring title, the transfer itself and the entry of ownership in the Land Register, which measure is of a declaratory nature. While the Constitutional Court found that the final decision transferring title represented acquisition of a property right, the award decision created a protected expectation on the part of the buyer to acquire such a right. Therefore, the acquisition of property could only be halted if it was found that the auction had been unlawful or if the buyer had failed to pay the purchase price. It could not be stopped by any other circumstances arising subsequently, such as the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings. Decision no. Up-77/04 concerned a complaint from an individual who had bought an immovable property at public auction, paid the purchase price and had already been issued with an award decision as well as transfer of title. After the withdrawal of the enforcement application, the local court revoked all the decisions issued in favour of the buyer. The Constitutional Court, referring to the Court\u2019s case-law concerning \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d, found that the award decision had given rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the buyer that once the award decision had become final, the only condition he had to meet was to pay the purchase price. The Constitutional Court concluded that the revocation of the enforcement decisions due to the payment of the debt after the award decision had become final had unjustifiably interfered with the complainant\u2019s legitimate expectation to acquire the property in question.",

The Court further observes that the applicant continued to remain passive after the enforcement court granted company J.\u2019s application for the judicial sale of his house and did not make use of the various procedural possibilities available to him with a view to avoiding the sale of his house, despite being served with all the relevant decisions and summoned to appear at the auctions (see, in particular, paragraphs 17, 22, 25,44, 48 and 49). Only after his house was sold did the applicant avail himself of the possibility of appealing, arguing that he had been having financial difficulties and that unless the sale was revoked, his family would risk becoming homeless (see paragraph 29 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the domestic court does not seem to have investigated those allegations in any detail (see paragraph 34 above).

Company J. initially attempted to enforce the debt through the sale of the applicant\u2019s movable property and when that proved unsuccessful, it directly requested that his house be sold at public auction (see paragraph 16 above). After company J. had applied for enforcement of the debt by sale of the house on 15 June 2010, the enforcement court granted the application within two days and, after a summons to attend the auction had been left in the applicant\u2019s mailbox on 20 September 2010, held the first auction on 7 October 2010. It sold the house for half its market value at the next auction, held on 18 November 2010 (see paragraphs 16 to 25 above). During that time the enforcement court did not consider any alternative measures to the judicial sale of the house, despite the fact that the applicant appeared to have been employed and to have had a monthly income, and that company P. in the meantime successfully enforced a much higher debt through the seizure of assets from his bank account (see paragraphs 19, 27 and 63 above).",

Nor does the legislation set any minimum threshold in respect of the amount of debt owed, so in principle even a minor debt could be enforced by means of the judicial sale of an immovable property, such as a house. This has been confirmed also by the data submitted by the Government, which show that in the period between 1\u00a0January 2008 and 1\u00a0March 2012, a decision transferring title of property was issued following the judicial sale of immovable property in thirty-two cases concerning debts lower than EUR 1,000 (see paragraph 56 above).

It further refers to its finding above that there was a clear indication that the measure in the form of seizure of assets from the applicant\u2019s bank account was available as a potentially suitable and effective measure for the enforcement of his debt (see paragraph 81 above), especially if applied with some flexibility, such as repayment over a reasonable period of time. What is more, almost a month before the second auction company J. requested that the enforcement be carried out by seizing the applicant\u2019s salary and bank account. However, although the requests were made on 18 and 25 October 2010 respectively, the court did not grant them until 22 November 2010, that is after the house had been sold at the second auction (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above).

It sees no reason to make a different assessment in the present case. It observes that the applicant\u2019s property was inspected by a property valuer before the sale, at which point its market value was set at EUR 140,000 (see paragraph 14 above). The Government provided no arguments calling into question the accuracy of that evaluation.

The Court further considers that interest should be added to the above award in order to compensate for the loss of value of the award over time. The interest should reflect national economic conditions, such as levels of inflation and rates of interest (see Ghigo v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 31122/05, \u00a7 20, 17 July 2008).
