In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001). Having regard to the above, the Court cannot accept the position adopted by the judicial authorities in the present case, namely that the presumption referred to above would alone, after a certain lapse of time, justify the applicant's continued detention, without the need to indicate any concrete facts supporting the risk of obstruction of the proceedings (see Szyd\u0142owski v. Poland, no. 1326/04, \u00a7 55; Malikowski v. Poland, no. 15154/03, \u00a7 54 and Osi\u0144ski v. , no. 13732/02, \u00a7 53, all judgments delivered on 16\u00a0October 2007).",

In this regard, the Court reiterates that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (see, G\u00f3rski v. , no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4\u00a0October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see, Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-defendants, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant's detention during the period necessary to terminate the investigation, to draw up the bill of indictment and to hear evidence from the accused. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high. In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant and his co-defendants by their obstructive behaviour, tried to delay the trial (see paragraphs 13, 15 and 19 above).",

In this regard, the Court observes that the proceedings were of considerable complexity, regard being had to the number of defendants, the extensive evidentiary proceedings and the implementation of special measures required in cases concerning organised crime. Nevertheless, hearings in the applicant's case were held regularly and at fairly short intervals. Furthermore, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the obstructiveness on the part of the defendants, including the applicant (see paragraphs 13, 15 and 19 above) had a negative impact on the progress of the trial. For these reasons, the Court considers that the domestic authorities handled the applicant's case with relative expedition.",
