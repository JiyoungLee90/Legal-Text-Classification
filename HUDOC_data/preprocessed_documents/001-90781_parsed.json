Like the court in Sellick [see relevant domestic law below] we do not consider that the case law of the European Court of Human Rights requires the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair. The provision in Article 6(3)(d) that a person charged shall be able to [have] the witnesses against him examined is one specific aspect of a fair trial: but if the opportunity is not provided, the question is 'whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way the evidence was taken, were fair' \u2013 Doorson, paragraph 19. This was not a case where the witness had absented himself, whether through fear or otherwise, or had required anonymity, or had exercised a right to keep silent. The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.\u201d",

I am satisfied that there would be an unfairness caused by its exclusion; but I am equally satisfied that no unfairness would be caused by its admission. And in doing so, I have taken into account the words of the statute [Section 116 (2)(e) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, see relevant domestic law below]; in particular how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence. Challenge of a statement does not always come from cross-examination. Challenge of a statement can be caused by evidence given in rebuttal; by either the defendant, if he chooses to do so, or by any other bystander \u2013 and we know that there were some \u2013 who were on the street at that time. Consequently I am satisfied that the defendant's evidence, if he chooses to give it, would be sufficient to rebut and to challenge the evidence that is contained in that statement. I have further considered other relevant factors, and I have also offered to the witness whilst he was in the witness box behind screens the possibility of him giving evidence with the same special measures in place. He told me his position would not change; that he could not give evidence before a jury, and the reason that he could not was because he was in fear.

It is right, as has been pointed out by the defence, that they were deprived of an opportunity to test that evidence under cross-examination. It is right also that you did not have the advantage of seeing the witness and his demeanour in Court...You must ask yourselves 'can we rely upon this statement? Is it a statement which we find convincing?' It is only if you are satisfied so that you are sure that what is in the statement has accurately depicted what happened that night and what the witness saw, that you could rely upon it. That goes for any witness. It is only if you find that the evidence is compelling and satisfies you so that you are sure that you act upon it. So you must always ask yourselves 'is the statement he made reliable?' You must bear in mind also, importantly, that it is agreed and acknowledged that it is not the defendant who is responsible for putting the witness in fear.\u201d",

The Court of Appeal acknowledged, however, that the Crown accepted that T.'s statement was \u201cboth important and probative of a major issue in the case...and had it not been admitted the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced.\u201d The court upheld the reasoning at first instance, stating that there was available not only cross-examination of other prosecution witnesses but also evidence from the applicant himself and the potential for evidence from other bystanders in order to prevent unfairness. It was also stated that the trial judge had explicitly warned the jury in detail as to how they should treat this evidence and properly directed them as to how they should consider it in reaching their verdict. Although the applicant maintained that even a proper direction by the judge could not cure the unfairness, the Court of Appeal held that the jury was informed of all matters necessary to its decision-making process. The applicant's sentence was reduced to seven years' imprisonment.",

Certainly at first sight paragraph 40 of Luca seems to suggest that in whatever circumstances and whatever counterbalancing factors are present if statements are read then there will be a breach of Article 6, if the statements are the sole or decisive evidence. Furthermore there is some support for that position in the previous authorities. But neither Luca nor any of the other authorities were concerned with a case where a witness, whose identity was well-known to a defendant, was being kept away by fear, although we must accept that the reference to Mafia-type organisations and the trials thereof in paragraph 40 shows that the court had extreme circumstances in mind.\u201d",

That test had been confirmed in Visser v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a026668/95, 14 February 2002; P.S. v. , no.\u00a033900/96, 20 December 2001, and Krasniki v. the , no.\u00a051277/99, 28 February 2006. Applying the Luc\u00e0 test to the facts of each of the present cases there were clear breaches of Article 6 since in each case there was one central witness and it was beyond dispute that this witness was at least decisive in each case. While an exception might apply to cases such as Sellick (see paragraph 25 above), where the defendant was responsible for the witnesses' non-attendance at trial, this was not the case for either of the present cases where the applicants were not responsible for the absence of the witnesses. In the present cases, the Court of Appeal had failed to apply fully this Court's ruling in Luc\u00e0. The procedural safeguards in the relevant legislation were capable of ensuring the right to a fair trial as long as their implementation gave due regard to the clear principles contained in Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) and Luc\u00e0.",

Neither applicant had been able to challenge the credibility of the relevant witness with respect to the truth of the central allegation each witness had made. No warning to the juries could compensate for the loss of opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses. In Tahery, the applicant could not have called other witnesses to the incident for the same reason that T. did not appear: the close knit nature of the Iranian community.",

The Government also noted that it was very difficult to say exactly when evidence is decisive, not least because in England and  juries did not give reasons for their verdicts. In respect of Mr Al-Khawaja, the Government noted that the impugned evidence was crucial to the prosecution's case on count one. However, referring to the fact that there had also been a conviction on count two, they further noted that the Court of Appeal had commented that, overall, the evidence against the applicant was very strong. The Court of Appeal had ruled out the possibility of collusion between the complainants and the prosecution was able to rely on the similar evidence of other women.",

It could often be impossible to determine whether a conviction had in fact been based to a sole or decisive extent on such testimony. Such a rule could lead to the intimidation of witnesses or other anomalous results. The legislation in question provided sufficient procedural safeguards so as to prevent a violation of Article 6. Many of the cases against other Contracting States where the Court had found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 read with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) would not have arisen in England and  because witnesses had to be identified to the trial court. For example, the witness in Luc\u00e0 who chose to exercise his statutory right to remain silent and whose earlier statement was then adduced in evidence did not fall within one of categories of witness in English law whose statement could be read in evidence.",

The applicant was in a position to challenge or rebut the statement by giving evidence himself (if he chose to do so) and by calling other witnesses who were present at the scene of the incident (one of whom was the applicant's uncle). He had also warned the jury that it was necessary to approach the evidence given by the absent witness with care because the defendant had been deprived of an opportunity to test it and because they, the jury, had not had the advantage of seeing the witness and his demeanour in court.

Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) is an aspect of the right to fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1, which, in principle, requires that all evidence must be produced in the presence of the accused in a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument (Krasniki v. the , no.\u00a051277/99, \u00a7\u00a075, 28 February 2006). As with the other elements of Article 6 \u00a7 3, it is one of the minimum rights which must be accorded to anyone who is charged with a criminal offence. As minimum rights, the provisions of Article 6 \u00a7 3 constitute express guarantees and cannot be read, as it was by the Court of Appeal in Sellick (see paragraph 25 above), as illustrations of matters to be taken into account when considering whether a fair trial has been held (see Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. , 6 December 1988, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a067 and 68, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0146; Kostovski v. the Netherlands, 20 November 1989, \u00a7\u00a039, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0166). Equally, even where those minimum rights have been respected, the general right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that the Court ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair. Hence, in Unterpertinger v. Austria, 24 November 1986, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0110 the Court held that the reading out of statements of witnesses without the witness being heard in a public hearing could not be regarded as being inconsistent with Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d) of the Convention but it went on to emphasise that the use made of this in evidence had nevertheless to comply with the rights of the defence which it was the object and purpose of Article 6 to protect. This meant that, in principle, the accused had to be given a proper and adequate opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him either when the witness made the statement or at a later stage.",

In the Court's case-law, the question whether there has been compliance with Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d) has arisen primarily in two different contexts. The first concerns the case of so-called \u201canonymous witnesses\u201d, in which the identity of a witness is concealed in order, for instance, to protect him or her from intimidation or threats of reprisals or to preserve the anonymity of an undercover agent or informer (see, for example, Krasniki, cited above). The other concerns cases of \u201cabsent witnesses\u201d, where the identity of a witness may be disclosed but where use is made in evidence of the statement of the witness who does not appear before the court to give evidence in person because he or she has died, cannot be traced or refuses to appear out of fear or for some other reason (see, for example, Craxi v. Italy (no. 1), no. 34896/97, 5 December 2002; Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, 7 August 1996, Reports 1996III; Zentar v. , no.\u00a017902/02, 13 April 2006; and S.N., cited above).

The Court notes that in the present cases the Government, relying on the Court of Appeal's judgment in Sellick (see paragraph 25 above), argue that this Court's statement in Luc\u00e0 and in other similar cases is not to be read as laying down an absolute rule, prohibiting the use of statements if they are the sole or decisive evidence, whatever counterbalancing factors might be present. However, the Court observes that the Court of Appeal in Sellick was concerned with identified witnesses and the trial judge allowed their statements to be read to the jury because he was satisfied that they were being kept from giving evidence through fear induced by the defendants. That is not the case in either of the present applications and, in the absence of such special circumstances, the Court doubts whether any counterbalancing factors would be sufficient to justify the introduction in evidence of an untested statement which was the sole or decisive basis for the conviction of an applicant. While it is true that the Court has often examined whether the procedures followed in the domestic courts were such as to counterbalance the difficulties caused to the defence, this has been principally in cases of anonymous witnesses whose evidence has not been regarded as decisive and who have been subjected to an examination in some form or other. This occurred in Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports 1996II, where the applicant was convicted of drug trafficking on the basis of statements by anonymous witnesses and a witness who attended trial but then absconded. The anonymous witnesses were ultimately questioned at the appeal stage, in the presence of the applicant's lawyer, but not the applicant, and without the identity of the witnesses being revealed to applicant's lawyer. The Court found no violation. It was satisfied that no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 taken together with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention could be found if it was \u201cestablished that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities\u201d (\u00a7 72 of the judgment).

The Government further relied on the case of S.N., cited above, as confirming that there is no absolute rule prohibiting the use of untested statements. However, the Court does not consider that case to be of assistance to either of the present cases, confined as it was to its specific facts. It involved the suspected sexual abuse of a 10 year-old boy who was twice interviewed by the police, a video-recording being made of the first interview and an audio-recording of the second. The Court accepted that the boy's statements were virtually the only evidence on which the applicant's conviction was based. But, in finding that there had been no violation of Article 6, the Court placed reliance on a number of features of the case: in particular, the second interview had taken place at the request of the applicant's lawyer who consented to not being present and accepted the manner in which the interview was conducted; he did not request any postponement or ask for the interview to be recorded on video; and he was able to put any question to the boy through the police officer and had confirmed that the issues which he had wished to raise had been covered. The Court does not therefore regard the S.N. case as authority for any general proposition that untested statements can be admitted consistently with Article 6 when they are the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant.",

The Court notes in the present cases that both parties were content to approach the matter on the basis that each conviction was based solely or to a decisive degree on the two witnesses concerned. It further notes that the Government have sought to qualify their position somewhat. In Tahery they maintained that in the jury system it was impossible to determine what evidence had been decisive for a conviction and relied on the Court of Appeal's findings that there was no reason to doubt the safety of the conviction and that the other evidence in the case was compelling. In Al-Khawaja, they relied on the fact that the Court of Appeal had commented that, overall, the evidence against the applicant was very strong, that it had ruled out the possibility of collusion between the complainants and that it had found that the prosecution was able to rely on the similar evidence of other women. However, the Court cannot overlook the finding of the trial judge in Al-Khawaja that \u201cno statement, no count one\u201d. Nor can it overlook the finding of the Court of Appeal in Tahery that T.'s statement was \u201cboth important and probative of a major issue in the case. Had it not been admitted the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced.\u201d Having regard to each of these findings, the Court too will proceed on the basis that S.T.'s statement in Al-Khawaja and T.'s statement in Tahery were the sole or, at least, the decisive basis for each applicant's conviction.",

The Court finds these particular factors to be of limited weight since the very issue in each case is whether the trial judges and the Court of Appeal acted compatibly with Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention and correctly applied the relevant case-law of this Court.

Having considered these factors, the Court does not find that any of them, taken alone or together, could counterbalance the prejudice to the defence by admitting S.T.'s statement. It is correct that even without S.T.'s statement, the applicant may have had to give evidence as part of his defence to the other count, count two. But had S.T.'s statement not been admitted, it is likely that the applicant would only have been tried on count two and would only have had to give evidence in respect of that count. In respect of the inconsistencies between the statement of S.T. and her account as given to two witnesses, the Court finds these were minor in nature. Only one such inconsistency was ever relied on by the defence, namely the fact that at one point during the alleged assault, S.T. had claimed in her statement that the applicant had touched her face and mouth while in the account given to one of the witnesses she had said that she had touched her own face at the instigation of the applicant. While it was certainly open to the defence to attempt to challenge the credibility of S.T., it is difficult to see on what basis they could have done so, particularly as her account corresponded in large part with that of the other complainant, with whom the trial judge found that there was no evidence of collusion. The absence of collusion may be a factor in domestic law in favour of admissibility but in the present case it cannot be regarded as a counterbalancing factor for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 read with Article 6 \u00a7 3(d). The absence of collusion does not alter the Court's conclusion that the content of the statement, once admitted, was evidence on count one that the applicant could not effectively challenge. As to the judge's warning to the jury, this was found by the Court of Appeal to be deficient. Even if it were not so, the Court is not persuaded that any more appropriate direction could effectively counterbalance the effect of an untested statement which was the only evidence against the applicant.",

It is appropriate for domestic courts, when faced with the problem of absent or anonymous witnesses, to consider whether alternative measures could be employed which would be less restrictive of the rights of the defence than admitting witness statements as evidence. However, the fact that alternative measures are found to be inappropriate does not absolve domestic courts of their responsibility to ensure that there is no breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) when they then allow witness statements to be read. Indeed, the rejection of less restrictive measures implies a greater duty to ensure respect for the rights of the defence. As regards the ability of the applicant to contradict the statement by calling other witnesses, the very problem was that there was no witness, with the exception of T., who was apparently able or willing to say what he had seen. In these circumstances, the Court does not find that T.'s statement could have been effectively rebutted. The Court accepts that the applicant gave evidence himself denying the charge, though the decision to do so must have been affected by the admission of T.'s statement. The right of an accused to give evidence in his defence cannot be said to counterbalance the loss of opportunity to see and have examined and cross-examined the only prosecution eye-witness against him.",

The Court accepts that domestic case-law is of limited relevance to the question of non-pecuniary damage in proceedings before it (Gault v. the , no.\u00a01271/05, \u00a7\u00a030, 20\u00a0November 2007). However, the fact remains that the criminal proceedings against the applicants, at least in respect of those charges which were based on the statements of the absent witnesses, were not conducted in conformity with the Convention and the Court finds that the applicants inevitably have suffered a degree of distress and anxiety as a result. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards each of the applicants the sum of EUR 6,000 by way of compensation for non-pecuniary damage.",

According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. The Court agrees with the Government that the claim in respect of Mr Al-Khawaja's solicitor is not itemised and so it makes no award under this head. However, in respect of the remainder of the applicants' claims, the Court finds the amount claimed is not excessive in light of the complexity of the cases and the hearing held. It therefore considers that the remainder of the applicants' costs and expenses should be met in full. It therefore awards them EUR 14,198, inclusive of VAT, less EUR 2,300 already received in legal aid from the Council of Europe, to be converted into pounds sterling on the date of settlement.",
