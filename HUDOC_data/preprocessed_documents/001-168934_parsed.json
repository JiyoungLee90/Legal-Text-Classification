The access to review under section 50 was restricted by Act No. 473 of 1 July 1998 so that it is only possible to review an expulsion order of a judgment once. According to Report No. 1326/1997, the rationale of this restriction was to link the review time wise with the date of the alien\u2019s release for the purpose of expulsion so as to reduce the likelihood of material relevant changes in the alien\u2019s circumstances occurring during the period between the review and the enforcement of the expulsion.

The Convention does not guarantee the right of an alien to enter or to reside in a particular country and, in pursuance of their task of maintaining public order, Contracting States have the power to expel an alien convicted of criminal offences. However, an interference with a person\u2019s private or family life will be in breach of Article\u00a08 of the Convention unless it can be justified under paragraph 2 of that Article as being \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, as pursuing one or more of the legitimate aims listed therein, and as being \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in order to achieve the aim or aims concerned. The relevant criteria to be applied, in determining whether an interference is necessary in a democratic society, was set out, inter alia, in \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-55 and 57-58; Maslov v.\u00a0Austria [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a072-73; Balogun v. the , no. 60286/09, \u00a7 46, 10\u00a0April 2012; and Samsonnikov v.

For example, the applicant\u2019s wife denied knowledge of a receipt dated 20\u00a0October 2008 for gold jewellery bought in her name in Dubai for DKK 43,000. Moreover, documents were presented before the Supreme Court showing that over a period of less than 5 months, up until the applicant was arrested, there had been nine hundred and sixtyseven calls to and from overseas numbers on the applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s home telephone.
