The Court notes a delay of approximately seventeen months caused by the stay in the proceedings awaiting the expert opinion (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). The Court is not called upon to determine the reasons for the delay in preparation of the expert report (difficulties in identifying the competent expert bureau, etc.), because Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. , no. 30546/96, \u00a7\u00a057, 3 October 2000). The Court observes that the principle responsibility for a delay caused by the expert examinations rests ultimately with the State (see Capuano v. Italy, judgment of 25 June 1987, Series A no. 119, \u00a7\u00a032). The Court further notes that the case was pending for approximately eleven months before the Moscow City Court (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). It appears that during that period the City Court only held one hearing, on 12 May 2003, when it took the final judgment. The Court also observes that certain delays attributable to the domestic authorities occurred in 1998 and 1999.",

In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see, e.g., \u010ceki\u0107 and Others v.  (dec.), no. 15085/02, 9\u00a0October 2003). Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.\u00a0Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7\u00a028, ECHR 1999I).",

The applicant was provided with ample opportunities to present her arguments and to challenge the submissions of the adversary in the proceedings and the judicial authorities gave them due consideration. In the light of the foregoing consideration, the Court finds that the reasons on which the national courts based their conclusions are sufficient to exclude any doubt that the way in which they established and assessed the evidence in the applicant's case was unfair or arbitrary.",
