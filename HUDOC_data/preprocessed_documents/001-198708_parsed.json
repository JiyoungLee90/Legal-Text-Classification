In any event, it is obvious that the person concerned would not be able to lodge a timely appeal in a situation where the latter became aware of the warrant and the secret surveillance conducted on its basis after that period. Relying on the decision of the Court of Cassation of 28 March 2014 (see paragraph 34 above), the Government submitted that the applicant could have lodged an appeal against the warrant of 3 February 2010 within fifteen days from the moment when she became acquainted with it, that is 12 May 2010, which she failed to do. It should be noted, however, that the relevant decision of the Court of Cassation concerned a specific situation where a person had attempted to appeal against a judicial warrant authorising an operative and intelligence measure in a case where the prosecution had not pursued the charges against him in court. Therefore the given example of domestic caselaw cannot be regarded as supporting the Government\u2019s claim that the applicant had an effective possibility of lodging an appeal against the warrant, having found out about it at the end of the investigation in the circumstances where the criminal case against her was about to be sent to the trial court for examination on the merits. The Government has not submitted any example of domestic case-law where the Court of Appeal accepted for examination an appeal against a procedural decision concerning a piece of evidence forming part of an indictment in a case which had been transmitted or was about to be transmitted to the trial court determining the criminal charge against a person. Furthermore, the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure set out the regular procedure for lodging appeals against procedural decisions within ten days of their pronouncement (see paragraph 30 above) while in its decision of 28 March 2014 the Court of Cassation clarified the principles with regard to calculation of the time-limits for such appeals (see paragraph 34 above). However, the Court of Cassation was not called to examine the powers and competence of the Court of Appeal when examining appeals against procedural decisions rendered in the course of criminal proceedings where an indictment had been finalised, with the result that the case file had been transmitted to the trial court whereas the Government, as noted above, has not produced any example of domestic case-law where the Court of Appeal agreed to adjudicate an appeal against a judicial warrant relating to evidence forming part of the body of incriminating evidence submitted to a court determining a criminal charge.",

The Court observes, however, that the Kirakosyan (no. 2) case concerned a search carried out in the applicant\u2019s presence (see Kirakosyan (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 14 and 15) hence a measure of which the applicant had been aware during the investigation as opposed to the situation in the present case where the applicant learnt about the secret surveillance measures after the completion of the investigation with the criminal case against her being sent to the trial court for examination. Notably, in its decision of 28 March 2014 the Court of Cassation also acknowledged the need to adopt a different approach, in so far as the procedure for lodging appeals against procedural decisions was concerned, depending on the type of the operative and intelligence measure. It stated that, for example, in the case of a search the relevant time-limit could start from the moment when it was carried out, as opposed to secret surveillance in which case the moment when the person became aware of the measure was the date to be taken into account (see paragraph 34 above).",

Against this background, and in view of the Court\u2019s above finding that lodging an appeal in a separate procedure at that stage of the proceedings did not constitute an effective remedy either, in view of the uncertainty as to the effectiveness of this remedy, the Court considers that it was not unreasonable for the applicant to try to bring her grievances to the attention of the trial court. This finding is further reinforced by the fact that the domestic courts did in fact examine the applicant\u2019s complaints, which primarily concerned the alleged unlawfulness of surveillance measures (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above) and therefore addressed, in substance, her Convention complaints. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant cannot be reproached for her attempt to bring her grievances to the attention of the domestic courts through the remedies which she mistakenly considered effective (see Zubkov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 29431/05 and 2 others, \u00a7 107, 7 November 2017).",

In any event, the Court is of the opinion that secret surveillance being a serious interference with a person\u2019s right to respect for private life, a judicial authorisation serving as its basis cannot be drafted in such vague terms as to leave room for speculation and assumptions with regard to its content and, most importantly, to the person in whose respect the given measure is being applied.",
