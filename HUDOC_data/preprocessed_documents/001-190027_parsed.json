Furthermore, the indispensable condition for making an award in respect of pecuniary damage is the existence of a causal link between the damage alleged and the violation found (see, for instance, Andrejeva, cited above, \u00a7 111). In the light of the foregoing, the Court awards the applicant EUR 44,853 as compensation for the unpaid pension instalments to which he would have been entitled between October 1994 and February 2003 had the violation of Article 14 not occurred. To this some interest should be added, reflecting the inflation rates since the relevant period (see Riba\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072).
