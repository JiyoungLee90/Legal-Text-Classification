Furthermore, with regard to possible remedies in the form of a third-party application to the prosecutor or an application to the president of the higher court to have the order set aside, referred to in Articles 287 and 291 of the Code (see paragraph 22 above), the Court considers that these manifestly did not satisfy the requirements of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 (see, mutatis mutandis, Gurepka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61, and Grecu v. Romania, no.\u00a075101/01, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84, 30 November 2006).

In that connection the Court has considered the terms of the Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 7, which states expressly that when deciding whether an offence is of a minor character, an important criterion is the question of whether the offence is punishable by imprisonment or not (see paragraph 24 above). In the instant case, Article 201-39 of the Regulatory Offences Code stipulated that the offence in question was punishable by a term of detention of up to fifteen days. Having regard to the aim of Article 2 and the nature of the guarantees for which it provides, the Court is satisfied that an offence for which the law prescribes a custodial sentence as the main punishment cannot be described as \u201cminor\u201d within the meaning of the second paragraph of that Article. As to the classification of the offence in national law, the Court has already pointed out that this has only a relative value. The exception invoked by the Government is therefore not applicable in the present case.",
