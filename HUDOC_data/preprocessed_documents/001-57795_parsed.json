Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10), is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established (see the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, para. 59).",

Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, for \"the protection of the reputation of ... others\", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest.
