The Supreme Court noted that the issue on re-trial was quantum, not liability, and that an arguable right of appeal existed as to quantum.

It also dismissed Superwood\u2019s further applications, inter alia, for leave to amend its notice of appeal or to file a new notice. The Supreme Court considered that it was within its inherent jurisdiction to dismiss proceedings by a company which had failed to provide security for costs ordered in the interests of the proper administration of justice. This was not inconsistent with the constitutional right of access to an appeal. Had Superwood made some realistic proposal to furnish security for costs, the Supreme Court might have been disposed to consider it.

As to when the period ended, the Government maintained that the final decision was delivered by the Supreme Court in March 2004 and Superwood argued that, since the taxation of costs was unresolved, the proceedings had not ended. The Court recalls that a taxation of costs procedure is to be seen as a continuation of the substantive litigation and accordingly as part of the \u201cdetermination of ... civil rights and obligations\u201d (Robins v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1997, \u00a7 29, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997V; Doran v. Ireland, no. 50389/99, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2003X; and McMullen v. , no. 42297/98, \u00a7 31, 29 July 2004). Since the Government did not dispute that taxation of costs has not been completed, the proceedings can be considered to be continuing.",

In particular, while Superwood was entitled to make use of all procedural steps relevant to it, it must bear the consequences when delay results (McMullen v. Ireland, \u00a7 35). In this respect and, in particular during the re-trial phase of the proceedings, Superwood made numerous applications to the Supreme Court (including an appeal against the judgment on re-trial which contained over 300 grounds of appeal), the majority of which applications were not successful. Moreover and importantly, the failure to resolve the taxation of costs matter since March 2004 is, on Superwood\u2019s own submissions, the result of the refusal to pay security for costs as ordered by the High Court and thus the last 7\u00a0years delay is entirely attributable to Superwood.",

The Court has therefore examined the conduct of the authorities. In this respect, the Court recalls in particular that, contrary to the Government\u2019s submission, even a principle of domestic law that parties to civil proceedings are required to take the initiative to progress the proceedings, does not dispense a State from the requirement to organise its system to deal with cases within a reasonable period of time: if a State allows proceedings to continue beyond a \u201creasonable time\u201d without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay (Foley v. the United Kingdom, no. 39197/98, \u00a7 40, 22 October 2002; Price and Lowe v. the United Kingdom, nos. 43185/98 and 43186/98, \u00a7 23, 29\u00a0July 2003 as cited in McFarlane v.  [GC], no. 31333/06, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2010...). Moreover, particular diligence was required of the authorities following the appeal judgment of 1995 which ordered a re-trial in a complex case 6 years after the action had begun. The periods of delay noted below have been assessed in the light, inter alia, of these principles.",
