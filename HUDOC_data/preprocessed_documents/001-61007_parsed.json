The resultant delay in notifying the defendant of the action rendered, in the light of the Regional Court's decision of 9 February 1994, any preceding procedure devoid of relevance. Moreover, it took the domestic court more than a year (between 25 October 1994 and 2 November 1995) to decide on, inter alia, the applicants' motion to hear witnesses and their request for legal aid. Lastly, it was not until 5 February 1998 that the Supreme Court held a hearing concerning the applicants' appeal lodged, in its finalised form, on 2\u00a0September 1996. ",
