In considering Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f), however, he did not accept that the applicant needed to be detained because there was no risk that he would abscond or otherwise misbehave. That finding was overturned by the Court of Appeal, which considered that Article 5 \u00a7 1\u00a0(f) required immigration authorities not to prolong unduly the detention of aliens pending consideration of applications for leave to enter, or for deportation, but that it did not apply a necessity test to those procedures. The House of Lords underlined that the aim of detention at Oakington was to speed up immigration procedures by using a \u201cfast-track\u201d procedure which could be applied in relatively straightforward cases. It, too, considered that in the absence of any express or implied necessity test in the Convention or the Convention case-law, immigration detention could be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1\u00a0(f) even though it was not \u201cnecessary\u201d. The House of Lords added, in connection with the question whether detention was a disproportionate response to the reasonable requirements of immigration control, that the need for speedy determination of claims favoured accepting the Oakington procedure as proportionate and reasonable.",

The position regarding potential immigrants, whether they are applying for asylum or not, is different to the extent that, until their application for immigration clearance and/or asylum has been dealt with, they are not \u201cauthorised\u201d to be on the territory. Subject, as always, to the rule against arbitrariness, the Court accepts that the State has a broader discretion to decide whether to detain potential immigrants than is the case for other interferences with the right to liberty. Accordingly, and this finding does no more than apply to the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1\u00a0(f) the ruling the Court has already made as regards the second limb of the provision, there is no requirement in Article 5 \u00a7 1\u00a0(f) that the detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing. All that is required is that the detention should be a genuine part of the process to determine whether the individual should be granted immigration clearance and/or asylum, and that it should not otherwise be arbitrary, for example on account of its length.",

In this respect, I share the opinion of the House of Lords that, until a State has \u201cauthorised\u201d entry, the entry is unauthorised and the State has in principle power to detain under the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (f) until the application has been considered and authorisation has been granted or refused.

As noted in the judgment, in the case of Chahal, the Court expressly rejected the contention that the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) demanded that the detention of a person against whom action was being taken with a view to deportation should reasonably be considered necessary to prevent the ",

As has frequently been emphasised in the Court\u2019s case-law, any deprivation of liberty must be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness. In the context of detention at the Oakington Centre, this requires not only that the detention of an immigrant lasts for no longer than is required to complete the procedures for deciding whether to grant entry but that the period of detention should be short. The detention in the present case lasted for a total of 7 days, which the majority has found not to be excessive. While I can agree that the period of the applicant\u2019s detention at Oakington was within the limits of what could be regarded as acceptable, any period of detention significantly in excess of this period would in my view not be compatible with the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f).",

On the basis of the facts in this case, the purpose of the applicant\u2019s detention was not, however to prevent the applicant\u2019s entry at all. The applicant arrived at  on 30 December 2000 and applied for asylum upon his arrival. If the competent authorities had been of the opinion that there existed grounds for detaining him in order to prevent him from effecting an unauthorised entry into the territory, they could have exercised that \u201cright to control entry\u201d at that moment for the purpose set out in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). However, the immigration authorities, on the contrary, granted him \u201ctemporary admission\u201d and he was permitted to stay at a hotel of his choice inside the country. The grant of temporary admission was subsequently extended twice, on two consecutive days. We therefore strongly believe that the pre-condition for the applicant\u2019s detention, namely that it be for the purpose of preventing him from effecting an unauthorised entry into the country, was not met, for the simple reason that the immigration authorities had already admitted him.",

States which are parties to international instruments dealing with the legal status of asylum seekers and refugees (e.g. the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, but also instruments in other systems, e.g. the European Union and the Council of Europe) are obliged to grant an asylum seeker admission to the territory (but not a residence permit) until the final decision in the asylum procedure is taken. This also happened in the instant case, where the respondent Government admitted the applicant to the territory. Paradoxically, as indicated in paragraph 45 of the judgment, the applicant was detained for seven days, and was then released from detention after his asylum claim had been refused.",

The true reason was purely based on administrative or bureaucratic grounds aiming to place the applicant in Oakington detention and to follow the \u201cfast-track procedure\u201d.
