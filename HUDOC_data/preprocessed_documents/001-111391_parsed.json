It appears that anticipating the transfer of the case the investigating authority overlooked the expiry of the term of detention, and so did the court which received the criminal case file on 9 March 2005, which declined jurisdiction. Accordingly, no decision extending the detention order was granted until 17 March 2005. It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention between 4 and 17 March 2005 was not covered by a detention order.",

It has held that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without judicial authorisation or clear rules governing their situation was incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Isayev v. Russia, no.\u00a020756/04, \u00a7\u00a7 131-33, 22 October 2009; Yudayev v. Russia, no.\u00a040258/03, \u00a7\u00a7 59-61, 15 January 2009; Belov v.

Russia, no. 75039/01, \u00a7 57, 8 June 2006; and Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 147-51). The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. It notes that the Government have also accepted that that this period of the applicant\u2019s detention did not comply with domestic law, and considers that it was not \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The applicant was not therefore able to initiate a judicial review of his detention during that period because Russian law provides only for a procedure for an appeal against formal detention orders (see paragraph 20 above). In the absence of such an order the applicant did not have a clear means available to him of seeking a review of the lawfulness of his detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Belevitskiy, cited above, \u00a7 109). Furthermore, when the applicant did complain to the , alleging unlawful detention in that period, it treated this complaint as an application for release, and did not make a retrospective assessment of the lawfulness of the previous detention periods. In particular, in the decision of 22 April 2005 the court limited itself to stating reasons for the prospective detention but did not examine the question as to whether there existed an authorisation in respect of the period at issue. Moreover, the subsequent supervisory review conducted on 27 July 2005 omitted this issue as well. Accordingly, the domestic courts did not consider this part of the applicant\u2019s detention to be subject to a judicial review.",
