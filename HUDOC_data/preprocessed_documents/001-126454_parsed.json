Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice, and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 102, Reports 1998VIII, and Labita v.
