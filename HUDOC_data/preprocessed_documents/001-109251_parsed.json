Moreover, there were numerous contradictions between the statements of the serviceman and the civilians who had witnessed the events of 23 October 2001. The military investigators failed to verify whether senior lieutenant Z. had acted in excess of his authority because his specific task on 23 October 2001 had consisted of evacuating the defective MATE vehicle and not inspecting civilian vehicles. The investigators did not establish who had discovered the bodies in the VAZ-2109 vehicle, whether the vehicle passengers had had arms and if so, what had become of them after their eventual seizure.",

Moreover, the investigators had disregarded the fact that during the examination of the vehicle on 24 October 2001 no weapons or ammunition had been found in it. More importantly, all the spent cartridges had been discovered on the side of the canal where the servicemen had been stationed. The investigators had also failed to examine the fact that the vehicle had been moving with its headlights turned on and that the driver could have been unable to see the servicemen who had allegedly been signalling at it to stop from the other side. It followed from the medical documents concerning the wounding of Z. that he had been wounded at 11.30 p.m. on 23 October 2001, whilst the incident involving the applicants\u2019 relative had taken place at 8 p.m. on that day. The investigators had failed to interview all the servicemen who had witnessed the shooting and to identify the persons who had discovered the bodies in the VAZ-2109 vehicle. Moreover, they had not taken procedural decisions in respect of all the servicemen who admitted to having fired at the vehicle.

Since the beginning of the counterterrorist operation the domestic authorities had informed the local population that, if they found themselves in an area where counterterrorist activities were being carried out, the civilians were, upon establishing visual contact with the members of the federal forces and receiving warning signals from them, to stop moving, to show that they had no fire- or other arms in their hands, to leave their vehicles and to wait until the arrival of a \u201ccheck-out group\u201d of the federal troops.",

Instead, the vehicle had accelerated its pace and its passengers had started firing at the servicemen with their automatic guns, following which the commander of the group had taken a lawful decision, ordering his servicemen to shoot to kill. The fact that the passengers of the VAZ-2109 vehicle had shot at the servicemen was confirmed by the wounding of officer Z., who had had to undergo inpatient treatment. The servicemen had had to act in a difficult operative situation and under a real threat of attack from members of illegal armed groups and had complied with all the relevant legal requirements.

They furthermore argued that the documents submitted by the Government suggested that Z. had not been entitled to stop and inspect civilian vehicles and that he had acted in excess of his powers, which fact had been indicated by higher-ranking prosecutors. Moreover, there was no indication that the servicemen under his command had been entitled to stop and inspect the vehicle. It followed from the statement by A.K. that the incident had taken place when it had been dark and accordingly the passengers of the VAZ-2109 car could hardly have seen any signals to stop allegedly made by the servicemen. Moreover, the statement by A.K. that he had fired two warning shots was contradicted by the statements of K.M. and the third applicant, who submitted that the servicemen had directly shot at the vehicle and that they had not heard any single shots but continuing bursts of automatic gun fire coming from the side of the servicemen. During the first minutes after the skirmish a police officer had inspected the vehicle but no weapons or ammunition had been discovered in it. Moreover, it had been inspected again on 24 October 2001 and no spent cartridges or guns had been found close to it. Hence, the allegation that the vehicle passengers had fired at the servicemen did not stand up. More importantly, all the spent cartridges seized from the crime scene were found on the side of the road where the servicemen had been stationed. In sum, the applicant claimed that the death of their relative had been in breach of Article 2 of the Convention.",

Shortly after having been informed of the existence of that decision, the applicants successfully challenged it before the UGA prosecutor\u2019s office, which ordered that the investigation be resumed (see paragraph 39 above). Subsequently, as it emerges from the case file materials, the military prosecutor\u2019s office persistently failed to inform the applicants of its ensuing decisions to close the investigation. However, in reply to the applicants\u2019 queries, the UGA prosecutor\u2019s office consistently notified them that the military prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s decisions to close the investigation had been set aside and that the investigation had been resumed and was ongoing (see paragraphs 41-45 above).",

Assuming that such radio intelligence indeed existed, it was critical for the assessment of the circumstances of the use of force by the servicemen and in particular, whether they had received any orders to stop or arrest the passengers of the vehicle, what instructions had been given to them, if any, and whether those instructions or orders had been issued by an authority properly empowered to do so.

Moreover, given the servicemen\u2019s statement that they had used 5.45\u00a0mm calibre bullets, an expert examination of the VAZ-2109 vehicle could have shed light on the presence of holes measuring between 3 and 15\u00a0cm on the car, noted in the crime scene inspection report (see paragraph\u00a056 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion, such an examination would have been particularly opportune, given the cursory nature of the inspection of the vehicle by the investigators and their summary and unspecific findings, as reflected in the crime scene inspection report (ibid.).

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 146-50, Series A no. 324).",

Furthermore, the national law regulating policing operations must secure a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force and even against avoidable accident (see Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7 58). In particular, law-enforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the pre-eminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97).",
