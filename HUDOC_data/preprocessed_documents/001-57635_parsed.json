There has been no evidence to support any suggestion that there was not \"a fair trial\". There was a record of the proceedings made by the President of the Court. I cannot agree that simply because this would not be regarded as a sufficient record for the purposes of cassation in the Netherlands Supreme Court it must follow that the procedure leading to the adjudication in the District Court was necessarily, or in the events which have happened, in violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (art. 5-1). The procedural omission in question did not go to the substance of the matter and did not touch upon any matter fundamental to the adjudication of the President of the District Court.",
