The judgment of 24 November 2010 of the Senate of the Supreme Court confirms the competence of domestic courts to review civil claims about such omissions on the part of administrative courts as a failure to provide translation of its decisions. The Government has not provided information on further developments in the case-law, apart from the judgment of 11 April 2013 of the Riga Regional Court, which dealt with a civil claim concerning the length of criminal proceedings in a case where the criminal courts themselves had made findings that there had been a breach of the reasonable time requirement. The courts\u2019 take on the applicable legal basis for the civil claim in the latter judgment deviated from the one indicated by the Senate of the Supreme Court in 24 November 2010.

What is at stake for the applicant is particularly important in cases relating to civil status, and special diligence is required in view of the possible consequences which the excessive length of proceedings may have, notably on enjoyment of the right to respect for family life (see Laino v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a033158/96, \u00a7\u00a018, ECHR 1999-I).

The applicant did not challenge the fact that he had been informed about those hearings in a timely manner, thus there is no reason to believe that there was insufficient time and opportunity to ensure his presence at the hearings, especially taking into account the importance of the subject matter. Furthermore, the Court draws attention to the fact that the applicant failed to cooperate with the B\u0101ri\u0146tiesa thereby contributing to the delays in obtaining an opinion on his and V.S.\u2019s relationship with each of their children (see paragraph 14 above).",

However, in his submissions to the Civil Division of the Supreme Court, he indicated that he had not received the relevant court summons. He also referred to domestic law provisions which led the court to believe that the summons should be sent to his address in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 18 above). Thus, the applicant contributed to the overall length of the proceedings.",

While the domestic courts examined the applications for interim measures during this time, no action was taken with regard to the merits of the case. Moreover, although the applicant indicated on 10 June 2010 that he had not received the relevant court summons (see paragraph 18 above), only on 16\u00a0September 2010 did the Civil Division of the Supreme Court conclude that the summons should have been sent to his address in the United Kingdom through the Ministry of Justice and schedule the next hearing for 27 April 2011, seven months later. Lastly, it should be noted that after the Senate of the Supreme Court had received the case it took eleven months to adopt the decision refusing to initiate cassation proceedings, and no court hearings were held during this time.",

In particular, the Court does not find information in the case file that would justify the significant periods of inactivity in the appellate proceedings from the moment the case was received in the Civil Division of the Supreme Court on 24 July 2008, initiating these proceedings on 2 July 2009 and scheduling of a hearing for 1 June 2010. The Court agrees with the Government that the applicant\u2019s conduct also contributed to the overall length of proceedings, however, it recalls that the duty to administer justice expeditiously is, in the first place, incumbent on the relevant authorities (see Karcheva and Shtarbova, cited above, \u00a7 47).",
