However, the Court distinguishes these cases from the present one as in the former cases the applicants did not inform the Court about receipt of relevant payments due to them under the monetary awards whereas in the present case the applicant resisted accepting the apartment allocated to him under the in-kind award. In the situation where the applicant does not accept the offer as enforcement of the judgment in his favour (see the applicant's claims before the Town Court lodged in November 2007 as set out paragraph\u00a025 above), his failure to inform the Court about further developments in his case does not, in the Court's view, amount to abuse of right of individual petition.

Although there were no formal enforcement proceedings after that date, the Court considers that the judgment remained unenforced till 14 August 2007, when the Brovary Town Executive Committee issued the applicant with a housing warrant. It is not for the Court, however, to speculate on whether the apartment allocated to the applicant complied with the judgment at issue, despite the applicant's position that it did not. In the absence of the domestic court's decision to the contrary, it deems, for the purposes of the present case, that the judgment was enforced on 14\u00a0August 2007. However, the fact that the judgment in the applicant's favour has been enforced does not deprive the applicant of his victim status in relation to the period during which that judgment remained unenforced (see Romashov v.

An applicant can allege a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 only in so far as the impugned decisions related to his or her \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of this provision. \u201cPossessions\u201d can be either \u201cexisting possessions\u201d or assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he or she has at least a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right (Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035). A \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d must be of a nature more concrete than a mere hope, and must be based on a legal provision or a legal act such as a judicial decision (ibid., \u00a7\u00a049).",

As real estate prices had increased, it was impossible for the Council to purchase an apartment for the applicant in advance. For that reason it invested the sum awarded in the construction of the apartment but it delayed the enforcement of the judgment at issue. As the Council acted in good faith and took all measures available to it, the delay in enforcement could not be attributed to it.

In this regard the Court emphasises that neither the debtor nor the bailiff, who were or ought to have been aware of the lack of available apartments from the very beginning, made any attempts to make alternative arrangements for the applicant's accommodation or compensation (see, mutatis mutandis, Shpakovskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a041307/02, \u00a7\u00a029, 7\u00a0July 2005, and Malinovskiy v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038).
