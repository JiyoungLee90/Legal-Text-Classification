Another girl stated that she had no respect for her father and hated it when he came home drunk. The third girl stated that she loved her mother, and she attempted to avoid speaking about her father. According to further records, the social workers were unable to interview O.L., as he was not at home during their visits. Their attempts to set up a separate appointment with him failed, as he either did not pick up the telephone or refused to meet the social workers, saying that he was very busy at work. As a result of the assessment, the welfare service drafted a report indicating that the children had generally been provided with the conditions necessary for their upbringing. However, their father neglected his parental responsibilities and engaged in violent arguments with the mother, which was intimidating and distressing for the children. The applicant was offered counselling support, which she declined at that time.",

It is a general problem which affects, to a varying degree, all member States, and which does not always surface, since it often takes place within personal relationships or closed circuits (Volodina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071). While this phenomenon may most frequently affect women, the Court acknowledges that men may also be the victims of domestic violence and, indeed, that children, too, are often its casualties, whether directly or indirectly. Accordingly, the Court will bear in mind the gravity of the problem at issue when examining the present case (see Opuz v. Turkey, no.\u00a033401/02, \u00a7\u00a0132, ECHR\u00a02009).",

Where it is established that a particular individual has been systematically targeted and future abuse is likely to follow, apart from responses to specific incidents, the authorities may be called upon to implement an appropriate action of a general nature to combat the underlying problem and prevent future ill-treatment (see \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a041526/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-93 and 147-49, ECHR\u00a02012; and Irina Smirnova, cited above, ibid.).",

Subsequently, the above ruling was reversed in appeal proceedings, essentially on the basis that O.L.\u2019s eviction would constitute a disproportionate interference with his right to respect for his home (see paragraph\u00a037 above). The main issue for the Court in the present case is therefore determining whether this ruling achieved a fair balance between the competing interests at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Pfeifer v. Austria, no.\u00a012556/03, \u00a7\u00a038, 15\u00a0November\u00a02007, and B. v. Moldova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a073). At this juncture, the Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national courts to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation, and the Court is not in a position to take their place in this matter (see S\u00f6derman, S\u00f6derman v. Sweden [GC], no.\u00a05786/08, \u00a7\u00a0102, ECHR\u00a02013, and B\u0103l\u015fan v. Romania, no.\u00a049645/09, \u00a7\u00a067, 23\u00a0May\u00a02017). However, while granting substantial deference to the national courts in the choice of appropriate measures, the Court is obliged to review their conclusions from the viewpoint of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Valiulien\u0117 v.

The Court reiterates at this point that where the domestic authorities are confronted with credible domestic violence assertions, it falls on them to assess the situation in its entirety including the risk of future violence.

The Court would note at this point that due to specificity of domestic violence, withdrawal of complaints by victims is a recurrent phenomenon (see, in particular, Opuz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0138-39; Volodina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099; and B. v.
