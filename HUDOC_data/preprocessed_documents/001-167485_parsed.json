In other words, the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Labour Court, as a civil court not bound by the findings or result of the criminal proceedings, was at liberty to determine the dispute from a labour law perspective. It could, as a civil court, reach a different conclusion from the criminal courts by establishing independently the facts of the case with regard to the applicant\u2019s conduct. The Court recalls in that respect that even exoneration from criminal responsibility does not, as such, preclude the establishment of civil or other forms of liability arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof (see, for example, Ringvold v. Norway, no. 34964/97, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2003II, and Vella v. Malta, no. 69122/10, \u00a7 56, 11 February 2014). However, in order to comply with the right guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention, the national courts in the subsequent proceedings need to stay within the bounds of a civil forum and refrain from suggesting criminal characterization of the applicant\u2019s conduct (see, inter alia, Teodor v.\u00a0Romania, no. 46878/06, \u00a7\u00a044, 4 June 2013, and N.A. v.\u00a0Norway, no.\u00a027473/11, \u00a7 46, 18 December 2014). Any statement or reasoning by a civil court calling into question the applicant\u2019s established innocence would be incompatible with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 2.",

The statement imputing criminal liability to the applicant, in complete disregard of her acquittal in the criminal proceedings, went beyond the court\u2019s task of determining the justifiability of the decision to dismiss her from her post, and cast doubt on the correctness of her acquittal. The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the wording employed by the labour court ran contrary to the right guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7 2.",

The Court notes in this context that it has already found that the use as evidence for a criminal conviction of statements given by the accused to the police without the assistance of a lawyer may amount to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 56-62, ECHR 2008). The Government have not commented on the applicant\u2019s claim that her statements to the police were used as evidence in the civil case. The Court further notes that the labour court in its judgment referred to the fact that the applicant\u2019s employer had relied on the fact that the applicant had confessed to inciting M.G. into committing the crime, and that the labour court explicitly stated that it had examined the entire criminal investigation file (see paragraph 14 above). Thus, the facts of the case seem to indicate that the statements given by the applicant to the police without the assistance of a lawyer were relied on by the labour court, and the Court does not rule out that reliance by a court on such statements in civil proceedings may raise an issue under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. However, having regard to the fact that the labour court\u2019s reasoning and the wording used violated the applicant\u2019s right to presumption of innocence, the Court does not find it necessary to also assess if the labour court in reaching its conclusion relied on evidence in violation of the right to a fair trial.",
