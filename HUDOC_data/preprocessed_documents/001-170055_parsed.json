The applicant claimed compensation for damage caused by the criminal offence committed by Inspector S.K. In the claim the applicant relied on the operative part of the judgment of the Daugavpils Court (see above), section 27 of the Law on Police and various provisions of the Civil Law which regulated tort liability. Relying on sections 2347 and 2349 of the Civil Law in particular, the applicant claimed pecuniary and non-pecuniary (mor\u0101lo kait\u0113jumu) damages of LVL 197,624.31 (EUR 282,320) for blindness, mutilation and disfigurement (sakrop\u013cojums un iz\u0137\u0113mojums), loss of future income (atraut\u0101 pe\u013c\u0146a) and medical expenses.",

In the judgment of 27\u00a0February 2003 the first and fourth criteria had been established.

The applicant had claimed pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages for injuries sustained as a result of police ill-treatment. In this regard he had relied on sections 2347 to\u00a02349 of the Civil Law, which provided that compensation could be claimed for mutilation and disfigurement. In order to determine whether the consequences of the alleged injuries were those stipulated in the legal provision, the domestic courts had to establish the essential conditions of tort liability, namely (i) unlawful conduct, (ii) damage, (iii) a causal link between the unlawful conduct and damage claimed and (iv) fault. In the applicant\u2019s case, no such conclusions could be drawn on the basis of the medical documents.

In his claim he had relied on legislation which provided for compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage for mutilation or disfigurement only (see paragraph 33 above). On this head the applicant\u2019s civil claim for pecuniary damages (medical expenses) had been partly upheld but the claim for non-pecuniary damages had been dismissed on the grounds that the domestic courts could not establish a causal link between the unlawful actions of the State authorities and the applicant\u2019s loss of sight. Consequently, the civil court could not conclude that the applicant had either been mutilated or disfigured. Furthermore, the Government referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s letter of 21 October 2010 (see paragraphs\u00a03032 above) and asserted that the applicant would have had much better prospects of success if he had claimed compensation for nonpecuniary damage for an unjustified violation of his rights, as done by the claimants in the \u201cTalsi tragedy\u201d case.

The effect of that provision is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article\u00a013 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see Jeronovi\u010ds v.\u00a0Latvia [GC], no. 44898/10, \u00a7\u00a0107, 5\u00a0July\u00a02016). Where an applicant alleges ill-treatment at the hands of a State agent in breach of Article 3, the Court has repeatedly found that two measures are necessary to provide sufficient redress. Firstly, the State authorities must have conducted a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Secondly, an award of compensation to the applicant is required where appropriate or, at least, the possibility of seeking and obtaining compensation for the ill-treatment, with a level of compensation awarded at domestic level commensurate to the alleged violation (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0116 and 118, ECHR\u00a02010).",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems with the interpretation of national legislation (see, among other authorities, Perez v. France [GC], no.\u00a047287/99, \u00a7 82, ECHR 2004I). What the Court finds important to assess is whether, given that in the civil proceedings the applicant brought to the domestic court\u2019s attention an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention, national law did allow the substance of that complaint to be dealt with and reparation to be made for the non-pecuniary damage caused (see, mutatis mutandis, Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2000\u2011XI).
