The Court cannot exclude that the persons concerned were not arrested on 13\u00a0October 1993, as found by the Commission, but on 14 October 1993. Whether or not the gendarmes of the \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc gendarmerie station were assisted by other security forces on 14 October 1993 cannot be established with certainty, since neither the daily duty ledger of the \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc gendarmerie station of 14 October 1993 nor any planning or operation record of this gendarmerie station has been submitted. Leaving aside the question on what exact date the twelve persons from G\u00fczderesi were arrested, the Court considers it highly unlikely \u2013 given the particular circumstances in the area at the material time \u2013 that the gendarmes from \u00c7atakk\u00f6pr\u00fc would not be assisted by other security forces when going to G\u00fczderesi with a specific order to apprehend twelve persons suspected of being involved with the PKK.

Recalling the Court\u2019s case-law in relation to the civil and administrative remedies referred to by the Government, it held that the domestic case-law submitted was insufficient to demonstrate that compensation claims were effective remedies for the destruction of homes and villages in south-east Turkey. It further noted that no example had been given of a successful, or indeed any, prosecution brought against a member of the security forces for destruction of a house in a village in this region. As regards the investigation of the applicant\u2019s case, it noted that it was dealt with by an Administrative Council. According to the Commission, such councils are subject to the authority of the executive and consequently not independent, and unlikely to instigate effective investigative measures. The Commission considered that it would be unrealistic to expect villagers to pursue civil or administrative remedies in the absence of any positive findings of fact by the State investigatory mechanism.",
