Accordingly, it is not unreasonable that the authorities request the applicant to produce additional documents, such as bank details, to allow or speed up the execution of a judgment (see, among others, Burdov\u00a0(no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a069). The creditor\u2019s uncooperative behaviour may be an obstacle to timely enforcement of a judgment, thus alleviating the authorities\u2019 responsibility for delays (see Belayev v.\u00a0Russia\u00a0(dec.), 36020/02, 22\u00a0March 2011). The Court has found, for example, that the authorities ought not to be held responsible for the applicants\u2019 unexplained failure to follow the domestic enforcement procedure and, notably, for their deliberate and persistent refusal to provide the writs of enforcement (see Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v. Russia, nos.\u00a010511/08 and 5866/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027-31, 31\u00a0January 2012). It should be recalled, however, that the requirement of the creditor\u2019s cooperation must not go beyond what is strictly necessary and, in any event, does not relieve the authorities of their obligation under the Convention to take timely action of their own motion, on the basis of the information available to them, with a view to honouring the judgment against the State (see Akashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a022, and Burdov\u00a0(no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a069).",

The Court further notes that some of those requests and petitions contained an explicit request to suspend enforcement pending re-consideration of the allegedly unfair judicial award. In any event, no suspension has ever been granted, and there is nothing to suggest that those petitions or the authorities\u2019 replies were at any point forwarded either to the respondent military unit or to a court competent to suspend execution of the initial award. In these circumstances, the Court is unable to find that these petitions had had any bearing on the enforcement issue.",

Further, that statement is even more surprising, given that the respondent authority was represented at the court room and was thus clearly aware of the outcome of the proceedings. In any event, Court has already found that where the defendant State authority intervenes as a party in court proceedings, it must automatically receive the original text of the judgment from the domestic court itself (see the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a020 above) The Court does not discern, therefore, any need for the applicant to notify the respondent authority of the judgment (see, for the similar conclusion, Gadzhikhanov and Saukov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a022).",

Further, in contrast to the above applications (see, for instance, Shevchenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a025), there is nothing to confirm that the applicant had been advised of the procedure to follow in order to obtain execution of the judgment. In fact, the parties did not submit any document or information to demonstrate that the applicant had in fact been advised of the necessity to solicit any writ of execution at a domestic court or to forward it to the respondent authority (see, for the outline of the relevant procedure referred to by the applicant and not disputed by the Government, paragraph\u00a012 above).

In fact, the Government themselves submitted that the judicial award had been executed in part as a follow-up of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry in 2008, and that the remainder of the allowances due to the applicant had been paid to him in 2009 irrespective of his alleged failure to obtain and submit the writs of execution.",
