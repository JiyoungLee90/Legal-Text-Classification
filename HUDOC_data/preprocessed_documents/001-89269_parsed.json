The Court notes, however, that neither the complexity of the case nor the five-year postponement explains the length of the proceedings. It points out, in particular, that the  gave its judgment over ten years after the initiation of the civil proceedings and that the Government did not supply any satisfactory explanation to account for this delay, which seems manifestly excessive. The Court notes in any event that, under Turkish law, the firstinstance court was not bound by the findings of the criminal courts and therefore did not have to suspend the proceedings for such a long period of time in order to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings (see Mustafa T\u00fcrko\u011flu v. , no.\u00a058922/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 8 August 2006).",
