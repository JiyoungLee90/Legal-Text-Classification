In the request, firstly, a summary of the suspicions against the applicant was set out. It was further submitted that the materials of the criminal case presented to the court (statements of witnesses and other suspects, copies of contracts, procurement documents, bank account statements, inspection reports and surveillance reports) provided grounds for the assertion that the applicant was very probably linked to the acts of which he was suspected. Furthermore, it was noted that, although the applicant had no prior convictions, he was suspected of the commission of crimes falling under four different Articles of the Penal Code (Karistusseadustik), committed over an extended period of time. The bringing of further charges against the applicant could not be excluded since there were hints of other similar episodes. The prosecutor noted that, considering the nature of the crimes the applicant was suspected of (including offences relating to a breach of the duty to maintain integrity), and having regard to his active and leading role in them, there was a reasonable suspicion that, if at liberty, he could compromise the ongoing investigation by tampering with the evidence or exerting pressure on witnesses or other suspects. In the course of the investigation several witnesses (including municipal officials) had repeatedly testified that the applicant had influenced them to take decisions in his favour by threatening them with trouble or loss of employment. There was further information and evidence indicating that the applicant was a wealthy and influential person who was capable of carrying out these threats and affecting processes in the city. It was also mentioned that several of the acts suggested ongoing corrupt behaviour on his part despite the detention of a number of his accomplices. The prosecutor considered that there was a real risk that, if at liberty, the applicant would contact other persons with a view to hindering the investigation and influence the municipal officials, entrepreneurs and other witnesses who had so far given statements against him and his accomplices. Exerting influence over witnesses or tampering with the evidence were potential offences.",

The County Court decided not to grant the defence access to the materials in question since the law did not provide for such a possibility. The applicant argued, inter alia, that a news article concerning the criminal investigation had been published a month and a half earlier and he had had the opportunity to influence the persons involved but had not done so. Moreover, he had suspended his functions at the City Council. He expressed his surprise that statements had been made by persons whom he even did not know. The prosecutor noted, inter alia, that the court had been presented with surveillance reports according to which the applicant had been involved in considering the question of the dismissal of certain officials.

The court reiterated the prosecutor\u2019s arguments as to the need for the applicant\u2019s detention because otherwise he could damage the investigation (see paragraph 10 above). It considered that remanding the applicant in custody was necessary in order to prevent the commission of further crimes by him.",

A public hearing took place on 6 December 2011, with the participation of the applicant\u2019s lawyer and the prosecutor. According to the record of the hearing, the applicant\u2019s lawyer raised the issue that without access to the case-file materials it was impossible for him to challenge the prosecutor\u2019s position. The prosecutor reiterated his arguments about the need to keep the applicant in custody in order to prevent him from exerting influence over the witnesses and the other accused. According to the prosecutor, the investigation was being conducted intensively and the case-file was voluminous. He handed over three volumes of case-file materials to the court but objected to the request of the defence to be given access to this evidence. The record of the hearing does not contain any information on the court\u2019s decision in respect of the defence\u2019s access request.",

It again referred to the applicant\u2019s role in the commission of the offences alleged and considered that, if at liberty, he might tamper with evidence and influence the other accused and witnesses.

The Supreme Court\u2019s plenary session found similarly in a judgment of 8 June 2009 (case no.\u00a0341708). The Supreme Court later reiterated that position, for example in a decision of 30 May 2012 (case no.\u00a03-1-1-48-12) of the Criminal Chamber where it held that a party\u2019s claim to have a legal act declared unconstitutional was to be considered a procedural request but that the court examining the case was not bound by it and also had an obligation to declare a legal act unconstitutional where it conflicted with the Constitution but the parties did not make such a claim.

The Supreme Court referred to its long-standing case-law according to which the Constitutional Review Court Procedure Act (P\u00f5hiseaduslikkuse j\u00e4relevalve kohtumenetluse seadus) did not explicitly provide for a possibility to lodge an individual constitutional complaint with the Supreme Court. However, proceeding from Articles 13, 14 and 15 of the Constitution and the practice of the Convention, the Supreme Court had heard such complaints in cases where the person had no other effective way to obtain judicial protection of his right of recourse to the courts established in Article 15 of the Constitution. In the said case the Supreme Court noted that in the impugned criminal proceedings the complainant had not made an explicit request for the initiation of constitutional review proceedings. Therefore, the court of appeal in that case could not be reproached for not having interpreted the complainant\u2019s arguments before it as a request for constitutional review. The Supreme Court concluded that the complainant had had an effective opportunity to protect his fundamental rights by requesting the initiation of constitutional review proceedings. Therefore, his individual constitutional complaint was inadmissible.",

The Supreme Court declined to rule on the merits of the case in constitutional review proceedings, noting that other proceedings were available to the person concerned for the judicial protection of his rights. He could seek protection of his rights and also challenge the constitutionality of the rules of criminal procedure within the criminal proceedings in his case. The Supreme Court noted that in the case of the complainant\u2019s request for the review of the reasons for his arrest, he was in substance complaining about the acts of the prosecutor. However, he had not made a complaint to the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office, from which an appeal lay to the preliminary investigation judge of a county court. The latter was entitled to declare the relevant regulation unconstitutional, order the prosecutor to release the evidence, and initiate constitutional review proceedings before the Supreme Court. In respect of the initial arrest warrant, the Supreme Court found that the complainant could have requested a declaration of unconstitutionality of the underlying legislation when challenging the arrest warrant before a court of appeal.",

Moldova, no.\u00a023393/05, \u00a7\u00a030, 13\u00a0March 2007; and McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006X). Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention cannot be seen as unconditionally authorising detention provided that it lasts no longer than a certain period. Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Idalov v. Russia [GC], no. 5826/03, \u00a7 140, 22 May 2012, and Shishkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038822/97, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2003-I). When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities have an obligation under Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 to consider alternative measures of ensuring his or her appearance at the trial (see Sulaoja v. Estonia, no. 55939/00, \u00a7 64, 15\u00a0February 2005, and Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 83, 21\u00a0December 2000).",

Thus, the Court considers that the domestic judicial authorities sufficiently reasoned their decisions in respect of the grounds for the applicant\u2019s continued detention, such as the danger that he might tamper with evidence and exert pressure on witnesses and co-defendants (which they saw as potential offences).",

He also requested release on bail \u2013 appealing against the refusal up to the Supreme Court \u2013 and asked to have his detention replaced by electronic surveillance as a preventive measure. The courts concluded, on the basis of the materials of the criminal case, that the danger that the applicant would compromise the investigation outweighed the presumption in favour of his liberty, and that the alternative preventive measures were not sufficient to prevent the risk of the applicant obstructing the establishment of truth. Although the reasoning provided by the courts in their various decisions was broadly similar, the Court does not find that reproachable. It observes that the courts did not use a standard formula but rather referred to specific suspicions, and that they displayed a consistent approach to the considerations justifying the need for the applicant\u2019s continued detention. The Court discerns no reasons for concluding that the domestic courts failed in their duty of weighing the genuine public-interest requirement of fighting crime against the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention. It also notes in this context that considerations relating to the risk of a suspect\u2019s committing further offences or compromising the investigation involve a degree of probabilistic assessment and are not susceptible of firm proof.",

The Court has taken note of the applicant\u2019s argument that it was possible to interpret the Code of Criminal Procedure in such a way that the defence could have been given access to the material in question. The Government disagreed in substance. The Court reiterates that it is not its task to resolve matters concerning the interpretation of the domestic law (see, among many others, Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, \u00a7 49, 20 October 2011, and Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 100, ECHR\u00a02010) including, in the present case, the question whether the applicant could have been granted the requested access without the underlying provisions of the law of procedure being declared unconstitutional. However, the Court considers that the applicant raised the question of access to the prosecution material sufficiently before the domestic courts. The same domestic courts were also empowered to set aside unconstitutional legal provisions of their own motion if they found that the Code of Criminal Procedure could not be interpreted as permitting the granting of the applicant\u2019s request (see the summary of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 30\u00a0May 2012 in paragraph 33 above). As concerns the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 1 November 2011, referred to by the Government in this context (see paragraph 34 above), the Court considers that that decision dealt with the question whether it was possible for a complainant to raise a constitutionality issue before an ordinary court, with the emphasis on the ensuing inadmissibility of the individual constitutional complaint before the Supreme Court if the said possibility existed. Thus, that decision is not, as such, decisive for resolving the question whether domestic remedies have been exhausted for the purposes of Article 35 of the Convention.",
