In particular, the law must be sufficiently clear in its terms and afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary application (see, among other authorities, Vlasov v. Russia, no.\u00a078146/01, \u00a7 125, 12 June 2008). The function of clarification and interpretation of the provisions of domestic law belongs primarily to domestic judicial authorities (see e.g. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v.  [GC], no. 22479/93, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 1999VI). While the Court is not in a position to substitute its own judgment for that of the national courts and its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited (see, among other authorities, Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], no. 48321/99, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2003X, and Pauli\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 3572/06, \u00a7 39, 22 October 2009), it is the Court's function to review the reasoning adduced by domestic judicial authorities from the point of view of the Convention (see Slivenko, loc. cit.). To protect a person against arbitrariness it is not sufficient to provide a formal possibility of bringing adversarial proceedings to contest the application of a legal provision to his or her case. Where a resulting judicial decision lacks reasoning or an evidentiary basis, ensuing interference with a Convention right may become unforeseeable and consequently fall short of the lawfulness requirement (see, mutatis mutandis, Lupsa v. Romania, no.\u00a010337/04, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, ECHR 2006VII and C.G. and Others v. , no. 1365/07, \u00a7\u00a042, 46 and49-50, 24 April 2008).",

In other words, it must answer a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and, in particular, be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Zehentner v. Austria, no. 20082/02, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2009...). The concept of a \u201chome\u201d is of central importance to an individual's identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community (see Connors v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 66746/01, \u00a7 82, 27 May 2004). Given that eviction is a serious interference with an individual's right to respect for his or her home, the Court attaches particular weight to the procedural safeguards afforded to that individual in the course of the decision-making process (see Zehentner, cited above, \u00a7 60). In particular, even where the lawful right to occupation of the premises has come to an end, an individual should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles of Article 8 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Stankov\u00e1 v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 7205/02, \u00a7\u00a7 60-63, 9 October 2007; McCann, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050; \u0106osi\u0107 v.

Lack of reasoning in a judicial decision as to the grounds of application of a statute may, even where the formal requirements have been complied with, be taken into account among other factors in determining whether the measure complained of struck a fair balance (see, mutatis mutandis, Beyeler v.  [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2000I).",

The basis for this annulment was a finding that the flat owner, who had never been formally deprived of legal capacity and apparently had had an independent lifestyle, \u201ccould not understand the meaning of her actions or control them\u201d on a particular date in 1992 when authorising the first applicant's tenancy. The Court considers that such a conclusion required solid evidentiary basis, regard being had, in particular, to the fact that it was reached after the owner's death, at the request of a third party (the State) ten years from the date at issue. In the meantime, in their reasoning the courts relied exclusively on a statement by a single expert, who appears to have taken several hours at most to formulate it upon studying one source of evidence \u2013 namely, a psychiatric assessment, carried out in 2001, relating to March 1993 (a later date). It appears that in the circumstances of the present case that evidentiary basis left room for a speculative assessment of the facts, and considerably obscured the foreseeability of a statute on eviction of arbitrary occupants being applied.",

In the course of the judicial proceedings the applicants raised a number of arguments, alleging that their eviction would constitute a disproportionate burden on them. They alleged, in particular, that they had concluded their tenancy in good faith and that they had been considered lawful occupants for a considerable time, bearing maintenance expenses and charges, as well as investing in renovations on the property. These arguments were not addressed in the texts of the relevant judgments, the courts confining themselves to deciding whether or not the applicants' occupancy complied with statutory provisions. Furthermore, at no stage of the proceedings (including enforcement) did the courts consider the applicants' argument that following eviction they would be rendered homeless with two minor children. It is not clear from the case-file, to what extent the applicants actually suffered on account of their eviction and whether they easily relocated. It appears that the second applicant was able to obtain new permanent housing four years after the events giving rise to the application. However, even assuming that, as suggested by the Government, the applicants were able to relocate in good time and without a prohibitive outlay, their respective opportunities were never a subject for consideration by the courts.",
