In the applicant\u2019s view, that line of case-law, initially developed in the context of the cooperation agreements, was \u201cfully transposable\u201d to the relevant provisions of the association agreements. The CJEU had also added that its interpretation was compatible with the requirements of Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Furthermore, the interpretation of the concept of \u201csocial security\u201d by the CJEU was sufficiently broad to encompass social-assistance benefits. In these circumstances, the applicant argued, it had not been open to the Court of Cassation to ignore the request to refer the question for a preliminary ruling.",

The allowance in question had been placed in the \u201csocial assistance\u201d category solely on the basis of domestic law, without reference to the criteria established by the CJEU (namely the statutory nature and dual function of the benefit and its connection to one of the risks referred to in Article 4(1) of Regulation No\u00a01408/71). Hence, the \u201cCommunity\u201d dimension of that categorisation operation had been overlooked. In the applicant\u2019s submission, it was clear from the European legislation and the case-law of the CJEU that Statefunded \u201cnon-contributory\u201d benefits could not be automatically excluded from the scope of the non-discrimination principle established by the Agreement (the applicant cited, by way of example, the cases of Yousfi, Case C-58/93, judgment of 20\u00a0April 1994, concerning the granting of a disability allowance; Commission v. Greece, Case C-185/96, judgment of 29 October 1998, concerning various categories of benefits for large families; and Hughes, Case C-78/91, judgment of 16 July 1992, on the subject of the \u201cfamily credit\u201d\u00a0in the United Kingdom). On the basis of his references to that case-law, the Court of Cassation should either, of its own accord, have included the allowance he was claiming within the scope of Regulation no. 1408/71, by analogy, or referred the question to the CJEU, which had not yet ruled on the nature of this particular allowance.",

The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see X and Others v. Austria [GC], no. 19010/07, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2013, and Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2013). The notion of discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 also includes cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7 82, Series A no. 94).",

The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background, but the final decision as to the observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013378/05, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2008; Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2010; \u015eerife Yi\u011fit v.

However, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before the Court could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of nationality as compatible with the Convention (see Gaygusuz, cited above, \u00a7 42; Koua Poirrez v.

It notes in that connection that at the relevant time the applicant had been in possession of a lawful residence and work permit in Italy and had been insured with the INPS (see paragraph 6 above). He paid contributions to that insurance agency in the same capacity and on the same basis as workers who were European Union nationals (see, mutatis mutandis, Gaygusuz, cited above, \u00a7 46). He was not an alien residing in the country for a short period or in breach of the immigration legislation. Hence, he did not belong to the category of persons who, as a rule, do not contribute to the funding of public services and in relation to whom a State may have legitimate reasons for curtailing the use of resource-hungry public services such as social insurance schemes, public benefits and health care (see, mutatis mutandis, Ponomaryovi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054).",

Nevertheless, that aim cannot by itself justify the difference in treatment complained of. It remains to be determined whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the above-mentioned legitimate aim and the means employed in the present case. The Court points out in that connection that the national authorities\u2019 refusal to grant the family allowance to the applicant was based solely on the fact that he was not a national of a European Union Member State. It is not disputed that a citizen of such a State in the same position as the applicant would receive the allowance in question. Nationality was therefore the sole criterion for the distinction complained of. However, the Court reiterates that very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before it could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of nationality as compatible with the Convention (see paragraph 46 above). In these circumstances, and notwithstanding the wide margin of appreciation left to the national authorities in the field of social security, the arguments submitted by the Government are not sufficient to satisfy the Court that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality in the instant case that would render the impugned distinction compatible with the requirements of Article\u00a014 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Andrejeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08689).",
