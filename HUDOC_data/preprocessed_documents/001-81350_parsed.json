It recalls that the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce the value of the award, such as an extended delay in enforcement (see Gizzatova v. , no. 5124/03, \u00a7 28, 13 January 2005). The Court notes that the Government disagreed with the period for which the applicant claimed the pecuniary damage, but it did not contest the method of calculation applied by the applicant. The Court considers that the period to be taken into consideration started in January 2000 when the judgment in the applicant's favour acquired legal force and ended on 12 May 2006 when it was fully enforced. Having regard to the materials in its possession, the Court awards the applicant EUR 70 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
