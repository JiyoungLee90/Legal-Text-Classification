An order of payment may also be carried out by assessment on the grounds laid down in section 41 (section 39).

The tax office may increase tax deduction liability twofold at most where the person responsible for carrying out the deduction has, due to gross negligence, failed to observe his obligation to provide the relevant information or has submitted a return or some other piece of information or document with essential inaccuracies (section 44). Where a return or some other piece of information or a document is not submitted, or is submitted with essential inaccuracies referred to in paragraph 1(4) for the purpose of fraud, the tax deduction liability must be increased by 50% at least and threefold at most (section\u00a044(2)).

According to Mr H.S., it was at the initiative of [the applicant] that invoices started to be made out in the name of [company T.]/West-Print. Mr H.S. said that he was told by [the applicant] in autumn 1998 that [company F.] was the new invoicing company that would be used. According to Mr H.S., he and the applicant had both worked independently hiring help for sites without being each other\u2019s employers. Both of them had worked for the Finnish State Railway and Perno Shipyard. Mr H.S. has stated, however, that he was responsible for less than two-thirds of the invoices sent to [company R.] in the name of [company T.]. As regards [company F.] he has not stated any amounts in FIM but has admitted to being responsible for some of the invoicing. According to Mr\u00a0M.V., heard as a witness in the pre-trial investigation, Mr H.S. assumed a smaller role in sub-contracting negotiations ever since [the applicant] took up sub-contracting activities. Mr H.V. noted that the switch had taken place with the change of invoicing companies in July 1998. Mr E.N., heard as a witness in the pre-trial investigation, said that in early spring 1998 he had gone to work at a [company R.] site at the machine workshop of the State Railway having been contacted either by Mr J.J., the owner of [company A.] or Mr H.S. without knowing specifically by which company he had been hired. Mr E.N. said he had received his salary in cash from either Mr J.J. or Mr H.S. He also stated that he knew that [the applicant] was also working at the [company R.] site and that he was the owner of West-Print. Mr E.N. did not know that West-Print and [company F.] had anything to do with the payment of his salary.\u201d",

The conclusions disclosed, on the other hand, that the tax inspection report concerning the company and other tax inspection reports were used in addition to the pre-trial investigation material. In the light of the statement of reasons, it could not be excluded that pre-trial material had been used at the tax inspection stage as well. On the basis of the statement of reasons, it was somewhat difficult to determine on which set of materials each conclusion was based. It was not possible to infer whether the observations on the entries in the accounts and the invoicing had been based solely on the tax inspection, or on the pre-trial material as well. In the decision it was observed that the inspection had disclosed that the cheque account of the company had, during the period July 1998 to 20 December 1999, been credited with over FIM 840,000 (EUR\u00a0134,214) by a number of different companies, with the majority of the funds not having been entered in the company\u2019s books. In any event, evidence relying on invoicing and entries on the account could be regarded as objective and incontestable, proving the fact that considerable sums of money had been credited to the account of the company controlled by the applicant.",

As far as the unpaid taxes were concerned, they also had exclusive competence to determine the amount ordered (that is, deduction of taxes and the social-security contribution). Furthermore, the assessment of the responsibility of the employer under fiscal law was not binding on a criminal court in assessing whether the employer was also guilty of illegally evading tax prepayment liability or of a tax offence under the threat of a fine or a tax prepayment offence. The consideration of charges and the imposition of tax sanctions were two different matters and were considered separately. In considering charges it was possible to arrive at a decision to drop or dismiss charges whereas determining tax penalties left considerably less leeway for discretion. Moreover, bringing the tax proceedings to an end before the completion of the pre-trial investigations or the consideration of charges would have unnecessarily prolonged the proceedings.",

The reasons for requesting a hearing in the case of Jussila therefore concerned in large part the validity of the tax assessment, which as such fell outside the scope of Article 6, although there was the additional question of whether the applicant\u2019s book-keeping had been so deficient as to justify a surcharge. The , which took the measure of inviting written observations from the tax inspector and a statement from an expert chosen by the applicant, found in the circumstances that an oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary as the information provided by the applicant himself formed a sufficient factual basis for the consideration of the case. For those reasons, the Court in the Jussila case found that the lack of an oral hearing did not give rise to a breach of Article 6.",
