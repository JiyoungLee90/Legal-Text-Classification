The case originated in an application against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Romanian nationals Mr Gheorghe Aştileanu (“the first applicant”), Mr Vasile Aştileanu (“the second applicant”), Mr Sandu Axente (“the third applicant”), Mr Vasile Aştileanu (“the fourth applicant”) and Mr Pavel Aştileanu (“the fifth applicant”) on the date indicated in the appended table.
The application was communicated to the Romanian Government (“the Government”).
The relevant details of the application are set out in the appended table.
The applicants complained of the excessive length of civil proceedings.
The Court received friendly-settlement declarations under which the first, second and third applicants agreed to waive any further claims against Romania in respect of the facts giving rise to the part of the application concerning their complaints, subject to an undertaking by the Government to pay them the amount detailed in the appended table. This amount will be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of payment, and will be payable within three months from the date of notification of the Court’s decision. In the event of failure to pay this amount within the above-mentioned three-month period, the Government undertake to pay simple interest on it, from the expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.
The payment will constitute the final resolution of this part of the application.
