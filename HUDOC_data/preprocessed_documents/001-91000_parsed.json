It reiterates that the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with the Convention, including the guarantees of Article 6. However, the actual manner in which it is used must not impair the very essence of a fair trial. In other words, the power to reopen criminal proceedings must be exercised by the authorities so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of the individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of criminal justice (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-61). In the specific context of supervisory review, the Convention requires that the authorities respect the binding nature of a final judicial decision and allow the resumption of criminal proceedings only if serious legitimate considerations outweigh the principle of legal certainty (see Bratyakin, cited above).",

The first round of the retrial was intended to amend the charges so as to prevent the applicant from being convicted of a more serious offence than the one he had been indicted for. The supervisory review was thus granted on the assumption that the defect of the previous proceedings would be rectified for the applicant\u2019s advantage only. The grounds for the second reopening were also valid and reasonable, namely, to rectify a violation of the applicant\u2019s procedural rights in the second set of proceedings. However, the Court considers that the system of reopening of criminal case by means of extraordinary remedy should not function on the assumption that the procedure remains open-ended with a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d always amenable to modifications and reversals, a situation which would run counter to the very principles of res judicata and legal certainty",

By not pursuing the superior court\u2019s instructions these judicial instances also encroached on the domestic statutory protection against reformatio in peius to which the applicant was entitled since the review was called for on the grounds of his interests.

However, the Government claimed that the second round of supervisory proceedings put matters right ensuring that the applicant was brought to justice without being deprived of the procedural guarantees prescribed by law. They contended that the second quashing effectively resolved the flagrant mistakes committed during the first round of retrial. However, in so far as they may be understood as claiming the loss of the victim status by the applicant after the second quashing, the Court reiterates that \u201ca decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a \u2018victim\u2019 unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention\u201d (see Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 44, ECHR 1999-VI). While the authorities in the present case indeed acknowledged a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights in the first set of re-trial, the Court considers that the second set of re-trial was insufficient by itself to eliminate the adverse effects of the quashed decisions, but that the notion of \u201credress\u201d required some form of tangible compensation. It notes that the applicant served six months in excess of his original prison sentence. In the absence of any submissions by the parties concerning the possible avenues provided for in the domestic law for claiming compensation in respect of these periods, the Court cannot but observe that, as matters stand, no compensation has been paid to the applicant for the violation of the applicant\u2019s right in the first trial. In such circumstances it concludes that the criminal proceedings against the applicant, taken as a whole, did not satisfy the requirements of a \u201cfair hearing\u201d guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention.",

This procedure obviously falls within the scope of Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7. However, the Court notes that, in addition, a system also existed which allowed the review of a case on the grounds of a judicial error concerning points of law and procedure (supervisory review, Articles\u00a0371-383 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The subject matter of such proceedings remained the same criminal charge and the validity of its previous determination. If the request was granted and the proceedings were resumed for further consideration, the ultimate effect of supervisory review would be to annul all decisions previously taken by courts and to determine the criminal charge in a new decision. To this extent, the effect of supervisory review is the same as reopening, because both constitute a form of continuation of the previous proceedings. The Court therefore concludes that for the purposes of the ne bis in idem principle supervisory review may be regarded as a special type of reopening falling within the scope of Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7.\u201d",

The latter judgment was subsequently quashed, also on the grounds of a serious procedural violation. As in the Nikitin case and other cases cited above, the subject matter of the new sets of proceedings consisted of the same criminal charge and the validity of its previous determination. Having regard to the above findings, the Court concludes that the supervisory review in the instant case constituted a reopening of the case owing to a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, within the meaning of Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7.
