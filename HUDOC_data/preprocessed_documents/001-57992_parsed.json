Switzerland judgment of 19 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, pp. 173-74, para. 32, and the Boughanemi v.  judgment of 24 April 1996, Reports 1996-II, pp. 607-08, para. 35). In the present case the mere fact that the applicant was imprisoned and subsequently deported or that his son was then taken in by Mr C.'s sister in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which borders on , do not constitute such circumstances. In addition, Mr C. established real social ties in . He lived there from the age of 11, went to school there, underwent vocational training there and worked there for a number of years.
