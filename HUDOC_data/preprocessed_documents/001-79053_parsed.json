Therefore the Court considered that it could not examine whether the first period was compatible with the Convention. However, it went on to say that, in the event of an applicant being convicted, the first period would normally be deducted from any term of imprisonment imposed; it would thus reduce the actual length of imprisonment which might be expected.
