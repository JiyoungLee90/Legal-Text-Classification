The Conseil constitutionnel considered that \"not to apply to offences committed at a time when the earlier law was in force new, less severe provisions amounts to allowing the courts to impose penalties prescribed by the earlier provisions when such penalties are, according to the view of the legislature itself, no longer necessary\".

As far as imposition of sanctions was concerned, under the law applicable at the material time the applicant should have been committed for trial in the Assize Court as the offence of which he was accused was classified as serious (crime) and he would therefore have risked a life sentence, in view of the aggravating circumstance of abuse of a position of authority.

According to the Court's case-law, Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention embodies generally the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty and prohibits in particular the retrospective application of the criminal law where it is to an accused's disadvantage (see the Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, p.\u00a022, para. 52).  ",

In the present case the Court, like the Commission, is of the opinion that the offences of which the applicant was accused fell within the scope of the former Articles 332 and 333 of the Criminal Code, which satisfied the requirements of foreseeability and accessibility (see, mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: M\u00fcller and Others v. Switzerland of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 20, para. 29, and Salabiaku v. France of 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141-A, pp. 16-17, para. 29).  There was consistent case-law from the Court of Cassation, which was published and therefore accessible, on the notions of violence and abuse of authority.  As regards the notion of violence, the new provisions in the new Articles 332 and 333 of the Criminal Code merely confirmed this case-law.  ",

On the basis of the principle that the more lenient law should apply both as regards the definition of the offence and the sanctions imposed, the national courts applied the new Article 333 of the Criminal Code for the imposition of sanctions as that provision downgraded the offence of which Mr G. was accused from serious offence (crime) to less serious offence (d\u00e9lit) (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above).  Its application, admittedly retrospective, therefore operated in the applicant's favour.  ",
