The situation in police detention facilities was described as giving rise to \u201cserious concerns\u201d because, in addition to overcrowding, the cells were located in police station basements, there was inadequate ventilation and access to natural light and the opportunities for out-of-cell activities were very limited. The Committee of Ministers stated that significant additional measures were still required to ensure that police detention facilities afforded conditions that were fully compatible with the requirements deriving from Article 3 of the Convention. The authorities were encouraged to transfer everyone detained on remand to prisons. The overcrowding in the vast majority of Romanian prisons was said to give rise to \u201cserious concerns\u201d.",

Regarding police detention facilities, the memorandum concluded that, as well as being overcrowded, a number of such facilities were structurally unsuitable for longer-term detention. In addition to the severe overcrowding and the shortage of individual beds, the cells were located in police station basements and there was inadequate ventilation and access to natural light. The Romanian authorities were encouraged to provide appropriate living conditions in the cells, to review the system of pre-trial detention on police premises and to ensure that remand prisoners were not held in such facilities for extended periods and were transferred promptly to prisons. The measures introduced in the new Code of Criminal Procedure to reduce prison overcrowding in particular (house arrest, judicial supervision, suspension of sentence and discharge) did not appear likely to contribute to a significant reduction in the prison population. According to the conclusions of the memorandum, Romanian prisons were still severely overcrowded and the material conditions were precarious. The recommendations issued to the Romanian authorities included diversifying the range of alternative measures to imprisonment, relaxing the conditions of access to conditional release, ensuring the proper functioning of the probation service and continuing with plans to modernise the prison estate.",

The report (CPT/Inf (2015) 31) produced following the visit was published on 28 September 2015. With regard to the police detention facilities, the CPT observed that many detainees were still being held there for prolonged periods, even though the facilities were not suitable for such lengthy stays. The CPT recommended that the Romanian authorities ensure that detainees were no longer held for lengthy periods in police facilities and were instead detained in prisons. The conditions in most of the police detention facilities visited, with two exceptions (Oradea and Arad), were similar to those observed in 2010 (overcrowding, dilapidation, lack of hygiene, and insufficient natural light and ventilation). Turning to the detention conditions in the prisons, the CPT noted that overcrowding remained a significant problem and recommended that the Romanian authorities redouble their efforts to develop a penal policy placing emphasis on non-custodial measures. The material conditions at Arad Prison \u2013 which had been renovated between 1998 and 2010 \u2013 were generally satisfactory, apart from the dilapidated state of certain cells, decrepit walls, damage to beds and wardrobes and problems of vermin infestation. At Oradea Prison, built in the nineteenth century, there were run-down buildings, with overcrowded cells where the walls and ceilings were exposed to water seepage, and in some cases with no artificial lighting or access to natural light, and furniture and mattresses in a poor condition. At T\u00e2rg\u015for Prison there were also overcrowded and poorly ventilated cells, with triple bunkbeds, limited access to natural light and seriously inadequate artificial lighting. As far as sanitary facilities and hygiene were concerned, the CPT noted that the toilets and washbasins in several cells were dilapidated and that there were shower heads missing (Arad and Oradea); and that the toilets were unfit for use and detainees were not supplied with enough soap, detergent and sanitary towels (T\u00e2rg\u015for). The CPT delegation had received a large number of complaints about the quantity and quality of food. Despite the efforts made at three prisons to offer prisoners work and/or social and educational activities, the vast majority of the prison population did not take part in such activities.",

Courts should not deprive a person of his/her liberty simply because it is provided by law and is carried out in a lawful manner, but also because it is reasonable and necessary in all circumstances (evaluated on a case-by-case basis).

They submitted that, as far as pre-trial detention was concerned, the NCC provided for alternative measures (house arrest, judicial supervision on bail) and that, with regard to post-conviction detention, the statutory maximum sentence for certain offences had been reduced and fines had replaced prison sentences (for example, for property-related offences). They also referred to Article 64 of the NCC (replacement of a fine by community service), Article 80 of the NCC (some 49,000 individuals had had the imposition of a sentence waived in 2014) and Article 83 of the NCC (suspension of a sentence). Law no. 213/2013 had contributed to reducing the prison population and would continue to do so. Thus, between 2013 and 2014 there had been a decline in the number of people placed in pre-trial detention (by 31.75%), the number of people admitted to prison (by 20%) and the total number of individuals committed for trial. A significant decline in the number of accused persons standing trial for property-related offences had been recorded in 2014 in relation to the period from 2011 to 2013. An increasing number of prisoners had been released on parole between 2013 and 2014. The probation system was becoming increasingly effective and now included 26,749 people in its records.

Detainees who did not have 4 sq. m of living space were transferred to other detention facilities. At ANP level, the monitoring of detainees in prisons had alleviated the effects of overcrowding. The ANP\u2019s budget had increased by EUR 225,000 in 2015. Since March 2015, following a decision by the director of the ANP, female prisoners and anyone detained in educational facilities had been given permanent access to hot water.",

The remedy consisted in applying to the post-sentencing judge, who ordered the prisons concerned to provide detainees with the minimum accommodation standards as laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law. With a view to executing the relevant judgments, the ANP had recommended that the prisons transfer certain prisoners to other cells or other prisons. The Government submitted twenty-two examples of domestic decisions, including nineteen in which different prisons had been ordered to guarantee prisoners 4 sq. m of living space, and three in which prisons had been required to take particular action: repairing furniture in an applicant\u2019s cell, repainting bathroom walls and complying with hygiene standards. With regard to the compensatory remedy, the Government submitted that a liability claim in tort as provided for by the Civil Code (see paragraph 36 above) could be brought by applicants wishing to seek redress for damage resulting from material conditions breaching Article 3 of the Convention. In that connection, they submitted a copy of a domestic decision in which the authorities had been ordered to pay compensation to a prisoner on account of the inappropriate medical treatment and diet he had received during his detention. Two other decisions had ordered Jilava Prison to pay compensation to two prisoners for their lack of access to hot water for two months and four months. A final example of a domestic decision concerned an award of compensation to a prisoner who had been forced to share a police cell with two smokers and who had not had permanent access to a toilet.",

The Government were conscious, however, that there were still gaps to be filled before the existing system complied with Convention standards on detention conditions. The authorities had made efforts to tackle overcrowding, and were continuing and stepping up their modernisation and investment plans. A new memorandum, adopted on 19 January 2016, had stressed the need to consolidate the probation system (in particular by increasing the number of probation officers), improve detention conditions and develop alternative measures. Accordingly, an investment plan involving a total of EUR 838.45 million, to be shared between the ANP, the National Probation Service and the Ministry of the Interior, had been envisaged for 2016-2023. By the end of 2023, 10,895 new places for detainees would be created, 1,651 places would be modernised and 5,847 staff would be recruited by the ANP. By 2018, 626 probation officers and 171 administrative assistants would be recruited to the National Probation Service. Between 2018 and 2020, 1,769 new places for detainees would be created in police detention facilities.

In that connection he cited the pilot judgment in Ananyev and Others v. Russia (nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, 10 January 2012). With regard to overcrowding, he referred to the statistics published by the ANP indicating that in October 2015 the prison occupancy rate in Romania had been 150.68%, with a prison population of 28,383 detainees occupying 18,336 places. The ANP had also noted that in some prisons, detainees were obliged to share beds, for example in Ploie\u0219ti Prison, which the Association for the Defence of Human Rights in Romania \u2013 Helsinki Committee (APADOR-CH) had visited in 2012, finding that there were twenty-four beds between thirty-one detainees. The situation was similar in police detention facilities (he cited the case of the facilities in Ia\u0219i, which APADOR-CH had visited in 2014, finding that three detainees were sharing a cell measuring 6.21 sq.\u00a0m). With regard to material conditions of detention, the third applicant referred to the Court\u2019s findings concerning the lack of hygiene, inadequate number and poor working order of toilets and sinks, limited access to showers, presence of cockroaches, rats and lice, worn-out mattresses and bed linen and poor-quality food (he referred to Iacov Stanciu, cited above, \u00a7 175). Reports on more recent visits by APADOR-CH confirmed the presence of cockroaches and mould, the failure at certain prisons to ensure that the toilets complied with hygiene standards, and the lack of toilets in police detention facilities. With regard to access to health care, the third applicant stated that the acute shortage of medical staff in prisons was confirmed by official statistics published by the ANP (out of the 1,147 posts that had been approved, only 730 were occupied). This, in his submission, resulted in a very heavy workload for prison doctors and a lowering of the quality of medical treatment. In addition, there were insufficient funds, a factor that had a direct influence on the medical treatment provided to prisoners. Lastly, the third applicant asked the Court not to suspend the processing of similar cases pending before it, in order to avoid exacerbating the damage sustained by victims.",

The Committee of Ministers found that additional measures were needed in order to set up an adequate and effective system of remedies (see paragraph 47 above). The reality of the situation is also confirmed by the latest CPT reports, emphasising the significance of the problem of overcrowding in Romanian custodial facilities. The same reports note that police detention facilities are inappropriate for prolonged periods of detention as they are generally overcrowded, have no direct access to a toilet and are poorly ventilated and unhygienic. The CPT has also found that overcrowding is a persistent problem in Romanian prisons, at some of which it has noted a lack of hygiene, insufficient lighting and ventilation, sanitary facilities not in working order, inadequate food and insufficient sociocultural activities (see paragraphs 52-54 above). All these findings are also borne out by the recommendations of the People\u2019s Advocate, who, after visiting certain prisons, called on the prison authorities to put an end to overcrowding, poor hygiene conditions, the lack of a canteen, the presence of rats, mice and bedbugs and the lack of partitions for toilets, and also urged them to provide drinking water and sufficient furniture and to allow access to working showers (see paragraphs 39-40 above).",

The Court also notes that it has already found that these facilities are intended to house detainees for only very short periods (see, for example, Horshill\u00a0v.\u00a0Greece, no. 70427/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-53, 1 August 2013; Chkhartishvili v.

The Court notes that the reform implemented by the Government has resulted in some reduction in the number of pre-trial detainees (see paragraph\u00a092\u00a0above). It welcomes the steps taken and encourages the Romanian State both to ensure that this reform is pursued and also to explore the possibility of facilitating more widespread use of alternatives to pre-trial detention (see paragraphs 42 and 92 above).",

Although this reform has not had a significant effect on overcrowding levels, which remain fairly high (see paragraph 37 above), such measures, coupled with a more diverse range of alternatives to imprisonment (see paragraphs\u00a046 and 57 above), could have a positive impact in reducing the prison population. Other possible options, such as relaxing the conditions for waiving the imposition of a sentence, suspending sentences (see paragraph 32 above), and above all expanding the possibility of access to parole (see paragraphs 31 and 42 above) and ensuring the effective operation of the probation service (see paragraph 97 above), could be sources of inspiration for the respondent Government with a view to resolving the problem of the growing prison population and inadequate material conditions of detention.",

However, it notes that in Romanian law, the system of liability in tort is based on personal liability and therefore requires fault on the part of the person who caused the damage (see paragraph 36 above). The Court would emphasise that in the case of poor detention conditions, the burden of proof, which rests with the individual, must not be excessive. Moreover, it reiterates that substandard conditions of detention are not necessarily due to problems within the prison administration as such, but usually have more complex causes, such as problems in penal policy (see Iacov Stanciu,\u00a0cited above, \u00a7 199). Even where it provides for the possibility of compensation, a remedy may not offer reasonable prospects of success, for example if the award is conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities (see Ananyev\u00a0and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0113; Roman Karasev v.

Furthermore, under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, the States Parties have undertaken to hold elections under conditions ensuring the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. The implementation of this Article presupposes the establishment of a parliament with legislative power and the ability to make policy choices expressed through legislation. It is not for the Court to interfere in the political sphere, which falls within the exclusive competence of national parliaments and governments. Hence the choice of penal policies is a matter for national parliaments. They may, in principle, opt either for a more repressive policy, requiring a greater number of prison places, or for a more lenient policy, requiring a lower number of places in custodial facilities.",

Moreover, even the least punitive penal policies will necessarily lead to overcrowding in prisons if the number of prison places remains insufficient in relation to the needs resulting from a particular crime level. In general, a rational penal policy must above all, as far as possible, be tailored to the nature and extent of crime rather than to prison capacity, although the question of the optimum allocation of the available resources is an important factor which must inevitably be taken into account.",
