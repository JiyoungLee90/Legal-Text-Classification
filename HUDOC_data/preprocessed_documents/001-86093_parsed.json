He relied extensively on Al-Nashif (cited above) and Berrehab v. the Netherlands (judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 138), and asserted that the existing legal framework did not provide sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness. Moreover, the lower court had not examined the proportionality of the interference, contrary to the approach of the European Court of Human Rights in all cases under Article 8 of the Convention.

The law must moreover afford a degree of legal protection against arbitrary interference by the authorities. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, so as to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, among many other authorities, Malone v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 August 1984, Series A no. 82, pp. 3133, \u00a7\u00a7 6668).",

In particular, the requirement of \u201cforeseeability\u201d of the law does not go so far as to compel States to enact legal provisions listing in detail all conduct that may prompt a decision to expel an individual on national security grounds. By the nature of things, threats to national security may vary in character and may be unanticipated or difficult to define in advance. However, even where national security is at stake, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that deportation measures affecting fundamental human rights be subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent authority or a court competent to effectively scrutinise the reasons for them and review the relevant evidence, if need be with appropriate procedural limitations on the use of classified information. The individual must be able to challenge the executive\u2019s assertion that national security is at stake. While the executive\u2019s assessment of what poses a threat to national security will naturally be of significant weight, the independent authority or court must be able to react in cases where the invocation of this concept has no reasonable basis in the facts or reveals an interpretation of \u201cnational security\u201d that is unlawful or contrary to common sense and arbitrary (see AlNashif, \u00a7\u00a7 11924, and Lupsa, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 34, both cited above).",

It is true that the notion of \u201cnational security\u201d is not capable of being comprehensively defined (see Esbester v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 18601/91, Commission decision of 2 April 1993, unreported; Hewitt and Harman v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a020317/92, Commission decision of 1 September 1993, unreported; and Christie v. the United Kingdom, no. 21482/93, Commission decision of 27\u00a0June 1994, DR 78A, p. 119, at p. 134).

On appeal, the Supreme Administrative Court did not gather evidence either and confined its reasoning on this point to the following brief statement: \u201cIt has been established ... that [the first applicant] has acted as an intermediary for the supply of narcotics and maintains regular contacts with Bulgarian citizens who distribute narcotics and intoxicating substances...\u201d It did not elaborate on the evidentiary basis for making such a finding and did not deal with the first applicant\u2019s detailed submissions that he had not in fact been involved in such activities (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above).

However, these limitations can by no means justify doing away with remedies altogether whenever the executive has chosen to invoke the term \u201cnational security\u201d. Even where an allegation of a threat to national security has been made, the guarantee of an effective remedy requires as a minimum that the competent appeals authority be informed of the reasons grounding the expulsion decision, even if such reasons are not publicly available. The authority must be competent to reject the executive\u2019s assertion that there is a threat to national security where it finds it arbitrary or unreasonable. There must be some form of adversarial proceedings, if need be through a special representative following security clearance. Furthermore, the question whether the impugned measure would interfere with the individual\u2019s right to respect for his or her family life and, if so, whether a fair balance has been struck between the public interest involved and the individual\u2019s rights must be examined (ibid., \u00a7 137, with a further reference to Chahal, cited above).",
