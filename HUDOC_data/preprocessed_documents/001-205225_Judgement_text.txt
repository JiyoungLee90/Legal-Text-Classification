The present case concerns lawfulness of imposition of an administrative fine on the applicant for violation of customs regulations and raises issues under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Kajaran. The applicant was represented by Ms M. Ghulyan and Mr A. Karakhanyan, lawyers practising in Yerevan.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Kostanyan, and subsequently by Mr Y. Kirakosyan, Representative of the Republic of Armenia to the European Court of Human Rights.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 20 September 2005 a company called ZPMK (“the Company”), which was the applicant’s employer, purchased technical equipment in the Russian Federation.
On 21, 24 and 26 October 2006 the equipment was imported into Armenia.
On 30 October 2006 the applicant, acting on behalf of the Company, filed a customs declaration with the State Customs Service (“the Customs Service”) for the imported technical equipment.
On an unspecified date the head of the Customs Service ordered a review of the lawfulness of the imports performed by the Company since 2006.
On 30 July 2008 officers of the Customs Oversight Department of the State Revenue Committee (“the Revenue Committee”), following the review, produced a statement, which revealed that the Company, on a number of occasions, had indicated inaccurate classifications and incorrect codes in respect of the imported goods. As regards the customs declaration of 30 October 2006, it was stated in the statement that the declared price of the imported equipment was 194,823 US dollars (USD), whereas the actual price of that equipment was USD 1,461,176.
On 16 October 2008 the officers of the Customs Oversight Department of the Revenue Committee transmitted the results of their review to the Investigative Department of the Revenue Committee, for further action.
On 17 October 2008 an officer of the Investigative Department of the Revenue Committee initiated administrative proceedings in respect of the applicant by drawing up a record of a breach of customs regulations, in which it was stated that on 30 October 2006 the applicant, acting on behalf of the Company, had declared the price of the imported equipment inaccurately. The applicant’s actions therefore appeared to amount to a breach of Article 203 of the Customs Code (“the CC”).
On 27 October 2008 the head of the Investigative Department of the Revenue Committee, with reference to the results of the review carried out by the officers of the Customs Oversight Department and the administrative proceedings initiated in respect of the applicant, held that the applicant, having inaccurately declared the price of imported goods, had committed an administrative offence under Article 203 of the CC and decided to fine the applicant in the amount equivalent to the value of the inaccurately declared equipment, that is to say 579,506,236.48 Armenian drams (AMD).
On 27 December 2008 the applicant lodged a claim with the Administrative Court, seeking partial invalidation of the decision of 27 October 2008. The applicant submitted that the contested decision had been unlawful as it had been adopted in breach of the two-month prescription period set down in Article 37 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”). He argued that the review conducted by the Revenue Committee on 30 July 2008 had already revealed all the elements of a breach of customs regulations, and the deadline for imposing a fine for this breach had therefore expired on 30 September 2008. In such circumstances, the applicant argued, Article 247 of the CAO barred the Revenue Committee from initiating proceedings against him, while any pending proceedings should be terminated.
On 19 January 2009 the Revenue Committee, in its turn, lodged a claim with the Administrative Court against the applicant, seeking enforcement of the decision of 27 October 2008 and payment of the fine.
On 28 August 2009 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s claim and allowed that of the Revenue Committee, finding that the applicant, as a representative of the Company, had violated Article 203 of the CC and ordering him to pay the fine imposed by the Revenue Committee, namely AMD 579,506,236.48. As regards the two-month prescription period set down in Article 37 of the CAO, the Administrative Court held as follows:
“... [T]he court concludes that the fact that the [the applicant] had breached customs regulations was discovered and became clear only on the basis of the record of a breach of customs regulations drawn up on 17 October 2008 by [the investigator of the Investigative Department of the Revenue Committee], which recorded the fact of [the applicant’s] committing the offence. The relevant administrative fine was imposed on [the applicant] within two months of the date of discovery of the offence, namely on 27 October 2008.”
On 28 September 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation, which was the only appeal instance on those matters, where he raised arguments similar to those in his initial claim.
On 4 November 2009 the Court of Cassation declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible for lack of merit.
Pursuant to the bailiff’s order of 27 June 2011 issued for the purpose of enforcement of the judgment of 28 August 2009, the applicant’s employer withheld 50% of his monthly salary from June 2011 to April 2012, amounting to a total of AMD 2,159,000.
On 18 October 2011 the bailiff seized and ordered a valuation of two flats belonging to the applicant for the purpose of enforcement of the judgment of 28 August 2009. The flats were valued at AMD 3,208,000 and AMD 3,713,000 respectively.
On an unspecified date the bailiff sold the flats at a public auction for AMD 689,527 and AMD 214,334 respectively.
On 9 June 2017 the bailiff seized and ordered a valuation of a third flat, which the applicant owned jointly with his family members, his share amounting to one fifth of the common property. The flat in question was valued at AMD 8,300,000.
On an unspecified date the bailiff sold the flat at a public auction for AMD 2,220,600. The applicant’s share, amounting to AMD 422,971, was used for payment of his judgment debt, while the remaining amount was given to his family members.
Article 37 provides that an administrative penalty for a breach of customs regulations may be imposed within two months of the date on which the offence was discovered, but not later than three years after the date on which the offence was committed.
Article 247 provides that proceedings in respect of an administrative offence may not be initiated − and those that have already been initiated must be terminated – if, inter alia, the time-limit prescribed by Article 37 has expired at the time of examination of the case concerning the administrative offence.
Article 203 provides that failure to declare goods and means of transport crossing the customs borders of Armenia, that is to say failure to declare accurate information in an established format regarding those goods and means of transport, or declaring them under a wrong name, in the absence of appearance of a criminal offence, is punishable by a fine in the amount of the customs value of those goods and means of transport.
Article 207 lists, among the grounds for initiating proceedings concerning a breach of customs regulations, the discovery of a breach of customs regulations by customs officials when performing their duties.
Article 209 provides that the proceedings concerning a breach of customs regulations start with the drawing up of a record of a breach of customs regulations.
The business run by one of the two applicants in this case was subjected to a customs inspection ordered by the head of the Revenue Committee and it was revealed that a number of goods had been imported by that business under an inaccurate classification and with incorrect codes indicated, which was recorded in an inspection report produced on 18 October 2008. On 22 October 2008 a record of a breach of customs regulations was drawn up by an officer of the Revenue Committee, alleging that Article 203 of the CC had been breached. As a result of those administrative proceedings, on 28 November 2008 a fine was imposed on one of the applicants by the Revenue Committee for a breach of that Article. In its decision, the Court of Cassation found, inter alia, that the fine had been imposed in compliance with the two-month prescription period set out in Article 37 of the CAO, since the offence had been discovered on 18 October 2008, whereas the fine had been imposed on 28 November 2008.
