There was no ventilation system and the air was impregnated with a sewage smell and with cigarette smoke; there was no sufficient natural light because the windows were very small; the daily walks lasted for only one hour and the food served was of a very bad quality.

The Government adduced no evidence in support of their submission that considerable improvements in Prison no. 13 had taken place during recent years. In such circumstances, the Court considers that there are no reasons to depart from the conclusions reached in its previous judgments (see, among recent authorities, Hadji v.\u00a0Moldova, nos. 32844/07 and 41378/07, \u00a7 20, 14\u00a0February 2012; Silvestru v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 28173/10, 13 January 2015; Pisaroglu v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 21061/11, 3 March 2015).
