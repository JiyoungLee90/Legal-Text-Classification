If the basic underlying concept of public scrutability is to be a reality, a restricted access to judgments such as existed in the present case, i.e. restricted only to persons who could establish an interest to the satisfaction of a court official, falls short of what is required by that provision of the Convention. Public knowledge of court decisions cannot be secured by confining that knowledge to a limited class of persons.",

I think that the publicity requirement contained in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) should be understood in a different way.",

The object and purpose of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) are to guarantee a fair hearing, inter alia, through the public character of the hearing and the public pronouncement of the judgment at least in the first instance, and probably also in appeal proceedings if the facts and the law can be reviewed at that stage. However, the situation is different in cassation proceedings if the only issue is whether the lower court has correctly interpreted the law. It seems to me to be possible and necessary to give the publicity requirement in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) a restrictive interpretation in this respect, taking into account the fact that publicity is, as far as Article 6 (art. 6) is concerned, not an end in itself but a means of protecting the right of the individual.",

Nevertheless, it is also true that in many countries public hearings are obligatory and held in cassation proceedings only if exceptional circumstances are involved, but not in normal cases in which solely questions of law are discussed. Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) can and should be interpreted restrictively, in conformity with this long-standing practice.",
