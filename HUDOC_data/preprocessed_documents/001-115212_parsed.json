The Court acknowledges that the relevant events happened in a period of social and economic transition in Bulgaria and that the authorities needed to take into account the claims of numerous interested parties (see Lyubomir Popov, cited above, \u00a7 122, with further references). However, in the absence of any specific justifications for the delays in issue, the Court cannot but accept that the delays were unreasonable and placed an excessive burden on the applicant (ibid., and Ramadhi and Others v. , no. 38222/02, \u00a7 83, 13 November 2007).",

The remedy must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see Rotaru v.  [GC], no. 28341/95, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2000V).",

The Court reiterates that a claim for damages may sometimes be deemed a sufficient remedy, in particular where compensation is the only means of redressing the wrong suffered. However, it could not be an alternative to the measures which the authorities should have afforded the applicant in order to comply with a final judgment in his favour (see Naydenov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051, with further references). It follows that a compensatory remedy could be regarded as capable of providing redress only after the authorities have taken all reasonable measures to comply with their obligations under the Convention (ibid.). In the present case, the authorities completed the restitution procedure in early 2007 (see paragraph 19 above). It follows that a compensation claim could in principle be an effective remedy in respect of the delays which had occurred in the applicant\u2019s case (see Naydenov, cited above, \u00a7 53). However, the Court notes that in Naydenov it already rejected the Government\u2019s argument that an action under the SMRDA would be an effective remedy in cases of delayed restitution procedures, finding that the Government had failed to show that there was sufficient case-law of domestic courts on such claims (see \u00a7 56 of that judgment). The Court observes that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it that there had been any domestic developments in that respect (see also Vasilev and Doycheva, cited above, \u00a7 29). Furthermore, it notes that one of the prerequisites for a successful claim under the SMRDA is the establishment of the unlawfulness of the act causing the damage (see paragraph 24 above). However, the domestic courts dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeals against the refusals of the authorities to issue a plan, finding them lawful under the national law (see paragraphs\u00a01617 above). Moreover, the Court is of the view that the applicant, who could not have known when the requisite plan would be issued, cannot have been expected to periodically bring claims for damages in order to obtain redress for the delays. Had he been required to do so, this might have erected a permanent barrier to bringing matters before the Court (see Lyubomir Popov, cited above, \u00a7 105). In the specific circumstances of the case, therefore, a claim under the SMRDA did not represent an effective remedy which the applicant should have used.",
