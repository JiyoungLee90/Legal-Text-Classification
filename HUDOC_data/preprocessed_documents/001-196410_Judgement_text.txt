The case originated in four applications (nos. 40442/07, 6327/09, 21248/09 and 56679/11) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Russian nationals. The application numbers, the dates of lodging the applications and the dates of their communication, the applicants’ names, their personal details and the names of their legal representatives, where applicable, as well as the information concerning the relevant domestic judgments, are set out in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin and then by Mr M. Galperin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants each alleged that they had been convicted of criminal offences following entrapment by the police in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
Mr Manelyuk (application 40442/07) also complained under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention about his detention on remand and under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (a), (b), (c) of the Convention about the alleged unfairness of the supervisory review proceedings in his case.
Mr Konoplenko (application no. 6327/09) also complained under Article 5 § 1 (c) that his detention on remand had been unlawful and impermissibly long, in breach of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. On 7 July 2015 the remainder of Mr Konoplenko’s application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government were informed by a letter of 1 July 2019 that the cases of Mr Manelyuk and Mr Konoplenko had been assigned to a Committee.
The applicants were each targeted in undercover operations conducted by the police in the form of an operative experiment under sections 7 and 8 of the Operational-Search Activities Act of 12 August 1995 (no. 144-FZ). Those operations led to their criminal convictions for drug-dealing (applications 40442/07, 6327/09 and 56679/11) and bribe-taking (application 21248/09).
The applicants disagreed with their convictions and argued that the police had incited them to commit criminal offences.
The relevant domestic law governing the use of undercover operations at the material time is summed up in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Lagutin and Others v. Russia (nos. 6228/09, 19123/09, 19678/07, 52340/08 and 7451/09, 24 April 2014); Veselov and Others v. Russia (nos. 23200/10, 24009/07 and 556/10, 2 October 2012); Bannikova v. Russia (no. 18757/06, 14 October 2010); Vanyan v. Russia (no. 53203/99, 15 December 2005); and Khudobin v. Russia (no. 59696/00, ECHR 2006‑XII (extracts)).
For relevant provisions concerning review of final judgments and reopening of criminal proceedings in Russia, see Kumitskiy and Others v. Russia, nos. 66215/12 and 4 others, §§ 6-11, 10 July 2018).
In 2016 the Russian Supreme Court published an extensive report summarising the legal positions of the European Court of Human Rights in cases where a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention has been found in view of the applicants’ conviction as a result of the police entrapment. It has since issued a number of similar interpretative summaries of the Court’s case-law on this subject. In addition, relying on Article 415 § 5 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, the Presidium of the Russian Supreme Court has regularly authorised the reopening of criminal proceedings in view of the fact that the European Court of Human Rights found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention following the Russian courts’ failure to effectively conduct the review of the defendants’ arguments that the criminal offence had been committed as a result of the police entrapment (see for example the Presidium’s decision no. 28-P17 issued on 12 April 2017 in response to the Court’s decision in the case of Ulyanov and Others v. Russia, nos. 22486/05 and 10 others, 9 February 2016).
