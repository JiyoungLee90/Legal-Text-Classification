On the one hand, as indicated above, the majority point to the fact that the law made it possible for the Sisak County Court to uphold the sale of the applicant\u2019s house for HRK 70,000, about one and a half years after it had found that a sale for HRK 50,000 did not sufficiently respect the applicant\u2019s dignity and was too onerous for him (see paragraph 67 of the judgment).

It therefore concluded that by accepting the offer the first-instance court had breached section 6 of the Enforcement Act, and that the sale in question did not achieve the purpose of the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 14 of the judgment). When it examined on 20 December 2010 the outcome of the new third auction (of 12 May 2009), the situation was very different: not only had the applicant\u2019s house been sold for a higher amount (HRK 70,000), but also, and more importantly, the purpose of enforcement had been achieved because the creditors\u2019 claim had been settled in full, following the latter\u2019s declaration to that effect (see paragraphs 15 and 17 of the judgment).

When he did not come forward, the creditors applied for enforcement of the judgment rendered in their favour, and a writ of execution was issued. In the ensuing enforcement proceedings several attempts between 2005 and 2008 to sell the house were unsuccessful. The house was eventually sold in 2009 for the amount of HRK 70,000.",

However, this percentage is to be compared to the percentages obtained in the cases that have come before the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, cited in paragraphs 33-40 of the judgment. In the cases where judgments of enforcement courts were quashed, the property had been sold for a symbolic price of HRK 1, or for an amount that was respectively 5.5%, 2.57%, 2.43% and 1.15% of the estimated value of the property. The amount in the present case was thus substantially higher than in the cited cases. Moreover, the value of the sale in the present case was sufficient to prompt the creditors to declare their claim to be settled in full and thus to release the applicant from his obligations. Contrary to the situations in the above-mentioned cases, the purpose of enforcement was therefore achieved by the settlement of the creditors\u2019 claim.",

                        "content": "Third, and in line with the foregoing, we want to emphasise that, since the purpose of enforcement proceedings is the settlement of the creditors\u2019 claim, an additional comparison can be made to assess the relative value of the price obtained: under Croatian law, the theoretical value of the house to be sold is assessed by an independent expert and the outcome of the sale is compared with this value (here: HRK 384,197 to HRK 70,000). In the present case, the owner\u2019s debt was alleviated not merely by HRK 70,000, but by an additional HRK 37,974 (the part of the claim abandoned by the creditors), making a total of HRK 107,974. The sale thus reduced his liabilities by HRK 107,974. The ratio of HRK 107,974 to HRK 384,197 amounts to 28.10%. This is the real advantage the applicant received from the sale of his house as his entire debt was subsequently declared settled. This percentage is very close to the minimum of one-third set as the lowest limit at a public auction in some of the later amendments to section 97(4) of the Enforcement Act (see paragraph 68 of the judgment). It is at any rate, in our opinion, too high for the Court to step in and to declare that the outcome in the proceedings was arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable.",

In the light of the foregoing, we therefore conclude that the domestic courts\u2019 decision to sell the applicant\u2019s house cannot be considered arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. Contrary to the majority, we are therefore of the opinion that the impugned judgment of the Croatian enforcement court did not constitute an unlawful interference with the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.",
