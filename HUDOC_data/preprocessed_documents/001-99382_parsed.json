In their view, at no time had the applicant been detained pending trial in the absence of a court order. All the court orders authorising the applicant's detention had been issued by a competent judicial body and had been subject to review by an appeal court. The applicant had attended all the court hearings. As regards the lawfulness of the applicant's detention from 23\u00a0September to 1\u00a0December 2005, the Government submitted that it had been covered by a court order issued on 28\u00a0July 2005 when the District Court had ruled that the restrictive measure imposed earlier on the applicant should remain unchanged. They suggested that even though the decision of 28\u00a0July 2005, had not referred to a time-limit for the applicant's detention, it should be interpreted, by virtue of the applicable rules of criminal procedure, as authorising the extension of the applicant's detention pending trial for another six months. They referred, in particular, to Article\u00a0255 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure which indicated that a defendant's detention pending trial should not exceed six months and could be further repeatedly extended for no longer than three months in respect of defendants charged with serious and particularly serious criminal offences. In sum, the Government considered that, in the applicant's case, on 28\u00a0July 2005 his detention pending trial had been extended until 6\u00a0January 2006. In line with the rules of criminal procedure, the trial court had carried out a new review of the issue of the applicant's detention on 1\u00a0December 2005, that is, before the expiration of that sixmonth period, and lawfully authorised his further detention until 12\u00a0April 2006.",

Germany, 27\u00a0June 1968, \u00a7\u00a09, Series A no. 7, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0145 and\u00a0147, ECHR\u00a02000-IV). In view of the essential link between Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention and paragraph 1 (c) of that Article, a person convicted at first instance cannot be regarded as being detained \u201cfor the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence\u201d, but is in the position provided for by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), which authorises deprivation of liberty \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d (see Panchenko v. Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7\u00a7 91 and 93, 8\u00a0February 2005, with further references). Accordingly, the applicant's detention from 22\u00a0April 2004, the date of his original first-instance conviction, to 22\u00a0June 2005, the date on which that conviction was quashed by way of supervisory review and his case remitted for a new trial, cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3. Accordingly, the period to be taken into consideration comprised two terms, the first lasting from 2 January 2002 to 22\u00a0April 2004 and the second from 22\u00a0June 2005 to 21\u00a0August 2006, and amounted in total to over three years and five and a half months (see, among other authorities, Solmaz v. Turkey, no.\u00a027561/02, \u00a7\u00a7 34-37, 16\u00a0January 2007).",

In this connection the Court reiterates that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Panchenko, cited above \u00a7 102; Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081; and Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 51). This is particularly true in the Russian legal system where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no.\u00a06847/02, \u00a7\u00a0180, 8\u00a0November 2005). In the instant case, beyond a reference to the applicant's character and past criminal record in one decision (see paragraph 9), the domestic authorities did not mention any concrete facts corroborating the detention orders.",

In that context, the Court would emphasise that under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 the authorities are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at trial when deciding whether a person should be released or detained. Indeed, the provision proclaims not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\u201d but also lays down that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 183; Dolgova v. Russia, no.\u00a011886/05, \u00a7\u00a047, 2 March 2006). In the Court's view, the authorities should either have considered having recourse to such alternative measures or at minimum explained in their decisions why such alternatives would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course. This failure is made all the more inexplicable by the fact that after 1 July 2002 the Code of Criminal Procedure expressly requires the domestic courts to consider less restrictive \u201cpreventive measures\u201d as an alternative to custody (see paragraph 27).",

The Court reiterates that this approach is incompatible, in itself, with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03 since it has permitted the continued detention of a group of persons without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention or compliance with the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement in respect of each individual member of the group (see Khudoyorov, \u00a7 186; and Dolgova, \u00a7 49, both cited above).",
