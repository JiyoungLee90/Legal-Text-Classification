The essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities. The Court reiterates that it is an interference of a very serious order to split up a family. The Court recognises that, in reaching decisions in so sensitive an area, local authorities are faced with a task that is extremely difficult. To require them to follow on each occasion an inflexible procedure would only add to their problems. They must therefore be allowed a measure of discretion in this respect. On the other hand, predominant in any consideration of this aspect of the present case must be the fact that the decisions may well prove to be irreversible as in a case where a child has been taken away from his parents and freed for adoption. This is accordingly a domain in which there is an even greater call than usual for protection against arbitrary interferences (see B. v. the United Kingdom, 8\u00a0July 1987, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0121, \u00a7 63; X v.

The decision-making process must therefore, in the Court\u2019s view, be such as to ensure that their views and interests are made known to, and duly considered by, the local authority and that they are able to exercise in due time any remedies available to them. In the Court\u2019s view, what therefore has to be determined is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and notably the serious nature of the decisions to be taken, the parents have been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide them with the requisite protection of their interests. If they have not, there will have been a failure to respect their family life and the interference resulting from the decision will not be capable of being regarded as necessary within the meaning of Article 8 (see B. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 64; and X v.

Thus, it is provided that a parent is to be divested of parental rights if he or she abuses or seriously infringes parental responsibility, obligations and rights. The grounds for such a measure are listed in section 114(2) of the Family Act. Procedures to be followed are also envisaged by that Act. The interests of a child are protected by appointment of a special guardian in these proceedings (section 114(6) of the Family Act). The courts conducting any proceedings under the Family Act are obliged to ensure that the interests of persons suffering from mental ailments or of persons who, for other reasons, are not able to protect their rights and interests, are adequately protected (section 267 of the Family Act). The Court is thus satisfied that the Croatian legislation provides for adequate safeguards as regards the interests of parents and their children in the proceedings for divesting the parents of parental rights.",
