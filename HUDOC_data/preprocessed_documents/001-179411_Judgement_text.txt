The case originated in an application (no. 24536/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr İsmail Dik (“the applicant”), on 28 April 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Bayar, a lawyer practising in Van. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 31 January 2017 the complaint concerning the applicant’s right of access to a court was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Van.
Relying on Law no. 5233 on Compensation of the Losses resulting from Terrorism and the Measures Taken against Terrorism, the applicant applied to the compensation commission and requested to be awarded compensation due to forced evacuation from his village. His request was rejected. Subsequently, he initiated proceedings before the Van administrative court to have the said decision annulled. Relying on documents attesting to his poor financial status, the applicant requested legal aid to pay the court fees. On 7 July 2006 the administrative court rejected the applicant’s legal aid request. He was notified that he had to pay 604 Turkish Liras (TRY) (approximately 330 euros (EUR)) in court fees within one month to continue the proceedings and that failure to do so would result in the discontinuation of the proceedings. As the applicant failed to pay the court fees within the time-limit, on 2 August 2006 and 27 October 2006 respectively, the Van Administrative Court sent further warning letters and ordered the applicant to pay the court fees.
On 29 December 2006 the court decided to discontinue the proceedings since the necessary court fees were not deposited with the registry of the court. The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment on 17 December 2008. Subsequently, the administrative court decided to discontinue the proceedings.
A description of the relevant domestic law and practice can be found in Mehmet and Suna Yiğit v. Turkey, no. 52658/99, §§ 19-22, 17 July 2007.
In July 2006, the minimum wage in force was TRY 380 (approximately EUR 185).
