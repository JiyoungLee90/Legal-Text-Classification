The prosecutor referred to Article 7 \u00a7 13 of the Law on Local Self-Governance which determined that in the most general sense supervision of the use of construction works was the municipality\u2019s responsibility. Similarly, Article 42 of the Law on Construction set out the municipality\u2019s duty to supervise the use of residential houses and other constructions. The prosecutor analysed in detail whose responsibility it had been, and when, in respect of  city municipality and Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas, to supervise the buildings, given that there had been changes in the bodies between 1999 and 2005. She noted that in May 2004 the city had made some enquiries of Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas about the cellars, but there was no-one in the municipality who had the responsibility of supervising the activities of Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas. However, the prosecutor considered that the evidence gathered was contradictory, and that therefore it was not possible to establish which body\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the Vilnius city municipality or Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas \u2013 had been responsible for the proper maintenance of the building, the collapse of which had resulted in the death of the applicant\u2019s son. Therefore the prosecutor could not identify any physical person who could be held accountable for failure to act and to ensure that the building was in good condition and not dangerous. The prosecutor thus dropped the criminal charges in respect of A.J. Moreover, under Article 229 of the Criminal Code a corporate person could not be held criminally liable. However, the prosecutor noted that, in accordance with Article 6.266 of the Civil Code, the applicant and the parents of the two injured children could lodge civil proceedings against  city municipality or Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas, and claim that the building had been left unattended.",

The prosecutor found that the evidence as regards which body owned the collapsed building was contradictory. However, he considered that the  city municipality was the de facto owner of the building. On the basis of documents dated 2004 and 2005, the prosecutor also concluded that the municipality had known earlier about the poor condition of the building where the accident had happened. Nonetheless, in 2004-05 an administrative reform had taken place within the  city municipality, as a result of which new administrative units had been created, the responsibilities of those units redistributed and new people assigned to those administrative units. Consequently, at the time of the incident there was no one who had the duty to manage derelict and unused buildings.

The court drew the prosecutor\u2019s attention to specific actions to be taken and specific circumstances to be examined, whilst noting the applicant\u2019s earlier requests to the prosecutor to the same effect. Having given the prosecutor precise instructions, including to obtain archived documents from 1970-75, the district court emphasised that without that specific information it was not possible to establish the identity of persons who had failed to adopt a timely final decision, in accordance with their official duties, about the future of the derelict buildings and their proper maintenance.

The prosecutor noted, however, that the  city municipality had learned on 28 February 2005 of the poor state of the building the collapse of which had caused the death of the applicant\u2019s son. However, at that time the municipality was going through structural changes and the duties and responsibilities of the municipality\u2019s employees were being redistributed, therefore there was no particular person with the specific duty to take action on derelict and abandoned buildings. Moreover, taking into account the short period of time that had elapsed between that date and the accident (three months), it was not possible to conclude that the municipality\u2019s employees had been stalling the process of finding a solution to the question of what had to be done with the building. The evidence collected in the case did not prove that employees of the  city municipality, the Naujamiestis district or Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas had failed to carry out any of their clearly prescribed duties and had thus caused the death of one child and injuries to two others.

Referring to the Court\u2019s case-law on the subject of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention, they argued that the criminal-law avenue was not the one to be pursued by the applicant. On this point the Government admitted that within the framework of criminal proceedings the applicant had brought a civil action, and had been recognised as a civil claimant who had suffered pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. However, in each of the subsequent decisions to discontinue the criminal investigation of the death of the applicant\u2019s son the prosecutors suggested that she bring a separate civil claim against the  city municipality under Article 6.266 of the Civil Code. Moreover, by a decision of 3\u00a0July 2008 and subsequent decisions the prosecutors established that the  city municipality had been the de facto owner of the derelict building the collapse of which had caused the death, and that it thus had absolute liability. Referring to the practice of the Lithuanian courts (see paragraphs 40-42 above), the Government thus insisted that Article 6.266 of the Civil Code was an effective remedy the applicant should have pursued. Whilst noting that the pre-trial investigation did not establish physical persons liable for the accident, the Government also argued that the applicant could have alternatively claimed redress for the damage on the basis of Article 6.271 of the Civil Code, which sets forth a more general provision, namely liability to compensate for damage caused by unlawful actions of institutions of public authority. Again, the applicant could have relied on the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that the  city municipality, which had learned about the poor state of the building in question in 2004, did not act promptly enough to eliminate the threat. Even so, the applicant had never lodged any separate civil claim under the rules of civil procedure in respect of the damage caused by her son\u2019s death.",

It reiterates that although the Convention does not as such guarantee a right to have criminal proceedings instituted against third parties, the Court has said on a number of occasions that the effective judicial system required by Article 2 may, and under certain circumstances must, include recourse to the criminal law (see, among other authorities, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. , no. 22492/93, \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR 2000III, and Mahmut Kaya v. , no. 22535/93, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2000III). However, if the infringement of the right to life or to personal integrity has not been caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. The form of investigation may vary according to the circumstances. In the sphere of negligence, a civil or disciplinary remedy may suffice (see Calvelli and Ciglio v.  [GC], no. 32967/96, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2002I, and Mastromatteo v.  [GC], no. 37703/97, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2002VIII).",

That being so, the Court nevertheless reiterates that, in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when one remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Jasinskis v. , no. 45744/08, \u00a7 50, 21 December 2010). For the reasons described below, it is the Court\u2019s view that, in the present case, both sets of proceedings would have been pursued the same goal, which consisted in finding out who could be held accountable for the death of the applicant\u2019s son. On this point the Court firstly refers to the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 12\u00a0November 2007 to reopen the pre-trial investigation and to take measures to identify the person or persons who were responsible for the impugned building\u2019s maintenance and to establish why those persons had not taken measures to ensure that the building was properly maintained.",

In this connection the Court also notes the decision of 16\u00a0October 2009, in which the prosecutor emphasised that it was essential to identify the particular person in Naujamiestis district who was responsible for supervising the building at issue. If no particular person had been assigned such functions, the prosecutor supervising the investigation had to examine whether it was the municipality\u2019s or Naujamiestis district\u2019s managers who should bear the responsibility under Article 229 of the Criminal Code. Therefore it is not unreasonable to hold that the applicant could have realistically expected that the criminal proceedings would end with a positive result.",

These facts have been recognised by the Government. That being so, the Court does not see how a separate civil action would have helped to identify the person or persons liable for the accident which had cost her son his life. On this point the Court also considers that the prosecutors had all the measures at their disposal to disclose the truth, or at least the Government have not argued that some particular methods of investigation were not available to them but would have been available to courts of civil jurisdiction. On the contrary, the Government have asserted that the criminal investigation was effective (see paragraphs 57-59 below). It may also be noted that none of the three examples of domestic case-law provided by the Government deals with the issue of loss of life. Accordingly, the Court considers that by joining the criminal proceedings and lodging a civil claim for compensation within them in compliance with the provisions of domestic law the applicant did everything possible as a civil claimant. It thus finds that, also taking into account the long duration and consequences of the criminal investigation and specific circumstances of that case, the applicant was not required to start new civil proceedings once the criminal inquiry was terminated as time-barred. The Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must therefore be dismissed.",

Indeed, in its Oneryildiz judgment cited above (\u00a7 71), the Grand Chamber observed that the Article 2 positive obligation must be construed as applying in the context of any activity, whether public or not, in which the right to life may be at stake. That being so, the Court has also held that the positive obligation is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources (see Ciecho\u0144ska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063 and 64). Accordingly, not every risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual and that, if so, they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see, amongst other authorities, Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7\u00a090, ECHR 2001III).",

Furthermore, the responsibility of the  city municipality, or its enterprise, Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas, for the maintenance thereof in Naujamiestis district, had been implied by the Government and in essence confirmed by Lithuanian prosecutors. To this end the Court finds it of particular importance that the prosecutor had established that in 2005 the municipality had already known about the derelict building in question, but had not been carrying out its duty to care for the derelict buildings correctly, although it was legally obliged to do so. It also notes the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that at the  city municipality no one had been assigned to supervise the activities of Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas (see paragraphs 14, 17, 24 and 26 above). For the Court, reasons such as ongoing administrative reform cannot justify inaction on the part of the authorities. Even though the prosecutors could not establish personal liability on the part of employees of the municipality or Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas with regard to their duty to inspect the building, as the ownership of the building in respect of either institution appeared to be opaque and open to ambiguity, the Court considers that this did not justify the authorities\u2019 failure to take effective measures to prevent that risk from materialising. Accordingly, the Court finds that the regulatory framework as concerns the State\u2019s duty to ensure the safety of individuals in public places was not functioning effectively in practice.",

Be that as it may, it cannot overlook the fact that there were certain flaws in the way the investigation was conducted. The Court observes that the criminal investigation was characterised by three remittals of the case for re-examination and collection of additional materials because the State authorities could not establish who was responsible for the accident (see paragraphs 14, 17 and 22 above). Each time the applicant appealed, a prosecutor or a court would quash those decisions. The Government have implied that, taking into account the tragic events at issue, the decisions to resume the criminal inquiry were based on the applicant\u2019s wish to ensure the criminal liability of those responsible, and therefore goodwill on the part of State institutions. However, whilst being mindful of its case-law to the effect that Article 2 of the Convention does not entail a right to have third parties prosecuted or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, the Court is not ready to share the Government\u2019s view. It appears from the prosecutors\u2019 and courts\u2019 decisions to reopen the criminal inquiry that the domestic authorities themselves acknowledged that the investigating officers had acted without due diligence when collecting evidence, and had ignored possibilities of identifying those accountable, including bringing charges against the managers of the Vilnius municipality or Naujamiestis district (see paragraphs 16, 20 and 24 above). Therefore, the Court considers that the criminal investigation lacked thoroughness. The investigation was thus prolonged to the extent that the criminal inquiry incorporating the applicant\u2019s civil claim for damages, which the Court had found in theory to be an effective remedy as regards the applicant\u2019s complaint that the State had failed to protect her son\u2019s right to life, had to be terminated because of the statute of limitations (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above). To this end the Court also considers that the course of the criminal proceedings had made it clear that, because of the overall confusion as to which body and/or person had been responsible for the tragic incident, the applicant would have faced serious difficulties in her attempts to have her civil claim for compensation granted, even if she had opened separate civil proceedings after the criminal case was over.",

Italy [GC], no.\u00a032967/96, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2002-I).

Article 6.250 similarly provides for non-pecuniary damages \u201cincurred due to crime, health impairment or deprivation of life,\u201d but, again, it is not clear that the applicant could have recovered damages without a prior criminal judgment. Although the Government have argued that Article 6.266 provides a potential civil remedy that does not depend on evidence of fault, in this case the applicant would probably be unable to establish ownership of the building (see paragraphs 17 and 69 of the judgment), since ownership was established only de facto, and even then it was established only by a prosecution service which was clearly unwilling to proceed with the case. The Government failed to prove that de facto owners are liable under Article 6.266 of the Civil Code. Moreover, strict liability in civil law may not be sufficient to satisfy the Calvelli and Ciglio criteria, in the sense that it does not elucidate who was responsible for the child\u2019s death. Since the Government have not demonstrated that a separate civil action would have been an \u201ceffective\u201d remedy that the applicant was obliged to exhaust, I find that the applicant has victim status and the complaint is admissible.",

Turkey, for example, the Court stressed the importance of interpreting States\u2019 positive obligation to protect life \u201cde mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas imposer aux autorit\u00e9s un fardeau insupportable ou excessif\u201d, bearing in mind \u201cles choix op\u00e9rationnels \u00e0 faire en mati\u00e8re de priorit\u00e9s et de ressources\u201d (no. 30015/96, \u00a7 45, 27 July 2004). In Furd\u00edk v. Slovakia ((dec.), no.\u00a042994/05, 2 December 2008) the applicant claimed that Slovakia had violated Article 2 by failing to implement a regulatory framework specifying a time-limit within which emergency workers had to respond to a call. The Court held that \u201cthe positive obligations under Article 2 [do not] stretch as far as to require the incorporation in the relevant regulations of an obligation of result... Various limiting factors inherent to the operation of airborne medical assistance (...) would render such a general obligation difficult to fulfil and impose a disproportionate burden on the authorities of Contracting States\u201d (see Furd\u00edk v. Slovakia, cited above, LAW 1(b)(ii)). States do have an (additional) obligation to protect the safety of individuals in public places (see Ciecho\u0144ska v. Poland (no. 19776/04, \u00a7\u00a7 64-67, 14\u00a0June 2011), and also a duty \u201cto adopt in this context regulations for the protection of people\u2019s safety in public spaces, and to ensure the effective functioning of that regulatory framework\u201d (see Ciecho\u0144ska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069). However, this does not mean that in the specific case before us the Keenan criteria are not to be examined in order to establish State responsibility. In Ciecho\u0144ska the issue was whether \u201cthe legal system as a whole dealt adequately with the case at hand\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 70, emphasis added), taking into account the remedies available to the victim for redress. This is not the same as attributing strict liability to the State under the Article 2 positive obligations, as the present case seems to suggest. In contrast to the present case, the Court in the Ciecho\u0144ska case did not examine the issue of whether the Government\u2019s failure to remove the diseased tree in itself violated Article 2 and thus did not expand the States\u2019 positive obligations to protect life. The only issue the Court found itself obliged to examine concerned remedies (\u201cwhether the available legal remedies, taken together, as provided in law and applied in practice, could be said to have amounted to legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim\u201d). In fact the only ground for the finding of a violation was that the State had failed to provide an adequate and timely response to the negligent death. The judgment reaffirmed the proposition, expressed in both Keenan and A.A. and Others, that \u201cthe positive obligation is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind (...) operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a064).",

Although municipalities must take reasonable steps to avert foreseeable dangers to residents, they retain a measure of discretion in prioritising their obligations. In this case the authorities learned about the poor condition of the building at issue on 28\u00a0February 2005, some three months prior to the building\u2019s collapse on 6\u00a0June 2005 (see paragraphs\u00a06 and 26 of the judgment). There is no evidence in this case that the municipality was aware that the building was in imminent danger of collapsing or that it posed a foreseeable risk to the life of the applicant\u2019s son. Even if some risk was foreseeable, I do not find the authority\u2019s failure to take action within a three-month time-period to be unreasonable, given the other obligations that municipal governments must fulfil and the absence of strong evidence that the authorities knew that the building posed a serious and immediate danger to residents\u2019 lives.",

First, by focusing only on the obligation to take \u201creasonable measures\u201d to protect individuals, and without limiting these measures to addressing foreseeable risks, the Court is signalling a stark departure from our previous case-law (see Keenan v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7\u00a7 90-99, cited above). Moreover, requiring frequent monitoring and repair or demolition of derelict buildings is a heavy burden to place on State and municipal governments, which must meet many other obligations with limited staff and funds.",
