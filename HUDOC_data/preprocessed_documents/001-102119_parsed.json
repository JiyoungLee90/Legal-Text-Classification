Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicant has not argued that after that date her property was affected by the threat of future expropriation.

The works were subsequently abandoned. It was not contested, either before the domestic authorities or before the Court, that there was a causal link between the decision to expropriate the applicant and the works subsequently carried out on her land.

Such positive obligations may entail the taking of measures necessary to protect the right to property. This means, in particular, that States are under an obligation to provide a judicial mechanism for settling effectively property disputes and to ensure compliance of those mechanisms with the procedural and material safeguards enshrined in the Convention. This principle applies with all the more force when it is the State itself which is in dispute with an individual. Accordingly, serious deficiencies in the handling of such disputes may raise an issue under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0Where an issue in the general interest is at stake it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate manner and with the utmost consistency.

As a result, in cases concerning civil liability of public authorities the courts have been required to determine the authority responsible for taking over the competencies of authorities which had ceased to exist. The interpretation of the provisions of the relevant laws introducing the administrative reforms has constantly changed, which has led to contradictory judicial rulings by different domestic courts on the same legal question (see paragraphs 56-60 above). As a result, the case-law at the domestic level, including Supreme Court judgments and resolutions, has often been contradictory. The divergences which arose in the caselaw were acknowledged by the Supreme Court in its resolution adopted by a bench of three judges (see paragraph\u00a058 above). Hence, the question of liability for damages in connection with acts of public authorities carried out in the past was by no means clear at the time the applicant's claim was examined and the divergences in the case-law continued thereafter for several years.",

It further notes that the appellate court did not challenge that conclusion. Furthermore, the Court has had regard to the estimate drawn up by the expert for the purposes of the civil proceedings and notes that the applicant's claims are based on the expert's conclusions. The Court accordingly is satisfied that EUR\u00a05,870 should be awarded to the applicant as compensation for pecuniary damage.",
