As regards the extent to which they had been aware that an alternative verdict might be returned, the applicants stated that while it was true that aiding and abetting had been referred to at the investigation stage, it had subsequently been intentionally discounted by the investigating judge and disregarded by both the Criminal Court and the Court of Appeal at the hearings. They were adamant that the additional submissions lodged by Chantiers Beneteau with the Court of Appeal had not been served on them. They had only become aware of the request for their conviction of aiding and abetting when it was made \u2013 as a purely ancillary point \u2013 at the end of the oral submissions on behalf of that civil party.",

On a charge of aiding and abetting, Mr P\u00e9lissier and Mr Sassi would have had to persuade the court, firstly, that they had not committed any of the statutorily defined acts of aiding and abetting and, secondly, if they were accused of specific acts of aiding and abetting, that they had been unaware that they were assisting in the commission of an offence. Further, the principle that criminal statutes must be strictly construed means that it is not possible to avoid having to make out the specific elements of aiding and abetting (see paragraph 36 above). The Court notes, too, that the notion of joint offending (coaction) referred to by the Government, as indeed that of joint enterprise (complicit\u00e9 corespective), concern special situations unrelated to the present case.

They also stated that the oral submissions had been made over two hearings for reasons of convenience pertaining to the judges, not because the case was complex. They submitted that they could not be held responsible for the conduct of Fernand Cortez and that Mr\u00a0P\u00e9lissier\u2019s three weeks\u2019 absence in July 1986 could not justify the investigation\u2019s having taken six years.

In addition, the Government contended that Law no. 85-98 of 25 January 1985 reforming insolvency law had created difficulties for the judicial authorities from the moment it came into force, though it had enabled the offence of criminal bankruptcy to be simplified. The Government also argued that by being slow to lodge requested observations or documents, Fernand Cortez had contributed to delays in the proceedings, as had Mr P\u00e9lissier, who had informed the investigating judge that he would be away from home from 2 to 24 July 1986. The Government asserted, lastly, that the judicial authorities had conducted the proceedings diligently throughout, apart from a period of inactivity between 3 August 1987 and 30 June 1988 when they had been awaiting a report from an accounting expert. As to the interval between appeals being lodged by the public prosecutor and Fernand Cortez on 22 March 1991 and the first hearing held by the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal on 16 April 1992, the Government explained that there had been a large number of summonses to send to the various parties to the proceedings.",
