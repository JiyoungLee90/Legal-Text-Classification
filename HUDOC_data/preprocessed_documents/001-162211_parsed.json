Similarly, meals offered to persons who provided various services to the applicant party, but who were legally employed by other public or private bodies, such as police officers, municipality employees, journalists or gardeners, could not qualify as legitimate expenses under the Political Parties Act because any meal costs had to be met by the relevant person\u2019s respective employers and not by the applicant party. Some dinners hosted for the applicant party\u2019s guests, volunteers or personnel for special occasions were also considered to constitute personal expenditure not related to the party\u2019s legal personality, whereas some other dinners were accepted as relevant to party work.

In addition, reimbursement of passport fees to various employees was not considered relevant to the party\u2019s objectives, even when the passports had been obtained for travel in connection with party business, as passports could be used for personal travel as well.

Although the applicant party stated that the legal proceedings in question had concerned the party\u2019s political activities, and not personal disputes, the Constitutional Court nevertheless decided that the litigation expenses had to be met by the persons in question, regardless of their role or status in the party, as the political party itself was not a party to any of the relevant proceedings. In the decision of 11 July 2012 concerning the review of the 2009 accounts (see paragraph 10 above), one of the judges dissented from the majority\u2019s approach to this matter, and argued that demanding that such costs be met by the individual members of the party involved directly in the litigation, regardless of the effects of that litigation on the political party, would unduly curtail the scope of the party\u2019s political activities in an unconstitutional manner.",

It is not disputed between the parties that the decision in question was served on the applicant party on 4\u00a0April\u00a02012 and that no appeal lay against it. In these circumstances, according to the well-established case-law of the Court, the applicant party should have lodged its complaints concerning that decision within six months of 4 April 2012, whereas it waited until 16 March 2013 to bring those complaints before the Court. The applicant party argued that it could not be expected to have lodged the application any earlier owing to the uncertainty regarding the amount of default interest it would have to pay, which only became clear when the State actually confiscated its money on 10\u00a0January\u00a02013. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the applicant party\u2019s arguments could have been taken into consideration had its complaints concerned exclusively or predominantly the amount of default interest paid to the State. However, bearing in mind that the complaint in question related to the merits of the inspection conducted by the Constitutional Court of its 2007 accounts, the six-month time-limit must be calculated from the date on which the Constitutional Court\u2019s final decision was served in relation to that inspection.",

It appears that the sanctions in question have had a considerable impact on the applicant party\u2019s activities, but it stresses that the full impact of these sanctions cannot be taken into account, having regard to the finding of inadmissibility in respect of the sanctions concerning the 2007 accounts (see paragraph 61 above). It nevertheless notes that the sanctions pertaining to the 2008 and 2009 accounts alone involved a total amount of TRY 2,735,208 (approximately EUR\u00a01,154,840). That amount more than accounts for the cuts suffered by the local branches in 2013, which had increased significance in view of the upcoming local elections in March 2014. Contrary to the Government\u2019s allegations, the Court does not consider that amount to be negligible. Accordingly, it finds that the sanctions in question constituted an interference with the applicant party\u2019s political activities and thus its freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention. The fact that part of the applicant party\u2019s annual income is made up of State funding (see the table in paragraph 13 above) does not change the Court\u2019s finding in this regard, because the provision of financial support to political parties does not give States carte blanche to interfere in their political and/or financial affairs. The Court notes in any event that, contrary to the Government\u2019s allegations, State funding for the years 2008 and 2009 made up only about one-third of the applicant party\u2019s total income.",

There was, however, no guidance in the law or elsewhere to clarify what expenses could be lawfully incurred within the scope of the \u201cobjectives of a political party\u201d or what would be considered to constitute \u201cpolitical activities\u201d. Moreover, section 74(1) of the Political Parties Act, which entrusted the Constitutional Court with the duty of inspecting the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the finances of political parties, was also framed in imprecise terms, thereby leaving that court at liberty to adopt an overly formalistic and restrictive interpretation of the vague requirements of the Act. That uncertainty as regards the exact nature of the expenditure requirements, coupled with the lack of precision regarding the scope and extent of the Constitutional Court\u2019s authority, had made it impossible to foresee the possible consequences of the expenses incurred. By way of example, it had had no way of knowing that travel expenses, legal fees or court costs, gifts and flowers presented at weddings, or official dinners connected to the party\u2019s political activities could not lawfully be charged as party expenses.",

Nor is it possible to derive any clarification from the text of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions in the instant case or from the nature of the expenses that were the subject of warnings, which do not appear to be different in nature from other unlawful expenses that resulted in confiscation orders.

The Court further recognises the difficulty involved in providing comprehensive criteria to determine which of those activities may be considered to be in keeping with the objectives of a political party and to be genuinely related to party work. Nevertheless, having regard to the important role played by political parties in democratic societies, any legal regulations which may have the effect of interfering with their freedom of association, such as the inspection of their expenditure, must be couched in terms that provide a reasonable indication as to how those provisions will be interpreted and applied. In the instant case, the lack of precision of the relevant legal provisions, coupled with the apparent failure of the Constitutional Court to establish consistent case-law at the material time on how such provisions would be interpreted in practice deprived the applicant party of the possibility of regulating its expenditure accordingly. The Court notes that the amendments introduced to section 74 of the Political Parties Act in 2011 sought to remedy that vagueness, in terms of both the activities in relation to which a political party may incur expenses, and the scope of the Constitutional Court\u2019s powers in reviewing the lawfulness of expenditure on those activities. Although the Court is not in a position to comment on the appropriateness of those amendments from the standpoint of Article\u00a011 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, it nevertheless considers that they aimed to bring some clarity to the political parties\u2019 entitlements and obligations regarding their expenditure, which the legislature must have considered was lacking.",

The nature of the issues before the competent national court plays a decisive role here (see Hesse-Anger and Anger v. Germany (dec.), no.\u00a045835/99, ECHR\u00a02001VI (extracts))). In the instant case, the proceedings before the Constitutional Court concerned the inspection of the applicant party\u2019s financial accounts, which, as the Government stated, is a highly technical matter that may be sufficiently dealt with by way of a written procedure. Although the applicant party was not able to appear before the Constitutional Court to present its arguments orally, it had the opportunity to comment in writing on the expenses which the Constitutional Court deemed problematic and which later formed the basis of its findings of unlawfulness, and also to provide further information as requested (see table in the annex below). The Court reiterates in this connection that according to its case-law, a hearing may not be necessary, for example, when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see, among many other authorities, Keskinen and Veljekset Keskinen Oy v. Finland, no. 34721/09, \u00a7\u00a033, 5 June 2012, and Meimanis, cited above, \u00a7 49). Having regard to the special nature of the proceedings in question, the applicant party has not made it clear how an oral hearing would have provided a better opportunity to defend the lawfulness of the expenditure in question, especially given that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court, but rather a more general right to present one\u2019s case effectively before the court (see, among others, Margareti\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 16115/13, \u00a7 127, 5\u00a0June 2014). The Court also wishes to stress that political parties subject to financial inspection were not altogether deprived of the right to an oral hearing, as under section\u00a030 of the now defunct Act on the Establishment and Rules of Procedure of the Constitutional Court of Turkey, the Constitutional Court could invite representatives of political parties to hear their explanations regarding their finances where it deemed this necessary, which it apparently did not do in the instant case.",

France [GC], no. 39594/98, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2001VI, and Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, \u00a7\u00a063, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0262).
