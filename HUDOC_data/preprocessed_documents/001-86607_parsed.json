However, the investigation was opened thirty days after the kidnapping had occurred. This delay in itself was liable to affect the investigation of a crime such as kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. Within the next few days the first and second applicants were questioned and the first applicant was granted victim status. However, it appears that after that a number of crucial steps were delayed and were eventually taken only after the communication of the complaint to the respondent Government, or not at all. For instance, the district prosecutor\u2019s office questioned the third, fifth and sixth applicants, the siblings of Rizvan Ibragimov, only in July 2006, that is, more than three and a half years after the crime. The Court considers such a delay excessive, especially in view of the fact that the fifth and sixth applicants witnessed their brother\u2019s kidnapping. It is obvious that such measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. This delay, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrates the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitutes a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

The Government mentioned the possibility for the applicants to apply for judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes that the applicants did make use of this remedy, which proved to be futile. In any event, the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities\u2019 failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify the perpetrators. In such circumstances the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor\u2019s office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy relied on by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee.

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, p. 1020, \u00a7 64).",
