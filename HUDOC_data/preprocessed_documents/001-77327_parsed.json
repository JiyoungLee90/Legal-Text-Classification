The application merely had to be lodged within a reasonable period, which it had been. In the\u00a0alternative, the applicant argued that the timelimit under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention had commenced at the earliest on 30 December 2004, the date of the letter from the Bratislava Regional Prosecutor, and that, accordingly, the application had been submitted in time.

Paternity in such cases stemmed directly from the fact that a child was born in wedlock or that a joint declaration of paternity had been made by the parents. Such paternity was entered into the register of births automatically, without material verification. This entailed a risk of mistakes which might become apparent only after the expiry of the time within which individuals with an interest in doing so were entitled to disclaim paternity. It was therefore justified that, as a\u00a0last resort, the Prosecutor General was entitled to initiate judicial proceedings for rectification of such mistakes even after the expiry of that time-limit. In contrast, the applicant's paternity had been comprehensively examined in a judicial procedure in which he had enjoyed the full range of procedural rights. Once paternity was declared in a judicial decision and that decision became final, the risk of mistakes was lower and, in any event, it was outweighed by the interest of society in preserving the legal relationship thus determined. Furthermore, the Government emphasised that the possibility of requesting the Prosecutor General to challenge a declaration of paternity was not a full remedy in that the person making the request bore the entire burden of proof but had no procedural rights and the decision to accept or reject the request fell within the exclusive discretionary power of the Prosecutor General. Finally, the Government pointed out that under the new Labour Code, which had taken effect on 1 April 2005, the public prosecution service no longer had the power to contest paternity.",
