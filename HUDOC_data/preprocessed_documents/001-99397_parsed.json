The Court would assess, under normal circumstances, the existence of the risk with reference to the date of the applicants' first deportation, on 30 July 2008, together with the risk they could face if expelled to  now. However, given that the applicants immediately returned to Turkey after their deportation, the Court considers that it does not need to examine the first incident any further. The Court will therefore proceed to assess the existence of any risk in Iran faced by the applicants if they were now to be deported (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia, cited above, \u00a7 77).",

The Court further notes that when the applicants made statements to the police on 14 May 2008, they mentioned that they had been converted to Christianity and recognised as refugees by the UNHCR. Yet, they were summoned and deported to Iran. In these circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that the applicants' claims regarding the risks that they might face in  on the basis of their religion were meaningfully examined by the domestic authorities before their deportation. It fell to the UNHCR branch office to reassess the background to the applicants' asylum requests and to evaluate the risk to which they would be exposed if returned to .",
