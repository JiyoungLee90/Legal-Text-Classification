Their argument that a new assessment of the pension of those persons who already received the full amount of survivor\u2019s pension before 1\u00a0January\u00a01995 would have interfered with their existing rights, might equally well apply to persons who, until amendment of the Pension Act in December\u00a01994, were entitled to and trusted to receive the full amount of a survivor\u2019s pension as from 1 January 1995.
