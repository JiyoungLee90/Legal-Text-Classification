The life in Austria differs to a significant degree from the life here. They have more free time, [and] meet with children of their age. They spend their free time playing, which is not the case in Austria, not because one of the parents would prohibit or prevent them from doing so but because the pace of life is such. The parents and the children are not at home during the day because they work and the children go to school, so they spend very little time together, which means a lot to the children. Here they are well accepted in school, they know the neighbours and generally the social network (teachers, neighbours, children of their age) works better. Moreover, it is not in the children\u2019s interest to change school anew, which is stressful because the children have to re-adapt to teachers, the curriculum and [find new] friends.",

Potential conflicts between the best interests of a child, considered individually, and those of a group of children or children in general have to be resolved on a case-by-case basis, carefully balancing the interests of all parties and finding a suitable compromise. The same must be done if the rights of other persons are in conflict with the child\u2019s best interests. If harmonization is not possible, authorities and decision-makers will have to analyse and weigh the rights of all those concerned, bearing in mind that the right of the child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration means that the child\u2019s interests have high priority and not just one of several considerations.

Therefore, by retaining the children in Croatia their father had merely exercised his own \u201crights of custody\u201d, as defined in Article 5 paragraph 1 (a) of the Hague Convention (see paragraph 54 above), in particular the right to determine their residence.

The Court recognises that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when deciding on custody. Where the measures at issue concern parental disputes over their children, it is not for the Court to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in regulating contact and custody disputes, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of their margin of appreciation. However, that does not mean that in this sphere its review is limited to ascertaining whether a respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith. In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court cannot confine itself to considering the impugned decisions in isolation, but must look at them in the light of the case as a whole; it must determine whether the reasons adduced by the domestic courts were relevant and sufficient. Undoubtedly, consideration of what lies in the best interest of the child is of crucial importance (see, for example, Diamante and\u00a0Pelliccioni, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 174, 176 and 182).",

The Court notes that section 44(1) sub-paragraph 1 of the Family Act indeed provides for a mandatory mediation procedure where, as in the instant case, the civil proceedings for divorce are instituted by a joint petition for divorce and the spouses have minor common children in relation to which they exercise parental responsibility (see paragraphs 36 and 52 above). The Government admitted that the Vinkovci Municipal Court had not referred the parties for mediation but explained that it had not done so because it had accepted a request lodged by the applicant and S.V. to adjourn the first hearing so that they could agree on the legal consequences of the divorce affecting their children, including the children\u2019s future residence (see paragraphs 36 and 81 above). According to the Government, under section 46(1) of the Family Act (see paragraph 52 above) the court could have referred the parties for mediation only at the first hearing (see paragraph 81 above). Since the first hearing was adjourned at the request of the parties, it was unable to refer them at the second hearing, despite being informed at that hearing that the parties had been unable to agree on the custody of their youngest child (see paragraphs 36-37 and 81 above).",

In view of the importance of mandatory mediation before divorce for the (future) welfare of the children, the Court cannot accept that this procedure could be dispensed with in such a blithe and formalistic way, as the Government have suggested. It is clear to the Court that the Vinkovci Municipal Court was allowed to adjourn the first hearing in the case for the reasons as stated. However, it is equally evident that once the parties had informed the court at the second hearing that they could not agree on the custody of their youngest child (see paragraph 37 above), the first-instance court was required, under section\u00a044(1) sub-paragraph 1 of the Family Act (see paragraph 52 above), to refer them for mediation.

It does not take into account the fact that the national authorities to some extent took into consideration the specific situation of the youngest child (see paragraphs 25, 26, 35 and 45). Furthermore, the authorities emphasised on several occasions that the children were emotionally attached to each other and that it was not advisable to separate them (see paragraphs 39, 42, 45 and 47).
