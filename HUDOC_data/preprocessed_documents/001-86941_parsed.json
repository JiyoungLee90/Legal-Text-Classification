However, in the Court\u2019s view, this complexity alone cannot explain the general duration of the proceedings. It finds that significant delays attributable to domestic authorities, include, in particular, a remittal of the case for a fresh consideration on account of the non-observance of procedural formalities and lack of exhaustive analysis of the circumstances of the case; repetitive adjournments of hearings on account of the court matters and absences of the defendants and third parties and a seven-month interval in scheduling hearings between November\u00a02000 and June\u00a02001. The Court further notes that the Government has not provided any explanation as to why the statutory time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal was renewed for the defendants more than a year after the pronouncement of the final judgment.",
