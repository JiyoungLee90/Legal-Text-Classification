It did not find the applicant guilty of spreading the impugned statements by any other means. The court found the first statement to be false and defamatory because V.P. had been legally elected as the leader of the collective farm. The court also held the second statement to be defamatory because V.P. had been able to present a diploma from a university in the Russian Federation. In so far as the third statement was concerned, in declaring it defamatory the court relied on a letter of the Prosecutor's Office in reply to the applicant's letter of May 2003, in which the Prosecutor's Office stated that V.P.'s title to the shares was legitimate. As to the fourth statement, the court found that since V.P. had been the leader of the collective farm, he had had the right to administer its property and, therefore, the statement \u201cused by shameless people\u201d was defamatory of V.P. Finally, the court also found the last statement to be defamatory on the basis of a document issued by the police, according to which V.P. did not possess any registered guns. The court did not refer in its reasoning to the submissions of a witness put forward by the applicant, who claimed to have been threatened with a gun by V.P. In calculating the compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered by V.P., the court held that the fact that the impugned letter had been written during the election campaign and that the applicant had been a member of the electoral staff of the candidate running against V.P. in the elections were aggravating factors on the part of the applicant.",

It appears that in September 2004 the mayor's office of the applicant's village had made an inquiry of the university in the  which V.P. had stated that he had graduated from. According to a letter signed by the president of the university dated 9 September 2004, no person named V.P. had graduated from that university in the year indicated on V.P.'s diploma. It is not clear from the parties' submissions whether this document was part of the case file in the defamation proceedings.

He had been able to appeal against the judgments of the Briceni District Court and the B\u0103l\u0163i Court of Appeal and he had his case examined twice by the Supreme Court of Justice. The applicant did not explain why, in his opinion, such a remedy cannot be considered effective within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention. The fact that the applicant is not satisfied with the outcome of the proceedings does not automatically trigger a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.

Assessing the text of the letter as a whole, the Court finds that its contents did not go beyond the limits of acceptable criticism. Furthermore, it appears that the applicant's factual allegations rested on what he believed to have been sound grounds. In this respect the Court notes that the applicant's allegation that V.P. had a false diploma was considered to be serious enough by the Prosecutor's Office to initiate criminal proceedings against V.P. The Court would underline that it does not accept the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, namely that the allegations of possession of a false diploma by V.P. should have first been proved in criminal proceedings that ended with a conviction (see paragraph 13 above). To accept such a position would amount to an excessive restriction of the freedom of expression which under no circumstances can be limited to allegations proved in criminal proceedings ending in final court judgments.",

It has been the Court's consistent view that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the rights secured by Article 10 (see Savitchi v. , no. 11039/02, \u00a7 49, 11 October 2005). In the present case the Court considers that some of the impugned statements made by the applicant, such as \u201cV.P. who, as a matter of coincidence, was the leader of the collective farm is shameless...\u201d, \u201cthe property [of the collective farm] which was gathered by the people over a very long period of time is now used by shameless people...\u201d were value judgments that represented the applicant's subjective appraisal of V.P.'s personality.
