In addition, the applicant complained that the judge had constantly interrupted her examination-in-chief, making it impossible for her to give her evidence in a coherent manner, and had hectored her counsel to such an extent that he had felt unable to continue and had curtailed the examination. The grounds of appeal referred to the transcript of the trial which showed interventions by the judge on almost every page of S.\u2019s cross-examination and on twenty-two of the thirty-one pages of the applicant\u2019s examination-in-chief.",

Likewise, so far as the evidence of [S.] is concerned, it does appear that, probably through a misunderstanding of the points that Mr Engel was seeking to make, the learned judge did interrupt cross-examination far more often than could be justified on any view. We are not impressed with the complaint which is made about the interruption which occurred during Mr Engel\u2019s speech to the jury. That was simply to clear one matter up; it could have occupied no more than about ten seconds out of a speech lasting 45 minutes or thereabouts, we are told. That complaint is unjustified.",

The Court considers that in these circumstances particular weight should be attached to the assessment of the national appellate court, which because of its knowledge and experience of the conduct of jury trials, is especially well placed to determine whether a trial judge\u2019s handling of a trial resulted in unfairness. It is true that, while holding that there was \u201csome substance\u201d in the criticisms made of the conduct of the trial judge, the Court of Appeal did not in terms reach a conclusion as to whether such conduct had resulted in unfairness, finding instead that the applicant\u2019s conviction was not \u201cunsafe\u201d. It is true, too, that in its above-mentioned Condron judgment (at paragraph 65), the Court observed that the question whether or not the rights of defence under Article\u00a06 of the Convention were secured in any given case could not be assimilated to a finding that a conviction was \u201csafe\u201d in the absence of any inquiry into the issue of fairness.",

It is apparent from that case-law that, even in cases where the evidence against a defendant is strong and a jury would have been likely to convict in any event, a conviction will be quashed if the Court of Appeal is satisfied that the trial proceedings, taken as a whole, were unfair. In particular, the Court observes that in the cases of R. v. Roohi, R. v. Frixou, R. v. Roncoli and R. v. Kartal the conviction of the defendant was quashed as \u201cunsafe\u201d by the Court of Appeal on the grounds of the excessive interventions by the trial judge, notwithstanding the acknowledged strength of the evidence against each of the defendants. Had the applicant been able to demonstrate that the trial judge\u2019s interventions in the present case, which were the subject of criticism by the Court of Appeal, had resulted in an unfair trial the Court is satisfied that her conviction would similarly have been quashed, notwithstanding the \u201coverwhelming\u201d case against her.",

However, I would have felt more confident in this conclusion if the Court of Appeal had itself expressly ruled on the question whether the judge\u2019s interventions were such as to result in unfairness, rather than confining itself to examining whether the applicant\u2019s conviction was \u201cunsafe\u201d. As pointed out in the majority judgment and in the dissenting opinion of Judge Loucaides, this case gives rise again to the problem identified by the Court in its Condron judgment of the apparent divergence between the Convention test of what constitutes a \u201cfair hearing\u201d and the national courts\u2019 test of whether a conviction is \u201csafe\u201d. It is apparent from the authorities cited in paragraph 36 of the judgment that, in a case such as the present the two tests coincide to the extent that a conviction will not be treated as \u201csafe\u201d, if as a result of excessive interventions by a trial judge the trial proceedings are, taken as a whole, unfair. The particular difficulty which arises in the present case is that these authorities and the principles stated in them were not referred to by the Court of Appeal in dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal. While I am able to accept the view of the majority of the Court that, if the Court of Appeal had been satisfied that the trial proceedings were unfair, it would have quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction notwithstanding the overwhelming case against her, it would I consider have been preferable that the question whether the trial proceedings were unfair had been expressly addressed and ruled on.",

For if a judge goes beyond his legitimate role in the conduct of the proceedings, that is an element that points to unfairness. In contrast with the civil-law system (the inquisitorial system) the judge in the common-law system is not himself carrying out an investigation into the facts of the case and cannot question the witnesses other than to seek clarification on specific matters which appear to him unclear. The questioning of witnesses and any objections to any questions fall within the competence of counsel of the parties (the accusatorial system) (see Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England 4th Edition vol. 17 paragraph 281 no. 1; \u201cIf he goes beyond this, he drops the mantle of a judge and assumes the robe of an advocate; and the change does not become him well. Lord Bacon spoke right when he said that: \u2018Patience and gravity of hearing is an essential part of justice; and an over-speaking ",

If the judge is wrong on any point, if he oversteps his role in any way, or even is discourteous to the lawyer or a witness or obstructs the proper presentation of the evidence or the submissions of the parties, there is nothing that counsel can do during the hearing of the case to remedy the situation. However courageous and able a counsel may be, he cannot afford to point out effectively during the course of the proceedings any errors or irregularities committed by a judge without thereby running the risk of clashing with the judge or of causing ill-feeling that could adversely affect his case. In short, counsel cannot afford to do anything that may arouse the judge\u2019s hostility or antagonise him or which the judge may interpret as so doing. Therefore, the judge should always be conscious of the delicate position of the lawyers appearing before him and exercise the restraint necessary to avoid placing them in an incommodious position that can only have the result of a feeling of oppression on their part to the detriment of the proper presentation of their case. I am inclined to find that the judge failed to exercise such restraint in this case.",

It may be useful to refer here, by way of example, to an unjustified interruption by the judge when he questioned the applicant during the first few minutes of her examination-in-chief.
