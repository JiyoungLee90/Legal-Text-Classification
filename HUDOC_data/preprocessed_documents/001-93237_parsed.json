In these circumstances, the administration\u2019s explanation that they needed to open the letters and inspect them in order to verify whether they were indeed addressed to the lawyer is unconvincing. It was not based on any fact and apparently did not concern a concrete suspicion regarding the particular case but referred to a general hypothetical possibility of abuse, which the prison administration viewed as sufficient to justify a policy of systematic control. In reality, the entirety of prisoners\u2019 incoming and outgoing correspondence, including that with their lawyers, was subject to inspection under section 33 of the Execution of Punishments Act. This systematic monitoring of prisoners\u2019 correspondence by the authorities in  was found by the Court to be in breach of Article 8 (see Petrov, cited above \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-45, and Bochev v.
