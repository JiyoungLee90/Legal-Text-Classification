In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Schatschaschwili v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a09154/10, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR\u00a02015).

Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair.\u201d",

The Court observes, firstly, that the applicant was at all times represented by counsel who effectively carried out the applicant\u2019s defence by, inter alia, questioning another witness (see paragraph 19 above). Secondly, the firstinstance court had ordered the prosecutor to provide further information with regard to the recording of the statements of witness E.A. (see paragraph 13 above, compare with the case of Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0149), and the applicant did not raise further objections in that regard.

In the present case the appellate court\u2019s judgment shows that it had recourse to a number of evidence (see paragraph\u00a025 above). It derives from the appellate court\u2019s reasoning that E.A.\u2019s statements were used to support the other evidence (ibid.; see also in this regard Mariana Marinescu v. Romania, no.\u00a036110/03, \u00a7\u00a079, 2\u00a0February 2010). The Court therefore considers that the appellate court treated E.A.\u2019s statements in a careful manner.",

The Court observes that the applicant was afforded an effective opportunity to come up before the appellate court with comments on E.A.\u2019s statements or with any additional questions thereof, but that he did not exercise this right (see paragraph 23 above).",

In the present case, it is demonstrated by the documents submitted to the Court that the domestic courts gave sufficient arguments to enable the applicant to understand the reasons for his conviction (see to the contrary, for example, Caka v. Albania, no. 44023/02, \u00a7\u00a0110, 8\u00a0December\u00a02009).",
