The Court notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found (cf. Poznakhirina v. Russia, no. 25964/02, \u00a7\u00a033, 24\u00a0February 2005, and Sukhobokov, cited above, \u00a7 34). The applicant was prevented from receiving money she had legitimately expected to receive under the judgment of 11\u00a0July 2003. Deducting the sum which the applicant was awarded under the final judgment of 24 August 2006, the Court, accordingly, awards the applicant RUR 39,766 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
