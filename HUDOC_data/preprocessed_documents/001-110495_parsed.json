She further contended that the authorities had failed to carry out an effective investigation into the incident. For instance, the authorities had failed to take basic investigative steps such as the identification of the persons in the military convoy who had opened fire on 5 January 2001; the questioning of the head of the military convoy and the senior drivers despite the supervising prosecutor\u2019s direct orders to this end; and the questioning of the servicemen from the 70th motorised infantry battalion who had participated in the military convoy, despite information that the battalion had been stationed in Shali in 2004.

Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this regard that while the suspension or resumption of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to suspend were taken without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success.
