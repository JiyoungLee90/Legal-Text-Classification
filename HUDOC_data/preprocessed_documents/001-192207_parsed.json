The Court is acutely conscious of the difficulties faced by modern States in the fight against terrorism and the dangers of hindsight analysis. The Russian authorities, in particular, have been confronted in the past decades with separatist movements in the North Caucasus \u2013 a major threat to national security and public safety (see Finogenov and Others v.

The Court finds that in the context of the existence of a reasonable suspicion in terrorist offences against a person habitually residing at a given address, the relevant part of the court\u2019s order was couched in terms that gave the investigators a clear indication of the objects and documents that would be directly relevant for the criminal investigation. In that respect, the scope of the warrant had been properly delineated. The Court reiterates that the specificity of the list of items susceptible to seizure in a search conducted by law-enforcement officers will vary from case to case, depending on the nature of the allegations in question. In terrorism-related offences, in particular, \u201cto impose under Article 8 the requirement that a search warrant identify in detail the precise nature of the items sought and to be seized could seriously jeopardise the effectiveness of an investigation where numerous lives might be at stake. In cases of this nature, the police must be permitted some flexibility to assess, on the basis of what is encountered during the search, which items might be linked to terrorist activities and to seize them for further examination\u201d (see Sher and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 5201/11, \u00a7 174, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).",

The Court has previously found that in the Russian legal system a judicial appeal against a\u00a0decision not to institute criminal proceedings may offer a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power by the investigating authority, given courts\u2019 power to annul such decisions and indicate the defects to be addressed (see Trubnikov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a049790/99, 14 October 2003; Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05467, 1 March 2007; and Chumakov v. Russia, no. 41794/04, \u00a7 91, 24\u00a0April 2012). Therefore, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as an effective remedy where the prosecution decided not to investigate a claim. Failure to bring such proceedings in due time would normally result in dismissal of the complaint for non-exhaustion (see Nasipova and Khamzatova v. Russia (dec.), no. 32382/05, 2 September 2010, and Dzhamaldayev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a039768/06, \u00a7 28 22 January 2013).",

In reaching such conclusions, the Court had regard to the overall length of the domestic proceedings by the time the applicants had lodged their complaints to the Court, the number of times the decisions not to open a criminal investigation had been quashed, the absence of progress in the inquiry and repetitive findings by the supervising prosecutors of the inquiry\u2019s deficiencies that were not corrected and that made the same findings by the courts redundant (see, in the context of complaints of ill-treatment, Nechto v. Russia, no. 24893/05, \u00a7\u00a7 80-82, 24 January 2012, in which the proceedings lasted for seven years and there were thirteen decisions not to open a criminal investigation; Mikhail Nikolayev v.

Russia, no.\u00a040384/06, \u00a7 30, 24 October 2017, in which the decisions refusing to institute criminal proceedings were annulled seven times in two years). The Court is not convinced that the circumstances of the present case allow it to draw the conclusion that an appeal would be devoid of purpose. Although the investigator\u2019s decision of 22 November 2011 followed an earlier decision of 8\u00a0April 2011, it contained sufficiently precise and detailed factual elements to allow the applicants to challenge any perceived arbitrariness or any other elements of the ruling with which they disagreed, had they wanted to do so. The Court finds that the applicants have not shown convincingly that a judicial review of such decision was bound to be ineffective; nor can it accept the argument that the applicants had insufficient access to the decisions in question, in view of their correspondence with the military investigation office and the timely notifications of the decisions taken, as attested by corresponding letters (see paragraphs 32 and 39-40 above).",

She repeated that suggestion in later statements and denied that any explosives had been stored in the house. However, other witness statements collected on the same day or soon afterwards gave little evidence to support that version. The materials of the case indicated that the servicemen\u2019s behaviour was consistent with the accidental finding of an IED: having conducted the search, they called in an explosives expert, warned the residents and took them to a safe distance, maintained security lines and lifted them after the explosion and examination of the debris. The second applicant testified to having heard a conversation over the radio between the servicemen that an explosive device had been found and a call for an explosives expert (see paragraph 25 above). Other applicants did not produce any statements to the domestic authorities or to the Court. The applicants\u2019 neighbours confirmed that they had been asked by the servicemen to move a safe distance away because an explosive device had been found, and later heard the explosion (see paragraphs 26 and 28). None of those witnesses corroborated the third applicant\u2019s allegations of threats or other forms of pressure put on her by the servicemen. The Government indicated that the finding of the IED at the applicants\u2019 home had been part of the criminal case against Mr Ali T. (see paragraph 43 above).",
