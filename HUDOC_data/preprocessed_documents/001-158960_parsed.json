The parties obtained a right to lodge an appeal on points of law on 9 March 2007, when the Court of Appeal adopted its judgment and prior to the above-mentioned amendments. Therefore, the Court of Cassation had to apply the law which was in force at that time. Moreover, the amendments of 7 April 2007 could not be applied to the present case, since Article 42 of the Constitution and Article 78 of the Law on Legal Acts prohibited the retroactive application of laws worsening a person\u2019s legal situation.

With effect from 7 April 2007, Articles 228.1 \u00a7 1 and 231.1 \u00a7 4 of the CCP explicitly prohibited appeals on points of law to be lodged more than once in the same case if no time-limit was fixed by the Court of Cassation to correct possible shortcomings. The Court of Cassation returned G.\u2019s first appeal on points of law on 12 April 2007, when these amendments were already in force, and stated explicitly in its decision that it did not find it appropriate to fix a time-limit for correcting the shortcomings and lodging the appeal anew. From that moment the judgment of the Court of Appeal of 9 March 2007 became final and binding and G. had no right to lodge another appeal on points of law nor the Court of Cassation to admit such an appeal, regardless of its content. In any event, the two appeals lodged by G. were basically the same. The fact that she relied on other domestic provisions in her new appeal did not mean that the very essence of her arguments was different. Both appeals made reference to the same expert opinion. Lastly, as regards the alleged prohibition of retroactive application of the law, Article 1 \u00a7 3 of the CCP stipulated a general rule of civil procedure, pursuant to which civil cases were to be examined in accordance with laws in force at the material time.",

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, inter alia, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999VII). Legal certainty presupposes respect for the principle of res judicata, that is the principle of the finality of judgments. This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for reexamination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003-IX).",

Appeal lay against this judgment to the Court of Cassation, which is the final instance, within six months by virtue of Article\u00a0228.1 \u00a7 1 of the CCP. On 26 March 2007 the applicant\u2019s opponent lodged an appeal on points of law. In the meantime, on 7 April 2007 amendments were introduced in the CCP which explicitly prohibited lodging appeals on points of law more than once unless, when returning an appeal, the Court of Cassation fixed a time-limit for its correction and resubmission. On 12 April 2007 the Court of Cassation decided to return the appeal of 26 March 2007, specifying in its decision that it did not find it appropriate to fix such a time-limit. In spite of this, the applicant\u2019s opponent lodged another appeal on points of law on 7 September 2007, which the Court of Cassation decided to admit for examination on 1 October 2007, subsequently quashing the judgment of 9 March 2007.",

They alleged that, before those amendments were introduced, an unlimited number of appeals on points of law could be lodged with the Court of Cassation within the prescribed six months. The Court of Cassation was guided by those rules since they were in force at the time when the Court of Appeal adopted its judgment, whereas the amendments of 7 April 2007 worsened the applicant\u2019s opponent\u2019s situation and were therefore not applied as was required by law. The Court, however, is not convinced by these allegations for the following reasons.",

None of the provisions of the CCP stipulated such a right. To the contrary, Article 239 of the CCP provided that the decisions of the Court of Cassation were final and not subject to appeal. Furthermore, the Government have not demonstrated that such a right derived from any well-established practice either. The procedure of returning appeals for their failure to comply with admissibility requirements was introduced in November 2005 (see Borisenko and Yerevanyan Bazalt Ltd v. Armenia (dec.), no. 18297/08, 14 April 2009), but there is no material before the Court to indicate that the new rules were authoritatively interpreted by the Court of Cassation in such a way as to allow parties to lodge appeals repeatedly until the expiry of the time-limit for appeal. The Government have also failed to submit any examples of domestic decisions dating from that period to show that what happened in the present case was part of normal practice rather than the result of some sort of omission.",

Thus, by admitting another appeal lodged by the same party and subsequently granting it the Court of Cassation overturned a final judgment. The Court accepts that in certain circumstances legal certainty can be disturbed in order to correct a \u201cfundamental defect\u201d or a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d (see, among other authorities, Ryabykh, cited above, \u00a7 52; Ro\u015fca v.

However, the Government did not suggest that this had happened in the present case. Nor does it follow from the materials of the case that this was the aim pursued.
