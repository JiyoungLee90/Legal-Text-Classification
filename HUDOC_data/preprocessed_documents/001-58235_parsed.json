It was not punishable by imprisonment and commission of such an offence was not entered on a criminal record (see paragraph\u00a020 above). Unlike criminal offences, it did not result in the more severe penalties imposed on habitual offenders and was subject to a shorter statutory limitation period. None of the restrictions on personal freedom typical of criminal proceedings applied to the minor offence committed by the applicant; nor did criminal responsibility extend to preparatory acts and attempts to commit such an offence.

The Commission noted the general character of the legal rule infringed by the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a019 and 22 above). Furthermore, the penalties imposed on those who committed minor offences are intended to deter and are of a punitive nature. The Minor Offences Act contains several procedural guarantees such as the presumption of innocence and the right to remain silent which are indicative of the criminal nature of minor offences (see paragraph\u00a028 above). Under the\u00a0Act the operative part of the decision on the guilt of an accused comprises, inter alia, the fact of conviction and the determination of the sanction (see paragraph\u00a029 above). Significantly, both the Minor Offences Act and the Criminal Code use the same approach in this respect (see paragraph\u00a021 above). ",

Sentences imposed for minor offences and criminal offences produce similar effects for the purpose of civil proceedings since civil courts are bound by the decisions of administrative authorities concerning convictions for minor offences in the same way as for convictions for criminal offences (see paragraph\u00a036 above). Finally, the Commission noted that under the Constitution there existed the possibility of granting pardons in relation to minor offences (see paragraph\u00a015 above).

However, the indications furnished by the domestic law of the respondent State have only a relative value (see the \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v.

In this respect, the Court recalls that these criteria are alternative and not cumulative: for Article\u00a06 to apply by virtue of the words \u201ccriminal charge\u201d, it suffices that the offence in question should by its nature be \u201ccriminal\u201d from the point of view of the Convention, or should have made the person concerned liable to a sanction which, by its nature and degree of severity, belongs in general to the \u201ccriminal\u201d sphere (see, inter alia, the Lutz v.

This does not exclude that a cumulative approach may be adopted where the separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d (see, among other authorities, the above-mentioned Garyfallou\u00a0AEBE judgment, p.\u00a01830, \u00a7\u00a033; and the Bendenoun v.

That provision regulates minor offences against public order (see paragraph\u00a022 above). Accordingly, the legal rule infringed by the applicant is directed towards all citizens and not towards a given group possessing a special status. The general character of the legal rule in question is further confirmed by section\u00a01 of the Minor Offences Act which refers to the fact that all citizens must ensure respect for legal rules and the rights of other citizens and also by section\u00a02(1) of the same Act which defines a minor offence as a wrongful act which interferes with or causes danger to the public interest (see paragraphs\u00a018\u201319 above; and the above-mentioned \u00d6zt\u00fcrk judgment, p.\u00a020, \u00a7\u00a053).
