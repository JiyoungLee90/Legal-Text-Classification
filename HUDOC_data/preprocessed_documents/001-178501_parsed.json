Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in\u00a0reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case. This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see Akdivar and Other v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 69, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV; Selmouni v.

Subsequently, the Constitutional Court adopted eight more decisions in cases raising the same issues as the present ones with the same legal reasoning and instructions for the cantonal government. However, on 16 January 2013 the Constitutional Court adopted a procedural decision to the effect that these decisions had not been enforced (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above). Therefore, it has not been shown that in this particular matter an appeal to the Constitutional Court was capable of providing redress for the applicants\u2019 complaints and offered a reasonable prospect of success. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the Government\u2019s objection on grounds of failure to exhaust domestic remedies cannot be upheld (see, mutatis mutandis, Had\u017eimejli\u0107 and Others v.

The government of the Zenica-Doboj Canton was ordered to take the necessary steps in order to secure the enforcement of final judgments from the cantonal budget within a reasonable time. The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that the cantonal government should identify the exact number of unenforced judgments and the amount of aggregate debt, and set up a centralised, chronological and transparent database which should include the enforcement time-frame and help avoid abuses of the enforcement procedure. On 16 January 2013 the Constitutional Court adopted a procedural decision to the effect that its decision of 12 October 2011 and eight other decisions concerning the same matter had not been enforced.",
