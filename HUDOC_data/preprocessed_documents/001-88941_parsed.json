Such a petition represents an extraordinary remedy which may be used to challenge administrative decisions exclusively on one of the grounds listed in section 267 of the Administrative Procedure Act (see paragraph 29 above). That being so, the Court considers that the right claimed by the applicants, namely to have the Fund\u2019s decision declared null and void on the grounds of their non-participation in the proceedings, is not recognised, even on arguable grounds, under Croatian law (see Gallo v. Slovakia, no. 30900/96, Commission decision of 4\u00a0September 1996). Accordingly, Article 6 of the Convention is not applicable to the second set of proceedings.

The Court reiterates in this connection that in its judgments in the Bo\u017ei\u0107 and Po\u010du\u010da cases it noted that that approach of the  differed from the one of the Court as it did not cover all stages of the proceedings. For that reason the Court held that a constitutional complaint alone could not be considered an \u201ceffective\u201d remedy within the meaning of Articles 35 \u00a7 1 and 13 of the Convention in respect of the length of administrative proceedings (see Bo\u017ei\u0107 v. Croatia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 36 and 45, and Po\u010du\u010da v. Croatia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037). As the Government did not submit any evidence to the contrary, the Court sees no reasons to reach a different conclusion in the present case.",
