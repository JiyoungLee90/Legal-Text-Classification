It clarified, nevertheless, that the term \u201cadministration of justice\u201d did not cover the judicial proceedings in their entirety, but only extended to judicial acts touching upon the merits of a case.

The  emphasised, moreover, that the constitutional right to compensation by the State for the damage should not be tied in with the personal fault of a judge.

In this way, that provision embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only; however, it is an aspect that makes it in fact possible to benefit from the further guarantees laid down in paragraph 1 of Article 6 (see Sergey Smirnov v.Russia, no.\u00a014085/04, \u00a7 25, 22 December 2009).",

In this respect, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court. It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved. If the restriction is compatible with these principles, no violation of Article 6 will arise (see Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v. Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2001VIII).",

The domestic courts refused to entertain the applicant\u2019s claims not because of the judicial immunity from liability for actions taken in a professional capacity in the course of the administration of justice (compare, Sergey Zubarev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a031-32, and Gryaznov v. Russia, no.\u00a019673/03, \u00a7 78, 12\u00a0June 2012), but rather on the grounds that the legislature had not yet determined jurisdiction over such claims concerning the judicial acts, falling outside the scope of the notion \u201cadministration of justice\u201d. The possibility of lodging such claims was envisaged in Articles 1064 and 1070 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation (see paragraph 15 above). The Constitutional Court clarified that State liability for the damage caused by any violations of the litigant\u2019s right to a fair trial, including a breach of the reasonable-time guarantee, would arise even if the fault of the judge was established in civil \u2013 rather than criminal \u2013 proceedings, and that the right to compensation by the State for the damage should not be tied in with the personal fault of a judge (see paragraph 16 above). It also held that an individual should be able to obtain compensation for any damage incurred through a violation of his or her right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. The Constitutional Court further stated that Parliament should legislate on the grounds and procedure for this kind of compensation. It follows that the applicant\u2019s claim concerned his civil rights of a pecuniary nature and should have been amenable to examination in civil proceedings.",
