In a judgment of 15\u00a0January 2007 the Constitutional Court allowed the appeal, considering that the principle that there should be no discrimination based on gender had been violated in the applicant\u2019s case. The court referred to the established case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities to the effect that \u201cCommunity law precluded the application of a domestic measure which, although formulated in a neutral manner, affected a much higher percentage of women than men\u201d, unless this was the result of objective factors unrelated to any discrimination on grounds of sex. It noted that \u201cin the event of indirect discrimination it is not necessary to prove the existence of more favourable treatment reserved exclusively for men; it is sufficient that there exists a legal provision the interpretation or application of which adversely affects a group composed mainly of female employees\u201d. The Constitutional Court found that there had been a breach of the principle prohibiting discrimination on grounds of sex, stating: \u201cthe court\u2019s refusal to acknowledge [the applicant\u2019s right to] a reduction of her working hours, without examining to what degree the reduction concerned was necessary in order to respect the constitutional purposes for which [the possibility of working reduced hours] had been introduced or what organisational difficulties the employer might have if [the applicant\u2019s] right to work the hours concerned were to be acknowledged, constitutes an unjustified obstacle to [the applicant] in her work and in reconciling that work with her family life, and therefore discrimination on grounds of sex\u201d. The Constitutional Court accordingly allowed the amparo appeal, set aside the Madrid Employment Tribunal\u2019s judgment of 25\u00a0September 2003 and ordered that court to deliver a new judgment in keeping with the fundamental right in issue.",
