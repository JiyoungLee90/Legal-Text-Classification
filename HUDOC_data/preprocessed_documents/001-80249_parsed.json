The holders of posts involving responsibilities in the general interest or participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law wielded a portion of the State\u2019s sovereign power. The State therefore had a legitimate interest in requiring of these officials a special bond of trust and loyalty. On the other hand, in respect of other posts which did not have this \u201cpublic administration\u201d aspect, there was no such interest (see Pellegrin, cited above, \u00a7 65). The Court therefore ruled that the only disputes excluded from the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 were those which were raised by public servants whose duties typified the specific activities of the public service in so far as the latter was acting as the depositary of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State or other public authorities. A manifest example of such activities was provided by the armed forces and the police (\u00a7 66). It concluded that no disputes between administrative authorities and employees who occupied posts involving participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law attracted the application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (\u00a7\u00a067).",

However, it is evident from the cases decided since that in very many Contracting States access to a court is accorded to civil servants, allowing them to bring claims for salary and allowances, even dismissal or recruitment, on a similar basis to employees in the private sector. The domestic system, in such circumstances, perceives no conflict between the vital interests of the State and the right of the individual to protection.

Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in Pellegrin, a \u201cspecial bond of trust and loyalty\u201d between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified.",

By a subsequent collective agreement, in force until 29 February 1992, the remote-area allowance had been replaced by a cold-area allowance and certain municipalities, including Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, had been removed from the group for which this allowance was to be paid. The loss of the wage supplement was based on a provision in the implementing instruction for the collective agreement, according to which it was paid only as long as the person concerned served in the municipality where the entitlement to the supplement was given. If the duty station changed, temporarily or permanently, the payment of the supplement ceased. As to the Nurmes case, in which a wage supplement had been granted because of a reduction in the cold-area allowance grading, it was not comparable to the applicants\u2019 case. A clearly negative position concerning compensation for the longer commute was taken by the Ministry of Finance in the Sonkaj\u00e4rvi and Askola cases (decisions of 3 July 1991) and in the subsequent court proceedings, which in both cases resulted in a negative decision by the . The Ministry of the Interior had only applied for a wage supplement on the basis of increased costs arising from the longer commute for ten persons, including the applicants, referring to earlier practice applied by the Ministry of Finance in the M\u00e4ntyharju case. Thus, the Ministry of the Interior did not lodge the application on the basis of the loss of the wage supplement arising from the removal of the remote-area allowance. Accordingly, the applicants\u2019 case was entirely comparable with the Askola case. In fact, where police districts had been incorporated after 3 July 1991, the practice had been not to award compensation in cases comparable to that of the applicants.",

To this end, it had abandoned criteria such as that relating to the economic nature of the dispute, which \u201c[left] scope for a degree of arbitrariness\u201d (\u00a7 60), in favour of \u201ca functional criterion based on the nature of the employee\u2019s duties and responsibilities\u201d (\u00a7 64). While adopting a restrictive interpretation of the exceptions to the safeguards afforded by Article 6 \u00a7 1, the Court decided that \u201cthe only disputes excluded from the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention are those which are raised by public servants whose duties typify the specific activities of the public service in so far as the latter is acting as the depositary of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State or other public authorities.

In this respect, we disagree with the majority when, in the instant judgment, it refers, in paragraph 60, to a \u201clandmark judgment\u201d of the Court of Justice, namely that delivered in case no. 222/84. Admittedly, that was indeed a landmark judgment, delivered following a request for a preliminary ruling, which held that judicial control reflects a general principle of law (this ECJ judgment, Marguerite Johnston, is cited in the joint dissenting opinion of Judges Costa, Tulkens, Fischbach, Casadevall and Maruste in the Athanassoglou and Others v. Switzerland judgment ([GC], no. 27644/95, ECHR 2000IV)). However, its scope differs from that which is presumed in the instant judgment. The issue was not one of determining whether every dispute between the State and its agents fell within the scope of Article 6 of the Convention, but merely of confirming that, by virtue of a general principle of law, every act by a public authority must, in principle, be open to supervision of its lawfulness (such as the recours pour exc\u00e8s de pouvoir in French law).",

It has been applied by the Court for seven years without any real problem and, as could have been expected and desired, it has extended rather than restricted the application of the guarantees secured under Article 6 \u00a7 1. The categories of agents excluded from these guarantees, such as the police service in its entirety, are limited when compared with public service employees as a whole (for examples, see paragraph 52 of the judgment). Legal certainty has certainly improved if we compare the situation with that which obtained prior to the Pellegrin judgment. As to the argument based on the existence of access to a domestic court, we are not convinced by it. As Article 53 of the Convention rightly points out, nothing prevents a High Contracting Party from recognising in its law freedoms or guarantees which go further than those set forth in the Convention; in addition, as legal systems vary from one State to another, the reasoning in the instant judgment is likely to have the effect of making the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to disputes between the State and its agents dependent on there existing access to a court with jurisdiction to decide them within the domestic legal system. To sum up, instead of the \u201cautonomous interpretation\u201d (by the Court) that the latter considered it important to establish for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Pellegrin, \u00a7 63), the instant judgment encourages a dependent and variable, not to say uncertain, interpretation, in other words an arbitrary one.

Abandoning a solid precedent in such conditions creates legal uncertainty and, in our opinion, will make it difficult for the States to identify the extent of their obligations.",
