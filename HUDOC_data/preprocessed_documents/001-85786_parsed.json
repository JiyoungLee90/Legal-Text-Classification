The applicant could not use that award for any other purpose. The Court observes that the applicant claimed EUR\u00a03,653 representing the interest which could have accrued if the money had been paid in good time and put in a bank. Having regard to the special purpose of the award, the Court agrees with the Government that the applicant had no right to profit from it by investing it or depositing the money on a bank account (see Glushakova v.  (no. 2), no. 23287/05, \u00a7\u00a023, 10\u00a0May 2007). The Court therefore dismisses her claim under this head.",

The Court reiterates that the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as an extended delay in enforcement (see Gizzatova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 5124/03, \u00a7\u00a028, 13 January 2005; Metaxas v. , no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 27 May 2004). The Court observes that the amount of housing aid awarded to the applicant under the judgment of 23\u00a0April 2002 was calculated by multiplying the number of sq. m to which she was entitled by the average price per sq. m in the region in 2002. The applicant received the award in December 2004 and by that time the average price had considerably increased (see paragraph 26 above). The Court accepts that the judgment debt depreciated as a result of the delayed enforcement of the judgment (compare Pylnov v. , no.\u00a07111/05, \u00a7\u00a031, 12\u00a0July 2007). The Court further finds that the Government failed to explain what specific aspect of the applicant\u2019s calculation had been erroneous. They did not contest the reference prices supplied by the applicant. Having regard to the materials in its possession and to the fact that the judgment was fully enforced in 2004, the Court awards the applicant EUR 4,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount, and dismisses the remainder of the claim for pecuniary damage.",
