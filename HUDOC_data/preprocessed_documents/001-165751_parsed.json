The question of whether a tribunal is impartial is analysed by applying two tests: a subjective test seeking to determine the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge; and an objective test seeking to ascertain whether the tribunal itself offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality. In the first test, the impartiality of a judge or a tribunal must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary. Under the second test it must be determined whether there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to impartiality of a judge. In deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Morice v.\u00a0France [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78).",

The Court observes that in the applicant\u2019s case the scale and intensity of the public debate at national level, including the statements made by the chairman of the Supreme Court about the judiciary in general (see paragraph\u00a08 above), and the media coverage of the inquiry might have caused the applicant anxiety about impartiality of several judges of the Supreme Court, including Judge O.D.J.",

The Court observes that at the material time challenges brought against judges because their names appeared in the book were accepted in cases where any of the parties had been represented by lawyers mentioned in the book (see paragraph 19 above). In addition, two inquiries were started and later concluded with respect to Judge O.D.J.\u2019s conversation published in the book. The Prosecutor\u2019s General Office established that there were not sufficient grounds to open investigation into Judge O.D.J.\u2019s conduct.
