Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2000-VI). Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 97, ECHR\u00a02000VII). The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, \u00a7\u00a7 146-47).",

The use of force, however, must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of any of the purposes set out in subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c). In this respect the use of the term \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d in Article 2 \u00a7 2 indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraph 2 of Articles\u00a08-11 of the Convention. In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in the subparagraphs of the Article (see McCann and Others, cited above, p. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 148-149).",

Turkey, judgment of 28 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV, \u00a7 79). Finally, law-enforcement officers, such as the police or the gendarmerie, should not be left in a vacuum when performing their duties, whether in the context of a prepared operation or a spontaneous chase of a person perceived to be dangerous: a legal and administrative framework should define the limited circumstances in which law-enforcement officials may use force and firearms, in the light of the international standards which have been developed in this respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Makaratzis v.

Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 103, ECHR\u00a01999-IV). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7\u00a0321, ECHR 2007...). The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfies the minimum threshold of an investigation's effectiveness depends on the circumstances of each particular case. It must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Velikova, cited above, \u00a7 80; \u00dclk\u00fc Ekinci v.

It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, in general, Av\u015far v.
