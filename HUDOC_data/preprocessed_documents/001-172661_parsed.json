The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should be made first to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, although there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Akdivar and Others v.

The Court also notes that the applicant did not complain to the Court that the letter had violated her rights; rather, she complained that her husband had been murdered by State agents and that the investigation into the murder had not been effective. However, it remains for the Court to examine whether the applicant can be criticised for having waited for almost five years after the start of the investigation into the murder of her husband before lodging her application with the Court.",

Croatia (dec.), no. 72254/11, \u00a7\u00a7 31-45, 18 March 2014). The Court has found that in cases concerning instances of violent death, the ineffectiveness of the investigation will generally be more readily apparent than in cases of missing persons; the requirement of expedition may require an applicant to bring such a case to Strasbourg within a matter of months or at most, depending on the circumstances, just a few years after the events (see Varnava and\u00a0Others v. Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a0 et al., \u00a7 158, ECHR 2009). Stricter expectations would apply in cases where there was a complete absence of any investigation or progress in an investigation, or meaningful contact with the authorities. Where there is an investigation of sorts, even if plagued by problems, or where a criminal prosecution is being pursued, even by the relatives themselves, the Court accepts that applicants may reasonably wait longer for developments which could potentially resolve crucial factual or legal issues. It is in the interests of not only the applicant but also the efficacy of the Convention system that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention (see Mu\u010dibabi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 34661/07, \u00a7 108, 12 July 2016).",

The investigation was still ongoing at the time of the most recent communication with the parties. In that connection, the Court notes that it appears from the Government\u2019s observations that they did not submit all the documents relating to the criminal investigation to the Court, only the case file material that they considered relevant to the Court\u2019s questions. In any event, it can be seen in the documents submitted by the Government that although the main investigative steps were carried out in the first few months after the murder in 2005, it could not be said that the investigation subsequently became passive and that no further steps were taken. In particular, it appears from those documents that from 2006 to 2009 numerous investigative actions were conducted in Azerbaijan and Georgia at the request of the Azerbaijani authorities. Moreover, in March 2009, when the Azerbaijani authorities replied to the applicant\u2019s last request about the progress of the investigation, they were still corresponding with the Georgian authorities with a view to establishing the whereabouts of one of the suspects and having him extradited to Azerbaijan (see paragraph 59 above).",

Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7 180, with further references, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). Nevertheless, since Article 2, which safeguards the right to life and sets out the circumstances when deprivation of life may be justified, ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention, from which no derogation is permitted, the Court must subject deprivation of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances (see, among other authorities, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27\u00a0September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 146-47, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0324, and Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v.

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends, in appropriate circumstances, to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual or individuals whose lives are at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v.

Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of a particular individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party, and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 116, Reports 1998VIII; Gongadze v.

It was apparent that his murder could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the work of other journalists in the country. In such circumstances, there was every reason for the investigating authorities to explore with particular diligence whether the murder, which appears to have been carefully planned, could be linked to Mr Huseynov\u2019s journalistic activities, or to come up with another plausible explanation for the motives behind the murder. However, having regard to the material in the case file, it does not appear that adequate steps were taken during the investigation to inquire sufficiently into the motives behind the killing of Mr\u00a0Huseynov and to investigate the possibility that the attack could have been linked to his work as a journalist (compare Adal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 231, and Uzeyir\u00a0Jafarov v. Azerbaijan, no. 54204/08, \u00a7 52, 29 January 2015).",

Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2012). The Court also reiterates that the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy is such that the genuine, effective exercise of this freedom is not dependent merely on the State\u2019s duty not to interfere, but may call for positive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, \u00a7 59, with further references, ECHR 2011).

In 2005, in the case of Adal\u0131 v. Turkey, the Court was confronted with the inadequate investigation into the murder of a journalist in the \u201cTRNC\u201d who had received death threats on several occasions because of his articles and political opinions. Although the Court held that the widow\u2019s allegations that her husband\u2019s killing was related to his activities as a journalist were not implausible and that the authorities failed to inquire sufficiently into the motives behind the killing, the Court came to the conclusion that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s allegations arise out of the same facts as those examined under Article\u00a02 of the Convention\u201d. It did not therefore consider it necessary to examine this complaint also under Article 10 of the Convention. This approach was upheld in the case of Uzeyir Jafarov v.

To analyse the lack of an investigation in both cases in exactly the same way under Article 2 appears to us inadequate. Admittedly, the majority sought to take into account the \u201cchilling effect\u201d of the murder and confirmed the duty of the authorities \u201cto explore with particular diligence whether the murder, which appears to have been carefully planned, could be linked to Mr\u00a0Huseynov\u2019s journalistic activities\u201d.

But the destructive effect on human rights is the same. Therefore, the Court should not turn a blind eye to the fact that, as explained in a discussion paper issued by the Commissioner for Human Rights, murders of journalists are to be understood as \u201cthe most extreme form of censorship\u201d.",
