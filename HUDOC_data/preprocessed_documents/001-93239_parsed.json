In the Court\u2019s view, this reasoning was deficient in that the domestic courts failed to explain why their assessment had not been affected by the fact that the charge concerning participation in a criminal group had been dropped. The Court also notes that although the remaining offence the second applicant stood accused of \u2013 possession of counterfeit items \u2013 was classified as \u201cserious\u201d under domestic law, it is significant that it was a non-violent offence and the second applicant did not have a criminal record (see paragraphs 11 and 13-15 above).",

For the Court this approach is unacceptable. It has held that justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2003I (extracts)). Moreover, under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention it is for the national authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person is justified on the basis of relevant and sufficient reasons and does not exceed a reasonable period (see Labita v.
