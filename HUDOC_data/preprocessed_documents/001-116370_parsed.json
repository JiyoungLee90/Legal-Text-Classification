The applicant\u2019s assertion that some of the German marks and the United States dollars were his, acquired as a result of the sale of real property and a car, was not supported by evidence.

The origin of the jewellery was likewise uncertain. The applicant\u2019s assertion that it belonged to his wife had not been made out, because, when interviewed, his wife had failed to describe its characteristic features, and another witness \u2013 one of the officers carrying out the search in the applicant\u2019s office \u2013 had said that during the search the applicant had conceded that it belonged to victims of crime.

It found no substance in the applicant\u2019s assertion that part of the money found in the safe had been acquired as a result of the sale of real property and a car, because the applicant had not produced documents proving such transactions. However, it noted that a witness interviewed during the investigation had said he had bought a car from the applicant, paying him DM 2,000 (one note of DM 500, two notes of DM 200, and the rest in DM\u00a0100 notes). That, coupled with the applicant\u2019s assertion that a DM 200 note in the safe came from that transaction, showed that it indeed belonged to the applicant.

The same went for the USD 898, and for a gold necklace. As for the rings and the other jewellery, the applicant had stated during the search that he had seized them from offenders. No evidence had been gathered about their origin during the investigation, and the applicant\u2019s wife had failed to describe them in detail.",

After the end of the proceedings, items retained as real evidence and not forfeited under Article\u00a053 of the Criminal Code 1968 (see paragraph 36 below) could be forfeited if it was impossible to ascertain their owner and they had not been claimed within one year after the end of the proceedings (Article 109 \u00a7 1). If a dispute over ownership requiring adjudication by the civil courts arose in respect of items retained as real evidence, they had to be retained until the relevant judgment became final (Article 110). In 2006 the above provisions were superseded by Articles 111 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, 112 \u00a7 1, and 113 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 2005, which are almost identical. One difference is that Article 111 \u00a7 2 of the 2005 Code speaks of the possibility of returning the evidence to \u201cthose entitled\u201d, instead of \u201ctheir owners\u201d, the expression used in Article 108 \u00a7 2 of the 1974 Code.",

First, the case essentially revolved around a contested issue of fact: was there enough evidence that the applicant was the owner of items that had been seized from the safe and whose return he claimed. Secondly, the determination of that question involved issues of credibility \u2013 both the personal credibility of the applicant and the credibility of the witnesses who had made statements before the investigator in relation to that point (see paragraph 17 above). Indeed, in deciding that the applicant had failed to prove his assertion that the items were his, the prosecutor relied heavily on the statements of those witnesses and on the lack of credibility of the applicant\u2019s statements, and in challenging the prosecutor\u2019s findings on this point the applicant requested the reexamination of those witnesses and the examination of a new witness (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). In those circumstances, the  could not decide the case fairly and reasonably on the basis of the parties\u2019 written submissions and other written materials. It was not therefore dispensed from holding a hearing. It is also important to note in this context that that court was the first and only judicial body before which the case was brought (see Fischer v. Austria, 26\u00a0April 1995, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 312).",

A reading of its decision (see paragraph 21 above) shows that it did not gather fresh evidence and relied almost exclusively on the prosecutor\u2019s findings, even though the applicant expressly contested those findings, requested the reexamination of witnesses and the examination of a new witness, and said that he wished to give further explanations (contrast Fischer, cited above, \u00a7 34). This is hardly surprising, since under the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s caselaw under Article 237 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1974, the court reviewing a public prosecutor\u2019s decision to discontinue a criminal investigation could not take evidence and had to decide the case on the basis of the evidence gathered during the investigation (see paragraph 38 above). However, in the circumstances of the present case such limited review cannot be regarded as sufficient in relation to the question whether the forfeiture of the items seized from the applicant\u2019s safe was lawful and justified.",

It starts by noting that the Government did not provide any examples in support of their contention that the applicant could have availed himself of a claim for a judicial declaration or a claim under section 108 of the Property Act 1951 (see paragraph 39 above), and did not try to explain how these procedural avenues could have been used in the circumstances of the present case. In so far as it may be deduced from the Bulgarian courts\u2019 caselaw under Article\u00a0110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1974 and Article 113 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 2005, which superseded it but is couched in identical terms, that provision governed only situations where the authorities provisionally retained real evidence in a criminal case because third parties had come forward with claims that they were its rightful owners (see paragraph 35 above). By contrast, in the present case there were no third parties contesting the applicant\u2019s rights to the items seized from the safe. It is therefore unclear against whom he would have directed his claim. In as much as the Government may be taken to submit that it could have been directed against the authorities, the Court observes that the Government have not provided any arguments or examples in support of that contention. It appears that the Bulgarian civil courts refuse to entertain claims under section 108 of the Property Act 1951 brought while the criminal proceedings are still pending, or to allow confiscations to be challenged by way of such claims or claims for a judicial declaration (see paragraph 39 above). The Government have not pointed to any cases in which those courts have scrutinised a public prosecutor\u2019s decision to forfeit items retained as real evidence. The Court is therefore not persuaded that these procedural avenues were open to the applicant.",

In the present case, the question of whether the applicant had a good claim to the items seized from his safe lay at the heart of the dispute between him and the authorities. The instant complaint is thus directly connected with the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, in relation to which the Court found that the applicant had not obtained a proper judicial determination of his alleged entitlement to the items. Quite apart from the practical, ethical and internal disciplinary issues arising out of the fact that the applicant appears to have been using State property \u2013 the safe box in his office \u2013 for purely personal use, the Court cannot speculate as to what would have happened if the case had been heard in keeping with all the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, and is therefore dispensed from determining whether the applicant had a possession and from ruling on the complaint based on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Glod v.

It was not a result of the applicant\u2019s prosecution and conviction (contrast Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a041087/98, ECHR 2001VII), nor was it ordered because the forfeited items were deemed to have been unlawfully acquired (contrast Raimondo v.\u00a0Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 281A; Arcuri and Others v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no. 52024/99, 5 July 2001; and Riela and Others v.
