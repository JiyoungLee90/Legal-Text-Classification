In this respect the Court reiterates that the Convention and its Protocols must be interpreted as guaranteeing rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory. The right to have one\u2019s claim examined within a reasonable time would be devoid of all sense if domestic courts examined a case endlessly, even if at the end the length of proceedings per instance did not appear particularly excessive (see, mutatis mutandis, Svetlana Orlova v. Russia, no. 4487/04, \u00a7 47, 30 July 2009).",

Russia, no.\u00a011549/02, \u00a7 58, 25 March 2008). This is all the more true in the present case where the proceedings were subsequently discontinued due to the simple fact that they had been initiated by a party that had had no legal standing. The Court therefore arrives at the conclusion that the repeated referrals of the case to the first instance significantly contributed to the length at hand.",
