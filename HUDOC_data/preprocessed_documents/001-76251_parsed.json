This provision does no more than enshrine the right of everyone to the peaceful enjoyment of \u201chis\u201d possessions, and that consequently it applies only to a person\u2019s existing possessions (see Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 23, \u00a7\u00a050). Where a person actually possessed a property and was considered its owner for all legal purposes he or she can be said to have had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Be\u010dv\u00e1\u0159 and Be\u010dv\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 58358/00, \u00a7\u00a0131, 14\u00a0December 2004). \u201cPossessions\u201d can also be assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he or she has at least a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right (Kopeck\u00fd, ibid, \u00a7\u00a035). By way of contrast, the hope of recognition of a property right which it has been impossible to exercise effectively cannot be considered a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01. A \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d must be of a nature more concrete than a mere hope, and must be based on a legal provision or a legal act such as a judicial decision (Kopeck\u00fd, ibid, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035, 49). A person who complains of a violation of his or her right to property must first show that such a right existed (see Pi\u0161torov\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 73578/01, \u00a7\u00a0130, 26\u00a0October 2004).",

The Court notes that the applicant never brought an action for a finding of invalidity in respect of Resolutions nos.\u00a0111 and 167. He first adverted to their alleged unlawfulness in 2001, after the Land Certificates had been declared invalid. In reply, the courts stated that the lawfulness of the Resolutions had been verified and confirmed in the earlier proceedings brought by the prosecutor which ended with the judgment of the Commercial Court of the Kursk Region of 21 April 1999, as upheld by higher courts (see paragraphs 69 and 74 above).",

Thus, it was stated in the Resolution that the Land Committee was ordered to delimit the plot of land allocated to Luch Farm under the Resolution on site and to issue a Land Certificate (see paragraphs 46 and 80 above). The domestic courts\u2019 assessment of the Resolution and the Land Certificate undoubtedly indicates that the Resolution legally prevailed over the Land Certificate as the document establishing the right to land (see paragraphs 22-24, 4650, 53, 56-58 and 74-75 above). Consequently, the Land Certificates should have been issued in pursuance and full compliance with the Resolutions. The fact that they were not, and that they contained no information on the land rights of the other partners in the farm, should not have enabled Mr\u00a0Zhigalev to claim that the land had been allotted to him alone, in violation of the decisions contained in the Resolutions. Therefore, the Court considers that Mr\u00a0Zhigalev\u2019s allegation that the plot of 30.9 hectares and the plot of 315 hectares belonged to him alone has no basis in the facts of the case.",

The said Act was referred to in Resolution no.\u00a0111 on the allocation of land for organizing Luch Farm. As head of the farm, Mr\u00a0Zhigalev was or should have been aware of it. His argument that the Act was not sufficiently precise and foreseen is not persuasive. Thus, he alleges that the situation where a farm was founded by several partners was insufficiently regulated. However, his submissions do not show that his position concerning his rights to the land had a basis in law.",

It was never the applicant personally but Luch Farm which was treated as owner of the land in question for all legal purposes. Thus, the information before the Court suggests that it was Luch Farm which paid taxes, stood as a party to court proceedings and was referred to in decisions by the local authorities. Furthermore, it should be noted that the domestic authorities took steps since at least 1997 to correct the situation caused by the applicant\u2019s view that he was the sole owner of the land (see paragraphs 11-19 and 28 above). The applicant was or should have been aware that there was a possibility that the Land Certificates would be cancelled.",
