On 10 December 2008 the Vilnius Regional Court noted that according to the prosecutor and the court of first instance any breach of legal norms regulating the division of land was a breach of the public interest. However, twenty-five people altogether, including the applicant, had been allocated additional plots at the time (see paragraph 7 above), but the prosecutor had only found a breach of the public interest in the applicant\u2019s case. The court also found that when the applicant had been allocated the first plot of land (see paragraph 6 above), there had been no other plots demarcated and the land in front of his had been vacant. He thus could not have anticipated that the additional plot of 0.05 hectares would occupy part of the road because the road had not existed at the time the detailed plan had been drawn up or when the applicant had purchased the land (see paragraph 8 above). The court stated that the mechanism of allocating the additional plot to the applicant had been breached, but that he was a bona fide owner. Mistakes had been made by the authorities and taking the land from the applicant would have disproportionate consequences for him. The court observed that the applicant\u2019s neighbours could easily access their land using other roads and their rights had not been breached. Consequently, the court overturned the first-instance decision and dismissed the prosecutor\u2019s complaints. The case file contains no information of whether there was an appeal on points of law.",

The court held that the additional plot of 0.05 hectares had been allocated to the applicant in breach of the requirements of domestic law and that by holding that the rights of the applicant\u2019s neighbours had not been breached and that the applicant had been a bona fide party to the purchase agreement, the Vilnius Regional Court had made a clear mistake in the application of the law. The court thus annulled the Vilnius Regional Court\u2019s decision of 10 December 2008 and upheld that of the Vilnius District Court of 11 April 2008 (see paragraph 16 above).",

The court further held that the applicant had not been diligent enough and that ignorance of the law could not absolve someone of responsibility (see paragraph 37 below). The fact that the applicant had to return 0.05 hectares of land to the State did not prevent him from asking for an easement over the part of the State land where his waste water equipment and gas and water supplies were installed. The court thus rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that the order to return 0.05\u00a0hectares of land to the State prevented him from using his house.",

The purchase agreement was annulled, the land was returned to the State and G.A.V. was paid EUR\u00a01,604. G.A.V. complained that since he had lost his property, he should be repaid in accordance with its market value. The court of first instance awarded G.A.V.

The court held that an application for restitution did not deprive an applicant of the right to lodge a claim for damages. However, in the present case, G.A.V. had never been a lawful owner of the plot of land at issue, thus his argument that he had suffered pecuniary damage because he had lost that plot was unfounded. G.A.V. had failed to prove that he had a real opportunity to lawfully acquire the plot of land in question.

The Court takes note of the domestic court\u2019s conclusion that ignorance of the law does not absolve anyone of responsibility and that the Zuj\u016bnai settlement plans had shown that there was a continuing passage which was part of the applicant\u2019s 0.05 hectares of land (see paragraph 26 above). However, the Court observes that there was no detailed plan of Vilnius County at the time of purchase of the land (see paragraph 8 above) and that the rules for the Register of Territorial Planning Documents were only approved in 1996 (see paragraph 66 above). The Court thus does not see convincing reasons to find that the applicant should have questioned the actions of the competent public authorities rather than expecting them to take all the necessary measures to avoid mistakes in applying legislation (see, mutatis mutandis, Misiukonis and Others, cited above, \u00a7 60). In particular, the Court takes into account the fact that the domestic courts had already adopted decisions favourable to the applicant (see paragraphs 11-14 and 17 above), where they indicated that the applicant\u2019s neighbours could access their own land (compare and contrast R\u0103chit\u0103 v.\u00a0Romania, no. 15987/09, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 17\u00a0May 2016) and these findings had acquired res judicata effect and could not have been called into question (see, mutatis mutandis, Brum\u0103rescu, cited above, \u00a7 61; Esertas v.

According to an assessment submitted by the applicant, the market value of the improvements he had made to the disputed plot was LTL\u00a074,972 (EUR\u00a021,713) in October 2008. While no estimates were provided by the domestic authorities, the Court finds it reasonable to conclude that the market value of the land in 2008, when the first judgment in favour of the prosecutor was adopted, and in 2014, when the applicant\u2019s request to reopen proceedings was dismissed, was higher than the nominal price he had paid in 1993. It should also be noted that the LTL 15 returned to the applicant had obviously suffered considerable depreciation and could not reasonably be related to the value of the land fifteen or, even more so, twenty-one years later. Accordingly, the Court finds that the amount of as little as LTL 15 paid to the applicant in 2008 was clearly insufficient for the purchase of a comparable plot of land (see, mutatis mutandis, Velikovi and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98 and 8\u00a0others, \u00a7 207, 15 March 2007; and Padalevi\u010dius v.

In line with the Court\u2019s caselaw in similar cases concerning expropriation of property, the balance mentioned above is generally achieved where compensation paid to the person whose property has been taken reasonably relates to its \u201cmarket\u201d value as determined at the time of the expropriation (see Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc, cited above, \u00a7 53; Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins, cited above, \u00a7 111; and GuisoGallisay v.\u00a0Italy (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a058858/00, \u00a7 103, 22\u00a0December\u00a02009).
