The Court notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.

Secondly, the Court observes that the applicant was entitled to receive monthly payments awarded by the initial judgment of 9 February 2007 as from 1 July 2007. However, no payments under this judgment were ever made. After the quashing of the initial judgment, on 6 May 2008 the  reduced the applicant\u2019s monthly payments. Thus the quashing of the initial judgment deprived the applicant of an increase from 1 July 2007 to 6 May 2008, totally EUR 2,100.
