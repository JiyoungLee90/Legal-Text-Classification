In its leading decision of 17 October 1995 (1\u00a0Ob 612/95) the Supreme Court found that, even in the absence of an explicit provision stipulating the binding effect of criminal convictions, a convicted person must accept his or her conviction by a criminal court as an established fact and was not entitled to argue before a civil court that he or she had not committed the offence of which he or she had been convicted. Therefore, a conviction by a criminal court should have a binding effect with regard to the convicted person, so that nobody might argue that the facts differed from the ones already established and which had been the basis for that criminal conviction. The Supreme Court has also applied this principle to convictions under section 6 of the Media Act, which is an offence exclusively based on objective elements of fact. It held that a final conviction under that provision, finding that a media content fulfils the objective elements of fact of the offence of defamation, establishes, with binding effect for the civil courts and without being subject to further review, that the media content must be deemed defamatory (6 Ob 105/97b, 16 October 1997; 6 Ob 21/13a, 8 May 2013). The conviction becomes binding not only in respect of the finding of a criminal offence under objective aspects, but also in respect of the established elements of fact, and its legal qualification. Thus, in civil proceedings, the legal question of the meaning of the statement at issue cannot be reviewed (6 Ob 265/00i, 23\u00a0November 2000).",

Taking into account the context in which the statement was made \u2013 an article reporting that it had been the board of management of the KABEG who had ordered the spying operation \u2013 and the complementary allegation that K.S. had also put pressure on journalists in respect of critical reports on the KABEG, the Court sees no reason to disagree with the domestic courts that the allegation of being supposed to be the spiritus rector of the operation reported must be understood by readers to suggest that K.S. played some active role in that operation. The statement must thus be regarded as a statement of fact, which is susceptible to being proved to be true. As regards the applicant company\u2019s argument that K.S. had been associated with other spying operations in the past, the Court considers that such an alleged involvement cannot be taken as proof of the allegation relating to this particular spying operation: as the domestic courts correctly pointed out, the applicant company had explicitly abstained from submitting any evidence as to the truth of that allegation. Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicant company never even alleged, in the domestic proceedings or before the Court, that K.S. had participated in the spying operation. The Court thus sees no reason to further examine any arguments in respect of K.S.\u2019s prior conduct relating to other spying operations. Accordingly, the Court does not see any reason to object to the domestic court\u2019s assessment that the statement was defamatory.",

In the Court\u2019s view this issue does not raise concerns because the two sets of proceedings related to the very same factual basis and parties, and the subject matter of the injunction proceedings did not require any assessment of facts or law beyond the subject matter of the proceedings under the Media Act. Moreover, the Court observes that it was the applicant company who requested the suspension of the injunction proceedings until the termination of the proceedings under the Media Act, on the very ground that the latter would have a binding effect on the injunction proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court cannot find that the binding effect of the criminal conviction on the subsequent injunction proceedings, which exclusively concerned an order to refrain from repeating in the future an allegation that had already been qualified as defamatory under the Media Act, is disproportionate.",
