The Lithuanian court had regard to the Court\u2019s case-law on the subject and emphasised that the right to stand for elections was not absolute (the Supreme Administrative Court referred to Sukhovetskyy v. Ukraine, no. 13716/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050 and 51, ECHR 2006VI). Moreover, according to the Venice Commission guidelines, fundamental rights and freedoms, including the freedom to move within a State, could be limited in order to protect the public interest (see paragraph 74 below). In the applicant\u2019s case, he had not been denied the very essence of his right to be elected. The State, for its part, had an obligation to prosecute criminal acts and to take measures to ensure that criminal proceedings were not unduly protracted. The applicant had been hiding from prosecution in Russia, which showed that he had deliberately breached Lithuanian law by avoiding arrest which had earlier been sanctioned by a court (see paragraph\u00a014 above). The Supreme Administrative Court did not find erroneous the argument put forward by the Central Electoral Commission that \u201cthe applicant sought immunity status as a candidate in his own interests, which essentially had no connection with his electoral rights\u201d. One could not dismiss the likelihood that if immunity from prosecution was granted, the applicant could return to Lithuania, and would leave the country before his immunity expired [elected members of municipal councils do not have immunity from prosecution, see paragraph 69 below]. This would undermine society\u2019s trust in the State and in the authorities\u2019 duty to investigate crimes and prosecute perpetrators to protect society from attempts to commit crime.",

In fact, the criminal proceedings had started long before the municipal elections, the date of which was not announced by the Seimas until July 2006.

From the documents in the European Parliament\u2019s possession it was clear that the definition of the offences giving rise to the charges against the applicant had always remained the same. Moreover, no convincing evidence was available to demonstrate fumus persecutionis. The offences of which the applicant was accused had nothing to do with his work as a Member of the European Parliament.

The States were also required to provide effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for breach of the rules on political parties\u2019 funding. It was for the States to determine what those sanctions should be \u2013 they could be administrative or criminal in nature.

Facing criminal charges for political corruption, the applicant was striving to hide by exploiting the very measures which were applied to ensure free and unhindered democratic elections, namely, a parliamentarian\u2019s immunity from prosecution. Taking into account all the circumstances of the case, one could not exclude the possibility that the applicant might have exploited the passive electoral right in this case to acquire immunity from prosecution. On this point, the Government indicated that the applicant had taken part in the parliamentary elections of October 2007 immediately after being elected to the municipal council in February 2007. He refused the post of municipal councillor, presumably because members of municipal councils do not enjoy immunity from prosecution. The Government lastly pointed out that Lithuania was one of a few countries with such an extensive safeguard regulation \u2013 immunity for parliamentary candidates \u2013 whereas the immunity of electoral candidates was rarely accepted in Europe.",

As later indicated by the prosecutor and noted by the Central Electoral Commission, it was suspected that the damage done to the State budget amounted to millions of Lithuanian litai. The Central Electoral Commission refused, on the basis of auditors\u2019 evidence and the charges in that respect, to allocate appropriations to the Labour Party (see paragraphs 13 and 17 above; also see point 12 in paragraph 72 above).

The Lithuanian prosecutors\u2019 attempts to obtain his extradition to Lithuania were to no avail (see paragraphs 8-10, 12 and 16 above). Although the applicant argued that in September 2007, just before the parliamentary elections, he had voluntarily returned to Lithuania, thus making himself available to the prosecutors, the Court is not called upon to attempt to determine the applicant\u2019s motives. The Court however considers it established that in July 2007, when the applicant\u2019s political party named him as a candidate in the parliamentary elections (see paragraph 24 above), the applicant must have been clearly aware that he was a suspect in a criminal investigation. Even more importantly, the applicant must have known that a court order for his arrest and detention had been issued (see paragraph 14 above). Accordingly, he could not have reasonably expected to take part in those elections without any constraints, on equal terms with any other candidate, which was not an object of the criminal proceedings.",

It is not unreasonable to say that the applicant was therefore permitted to run his electoral campaign from his home, for example, by discussing that campaign with members of his political party, who in turn could spread his message to the voters (see paragraph 36 above). Any such opportunities would hardly have been available to the applicant had the Lithuanian authorities kept him in detention. Moreover, taking into account that the applicant was, in his own words, a well-known politician (see paragraph 82 above) and that the members of his political party took part in meetings with the voters in person (see paragraph 36 above), the Court does not find the restriction particularly burdensome on the applicant\u2019s right to participate in the elections to the extent that it would be decisive for its ultimate result.",

Such a system ensures an effective exercise of individual rights to vote and to stand for election, maintains general confidence in the State\u2019s administration of the electoral process and constitutes an important device at the State\u2019s disposal in achieving the fulfilment of its positive duty under Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to hold democratic elections. Indeed, the State\u2019s solemn undertaking under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and the individual rights guaranteed by that provision would be illusory if, throughout the electoral process, specific instances indicative of failure to ensure democratic elections were not open to challenge by individuals before a competent domestic body capable of effectively dealing with the matter (see Namat Alijev, cited above, \u00a7 81). The Court therefore must examine whether the decisions of the domestic courts in the instant case were compatible with the applicant\u2019s right to stand for election (see Melnychenko v. Ukraine, no. 17707/02, \u00a7\u00a060, ECHR\u00a02004X and the case-law referred to therein).",

The applicant made full use of that system. As to the municipal elections of February 2007, the applicant\u2019s argument that the remand measure imposed on him would unjustifiably interfere with his electoral rights was dismissed firstly by the Central Electoral Commission and then by a reasoned decision of the Supreme Administrative Court. Although, for reasons attributable only to the applicant, he did not take part in those proceedings in person, his interests were defended by a lawyer of his choice (see paragraphs 18, 19 and\u00a020 above). Thereafter, in the parliamentary elections of 2007, the applicant had the opportunity to appeal to the Central Electoral Commission against the decisions to place him under house arrest, as well as to the administrative and criminal courts, where he also relied on Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see paragraphs 28, 29, 32 and 34 above). There is nothing in the facts brought to the Court\u2019s knowledge to indicate that, in assessing the reasonableness of the remand measure of house arrest, the Central Electoral Commission or the Lithuanian courts acted arbitrarily. To the contrary, they relied on their earlier decisions and maintained that it was still in the public interest to keep applying remand measures in respect of the applicant, whilst balancing that restriction against his right to stand for election (see paragraphs 19, 20, 29, 34 and 74 above). Last but not least, the absence of any political basis in the criminal charges against the applicant was noted more than once by the European Parliament, which the applicant had all the possibilities to persuade otherwise (see paragraphs 57, 61, and 62 above; also principle 20 in paragraph 72 above, and paragraph 98 below).",

This also seems consistent with the States\u2019 duty to ensure that those in charge of prosecution and adjudication of corruption offences enjoy independence and autonomy (see paragraph 35 above, also see point 3 in paragraph 72 above). The Court likewise has had occasion to emphasise that it is important for the authorities in charge of electoral administration to function in a transparent manner and to maintain impartiality and independence from political manipulation (see, mutatis mutandis, The Georgian Labour Party v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 9103/04, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR 2008).",

However, this does not appear to be based on the facts of his criminal case. It is true that between November 2007 and January 2008 the prosecutor granted several requests by the applicant to visit medical establishments in Kaunas and Vilnius, which were outside the area designated in the court order of 8\u00a0October 2007 setting out the conditions for the applicant\u2019s house arrest (see paragraph 34 above and paragraphs 45 and 49 above). That being so, the Court does not consider that the State should be blamed for granting those requests, for it is clear that it would not have been in the applicant\u2019s best interests to have refused them. Furthermore, refusing to allow the applicant to see doctors could alternatively have led to his lodging complaints that the authorities had prevented him from obtaining medical care, which, in turn, could have raised an issue under Article 3 of the Convention. It is also pertinent to stress that some of the other requests granted by the prosecutor concerned the applicant visiting places such as the K\u0117dainiai sports school to take part in the Labour Party congress, that school being on the border of K\u0117dainiai town and thus within the area specified in the court ruling for his house arrest (see paragraph 44 above). On the other hand, the prosecutor did not allow the applicant to leave Lithuania for Belgium, or to take part in the television show \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d, because the first event was to take place outside Lithuania, and the second was to take place outside the hours set by the court for him to be in his home (see paragraphs 46 and 47 above). Lastly, the Court notes that the applicant was released from house arrest once the pre-trial investigation was terminated and the applicant had been able to acquaint himself with the criminal case file (see paragraphs 49, 20, 52 and 53 above). In conclusion, no inconsistency can be established in the manner in which the prosecutor examined the applicant\u2019s requests to travel within Lithuania after the parliamentary elections of 2007.",

On this point the Court cannot but reiterate its constant position that the press plays an essential role in a democratic society. Although it must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest, including those relating to justice. Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas, but the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (see Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 2003V, and the case-law cited therein). Having regard to the Government\u2019s argument about the \u201cexceptional nature\u201d of criminal case concerning political corruption (see paragraph 83 above; also see principle\u00a016 in paragraph 72 above), as well as noting that the sums unaccounted for by the Labour Party amounted to millions of Lithuanian litai (see paragraph 13 above), the Court finds nothing with which to reproach the State on this point.",

The guarantees offered by the different forms of parliamentary immunity serve to ensure the independence of Parliament in the performance of its tasks (see Kar\u00e1csony and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0138). That being so, the Court nevertheless notes that when persecuting corruption offences, the States are encouraged to limit immunity to the degree necessary in a democratic society (see principle 6 in paragraph 72 above). On the facts of the case the Court observes that during his political career the applicant held a number of elected posts. However, each time his immunity expired or was lifted, he would refuse the post. In particular, in February 2007, after being elected to the K\u0117dainiai city municipal council, given that municipal council members do not enjoy immunity from prosecution, the applicant refused his mandate, choosing just months later to run for the Seimas (see paragraphs 18, 21 and 22 above). When he was elected to the Seimas on the Labour Party\u2019s list in autumn 2008, and his immunity was soon lifted by the Seimas, the applicant again did not spend much time in the Lithuanian Parliament. In summer 2009 he was elected to the European Parliament, and resigned from the Seimas (see paragraphs 54 and 56 above). In 2010 the European Parliament rejected the applicant\u2019s plea to shield him from prosecution in Lithuania (see paragraph 57 above). He was then elected to the Seimas in 2012, and resigned his seat in the European Parliament. It was for the Seimas then to permit the applicant\u2019s prosecution (see paragraph 58 above), which again were perturbed when he was re-elected to the European Parliament two years later (see paragraph 61 above). This sequence of the applicant sidestepping the system lasted until the European Parliament again lifted his immunity in 2015, and terminated with the applicant\u2019s conviction being upheld by the Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 62 and 63 above). The Government\u2019s argument that the applicant sought each time to take part in elections to a different elected body and then moved on once he lost immunity in order to avoid prosecution does not appear to be without basis. This argument was also endorsed by the Central Electoral Commission and the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 19 above).",
