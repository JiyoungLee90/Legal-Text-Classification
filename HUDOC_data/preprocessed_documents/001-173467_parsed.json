Similarly, in Osman v. the United Kingdom (28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII), the Court examined the State\u2019s obligation to protect the right to life of Ali and Ahmet Osman, even though the latter had not lost his life but had been wounded in a shooting incident (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 115-122). In a number of other cases, the Court considered that Article 2 was applicable to non-fatal shootings where the applicants\u2019 lives had been put at serious risk as a result of the conduct of the security forces or third persons (see, for example, Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no.\u00a050385/99, \u00a7 49-55, ECHR 2004XI; Soare and Others v. Romania, no.\u00a024329/02, \u00a7\u00a7 108-109, 22 February 2011; Tr\u00e9valec v.

The Court notes that although D.M. was a military serviceman, there is nothing to suggest that on the evening in question he was performing any service-related functions. The national courts established that the accident had happened when he had been off duty and dressed in civilian clothes and that he had not used any weapons conferred on him in connection with his position, and the Court sees no ground not to accept these findings. The Court further notes that there is no indication that he used any special powers, tools or information connected to his service either (see, by contrast, \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a052442/09, \u00a7\u00a075, ECHR 2011 (extracts), and Sa\u0161o Gorgiev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48-52). Given the circumstances of the present case, therefore, the Court accepts the national courts\u2019 findings that D.M. acted as an ordinary private individual not vested with any official powers (compare Kotelnikov v.
