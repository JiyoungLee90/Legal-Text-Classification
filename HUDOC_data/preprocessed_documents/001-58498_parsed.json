In 1993 a third constitutional complaint, covering general aspects, was added to the test cases.

The parties in the test cases were given an opportunity to submit comments before the end of August 1994.

Public international law did not prohibit espionage, but it also allowed the State spied upon to punish spies even if they had only acted abroad. There was no differentiation between espionage on behalf of a totalitarian State and espionage on behalf of a State with a free democratic basic order. Thus, espionage had an ambivalent nature: it served the interests of the observing State, where it was accordingly regarded as lawful, and prejudiced the interests of the State being spied upon, where it was therefore regarded as a punishable offence. Punishment of foreign spies was not, therefore, justified on account of a general moral value judgment of reproach (Unwerturteil) regarding the espionage act, but only for the purpose of protecting the State spied upon.",

Furthermore, while Article 6 requires that judicial proceedings be expeditious, it also lays emphasis on the more general principle of the proper administration of justice (see the S\u00fc\u00dfmann judgment cited above, p.\u00a01174, \u00a7\u00a7 55-57).",

In this respect, the Court has also noted the Government\u2019s submission that the applicants could have applied to the Federal Constitutional Court for an interim stay of execution of their prison sentences (see, mutatis mutandis, the K\u00f6nig v.\u00a0Germany judgment of 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, p. 40, \u00a7 111).",

In reaching this conclusion, the Court has had regard to the fact that the criminal proceedings against the first and second applicants, including the pre-trial stage, the trial and the appeal proceedings, only lasted about one year and ten months in the first applicant\u2019s case and about two years and three months in the second applicant\u2019s case.",
