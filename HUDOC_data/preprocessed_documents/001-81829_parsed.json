This investigation led to a decision of non-prosecution concerning prison officers since the prosecutors found that only gendarmes had entered the dormitory and used force (see paragraph 20). However, the case file against the gendarmes was transferred to the \u0130zmir Governor\u2019s Office pursuant to the Law on the prosecution of civil servants. The case file does not reveal the outcome of this procedure. In any event, the Court reiterates its earlier finding in a number of cases that the investigation carried out by the administrative councils cannot be regarded as independent since they are chaired by the governors, or their deputies, and composed of local representatives of the executive, who are hierarchically dependent on the governors (see, among other authorities, Ibid, \u00a7 60, Talat Tepe v. Turkey, no.\u00a031247/96, \u00a7\u00a084, 21 December 2004, and G\u00fcle\u00e7 v. Turkey, judgment of 27\u00a0July 1998, Reports 1998IV, \u00a7\u00a080, O\u011fur v.
