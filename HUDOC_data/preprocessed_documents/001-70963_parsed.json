The court's first consideration is the fact that Article 6 [of the Convention], particularly in the light of some recent [Strasbourg] decisions given on applications brought against the Netherlands, does not unconditionally oppose the use in evidence of statements given by witnesses whom a suspect has not been able to question. There is room for the balancing of interests. In its judgment of 26 March 1996 in the case of Doorson v. the Netherlands, the European Court [of Human Rights] considered in this respect that the principles of a fair trial also require that, in appropriate cases, the interests of the suspect in questioning [witnesses] are to be balanced against the interests of witnesses and victims in the adequate protection of their rights guaranteed by Article 8 [of the Convention]. In the opinion of the European Court, briefly summarised, in balancing these interests much weight must be given to the question whether the handicaps under which the defence labours on account of the inability to questioning a witness in an indirect manner are compensated, and whether a conviction is based either solely or to a decisive extent on the statement of this witness. In its report of 17 May 1995 [in the case of Finkensieper v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a019525/92], the European Commission [of Human Rights] adopted an essentially similar opinion.",

As already found by the court, the interests of the four children in not being exposed to reliving a possibly traumatic experience weighs heavily. With that, as also already found by the court, stands the fact that the confrontations of these four witnesses with the suspect have been carried out with the required care, and that the results thereof, as already found earlier, are particularly reliable. As regards the acts themselves of which the suspect stands accused, the court finds it established that the four children have all been questioned by (or assisted by) investigation officers of the Amsterdam Juvenile and Vice Police Bureau with extensive experience in questioning very young persons. It has become plausible from the records drawn up by them and from the oral evidence given in court by these civil servants that the four children have been questioned in an open, careful and non-suggestive manner. What these children have stated, independently of each other, finds corroboration ... in what the other children have declared. In addition, important support for the veracity of their accounts is also to be found in the statements of the witnesses Mrs E. and Mrs F., witnesses whom the defence has been able to question at the hearing held before the  on 20\u00a0August 1997. It does not appear from the record of this hearing that their statements were challenged by the defence, only that the suspect did not recognise these witnesses. [The court further notes that] no request for their appearance in the proceedings on appeal has been made. Taking into account these circumstances as a whole, the court does not find a violation of the suspect's right to question witnesses in using as evidence ... the statements of the four children.",

In so far as the applicant complained that the Court of Appeal had used in evidence the statements given by the four boys, although they had never been heard by a judge and/or in the presence of the defence, and despite a request thereto filed by the defence, the Supreme Court held that it was not necessarily contrary to Article\u00a06 to use in evidence statements of such witnesses where such evidence was sufficiently supported by other evidence. Having regard to the manner in which the Court of Appeal had set out in its judgment, as regards each separate offence of which the applicant had been convicted, the evidence given by each of the boys and other pertinent evidence, the Supreme Court noted that the other evidence related each time to those parts of the boys' statements that were disputed by the applicant.

In a judgment given on 9\u00a0February 1993, the Supreme Court accepted the reasons given by the Court of Appeal to refuse a request under Article 280 \u00a7 3 of the CCP by the defence to take (further) evidence from the victim of a sexual offence, a 22 year old woman with Down's syndrome.

Moreover, the applicant had failed to indicate on what grounds he wished to query the identification procedure and the statements taken from the four boys during the initial investigation. Thirdly, the Court of Appeal did grant his request to take further evidence from the adult witnesses, Mrs E. and Mrs F., whose statements corroborated the children's statements, and from the police officers X., Y. and Z. The Government further pointed out that, after X., Y. and Z. had been heard before the Court of Appeal on 16 April 1998, the applicant's lawyer had indicated that the defence did not wish to take further evidence from them or any other witnesses and did not explicitly persist in its request to hear the four children.",

The fact that his lawyer indicated at the end of this hearing that he did not wish to hear any further witnesses can, according to the applicant, only be taken as referring to witnesses other than the four boys. Any other interpretation would defy logic. Moreover, it is clear from its judgment that the Court of Appeal acted on the basis of the supposition that the request to hear the four victims had been maintained and had never been waived, and also the Supreme Court considered the applicant's complaint relating to the trial courts' failure to hear the four victims during the trial proceedings on the basis of the assumption that the request to this effect by the defence had been maintained throughout.",

Although it noted that the remark by the applicant's lawyer after the hearing of witnesses on 16 April 1998 that he did not wish to hear any further witnesses could be interpreted as also referring to the four children, it did not base its decision on such an interpretation but on other substantive grounds. Moreover, the Supreme Court did not reject the applicant's complaint about the refusal of his request to hear the children on the basis that he had withdrawn it, but assessed and accepted as correct the reasons given by the Court of Appeal for its refusal of that request. The Court, therefore, finds that the applicant cannot be regarded as having waived his rights under Article 6 as to the hearing of these witnesses.",

The Court's task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair. In particular, as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce. Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses. It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Perna v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a048898/99, \u00a7 29 with further references, ECHR 2003V).",

As a rule these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see, among other authorities, Isgr\u00f2 v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0194A, p. 12, \u00a7 34; and Luc\u00e0 v. Italy, no. 33354/96, \u00a7\u00a7 40-43, ECHR 2001-II). However, Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see S.N. v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 34209/96, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2002V).",

In this respect, the Court has had regard to the special features of criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences. Such proceedings are often conceived of as an ordeal by the victim, in particular when the latter is unwillingly confronted with the defendant. These features are even more prominent in a case involving a minor. In the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, the victim's interest must be taken into account. The Court, therefore, accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence. In securing the rights of the defence, the judicial authorities may be required to take measures which counterbalance the handicaps under which the defence labours (see S.N. v.\u00a0Sweden, cited above, \u00a7 47 with further references).",

The other witnesses heard before the courts, the police officers X., Y. and Z., gave evidence on the manner in which statements had been taken from the four victims and on the manner in which the latter had been confronted with the applicant for identification purposes. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the statements given by A., B., C. and D. to the police, which was the only direct evidence of the facts held against the applicant, must be regarded as having been of a decisive importance for the courts' finding of the applicant's guilt, whereas neither at the stage of the investigation nor during the trial was the applicant given the opportunity to examine or have these victims examined.

Furthermore, as the children's statements to the police were not recorded on videotape, neither the applicant nor the trial court judges were able to observe their demeanour under questioning and thus form their own impression of their reliability (see, a contrario, Accardi and Others v.  (dec.), no. 30598/02, ECHR 2005-...).
