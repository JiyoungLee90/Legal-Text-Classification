He alleged that, by denying him a special extraction permit, the competent authorities had prevented him from taking measures to comply with the restoration plan; the refusal contravened the principle of objectivity enshrined in Chapter 1, section 9, of the Instrument of Government (regeringsformen, which forms part of the Constitution). Moreover, contrary to the principle of proportionality and section 3 of the 1964 Nature Conservation Act (naturv\u00e5rdslagen 1964:822), the authorities had gone beyond what was necessary in the interests of nature conservation, as well as other public and private interests. Their decision was also incompatible with the aim of nature conservation laid down in section 1(3) of the Act. Finally, the only reply given by the County Administrative Board to his question as to what steps he should take had been that the time-limit for restoration of the pit had expired; he had thus been the victim of a denial of justice.",
