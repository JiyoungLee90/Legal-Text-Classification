They both contended that they had not planned a march after the gathering on Academician Sakharov Prospekt, and that they had been walking towards the next gathering when the riot police had obstructed their path and arrested them without giving them an opportunity to disperse.

It reiterates that an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not necessarily justify an interference with a person\u2019s right to freedom of assembly (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, \u00a7 150, ECHR 2015, and the cases cited therein). In particular, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2006XIV; Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2007III; F\u00e1ber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, \u00a7 49, 24 July 2012; Berladir and Others v.

Whether such a demonstration is objectionable and what, if any, measures it calls for on the part of the police should primarily depend on the seriousness of the nuisance it was causing (see Navalnyy and Yashin, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

The Court must also be satisfied that detention during the period under consideration was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent individuals from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary fashion. Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is an exhaustive one, and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see Giulia Manzoni v.

The police therefore had formal grounds for charging the applicants with an administrative offence under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences. The Court also accepts that the situation might not have allowed the relevant documents to be drawn up on the spot, given the number of protestors and the scale of agitation there. It concludes that the escorting procedure had the purpose of bringing the applicants before the competent legal authority on suspicion of having committed an administrative offence and that it complied with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.",

Mutatis mutandis, the arguments made therein also apply here. In particular, I reiterate that, although it is an accessory provision, Article 18 of the Convention must be understood as protecting a separate legal interest, additional to that protected by the other Convention rights and freedoms with which it is invoked. This understanding of the provision follows both from the fact that it was enshrined in the Convention as a separate article, which logically entails a need to grant it a reasonable scope of independent application, and from its drafting history.",

However, cases such as the present one disclose an urgent need to address the instrumentalisation of legal proceedings in order to target and silence dissidents and oppositional actors in certain member States. As I have previously argued, in a joint partly dissenting opinion with judges Nicolaou and Dedov (Navalnyy and Ofitserov v.

This is alarming, given that tendencies such as those which underlie the present case run counter to the demands of a democratic society.

In other words, the definition of the rights in Section 1 of the Convention certainly covers the exceptions thereto, which, in a sense, if I may use this term, can be regarded as \u201ccharacteristics\u201d of those rights. Accordingly, since Section 1 of the Convention defines both the essence of the rights and the exceptions, there is no room for implied or tacit exceptions. The fact of ensuring observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto, under Article 19 of the Convention, certainly refers to the obligation undertaken by these Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to respect and secure human rights, as defined in Section 1 of the Convention together with any exceptions, which form part of their definition.",

Therefore, apart from such exceptional situations, based on the law of necessity (the relevant Latin maxims being salus populi suprema lex esto and necessitas non habet legem), which may apply only temporarily in time of emergency, the right under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention may not be affected adversely by any provision of the Convention other than Article 15. However, it must be made clear that any derogation from the obligations of a High Contracting State under Article 15 of the Convention does not have the effect of extending the list of exceptions to any of the rights under the Convention, including Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\u00a0Its operation has a temporal character and a certain aim, thus, as stated in the Article, to save a nation from a \u201cpublic emergency\u201d.\u00a0In any event, in the present case, there is no issue of emergency, and therefore, neither is there an issue involving application of the provisions of Article 15. Furthermore, in the present case there is no issue of an international armed conflict and, therefore, no question of applying international humanitarian law (see Hassan v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], no. 29750/09, 16 September 2014).",

In view of the above-mentioned importance of the right to liberty and security, neither this right nor the principle of legal certainty and the rule of law, with which the former is associated, can be secured unless there are concrete and strict exceptions to it, as has been explained above. This point is highlighted in Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 37, where the Court, referring to a detention not covered by any of the exceptions in Article 5 \u00a7 1, and after making it clear that Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention called for a narrow interpretation, said:",
