They further submitted that Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with other successor States, had inherited valuable assets from the former SFRY pursuant to the 2001 Agreement on Succession Issues: for example, Bosnia and Herzegovina received only from the Bank for International Settlements the equivalent of BAM 156,011,373.15 in 2002 (see the Earmarking of Certain Assets Act 2002; Zakon o namjeni i kori\u0161tenju dijela imovine koju je Bosna i Hercegovina dobila po Sporazumu o pitanjima sukcesije; published in the Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina no. 11/02 of 30 May 2002). They concluded that the financial difficulties of Bosnia and Herzegovina were not as serious as the Government suggested. Indeed, they accused the Government of weak public-sector management and of being influenced by narrow private interests.",

The Government then addressed the general situation of \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings. Lastly, they submitted that, following the Court's judgment in Jeli\u010di\u0107 (cited above), it had been realised that the number of judgments ordering the release of \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings could amount to 200 and not, as earlier believed, 10 to 20 judgments.

It is true that section 27 of the 2006 Act has recently been amended and that this could eventually lead to the full enforcement of the judgments at issue. Nevertheless, it would appear that this has not yet happened. Furthermore, while there is no doubt that the public debt to which the Government referred constitutes an important burden for the State, the Government failed to substantiate their claim that the enforcement of the judgments ordering the release of \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings (such as those in the present case) would indeed endanger the macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That being so, the Court does not see any reason to depart from its well-established case-law pursuant to which it is not open to a State authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt (see Jeli\u010di\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 39). The remaining arguments of the Government were either already rejected in Jeli\u010di\u0107 (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 44) or became moot following the amendment of section 27 of the 2006 Act.",

As for the amount to be deducted, the Court notes that the applicant has converted a part of his savings (in total EUR 21,213) into privatisation coupons which he has then sold for an unknown price on the secondary market (see paragraph 11 above). Taking into consideration the going rate for such coupons at the relevant time (see the Human Rights Chamber's decision nos. CH/98/420, CH/00/5893, CH/02/9315 and CH/02/9852 of 4 September 2003, \u00a7 159), the presumption is that the applicant has received 60% of the nominal value of his privatisation coupons.
