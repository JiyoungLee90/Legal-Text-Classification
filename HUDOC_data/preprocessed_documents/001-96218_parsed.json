They maintained that the domestic courts had acted in compliance with the procedural legislation, according to which the applicant could challenge only a resolution of the police, but not the contents of their letter. The Government referred in this connection to section\u00a012 of the Compensation Act, under which the amount of compensation for pecuniary damage in the applicant's case was to be established by a resolution of the tax police. Thereafter, had the applicant disagreed with it, he could have further challenged it before the courts.",

In this way it embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see, as a long-established reference, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February\u00a01975, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-36, Series A no. 18, and, for more recent case-law, Mendel v. Sweden, no.\u00a028426/06, \u00a7\u00a073, 7\u00a0April\u00a02009). This right is not, however, absolute and may be subject to legitimate restrictions. Where an individual's access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the restriction will not be incompatible with Article 6 where the limitation does not impair the very essence of the right and where it pursues a legitimate aim, and there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0May\u00a01985, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 93). At the same time, in order for the right of access to a court to be effective, an individual must have a clear, practical opportunity to challenge an act that is an interference with his or her rights (see Ponomarenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a013156/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 14\u00a0June 2007). The Court also underlines that in the domain of interpretation of domestic legislation, in particular, procedural rules applicable to judicial proceedings, its role is limited to verifying whether the effects of such interpretation by the domestic authorities, notably the courts, are compatible with the Convention (see Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2002IX).",

After their failure to respond to his renewed claim of 10\u00a0December\u00a02001, the applicant applied for compensation to the , but was instructed that he had first to appeal against the refusal of the tax police to award it to him of 23\u00a0November\u00a02001 (see paragraph 11 above). After he fulfilled that requirement, the courts of three levels of jurisdiction dismissed without consideration his complaint on the ground that the decision of the police, which he was challenging, had not been issued as a resolution but stated in a simple letter. The courts relied on section\u00a012 of the Compensation Act (see paragraphs 15, 17-18 and 20 above), according to which it was for the tax police to establish the amount of compensation for pecuniary damage. To\u00a0sum up, the domestic courts instructed the applicant to apply to the tax police for a resolution about the amount of the compensation for pecuniary damage after the latter had rejected such compensation claim as a whole by their letter of 23 November 2001 and after the applicant had judicially challenged that rejection in compliance with the earlier instruction of the Bila Tserkva Court of 4 March 2002.",
