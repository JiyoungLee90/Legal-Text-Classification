France (dec.), no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002-VIII). As regards the applicant\u2019s alleged failure to complain about delayed enforcement to a domestic court, the Court observes that the Government did not specify what kind of a court action she could have brought, nor did they advance any reasons as to the effectiveness of such remedy and its availability in theory and in practice. The Court finds that the Government have failed to substantiate their contention that the remedy at issue was an effective one. As regards the argument that the applicant did not ask for the bailiffs\u2019 assistance, it is undisputed that the Donetsk Social Welfare Office was competent to make payments pursuant the judgment. The Court had already found, in a similar context, that after a competent State agency was served with a judgment, the recourse by the applicant to another State agency should not in principle have been necessary to secure its enforcement (see, mutatis mutandis, Koltsov v. Russia, no.\u00a041304/02, \u00a7\u00a016, 24 February 2005). Nor can a person be required to resort to enforcement proceedings, in order to ensure the enforcement of a final and binding judgment delivered against the State. There is nothing in the present case to depart from this conclusion. The Court considers that in the present case the recourse to the bailiff service could not be said to have constituted an effective remedy against non-enforcement. The argument of the Government must accordingly be dismissed.",

Only the remaining sum of RUB 95 (less than 3 euro) of costs and expenses had been transferred to her account in December 2004.

Russia, no. 23405/03, \u00a7 24, 29\u00a0September 2005). Therefore, the delay of execution should be calculated from 4 December 2002. The Court further notes the Government\u2019s submission that the major part of the award was paid to the applicant in 2003. However, the Court observes, and it is not disputed by the parties, that the last payment pursuant the judgment, notwithstanding its amount, was made on 27 December 2004. Accordingly, the Court considers that the award was executed in full on the latter date. The delay of enforcement therefore totalled 2 years and 24 days.",
