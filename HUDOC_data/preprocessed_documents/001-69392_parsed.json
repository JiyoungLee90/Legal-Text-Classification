It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim's behaviour (see Labita v.  [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). However, to fall under Article 3 of the Convention, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Vala\u0161inas v. Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 100\u2013101, ECHR 2001-VIII).",

The applicant's situation was also comparable with that in the Kalashnikov case, where the applicant had been con\ufb01ned to a space measuring less than 2 m\u00b2.

By contrast, in some other cases no violation of Article 3 was found, as the restricted space in the sleeping facilities was compensated by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (see Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103, 107; Nurmagomedov v.

The fact that the applicant was obliged to live, sleep, and use the toilet in the same cell with so many other inmates was itself suf\ufb01cient to cause distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention, and arouse in him the feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him (see Peers and Kalashnikov, cited above; see also the CPT's 11th General Report [CPT/Inf (2001) 16], \u00a7 29).",
