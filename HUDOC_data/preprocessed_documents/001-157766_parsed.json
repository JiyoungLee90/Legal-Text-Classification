Thus, where a family tie has been established, the State must in principle act in such a way as to allow the relationship to develop (see Olsson v. Sweden (no.\u00a02), 27\u00a0November 1992, \u00a7\u00a090, Series A no.\u00a0250; Neulinger and Shuruk v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a041615/07, \u00a7 140, ECHR 2010; and Pontes v.\u00a0Portugal, cited above, \u00a7 75). The boundary between positive and negative obligations under Article\u00a08 cannot be precisely defined, but the applicable principles are nonetheless comparable. In particular, in both cases a fair balance must be sought between the interests of the child and those of the parents and that, in the balancing process, primary importance should be attached to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents (see Sahin v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a030943/96, \u00a7 66, ECHR\u00a02003-VIII; Kearns v. France, no. 35991/04, \u00a7 79, 10\u00a0January\u00a02008; and Akinnibosun v. Italy, cited above,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a060). In particular, a parent cannot be entitled under Article 8 of the Convention to have such measures taken as would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see Johansen\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway, cited above, \u00a7 78, and Gnahor\u00e9, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059). Thus, in the field of adoption, the Court had already accepted that it may be in the child\u2019s interest to promote the process of establishing bonds with his or her foster parents (see Johansen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080, and Kearns, cited above, \u00a7 80).",

In particular, the Court requires that measures which involve breaking a child\u2019s bonds with his or her family should only be applied under exceptional circumstances, that is to say only where the parents have shown themselves to be particularly unfit (see Clemeno and Others v. Italy, no. 19537/03, \u00a7 60, 21 October 2008), or where the measures are justified by an overriding requirement in the child\u2019s best interests (see Johansen, cited above, \u00a7 84, and P., C. and S.\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, no. 56547/00, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2002VI).

The decision to break the maternal bond immediately and definitively was taken very quickly, without any detailed analysis of the impact of the adoption on the individuals concerned and despite the legal provisions laying down that a declaration of availability for adoption must remain the last resort.

The judicial authorities solely considered the family\u2019s difficulties, which could have been overcome by means of targeted social assistance, as the expert report had in fact stated. Although an initial support project had been put in place in 2009 and had failed because of the applicant\u2019s worsening state of health and the termination of her cohabitation with her husband, those facts were insufficient to justify the removal of any opportunity for the applicant to reconnect with her children.",
