After a first visit at 8.30 p.m. without any incident, at about 9.30 p.m. several police officers returned to the house, demanding that the music be turned down. Those present complied. Subsequently, a heated argument started between a Mr H. and a police officer. The applicant intervened, a tumultuous scene developed, and the officer called the applicant names. The officer, threatening her with arrest, grabbed her arm and pepper-sprayed her eyes. The Government submitted that this had been necessitated by the applicant\u2019s resistance. The applicant fell over, and then six or seven male officers dragged her on the ground to, and banged her against, the police car. While being dragged, her breasts became exposed, since her pullover was torn. She suffered bruises on her neck and her eyes were burning badly. Eventually, however, the officers refrained from arresting her.",

The evidence against her was limited to the consideration that since she had gone to see a doctor, she (and others who had done so) must have been involved in the case. Statements of several police officers included the assertion that those who had been sprayed had obviously obstructed the police action, otherwise they would not have been sprayed. On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s own testimony was confirmed by several witnesses; and there were two different versions of the facts, both confirmed by the same number of witnesses.

Contrary to Government claims, her allegations were supported by other participants of the feast who had filed a criminal report against the officers concerned as well as by the witnesses\u2019 video testimonies. The Government had not shown how this evidence was defective, nor had an effective investigation been undertaken to allow them to do so. Nevertheless, the burden of proof to explain how her injuries had been sustained and to demonstrate that the intervention had been lawful rested on the Government. They had however failed to point to the particular behaviour of the applicant which had necessitated the police\u2019s action. The conclusions reached in the criminal proceedings conducted against her (see paragraph 16 above) in no way supported the Government\u2019s claim that the use of force and pepper spray had been necessary and proportionate so as to counter her alleged resistance. On the contrary, the impugned measures had not been necessary or proportionate. The applicant drew attention to the fact that she was shorter and weaker than either of the at least seven male officers present.",
