The case originated in an application (no. 44713/98) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by nine Turkish nationals, Mr Mehmet Derilgen, Mr Yusuf Uşaklı, Mr Hüseyin Uşaklı, Mrs Ayşe Çelimli, Mrs Gülşen Işık, Mr Yılmaz Çelimli, Mr Kamil Çelimli, Mr Metin Çelimli and Mrs Şenay Taşkın (“the applicants”), on 24 September 1998.
By a letter dated 2 March 2004 the applicants’ representative informed the Court that the applicant Şenay Taşgın had died on 3 May 1999 and that her heirs Mr Ünal Taşgın, Mrs Münevver Taşgın (Bulut), Mrs Neslihan Taşgın and Mr Şükrü Taşgın, wished to pursue her application (also “the applicants”).
The applicants were represented by Mrs N. Menderes, a lawyer practising in Aydın. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.
On 16 October 2001 the Court decided to communicate the application. In a letter of 19 October 2004, the Court informed the parties that, in accordance with Article 29 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention, it would decide on both the admissibility and merits of the application.
In 1996 the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways (Devlet Karayolları Genel Müdürlüğü), a State body responsible, inter alia, for motorway construction, expropriated a plot of land belonging to the applicants in Aydın in order to build a motorway. A committee of experts assessed the value of the applicants’ land and the sum fixed thereby was paid when the expropriation took place.
Following the applicants’ request for increased compensation, on 12 September 1996 the Aydın Civil Court of First Instance awarded them additional compensation of 4,911,300,000 Turkish liras (TRL) (approximately 44,092 euros (EUR)) plus interest at the statutory rate applicable at the date of the court’s decision, running from 17 January 1996.
On 20 February 1997 the judgment of 12 September 1996 became final.
On 7 May 1998 the administration paid the applicants TRL 8,532,488,000 (approximately EUR 30,616).
The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the Aka v. Turkey judgment of 23 September 1998 (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, §§ 17-25).
