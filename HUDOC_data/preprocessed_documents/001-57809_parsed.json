At the material time - and the Court does not have to express an opinion on the legislative reforms of 1986 and 1989, which were designed to afford better protection for individuals (see paragraph 29 above) - the customs authorities had very wide powers; in particular, they had exclusive competence to assess the expediency, number, length and scale of inspections. Above all, in the absence of any requirement of a judicial warrant the restrictions and conditions provided for in law, which were emphasised by the Government (see paragraph 54 above), appear too lax and full of loopholes for the interferences with the applicant\u2019s rights to have been strictly proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",
