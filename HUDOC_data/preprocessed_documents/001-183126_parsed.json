If the guarantees included the deposit of a sum of money, such pecuniary condition had to be considered by reference to the person of the accused and his means as well as his relation with the person who would act as his surety. The court referred to the Court\u2019s judgment of Iwanczuk v.\u00a0Poland (no.\u00a025196/94, \u00a7 66, 15\u00a0November 2011) where it had been held that the accused whom the judicial authorities declared themselves prepared to release on bail must faithfully furnish sufficient information, that can be checked if need be, about the amount of bail to be fixed. The court noted that the applicant did not satisfy this obligation. It was his duty to provide the courts with information on his income, savings and list his assets. Nevertheless, the applicant had only provided copies of self-assessment forms for purposes of income tax for the years between 1998 and 2011. According to the court, if an applicant argued that the deposit was too high, he had to show the court what he could afford by providing a list of his assets and property, even if this meant that he had to conduct researches in the Public Registry, and provide the relevant documentation. In its view an applicant had to show not only that he did not have the necessary means to deposit the sum requested but also that he was in an objective impossibility of finding the necessary means. He further had to show that he was unable to find persons who offered to act as surety. It was only when all this was shown that an applicant would have satisfied his duty to furnish sufficient information, thus enabling the court to make an objective assessment.",

In the present case, the Constitutional Court held that the latter option had not been contemplated by the applicant and it was only after various requests to have the amount reduced that he eventually proposed his mother to act as a surety. It noted that although the applicant\u2019s mother did not own the tenement she had used for the purposes of the guarantee, it was already in her possession for a period of time before the last application for the reduction of the amount was filed. Thus, the applicant could not argue that he could not have taken this course of action before. Although the applicant relied on the Court\u2019s judgment of Iwanczuk (cited above), where a violation had been found on the basis that it took four months for the Polish authorities to adjust the conditions for bail, the Constitutional Court held that (even if this were the case), the applicant \u2013 who was legally represented  had not explored all avenues to satisfy the courts with an adequate guarantee for the observance of the conditions of bail. No explanation as to why he only obtained a guarantee in the form of a surety at a subsequent stage was provided by the applicant.",

In the first place, the Court observes that the deduction of the period of pre-trial detention from the relevant sentence of imprisonment would be the case for any individual who is eventually found guilty and sentenced to jail time, irrespective of whether his pre-trial detention was Convention compatible or not. Secondly, the Court reiterates that, the protection granted through Article 5 \u00a7 3 applies to \u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c)\u201d without any exclusion, and thus does not provide protection only to persons who are later acquitted. The rights derived from Article 5 \u00a7 3 are separate from, and their examination independent of, any detention upon conviction by a competent court. More importantly, to accept that the outcome of a trial could have an impact on any complaints concerning pre-trial detention would mean that any such complaint would be premature in the absence of a final judgment in the criminal proceedings, which is evidently not the case under the Court\u2019s current case-law (see, by implication, amongst many others, Kud\u0142a v.

Therefore, the amount of bail must be set by reference to the detainee, his assets and his relationship with the persons who are to provide the security, in other words to the degree of confidence that is possible that the prospect of loss of the security or of action against the guarantors in case of his non-appearance at the trial will act as a sufficient deterrent to dispel any wish on his part to abscond (see Neumeister v.\u00a0Austria, 27 June 1968, \u00a7\u00a014, Series A no.\u00a08). Since the issue at stake is the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article\u00a05, the authorities must take as much care in fixing appropriate bail as in deciding whether or not continued detention is indispensable. Furthermore, the amount set for bail must be duly justified in the decision fixing bail and must take into account the accused\u2019s means (see Mangouras, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a079-80). The domestic courts\u2019 failure to assess the applicant\u2019s capacity to pay the sum required may lead the Court to find a violation. However, the accused whom the judicial authorities declare themselves prepared to release on bail must faithfully submit sufficient information, that can be checked if need be, about the amount of bail to be fixed (see Toshev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 56308/00, \u00a7 68, 10 August 2006; and Iwanczuk v.\u00a0Poland, no. \u00a025196/94, \u00a7 66, 15 November 2011).",

He therefore remained in pre-trial detention for an additional eleven months and fifteen days (from 22 August 2012 to 6 August 3013) until his mother, presumably after convincing other members of her family who, together with her, owned some immoveable property, hypothecated this property so as to enable her to stand as a surety for the amount fixed by the courts of criminal justice. Throughout this additional period, committal proceedings  which in principle, and according to Article 401 of the Criminal Code should be completed within a period of one month, extendible for a maximum of three months \u2013 continued, and were only finally terminated sometime towards the end of 2014. The Bill of Indictment was filed in the Criminal Court only on 26 January 2015, and the applicant was finally sentenced on 20 July 2015. The proceedings at one level of jurisdiction, therefore, lasted from 13 December 2010 (when the applicant was first arraigned in court) to 20 July 2015 \u2013 a period of over four years and six months. During this period a number of sittings were scheduled before the court of committal, where nothing happened and the case was simply adjourned (see paragraphs 8, 27 and 38).",

Nor did he focus his complaint, under Article 5 \u00a7 3, on the fact that the courts of criminal justice did not act with the \u201cspecial diligence\u201d required when people are denied bail (his comments on the \u201cspecial diligence\u201d requirement were quite vague \u2013 see paragraph 65). His main thrust was, in essence, that the domestic courts had failed to make a proper assessment of his ability (or rather, inability) to pay the sum required. Nevertheless, the time factor is important, as alluded to in paragraph\u00a071, because the violation of his fundamental right under Article 5 \u00a7 3 is compounded with the passage of time.",

It has also found that the constitutional jurisdictions failed to grasp the nettle of the problem (paragraph 75). Nevertheless in this case it has found that the finding of a violation is sufficient just satisfaction. Why? No reason whatsoever is given. Was it, perhaps, because the applicant was a bad guy, who eventually admitted to the murder charge and was sentenced to thirty-five years imprisonment? If that were a good reason for not granting non-pecuniary damage, then the Court should not grant a penny in the hundreds of conditions-of-detention cases before it under Article 3 \u2013 none of those detained are confined to their cells by virtue of some monastic vow! In Del\u00a0R\u00edo Prada v. Spain [GC] (no. 42750/09, ECHR 2013), the applicant, with a history of multiple convictions for innumerable crimes, including terrorist activities, attempted murders and murder, was awarded EUR\u00a030,000 by way of compensation for the illegality of her detention (the violation of Article 7 leading to a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention). Sergey Denisov\u2019s detention in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 attracted non-pecuniary damage to the tune of EUR 7,000 \u2013 admittedly his pre-trial detention lasted some seven years, but he was eventually convicted of multiple counts of organising a criminal group, murder and assault, preparing explosive devices and unlawfully storing and carrying firearms, and sentenced to life imprisonment (see Sergey Denisov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 1985/05 and 4\u00a0others, 19 April 2016). In a more recent case, Lisovskij v. Lithuania (no.\u00a036249/14, 2 May 2017), the applicant was convicted of leading an armed criminal organisation and of possession of a very large amount of narcotic and psychotropic substances with the intention to distribute them, and was sentenced to thirteen years\u2019 imprisonment. Notwithstanding that his case was still pending on appeal when the Court delivered its judgment, the Article 5 \u00a7 3 violation attracted EUR 4,700 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.

Malta [GC] (no. 25642/94, ECHR 1999III), where the detention lasted for just under nine days and where the core issue was the lack of automatic power on the part of the judicial authority to order release in the light of the domestic law as it then stood (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a049-50 and 53 of that judgment). Nor can it be said, as the Grand Chamber attempted to argue in respect of the fourth applicant in Ibrahim\u00a0and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC] (nos. 50541/08 and 3\u00a0others, \u00a7 315, ECHR 2016), that the applicant Gaf\u00e0 still has some form of remedy open to him domestically. He does not \u2013 well, at least not in respect of the Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03 violation. He applied to this Court precisely because the domestic constitutional jurisdictions had got it wrong. By holding that the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for any nonpecuniary damage sustained by the applicant, the Court is indirectly giving credence to the Government\u2019s argument that the only reason why the applicant continued proceedings before the Court was \u201cto obtain compensation\u201d (see paragraph 48), an argument which it ostensibly rejected in paragraph 57. But then, not only the Court but even the Government was inconsistent \u2013 in their submissions in respect of Article 41 of the Convention, the Government did not argue that a finding of a violation would be sufficient; their argument was that the amount of non-pecuniary damage should not exceed EUR\u00a01,500.
