Suffice it to say thatthe plaintiffs are a, and perhaps the, leader in their veryimportant field, which I deliberately do not identify, withnational and international customers and competitors.  They are faced with a situation which is in part the result oftheir own success.  They have reached a point at which theyhave to refinance and expand or go under with the loss notonly of money, but of a significant number of jobs.

On the other side the importance of protecting asource from disclosure in pursuance of the policy underlyingthe statute will also vary within a spectrum.  One importantfactor will be the nature of the information obtained fromthe source.  The greater the legitimate interest in theinformation which the source has given to the publisher orintended publisher, the greater will be the importance ofprotecting the source.  But another and perhaps moresignificant factor which will very much affect the importanceof protecting the source will be the manner in which theinformation was itself obtained by the source.  If it appearsto the court that the information was obtained legitimatelythis will enhance the importance of protecting the source.Conversely, if it appears that the information was obtainedillegally, this will diminish the importance of protectingthe source unless, of course, this factor is counterbalancedby a clear public interest in publication of the information,as in the classic case where the source has acted for thepurpose of exposing iniquity.

By applying this provision to the present case,  had completely revised the interpretation given by Lord Diplock in Secretary of State for Defence v. Guardian Newspapers.  The balancing exercise introduced by Lord Bridge amounted to subjective judicial assessment of factors based on retrospective evidence presented by the party seeking to discover the identity of the source (see paragraph 18 above).  At the time the source provided the information, the journalist could not possibly know whether the party\u2019s livelihood depended upon such discovery and could not assess with any degree of certainty the public interest in the information.  A journalist would usually be in a position to judge whether the information was acquired by legitimate means or not, but would not be able to predict how the courts would view the matter.  The law, as it stood, was no more than a mandate to the judiciary to order journalists to disclose sources if they were \"moved\" by the complaint of an aggrieved party.",

As a matter of general principle, the \"necessity\" for any restriction on freedom of expression must be convincingly established (see the Sunday Times v. the  (no. 2) judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 217, pp. 28-29, para. 50, for a statement of the major principles governing the \"necessity\" test). Admittedly, it is in the first place for the national authorities to assess whether there is a \"pressing social need\" for the restriction and, in making their assessment, they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation.  In the present context, however, the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in ensuring and maintaining a free press.  Similarly, that interest will weigh heavily in the balance in determining, as must be done under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), whether the restriction was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  In sum, limitations on the confidentiality of journalistic sources call for the most careful scrutiny by the Court.",

In the instant case, as appears from Lord Bridge\u2019s speech in the House of Lords, Tetra was granted an order for source disclosure primarily on the grounds of the threat of severe damage to their business, and consequently to the livelihood of their employees, which would arise from disclosure of the information in their corporate plan while their refinancing negotiations were still continuing (see paragraph 18 above).  This threat, \"ticking away beneath them like a time bomb\", as Lord Donaldson put it in the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 17 above), could only be defused, Lord Bridge considered, if they could identify the source either as himself the thief of the stolen copy of the plan or as a means to lead to identification of the thief and thus put the company in a position to institute proceedings for the recovery of the missing document.  The importance of protecting the source,  concluded, was much diminished by the source\u2019s complicity, at the very least, in a gross breach of confidentiality which was not counterbalanced by any legitimate interest in publication of the information (see paragraph 18 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, the justifications for the impugned disclosure order in the present case have to be seen in the broader context of the ex parte interim injunction which had earlier been granted to the company, restraining not only the applicant himself but also the publishers of The Engineer from publishing any information derived from the plan.  That injunction had been notified to all the national newspapers and relevant journals (see paragraph 12 above). The purpose of the disclosure order was to a very large extent the same as that already being achieved by the injunction, namely to prevent dissemination of the confidential information contained in the plan. There was no doubt, according to Lord Donaldson in the Court of Appeal, that the injunction was effective in stopping dissemination of the confidential information by the press (see paragraph 17 above). Tetra\u2019s creditors, customers, suppliers and competitors would not therefore come to learn of the information through the press.  A vital component of the threat of damage to the company had thus already largely been neutralised by the injunction.  This being so, in the Court\u2019s opinion, in so far as the disclosure order merely served to reinforce the injunction, the additional restriction on freedom of expression which it entailed was not supported by sufficient reasons for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) of the Convention.",

In that connection, the Court would recall that the considerations to be taken into account by the Convention institutions for their review under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) tip the balance of competing interests in favour of the interest of democratic society in securing a free press (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above).  On the facts of the present case, the Court cannot find that Tetra\u2019s interests in eliminating, by proceedings against the source, the residual threat of damage through dissemination of the confidential information otherwise than by the press, in obtaining compensation and in unmasking a disloyal employee or collaborator were, even if considered cumulatively, sufficient to outweigh the vital public interest in the protection of the applicant journalist\u2019s source.  The Court does not therefore consider that the further purposes served by the disclosure order, when measured against the standards imposed by the Convention, amount to an overriding requirement in the public interest.",

As explained by Lord Bridge in the House of Lords in the applicant\u2019s case, this statutory restriction operates unless the party seeking disclosure can satisfy the court that \"disclosure is necessary\" in the interests of one of the four matters of public concern that are listed in the section.  In asking himself the question whether disclosure of the source of some particular information is necessary to serve one of the interests in question, the judge has to engage in a balancing exercise: he must start \"with the assumptions, first, that the protection of sources is itself a matter of high public importance, secondly, that nothing less than necessity will suffice to override it, thirdly, that the necessity can only arise out of concern for another matter of high public importance, being one of the four interests listed in the section\".  Dealing with the way in which the judge should determine necessity where, as here, the relevant interests are those of justice, Lord Bridge said that it would never be enough for a party seeking disclosure of a source protected by the section to show merely that he will be unable without disclosure to exercise a legal right or avert a threatened legal wrong.  \"The judge\u2019s task will always be to weigh in the scales the importance of enabling the ends of justice to be attained in the circumstances of the particular case on the one hand against the importance of protecting the source on the other hand.  In this balancing exercise it is only if the judge is satisfied that disclosure in the interests of justice is of such preponderating importance as to override the statutory privilege against disclosure that the threshold of necessity will be reached.\"",

Given that, as the judgment accepts, the protection of Tetra\u2019s rights by way of the \"interests-of-justice\" exception amounts to the pursuit of a legitimate aim under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), the domestic-law test of necessity strikingly resembles that required by the Convention.  The domestic courts at three levels, on the basis of all the evidence which was before them, concluded that disclosure was necessary in the interests of justice.  Factors which  stressed, in support of his conclusion that the judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal were right in finding that the necessity for disclosure in the interests of justice was established, were the following.  First, the importance to Tetra of obtaining disclosure lay in the threat of severe damage to their business, and consequentially to the livelihood of their employees, which would arise from disclosure of the information contained in their corporate plan while their refinancing operations were still continuing.  This threat could only be defused if they could identify the source as himself the thief of the stolen copy of the plan or as a means to lead to identification of the thief and thus put themselves in a position to institute proceedings for the recovery of the missing document. Secondly, the importance of protecting the source was much diminished by the source\u2019s complicity, at the very least, in a gross breach of confidentiality which was not counterbalanced by any legitimate interest which publication of the information was calculated to serve. In this view of the balance, disclosure in the interests of justice was clearly of preponderating importance so as to override the policy underlying the statutory protection of sources and the test of necessity for disclosure was satisfied.",

The judgment, on the other hand, concludes that there was not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the legitimate aim pursued by the disclosure order and the means deployed to achieve that aim (paragraph 46).  In reaching this conclusion, the judgment first says (rightly), in paragraph 42, that the justifications for the disclosure order have to be seen in the broader context of the injunction which Tetra had already obtained.  That injunction was effective in stopping dissemination of the confidential information by the press, so that a \"vital component of the threat of damage to the company had ... already largely been neutralised ...\".  \"This being so\", the paragraph continues \"... in so far as the disclosure order merely served to reinforce the injunction, the additional restriction on freedom of expression which it entailed was not supported by sufficient reasons for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) ..\".",

The injunction bit upon the press, but it would not effectively prevent publication to Tetra\u2019s customers or competitors directly by the applicant\u2019s source (or that source\u2019s source).  Without knowing the identity of the source, Tetra would not be in a position to stop further dissemination of the contents of the plan by bringing proceedings against him for recovery of the missing document, for an injunction prohibiting further disclosure by him and for damages.

Such a result is certainly a matter of public interest and the applicant has succeeded in frustrating his national courts in their efforts to act in the interests of justice. It is for the national courts to decide whether or not the document in question was stolen.  Yet the applicant claims that because he does not believe it was stolen he can justify his refusal to comply with the court order made in his case.  His attitude and his words give the impression that he would comply if he believed the document in question had been stolen.  He is thus setting up his personal belief as to truth of a fact which is exclusively within the domain of the national courts to decide as a justification for not obeying the order of the courts simply because he does not agree with the judicial findings of fact.",
