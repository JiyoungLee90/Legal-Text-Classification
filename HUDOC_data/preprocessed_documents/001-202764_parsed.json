In the order, under the section of means of restraint (ohjeldusmeetmed), use of handcuffs was indicated. Under the headline \u201cThe explanation of the use of the means of restraint and other relevant information\u201d, a general reference was made to sections 69, 70(1) and 70-1 of the Imprisonment Act (Vangistusseadus), which allow for the use of various means of restraint when a prisoner is escorted outside the prison. It was also stated, in general terms, that escorting a prisoner out of prison entailed a serious security threat both for the prison as well as for society at large, and that the risk of escape increased when under escort. An escort plan (saateplaan) was attached to the order, according to which the escort would consist of two prison officers, one of whom was ordered to stay in close proximity to the applicant, in order to ensure constant supervision. Under the section entitled \u201cCircumstances relevant to the escort task\u201d (Saate\u00fclesande t\u00e4itmiseks olulised asjaolud) it was noted that the applicant had been imprisoned since 2010 for a drug-related crime and that it was his first imprisonment. His age, height, physical build, eye and hair colour were noted and it was added that the applicant had a 6-cm-long scar and a large burn scar measuring 10 by 4 cm on the left inner forearm. It was also noted in that section that \u201cin order to ensure the safety of the prison officers and the security of the surrounding people, it is expedient (otstarbekas) to use handcuffs as a means of restraint on the prisoner and to present him with the conditions of being escorted for his signature.\u201d Under the heading \u201cSpecial requirements for the escort task\u201d (Saate\u00fclesande t\u00e4itmise erin\u00f5uded) it was noted that the task of escorting the prisoner involved taking him for medical procedures. It was repeated that at least two prison officers were to stay within the near vicinity of the prisoner. No reference was made to the applicant\u2019s behaviour in prison. In the second part of the escort plan, details of an incident which took place on 22 September 2016 were subsequently recorded (see paragraph 9 below).",

To avoid an unnatural and forced position, two pairs of handcuffs were used together, attached to each other in a chain. The officers varied which hand was handcuffed and the applicant always had one hand free. The handcuffs were attached to the rails of the hospital bed, midway down the bed, so that when lying down, the applicant\u2019s hand and arms could rest in a normal position.",

Two prison officers grabbed the applicant by his arms and one of them handcuffed him while the other tried to hold him down by his other arm and chest. In the subsequent criminal proceedings against the applicant (see paragraphs 27-30 below) it was established that during that process, the applicant kicked and hit one of the prison officers repeatedly with his fists in the facial and chest area.",

The court examined the materials concerning the refusal not to initiate criminal proceedings and found that in the light of the detailed analyses provided by the Office of the Prosecutor General in its decision, the prospects of success of the applicant\u2019s appeal were negligible. The Tallinn Court of Appeal considered that under the circumstances handcuffing the applicant to a bed did not qualify as torture in the sense of the Penal Code. Moreover, the use of force on 22 September 2016 was not punishable as any other criminal offence as the applicant himself had actively resisted the lawful orders of the prison officers.

The Supreme Court stated that when escorting prisoners outside the premises of the prison, means of restraint were applied as a preventive measure in order to avoid an escape or to mitigate the risk to the life and health of others (such as the escort team or other people being escorted). When applying preventive measures, the harm feared did not definitely have to occur, but such harm had to be probable. It was considered that the opportunities to reduce risks were more limited in an escort vehicle than in a prison (as the latter had closed premises, different accommodation wings, increased security and surveillance possibilities and different supervisory measures).",

First, the court explained that when the grounds listed in section 69(1) of the Imprisonment Act existed, it was at the discretion of the prison as to whether to apply any additional security measures and, if needed, to choose a specific measure. In the light of that, the court\u2019s control was limited to deciding whether mistakes had been made in the exercise of that discretion. The court found that additional security measures served a preventive or deterrent purpose and, in deciding to apply them, the prison authorities were anticipating a future situation. In the light of that, it was not always necessary to first verify the circumstances serving as the basis for applying additional security measures within disciplinary, misdemeanour or criminal proceedings. In order to apply such security measures, it was sufficient that the prison had developed a justified fear of potential harm. The same principles were also reiterated in the Supreme Court judgment of 23 May 2013 in administrative case no. 3-3-1-19-13, where the court underlined that when deciding on the use of any means of restraint, the administrative authority had to assess a person\u2019s propensity to escape, his or her prior behaviour and potential behaviour during the escort, the general security threat based on the specific nature of the need to be escorted, and the sufficiency of any other measures that could be taken to reduce the threat.",

The court ordered the prison to pay the complainant damages compensating for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in the amount of 3000 kroons (equivalent to 191.73 euros). In the course of judicial proceedings, it was ascertained that the complainant had been handcuffed for the whole time that he was being escorted, that is to say while going to the escort vehicle, while in the vehicle and while exiting the vehicle, even though the escort team had been authorised to use handcuffs only outside the compartment of the escort vehicle.

He considered this to be an unlawful and disproportionate use of a means of restraint and as such in violation of, inter alia, Article 3 of the Convention. Taking into account that unlawful use of special equipment and physical force, as well as otherwise unlawful treatment of prisoners, is considered a criminal offence under the Penal Code, the Court does not consider the applicant\u2019s choice of procedure unreasonable. It is to be noted that, despite concluding that the statutory elements of a criminal offence were lacking, the prison, the prosecutor\u2019s office and the Court of Appeal analysed the alleged conduct in the light of Articles 290-1, 291 and 324 of the Penal Code. The applicant thereby sought the punishment of the persons he believed to be guilty of criminal conduct towards him (compare Mihhailov v.

They pointed out, referring to the European Prison Rules and the position of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d), that the use of means of restraint as a precautionary measure against escape during a transfer and in order to protect a prisoner from self-injury or injuring the others was accepted, so long as they were used in a proportionate manner on the basis of an individual risk assessment. The use of handcuffs had had a legal basis (see paragraph 33 above). When choosing to use handcuffs as means of restraint, the prison had taken into account the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances \u2013 he had committed numerous disciplinary violations while in prison and had behaved aggressively towards other prisoners and prison officers (see paragraphs 27 to 30 above). The Government also referred to the risk assessment questionnaire of 12 August 2016 completed in respect of the applicant, according to which he had refused to work in prison, had used obscene and offensive language and threats, and had been described as impulsive and manipulative. Thus there was reason to believe that the applicant had posed a security risk which could not have been ruled out by his health conditions. In that regard the Government pointed out that the applicant had continued to be aggressive while in hospital (see paragraphs 9 and 13 above). The Government also stressed that the handcuffs had been removed several times each day. The requirement under the Imprisonment Act that a means of restraint could not be used for longer than twelve hours had been met (see paragraph 33 above). In addition, two pairs of handcuffs had been linked together and the handcuffed hand had been varied to allow for more mobility and relief. The medical file of the applicant did not show that there had been any contraindications in relation to the use of handcuffs on him. In any event, the handcuffs had been removed for the duration of the applicant\u2019s medical procedures. The Government highlighted that after the use of force on 22 September 2016 a medical professional had checked the condition of the applicant and had recorded subcutaneous haematomas, redness of skin and a 1 mm abrasion on a knuckle of the left hand (see paragraph 12 above). However, a doctor had explained to the prison officers on the same morning that the haematoma had been caused by the attachment of a cannula to the applicant. The Government held, moreover, that the level of injury deriving from the use of handcuffs depended also on the behaviour of the person himself \u2013 the more the person shook his arm, the more severe were the marks. The Government also referred to the recent judgment of A.T. v. Estonia (no. 23183/15, \u00a7 59, 13 November 2018), where the Court had pointed out that while being taken to a medical facility outside prison, a prisoner may still pose a threat to medical personnel or other patients and that \u201cstaff in ordinary public hospitals cannot be expected to have the same level of preparedness and training as prison officers to deal with possible risks posed by prisoners\u2019 unpredictable or violent behaviour.\u201d",

The applicant\u2019s complaint had been dealt with effectively and swiftly.

Although later in the same year the applicant was convicted of four counts of having inflicted \u201chealth damage\u201d on prison officers and another prisoner (three of which preceded the incident of 22 September 2016), it does not appear that these were relied on when authorising the constant use of handcuffs on the applicant. More importantly, it does not seem that the security requirements took any account of the applicant\u2019s medical condition and how that could have affected the relevant risk profile. At the same time, the applicant\u2019s health condition \u2013 even if the severity of it was not entirely clear at the time of issuing the order \u2013 could not have been completely unknown to the prison as a heart attack was already suspected when the applicant was taken to the medical ward in prison (see paragraph 6 above). The Court considers that in a situation where the applicant had to be taken to hospital in a hurry, given his state of health, the prison authorities might not have immediately had the time to thoroughly analyse and weigh up all the relevant circumstances when authorising his escort. However, this should not have prevented the authorities from reviewing the situation and the need for the applicant to be constantly handcuffed at a later time, when the applicant was already at the hospital.",

Estonia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 62-63). Moreover, the Court notes that at the material time there were no specific written rules setting a requirement of individualised risk assessment that governed the use of means of restraint in a hospital setting as such or for the regular review of such measures.

Although there is some confusion as to whether the check noted in the ETCH\u2019s records (see paragraph 12 above) was performed briefly before or after the use of force, the Court notes that the injuries recorded in the entry match the ones recorded on the photographs taken at the request of the applicant on the following day and mainly include haematomas on the applicant\u2019s wrists.

It cannot be excluded, as suggested by the Government, that some of the haematomas might have been caused earlier either by the treatment or by continuously wearing handcuffs. Taking into account that the domestic law allowed for the use of force in such circumstances and given that the prison officers were following the terms of the order authorising the escort which obliged the applicant to be handcuffed, the Court does not find that the level of force used by them on that particular occasion was in itself excessive.

Against that background the Court observes that in the instant case the facts were to a great extent clear. The description of the events in the applicant\u2019s and in the prison officers\u2019 written statements did not contain any significant differences. There was no dispute about the use of handcuffs or about the use of force as such. Nor were the perpetrators of the alleged offence unknown.
