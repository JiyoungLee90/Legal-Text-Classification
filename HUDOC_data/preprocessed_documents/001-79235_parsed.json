They referred in that regard to the domestic courts' reasons for the detention. They stressed that there had been a strong suspicion against the applicant, which had been corroborated in the course of the proceedings and had finally led to the applicant's conviction. Furthermore, there had been a risk that the applicant would abscond because of his extremely precarious financial situation, loss of social integration, contacts abroad, foreign nationality and the impending severe sentence. The applicant's accomplice had already escaped justice and the persons behind the criminal organisation by committing suicide. Moreover, the offence in question had been carried out repeatedly and professionally and the applicant's precarious financial situation had worsened in the meantime. Therefore, there had been a danger that the applicant would commit offences of the same type, either in order to improve his financial situation or on account of the influence of the organisation behind the drug trafficking. Until the arrest of Mr P. on 2 June 1999 there had also been the danger of collusion. The pre-trial detention had been proportionate to the seriousness of the offences. Having regard to the complexity of the preliminary investigations involving requests for mutual assistance from several European states, the voluminous file, the need for sufficient time for preparation for trial and the interest of obtaining Mr K.'s direct evidence, which later turned out to be impossible, the length of the criminal proceedings also appeared reasonable. The applicant had not challenged the length of his pre-trial detention in the proceedings by filing a request that a time-limit be set under section 91 of the Courts Act. The Government referred finally to the relevant domestic legislation which guaranteed an effective remedy against and repeated examination of pre-trial detention and provided that the period of such detention was deducted from the sentence.",

Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features and on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic decisions and of the well-documented facts mentioned by the applicant in his applications for release. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, \nW.\u00a0v.\u00a0 , judgment of 26\u00a0January 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0254-A, p.\u00a015, \u00a7\u00a030, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a0152, ECHR 2000IV).

Germany, judgment of 27\u00a0June 1968, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a07, p.\u00a025, \u00a7\u00a014, and B. v.

However, in the present case the national courts also relied on other relevant circumstances; the fact that the applicant was of foreign nationality, had contacts abroad and was in a very precarious financial situation as he was deeply in debt. Furthermore, he had acted in the context of an international criminal organisation and his accomplice had committed suicide before the start of the trial. Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that a substantial risk of the applicant's absconding persisted over the total period of his detention. The Court notes that the authorities did not envisage the possibility of imposing other more lenient measures foreseen by Austrian law to secure a suspect's stay in  (see paragraph 34 above). However, taking account of the applicant's very precarious financial situation and his German nationality, which country has under the Schengen agreement removed border posts and checks between Austria and Germany, the Court can accept that alternative effective measures to secure the applicant's stay in Austria, such as the setting of a bail or the withdrawal of travel documents, did not appear appropriate in the particular circumstances of the present case.",

Nevertheless, when dismissing the applicant's requests for release, the domestic courts continued to rely on the same reasons (see paragraphs 25 and 27 of the judgment). In this context, we recall that, throughout the entire period of the applicant's pre-trial detention, the authorities did not envisage the possibility of imposing the other more lenient measures expressly foreseen by Austrian law in order to secure a suspect's continued presence in  (see paragraph 34 of the judgment). We would emphasise that, under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention, the authorities, when deciding whether a person should be released or detained, are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his or her appearance at trial. Indeed, that provision proclaims not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\u201d but also lays down that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see, amongst other authorities, Jablonski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7\u00a083, 21\u00a0December 2000). Accordingly, we find it open to doubt whether the grounds given by the Austrian courts were sufficient to justify the applicant being kept in pre-trial detention for a period as long as 2 years and 4\u00a0months.",

As to whether the judicial authorities displayed the special diligence required in the conduct of the proceedings, we accept that the applicant's case was certainly complex, in that it concerned a serious offence, namely drug trafficking, which, furthermore, had been committed in the context of an international criminal organisation which operated in more than two countries. However, while the duration of the criminal investigation does not in itself appear excessive, an unjustified delay occurred after the indictment had been issued in May 2000. In particular, it remains unexplained why the first hearing of the applicant's trial was not fixed until four months later, namely on 20 September 2000. Furthermore, and more importantly, a considerable period of time elapsed between the ",
