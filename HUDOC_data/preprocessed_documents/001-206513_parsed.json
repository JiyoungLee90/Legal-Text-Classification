The applicant association clarified that those amounts corresponded to actual loss and loss of profits. The applicant association explained that it had experienced enormous financial losses as a result of the domestic authorities\u2019 decision to dissolve it. On the basis of that decision, it had been excluded from the Croatian Olympic Committee in 2010 (see paragraph 35 above), and from the European and international golfing associations in 2014 (see paragraph 51 above). Consequently, the applicant association had lost its sponsors, partners and donors, and a number of its members had left the association, which had resulted in a loss of income from lost membership fees.",

Moreover, that exclusion was primarily based on the legal effects which the bankruptcy proceedings had on the association (see paragraph 35 above). The Court thus cannot speculate as to whether the exclusion would have occurred in the absence of the domestic authorities\u2019 decision to dissolve the applicant association. The Court therefore rejects the applicant association\u2019s claim in respect of pecuniary damage, as it does not discern a sufficient causal link between the violations found and the pecuniary damage alleged.",
