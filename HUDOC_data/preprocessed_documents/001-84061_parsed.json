There is no uniform practice in the contracting States with regard to the occurrence of a tied vote in decision-making before the Supreme and Constitutional Courts. Many States provide for measures to avoid tied votes and to ensure that a majority is obtained, such as establishing formations made up of an uneven number of judges (for example, in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Malta and the United Kingdom) and/or prohibiting judges from abstaining (for example, in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Moldova) and/or providing for an uneven number of judges to make a decision-making quorum (for example, in Italy, Andorra and Austria). Even in these circumstances, however, a tied vote could still occur. With a view to ensuring that a final decision can be reached, even in the event of a tied vote, different legal systems provide for different solutions, such as a casting vote for the president of the court/formation (for example, in Austria, Italy and Spain) or for the judge rapporteur (for example, in Andorra), or giving an interpretation to the tied vote (for example, in Germany, Poland, Slovakia and Moldova). In the event of a tied vote, the Albanian legal system provides for the adjournment of the case for an unspecified period of time until the circumstances that created the tied vote have ceased to exist (see paragraph 72 above).",

Once the liquidation order has been made, the liquidator is responsible for the administration of the company\u2019s assets. Indeed, it is self-evident in the Court\u2019s view that disputes over such matters may have major repercussions on the assets and liabilities of the company\u2019s estate. The Court consequently finds that the restriction is intended to protect the rights and interests of others, namely those of the company\u2019s creditors. The Court will go on to examine whether the consequences suffered by the applicant were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, Luordo v.\u00a0, no. 32190/96, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2003-IX).",

In that connection, the Court observes that the winding-up proceedings in the present case lasted four years. The applicant was able to contest the winding-up proceedings before four levels of jurisdiction. Hence, it cannot be considered that his right of access to a court was unreasonably limited. Furthermore, even assuming that the applicant\u2019s complaint concerned the conduct of the liquidator, he failed to challenge that conduct before the domestic courts.",

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions. To construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would indeed be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6.
