Bulgaria, no. 73281/01, \u00a7 74, 6 November 2008). On the facts, the Court finds nothing unreasonable or arbitrary in the impugned decision as the trial court seemed to have been acting in good faith and may well have had good reasons to believe that in the circumstances of the case a fresh expert examination was justified and necessary. It is true that, in view of the Court's conclusions in paragraph 90 below, the examination in question could have been conducted in a different form, namely in an outpatient, and not in-patient, setting.

In such cases the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita v.

As the Court has consistently held, the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 3 does not give judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until his conviction the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (see, among other authorities, Castravet v. Moldova, no. 23393/05, \u00a7 30, 13 March 2007; McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006-X; Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v.

Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention cannot be seen as unconditionally authorising detention provided that it lasts no longer than a certain period. Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2003-I).",

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7 67, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85, 26 July 2001). The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and must set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is not the Court's task to establish such facts and take the place of the national authorities which ruled on the applicant's detention. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic courts' decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Korchuganova v.

Nor can continuation of detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, \u00a7 101, 1 March 2007; Panchenko v. Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7 102, 8 February 2005; and Goral v. Poland, no. 38654/97, \u00a7\u00a068, 30 October 2003). The Court further reiterates that any system of mandatory detention pending trial is incompatible per se with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it being incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish and demonstrate the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty (see Belevitskiy, cited above, \u00a7 102, with further references). As regards the existence of a risk of absconding, the Court reiterates that such a danger cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the sentence faced. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Panchenko, cited above, \u00a7 106; and Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, \u00a7 43, Series A no. 207). In the present case the decisions of the domestic authorities gave no reasons why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of his applications for release, they considered the risk of his absconding to be decisive. The domestic decisions merely hinted at the existence of sufficient grounds to believe that the defendants would abscond, without saying what those grounds actually were. Since neither the trial court nor the Government in the proceedings before the Court have been able to substantiate the allegations that the applicant might obstruct the course of justice and abscond, the Court finds that the existence of such a risk was not established.",

Russia, no. 47095/99, \u00a7 124, ECHR 2002VI), and ended on 4 September 2002 with the judgment of the Military Court of the Tyumen Garrison (see paragraph 49). It follows that the period to be taken into consideration lasted for two years, three months and three days. The Court reiterates in the first place that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, amongst many others, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.
