The Court therefore considers that the injuries observed in those photographs, which are consistent with the content of the medical reports issued subsequently, were sustained on 1 May 2006. As to whether the applicants sustained those injuries during the demonstration, the Court notes that the Government submitted that there was no image in the police forces\u2019 video recordings showing the applicants being ill-treated by police. Nevertheless, the Government did not deny the applicants\u2019 claim that they had participated in the demonstration, during which they had been injured. Besides, in their observations submitted to the Court, the Government contended that the applicants had sustained those injuries in the chaotic atmosphere which existed at the time, after the police had used force against some of the demonstrators. What is more, according to the medical reports issued with regard to the applicants, the injuries observed on their bodies were the result of blunt trauma, a finding which is consistent with the applicants\u2019 allegation that they had been beaten with truncheons (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the applicants were injured during the demonstration of 1\u00a0May 2006 when the police used force to disperse protestors.",

In addition, the Court reiterates that the rights enshrined in the Convention are practical and effective, and not theoretical or illusory. Therefore, in such cases, an effective investigation must be able to lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Orhan Kur v. Turkey, no. 32577/02, \u00a7\u00a046, 3 June 2008).",

Secondly, the public prosecutor failed to enquire whether the applicants had engaged in any of the acts of violence referred to in the police report. Thirdly, it appears that the findings of the medical reports were not given serious consideration, despite the severity of the injuries noted therein. Finally, the prosecutor also appears to have failed to secure statements from potential eyewitnesses and did not examine video recordings of the incidents other than those submitted by the police.",
