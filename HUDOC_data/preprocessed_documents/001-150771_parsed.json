Following an appeal by Mr Neshkov, in a decision of 16 December 2008 (\u043e\u043f\u0440.\u00a0\u2116\u00a013975 \u043e\u0442 16\u00a0\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2008 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 14809/2008 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406\u0406\u0406 \u043e.) the Supreme Administrative Court quashed that decision and directed that the claim be examined on the merits.

It noted that the exact periods of time when he had been housed in Stara Zagora Prison in 2002-08 could only be established for 2007, because the prison\u2019s records for the remaining years had not been preserved. In 2007, Mr Neshkov had been housed in this prison on five occasions: on 18-19 January, alone in a cell; on 30-31 March, in a cell with three other inmates; on 4-6 April, in a cell with three other inmates; on 14-15 June, in a cell with two other inmates; and on 3-4 July, in a cell with one other inmate. During these periods, he had not been provided with bed linen. The cells in which he had been kept had been infested with cockroaches, had not been sufficiently lit during the day but constantly lit at night, and had not had in-cell toilets. As a result, Mr Neshkov had had to relieve himself in a bucket and urinate in a plastic bottle. The court made no findings in relation to the size of the cells or the number of inmates held in them, noting that at the relevant time there had been no binding legal requirement for minimum space per prisoner. However, it went on to say that Mr Neshkov had failed to prove that he had suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of these conditions. Moreover, he had only spent short periods of time in these cells. While a long period of time in such extremely poor conditions of detention could cause mental suffering, the same could not be said of a short period. There was therefore no damage to make good.",

For instance, the lower court had held Mr Neshkov\u2019s omission to present medical evidence on his state of health against him without instructing him to present such evidence. Since it was apparently of the view that such evidence was required, it could have even appointed a medical expert of its own motion.

It found that after his admission to Varna Prison, between 19 June and 19 August 2002 Mr Neshkov had been kept in cell no. 15. This cell had measured twelve by three metres and had been full of beds and cabinets. Mr Neshkov had had to share the cell with ten to fifteen other inmates, some of whom smokers. The cell had not had proper artificial lighting or access to sunlight. It had not had a ventilation system either, and it had not been possible to air it properly because its windows could not open widely. Nor had the cell had a toilet; it had only been equipped with a bucket for sanitary needs. Following a serious deterioration in Mr Neshkov\u2019s mental state as a result of the conditions in this cell, on 19 August 2002 the prison administration had moved him to cell no. 24, an isolation cell, where he had remained alone. This cell had not had a ventilation system or direct access to sunlight, because its window had been covered with a metal sheet. It had not had a toilet or any furniture apart from a bed. During his time in this cell \u2013 until\u00a019 November 2002 \u2013 Mr Neshkov had not always been allowed to use the half-an-hour out-of-cell time permitted three times a day under his prison regime. After that he had been moved for a period of about eight or nine months to cell no. 19a, which had been two by two metres and had only been equipped with a bed and a bucket for sanitary needs. This cell\u2019s window had been covered with a perforated metal sheet. The court said that the evidence presented by Mr Neshkov did not enable it to make any findings of fact in relation to the period after 19 August 2003.",

The cell had two windows close to the ceiling, one metre by fifty centimetres each, which allegedly did not allow direct sunlight into the cell or its proper ventilation. Since there were no cells for non-smokers, Mr Tsekov had to share the cell with smokers, which was allegedly particularly problematic for him in view of the lack of ventilation. According to the Government, the issue of smoking was being resolved amicably among the cellmates; according to Mr Tsekov, that was absolutely not the case. He said that the problem could not be solved as up to 90% of inmates in Burgas Prison were smokers. Mr Tsekov was not one, and he only received cigarettes from the outside to use them as currency, as was customary in the prison. He also said that there were four or five television sets in the cell that showed different programmes, which, given the little space available and the level of noise, made it impossible to watch television. There were no newspapers or magazines available in the prison either, and access to the poorly stocked library was only possible once a week.",

In support of this assertion he pointed out that two researches retained by his legal representative in these proceedings had visited Pleven Prison on 24\u00a0September 2014 and spoken with the prison\u2019s deputy governor, who had said that there were currently no records on the allocation of prisoners in 2007-10. Both he and members of the prison staff had explained that at that time all prisoners without final convictions and sentences had been placed on the prison\u2019s fourth floor, where their cells were separated by mere iron grills allowing free contacts between all inmates.",

In reply, Mr Yordanov said that he had not made such complaints because conditions in the prison had been the same for all prisoners, but that, as evident from a complaint that he had filed on 19 January 2010, he had sought a transfer to Vratsa Prison precisely because of the poor conditions in Pleven Prison.

The proper approach was to analyse them in combination and focus on their cumulative effect on the inmate\u2019s well-being. That part of the case was therefore to be remitted. The head of claim concerning the failure to provide Mr Yordanov with a hot meal was, for its part, unfounded, because there was evidence that he had been provided with a sufficiently calorific food package instead.

It noted that the lower court had constituted as a co-defendant the administration of Stara Zagora Prison, which could not be a proper defendant to a claim under section 1 of the 1988 Act. Its judgment was therefore inadmissible. The proceedings on remittal are apparently still pending.",

Any strategy for the sustainable reduction of the prison population must include a variety of steps to ensure that imprisonment (whether awaiting trial or following conviction) really is a measure of last resort. This implies, in the first place, an emphasis on non-custodial measures in the period before the imposition of a sentence and the availability to the judiciary, especially in less serious cases, of alternatives to custodial sentences together with an encouragement to use those options. Further, the adoption of measures to facilitate the reintegration into society of persons who have been deprived of their liberty could reduce the rate of reoffending.",

The allegations referred to prisoners being asked to pay money to prison/medical staff in order to be allowed to benefit from services provided for by law (e.g. access to medical care, transfer to a hospital, transfer to prison hostels, early release) or to be granted certain privileges (access to work for instance). Irrespective of whether each and every allegation is well-founded, the frequency, consistency and seriousness of the allegations received during the visit is a clear indication of a major problem. The CPT wishes to stress that the widespread conviction alone of the existence of a culture of corruption in a place of detention brings in its wake discrimination, violence, insecurity and, ultimately, a loss of respect for authority. The CPT calls upon the Bulgarian authorities to take decisive action to combat the phenomenon of corruption in all prisons. Prison staff and public officials associated with the prison system should be given the clear message that seeking advantages from prisoners or their relatives is not acceptable; this message should be reiterated in an appropriate form at suitable intervals.",

In particular, prison staff must be alert to signs of trouble and be both resolved and properly trained to intervene. Such a capacity to intervene will of course depend, inter alia, on an adequate staff/prisoner ratio and on providing all staff members with appropriate initial and advanced training. In addition, the prison system as a whole may need to develop the capacity to ensure that potentially incompatible categories of prisoners are not accommodated together.

However, it became clear during the visit that prisoners who did not have the state health insurance were unable to receive specialist/outside hospital care, except in emergencies. On a number of occasions, the delegation had to intervene to ensure that prisoners with serious health problems who did not have medical insurance were referred to hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

During the preceding twenty years, major repairs had only been carried out in one prison and three old buildings had been converted into open-type prison hostels. He went on to say that his inspections had led him to conclude that the conditions in almost all prisons and closed-type prison hostels could be characterised as subjecting the inmates to inhuman or degrading treatment. In relation in particular to overcrowding, the Ombudsman was of the view that Bulgarian law did not lay down any mechanism allowing the enforcement of minimum standards on the housing of prisoners. An amendment to the Execution of Punishments and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009 in December 2012 had made provision for the transfer of prisoners to another facility in case of lack of capacity of the prison to which they had been allocated (see paragraph 111 below). However, this possibility could serve no practical purpose, because all prisons in the country, except two correctional institutions for juveniles and Sliven Prison, which housed female prisoners, were overcrowded, in the sense of providing less than four square metres per prisoner. The worst example was Burgas Prison, where the available space per inmate was one square metre, which was in practice even less, because that was not the unencumbered area but the living area, including the space occupied by beds and tables. In the Ombudsman\u2019s opinion, the architecture of the old prisons did not allow conditions for individual work with inmates and required additional staff to ensure their safety. The construction of toilets had caused a reduction in the amount of living space. Moreover, construction works required the emptying of parts of the prisons, which led to even more overcrowding. In most prisons, reconstruction was impossible in practice. It would partly improve conditions, but would not solve the issue of overcrowding. There was therefore an urgent need to build new prisons and prison hostels. The Ombudsman outlined the possibilities in that regard.",

During the previous four years the daily food allowance per inmate had increased from BGN 1.30 (0.66 euros (EUR)) to BGN 2.50 (EUR 1.28), but this largely reflected food price inflation. Eggs, dairy products and fruits were a rarity on the prisoners\u2019 menu. Fruits and vegetables were not readily available even in prison food shops.

One reason for that had been the introduction of probation as a form of sentence in respect of many offences, but there was room for increased use of this option as an alternative to custody, as well as for more release on parole. An action plan for 2010-13 for improving the prison estate had not been fully implemented for financial reasons. However, works had been carried out in a number of facilities: a prison hostel in Pleven had been converted into a closed-type prison, in-cell toilets been installed in the life prisoners\u2019 section of Varna Prison, and minor renovations had been carried out in eight prisons. There were plans to build a new hostel attached to Burgas Prison, able to hold four hundred and fifty inmates, with Norwegian funding. However, any further improvement was contingent on the finding of sources of extra-budgetary funding. There was no preventive remedy, and there were issues with the operation of the existing compensatory remedy, such as conflicting decisions no very similar facts and the lack of a statutory rule on the minimum amount of space per prisoner, which precluded the courts from considering this as a factor in the assessment of prison conditions under Article 3 of the Convention.",

It also noted that crime in Bulgaria was falling, and that in 2012, only 47.5% of those convicted of a criminal offence had been given an effective sentence, with conditional sentences imposed on 37.6% and 11% released for criminal liability. However, there was more that could be done in this respect. For instance, prosecutors could be empowered to resort to alternatives to prosecution, such as formal warnings, mediation and reparation programmes or community work, early in the criminal process, but with appropriate monitoring to reduce the risk of corruption. In 2013, there had been 22,029 persons placed in pre-trial detention, spending an average of forty-one days in custody. This suggested that pre-trial detention was routinely being imposed in respect of certain charges, and that alternatives to pre-trial detention could be used to result the number of people in custody. There was also room for reducing the percentage of custodial sentences, which stood at either 48% or 66.2% for 2012, by resorting more readily to probation or fines, especially with respect to offenders given sentences of less than six months (47% in 2012) or between six months and a year (29% in 2012). Those offenders were apparently perceived as low-risk, and it was well known that short sentences were the most ineffective ones in terms of offender rehabilitation, while at the same time the most disruptive ones in terms of impact on the lives of those concerned. Resort to the automatic remission of sentences could also be envisaged as well as expanding and improving the use of parole, in line with Recommendation Rec(2003)22 of the Committee of Ministers on conditional release (parole), and the use of waiting lists.",

Such plans existed, but none of them had come to fruition. The authorities were looking at various options to ensure extra-budgetary funding for this. Renovating existing prisons, some of which were in a very poor state of repair, was a very difficult and expensive option; building new ones was a superior alternative. Changes had to be envisaged in respect of the investigation detention facilities as well. There was also a lot that could be done with respect to prisoner allocation. According to the authorities, the total number of persons held in prisons and prison hostels on 31 December 2013 was 8,449, for an official capacity of 8,763. This meant that the penitentiary system as a whole was not overcrowded according to local norms. However, on the same date Burgas Prison held 1,057 inmates for an official capacity of 547 and Bobov Dol Prison held 665 inmates for an official capacity of 530, whereas Sofia Prison had 1,471 inmates for an official capacity of 1,671. There were thus pockets of massive overcrowding while some prisons were underused. This was largely due to the rules on the classification of prisons and prison regimes in the Execution of Punishments and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009, which left the criminal courts little discretion in allocating offenders to one or another regime or prison. For instance, recidivists and those sentenced to more than years\u2019 imprisonment were automatically allocated to closed-type prisons. Since 47% of custodial sentences were for less than six months, the statutory requirement to have served at least six months to qualify for a transfer from a prison or a closedtype prison hostel to an open-type prison hostel (see paragraph 113 below) meant that no recidivist could hope to obtain such transfer; those serving sentences ranging between six months and a year (29% of all prisoners in 2012) could also find it difficult to obtain a transfer. As a result of those rigid rules, prisons and close-type prison hostels were overcrowded while open-type prison hostels were underused. The report urged more flexibility in this respect. As regards remedies, there was perhaps a need to overhaul the applicable statutes, putting the emphasis on the rights of prisoners and on the ways in which they could be enforced. The authorities also had to strengthen the role of the Ombudsman as national preventive mechanism under the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. There was in addition a need for better cooperation between the various actors involved; the report therefore recommended that a coordinating body be set up under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice.",

However, in December 2012, at the proposal of the Council of Ministers, Parliament decided to amend paragraph 13 of the transitional and concluding provisions of the Act, postponing the entry into force of section 43(3) until 1 January 2019. The explanatory notes to the bill for the amendment of the Act said that the postponement was necessary because, in view of the economic situation in the country, it would be extremely hard to attain the goal of four square metres per inmate before the end of 2012. In these circumstances, the entry of the provision into force would only increase inmates\u2019 resentment and the number of adverse judgments of this Court against Bulgaria, whose execution would require large sums of money for the payment of just satisfaction awards, and which would have a negative effect on the country\u2019s standing in the European Union.

In assessing this point, the courts often only had regard to the specific rules laid down in the relevant statutes or statutory instruments.

The request is to be made to the competent administrative court (Article 251 \u00a7 1), which has to deal with it immediately\u00a0(Article 252 \u00a7 1) and, having made the necessary inquiries (Article 252(2)-(4)), rule forthwith (Article 253 \u00a7 1). The court\u2019s decision is subject to appeal, which does not have suspensive effect (Article\u00a0254\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0and 2). In a decision of 2 February 2009 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed a life prisoner\u2019s legal challenge under Article 250 \u00a7 1 to, inter alia, the fact that the prison authorities were keeping him in a cell without a toilet or running water as being out of the scope of this provision (see \u043e\u043f\u0440.\u00a0\u2116 1366 \u043e\u0442 2 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2009 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 498/2009 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.).

The court examined the request on its merits but found that under the applicable provisions of the Execution of Punishments and PreTrial Detention Act 2009 and the regulations for its application, life prisoners were to be kept in isolation even when their prison regime had been relaxed, and could only be moved in the common areas if a special commission found that their personality permitted it. There was therefore no unlawful act that needed to be cut short by the court. In a decision of 19\u00a0September 2011 (\u043e\u043f\u0440.\u00a0\u2116\u00a011630 \u043e\u0442 19 \u0441\u0435\u043f\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2011 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116\u00a010959/2011 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406\u0406\u0406 \u043e.) the Supreme Administrative Court upheld this decision, fully agreeing with its reasoning.",

                                        "content": "138.\u00a0\u00a0Articles 256 and 257 of the same Code, which likewise came into force on 1 March 2007, provide that a person may bring proceedings to enjoin an administrative authority to carry out an act that it has the duty to carry out under a legal provision. If the court allows the claim, it must order the authority to carry out the act within a fixed time-limit. In 2009 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed a challenge under these provisions to an alleged failure of a prison governor to provide adequate food to inmates (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 5924 \u043e\u0442 11 \u043c\u0430\u0439 2009 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 12132/2008 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406\u0406\u0406 \u043e.). However, in 2011 that court allowed a life prisoner\u2019s claim relating to the failure of the prison authorities to provide him with clothing, shoes and bed linen (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 9276 \u043e\u0442 27 \u044e\u043d\u0438 2011 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116\u00a05747/2011 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406\u0406\u0406 \u043e.). The Pleven Administrative Court also recently made such an order, but its judgment is apparently not yet final (see\u00a0paragraphs 28-31 of Appendix 1). In June 2014 that court dismissed a claim by an inmate to be sent for medical treatment in an outside hospital, noting that he could obtain the requisite medical care in prison and that the prison governor had taken steps to arrange for such care (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 8454 \u043e\u0442\u00a020\u00a0\u044e\u043d\u0438 2014 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 14001/2013 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406\u0406\u0406 \u043e.).",

Section 146(2) provides that with a view to correcting infringements public prosecutors may order the release of any person who is being detained unlawfully, give instructions for the correction of irregularities, or stay the enforcement of any unlawful decisions and seek their quashing.

The existence of positive relations between staff and prisoners, based on the notions of secure custody and care, is a decisive factor in this context; this will depend in large measure on staff possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills. Further, management must be prepared fully to support staff in the exercise of their authority.

Another approach is to disperse prisoners suspected or convicted of sexual offences throughout the prison concerned. If such an approach is to succeed, the necessary environment for the proper integration of such prisoners into ordinary cell blocks must be guaranteed; in particular, the prison staff must be sincerely committed to dealing firmly with any signs of hostility or persecution. A third approach can consist of transferring prisoners to another establishment, accompanied by measures aimed at concealing the nature of their offence. Each of these policies has its advantages and disadvantages, and the CPT does not seek to promote a given approach as opposed to another.

It was true that for a period of time the civil and then the administrative courts had construed this provision somewhat formally, taking a narrow view of what constituted unlawful acts or omissions on the part of the prison authorities, and requiring claimants to split up their claims to reflect discrete problematic aspects of the conditions of their detention. However, in the past few years the administrative courts had started consistently to interpret this provision extensively and had displayed flexibility in relation to the requisite level of proof. They still required claimants to make out the existence of an unlawful act or omission, damage, and a direct and proximate causal link between the damage and the act or omission, but the number of successful claims was clearly on the rise. In support of their assertion, the Government referred to five judgments given by first-instance administrative courts in 2013 and 2014 and ten judgments given by the Supreme Administrative Court between February and July 2014 (see paragraphs 7, 14, 30, 35, 44, 63, 65, 74, 108, 115, 116, 117, 119, 134 and 138 of Appendix 1). In their view, these judgments demonstrated the effectiveness of proceedings under section 1 of the 1988 Act. The courts could not be expected to disregard or reverse the burden of proof, or to stop requiring claimants in such proceedings to pay court fees and expenses for expert reports and bear the defendants\u2019 costs in case they lost the case. While prisoner claimants, being in the custody of the authority that they sued, were disadvantaged vis-\u00e0-vis regular claimants, administrative court judges could not simply find for them and award them damages without establishing a sufficient causal link between the damage suffered by them and the defendant authority\u2019s conduct. It had to be also borne in mind that legal aid was available in such proceedings.",

His first claim had been rejected because he had spent very short periods of time in Stara Zagora Prison and could not have therefore suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of the poor conditions there. His second claim had been rejected on account of the expiry of the relevant limitation period. This could not be held against the authorities, either on account of the legislature enacting a statute of limitations or of the courts applying it when deciding Mr Neshkov\u2019s case. The mere fact that Mr Neshkov had not been successful did not mean that the remedy that he had used was ineffective. It was worth noting in that connection that another claim brought by him in relation to the failure of the administration of Varna Prison to provide him with bed sheets for two periods of time in 2007 and 2008 had resulted in an award of damages.",

Such proceedings could have some, albeit indirect, preventive effect with respect to conditions of detention, depending on the specific underlying issue. In cases where this issue related to the regime of the inmate\u2019s detention, such proceedings could not grant relief because this regime was determined by a special commission. Some injunctions had been refused because the statutory requirement for a minimum of four square metres of living space per inmate was not yet in force. Some requests were baseless or made without sufficient legal interest on the part of the inmate. Mr Neshkov had made many such requests. One of them, concerning the amount of living space in his cell, had been turned down in January 2013 because his cellmate had been moved elsewhere and because the statutory requirement for a minimum of four square metres per inmate had still not come into effect.",

The possibility of making complaints to the prison authorities and on that basis seeking transfer to another correctional facility could in theory provide relief. However, that remedy was very uncertain, and had not worked in his case. Moreover, the prison authorities did not have the requisite independence.

For instance, when deciding whether any \u201cunlawful\u201d acts or omissions had taken place in relation to conditions of detention, the courts often only took into account domestic legal provisions. Other problems came from the lack of clarity about which authority was the proper defendant to such claims and from instructions by the courts to prisoners to split up their claims into separate heads with a view to considering each element of the conditions of their detention individually in terms of its effect on the prisoner\u2019s well-being. Thus, if some aspects of these conditions did not, when considered in isolation, run counter to a specific domestic rule, the courts were inclined to find that the conditions were \u201clawful\u201d. Another issue arose in relation to the requirement to prove the existence of non-pecuniary damage through objective, extrinsic evidence, such as witness statements or documents. As a result, claims of emotional distress were almost invariably dismissed as unsubstantiated. Nor did the courts permit damage to health to be proved through witness evidence; they always required expert evidence on that. The awards of damages were often too low, and sometimes diminished even further by the requirement, in cases where the claim had only been partly allowed, for the claimant to bear the costs of the defendant State authority in proportion to the rejected part of the claim. Nor could a claim under section 1 of the 1988 Act provide relief in respect of conditions that flowed directly from the prison regime applicable to the inmate concerned.",

However, once the impugned situation has come to an end because this person has been released or placed in conditions that meet the requirements of Article 3, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for any breach that has already taken place.

As a result, in the absence of a concrete domestic-law rule governing a particular aspect of these conditions \u2013 such as a rule laying down the minimum space per prisoner, or a rule requiring that toilets be properly installed in each cell \u2013 the courts often found no illegality, and did not go on to examine whether these matters could, when taken alone or together with other aspects of the conditions in which the inmate was held, constituted inhuman and degrading treatment (see\u00a0paragraph 132 above). In some cases, the courts even required inmates to split up their claims to reflect the particular issues that affected them and then proceeded to examine these claims separately (see paragraph 134 above). In this way, the courts did not review the acts or omissions alleged to amount to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention in line with the principles and standards laid down by this Court in its case-law \u2013 which according to circumstances may require a cumulative approach \u2013 even though under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the 1991 Constitution the Convention is part of Bulgarian law (see paragraph 95-97 above). Even in the few cases in which they had regard to the general prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment, the courts saw it more as an aid in the interpretation of concrete statutory or regulatory provisions rather than a fully-fledged norm whose breach could in itself prompt them to grant redress in respect of Convention rights (see paragraph 133 above). Thus, when they examined such claims, the courts did not focus so much on the inmate\u2019s right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment; they instead limited their examination to the lawfulness, within the meaning of domestic law, of the actions of the prison authorities.",

However, with two exceptions, which concerned very concrete statutory duties of the prison authorities \u2013 two cases concerning failures to provide prisoners with clothes and shoes \u2013 it does not appear that the administrative courts have thus far interpreted these provisions in a way enabling an inmate or a group of inmates to obtain a more general improvement of the conditions of their confinement (see paragraphs 116, 137 and 138 above). Moreover, the second of these cases has still not been finally decided, and that, as noted above, the administrative courts have a tendency to regard acts or omissions as unlawful only if they fail to conform to a very specific statutory duty or proscription rather than to the broader prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment. Therefore, this remedy, while theoretically capable of providing redress to the applicants, does not appear, for the time being, to be capable of doing so in practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Slovenia, nos. 5774/10 and 5985/10, \u00a7\u00a7 112 and 114, 20 October 2011; Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 110 and 217; and Harakchiev and Tolumov v.

In his 2012 report the Ombudsman said that the possibility for inmates to seek transfer to another correctional facility to escape overcrowding was of no practical use because all prisons in the country, except two correctional institutions for juveniles and Sliven Prison, which housed female prisoners, were overcrowded, in the sense of providing less than four square metres per prisoner (see paragraph 78 above). This is largely confirmed, at least as regards prisons and closed-type prison hostels, by the statistical data supplied by the Government about the situation in correctional facilities in December 2013 (see paragraph 143 above). Moreover, by statute the possibility for a transfer from a prison or a closed-type prison hostel to an open-type prison hostel is only available to prisoners who have spent at least six months in such facilities and have less than five years remaining of their sentence (see paragraph 113 above). As pointed out in the McManus report (see paragraph 91 above), that deprives a large category of prisoners of this possibility and makes it difficult to attain for another substantial category. It should also be noted in this connection that under Bulgarian law decisions of the prison authorities on transfers between prisons are apparently regarded as fully discretionary and not compellable by means of an injunction (see paragraphs 111, 112 and 114 above). Inmates do not have a right to be transferred if they so request, which means that the possibility is not a remedy for the purposes of Article\u00a013 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 110).",

However, although the absolute number of prisoners had not increased, the country\u2019s population \u2013 especially persons aged between of twenty and thirty-nine, who were statistically most likely to be imprisoned \u2013 had shrunk considerably, in particular as a result of emigration. The share of the prison population in relation to the population at large had thus in effect increased.",

Since the fall of the regime, no investment had been made in new correctional facilities, and conditions in the existing ones had noticeably deteriorated. The authorities were well aware of that, as shown by a number of statements on the issue by various public officials. A programme to ensure at least four square metres per inmate by the end of 2013 had been postponed until 2019.",

However, several prisons, such as this in Burgas, had remained consistently overcrowded. Its design capacity was\u00a0371 inmates, and when last visited by the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee in 2013 it housed almost 900. On the fourth floor, 240 inmates were held in cells containing between 15 and 44 persons. One cell, measuring 55 square metres, contained 40 bunk beds in three layers, for 44 inmates, four of whom had to sleep on the floor. The free space in this cell consisted of narrow paths between the beds. In most cells the windows could not be opened without moving the beds. The corridors were overcrowded as well. None of the cells was equipped with a toilet, and there were only three toilets for the entire floor, with appalling hygiene. There was only one bathroom with one shower. As the cells were locked at night, prisoners had to relieve themselves in buckets in the presence of their cellmates. The lack of in-cell toilets was a problem in Varna and Stara Zagora Prisons as well. On 31 December 2013 cells without toilets in these three prisons housed 1,700 inmates. The recent reduction in the number of inmates and a re-drawing of prisons\u2019 catchment areas in 2013 did relieve the overcrowding situation in some prisons, such as these in Lovech and Pazardzhik. However, in other prisons, such as this in Burgas, the situation worsened, with space per prisoner in some cells falling to less than one square metre. This prompted another re-drawing of prisons\u2019 catchment areas in the spring of 2014, which resulted in a slight reduction of the level of overcrowding in Burgas. While prison hostels generally provided better conditions, some were also overcrowded. For instance, the prison hostel in Kremikovtsi, designed for 300 inmates, usually had more than 500, sometimes even up to 700. In some cells, 20 to 23 prisoners lived in\u00a050\u00a0square metres with only one in-cell toilet.",

Since all prisoners but those serving life sentences were kept in common cells unlocked during the day, the guards had no possibility to supervise them properly. The shortage of prison staff added to the problem. For instance, in Varna Prison one guard had to supervise a corridor with 300 inmates, and on the fourth floor of Burgas Prison, one guard had to supervise up to 240 inmates. Close-circuit television surveillance could not fix this because it did not cover all areas. The available statistical data suggested that not all cases were properly recorded, let alone punished. Sexual violence among prisoners was also rife. Lastly, there were a number of problems in relation to solitary confinement, which was used as a disciplinary measure.",

In the assessment of the amount of available space, account must be taken of the space occupied by furniture and fixtures in the cell.

From the findings of the Varna Administrative Court it can been seen that between June and August 2002 Mr Neshkov had to share this cell, which, according to the Government measured 6.5 by 3.2 metres, with ten to fifteen other inmates (see paragraph 32 above). After that, he was moved, for about two months, to a small and dark isolation cell that had no toilet and had a window covered by a metal sheet, and then, for eight or nine months, to an even smaller cell that measured about 2 by 2 metres, and had no toilet and a window covered with a perforated metal sheet (ibid.). These cells remained locked except for three periods of 30 to 40 minutes in the morning, at lunch and in the evening (see paragraph 12 above). There is no evidence that this state of affairs came to an end in August 2003. After it visited Varna Prison in 2010, the CPT described it as \u201cmarked by extreme overcrowding\u201d, with space per prisoner being at best around two square metres and on occasion little more than one square metre (see paragraph 72 above). The CPT also noted the extreme dilapidation of the prison building and the very poor hygiene in it (ibid.). It is true that this visit took place about five years after Mr Neshkov had been transferred to another prison. But there is nothing to suggest that the material conditions in Varna Prison dramatically changed\u00a0between 2003 and 2010, or that the level of overcrowding there in 2002-05 \u2013 when the overall number of prisoners in Bulgaria was about the same as in 2010 (see paragraph 219 above) \u2013 was significantly lower than in 2010. The CPT\u2019s findings may therefore inform the Court\u2019s assessment (see, mutatis mutandis, Iovchev, cited above, \u00a7 130, and Todor Todorov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 50765/99, \u00a7 47, 5 April 2007). It is very unlikely that Mr\u00a0Neshkov remained unaffected by the problems noted by the CPT, or that the living conditions that he was afforded in Varna Prison between 2003 and 2005 were up to Convention standards (see, mutatis mutandis, Orchowski, cited above, \u00a7 131).",

Coupled with the extremely limited amount of personal space available to Mr Neshkov, part of the time as a result of overcrowding and part of the time as a result of the small size of the cells in which he was kept alone, it is sufficient to find that the conditions in which he was kept in Varna Prison amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. As noted by the CPT in paragraph 50 of the Second General Report on its activities, the cumulative effect of overcrowding and inadequate access to toilet facilities can prove extremely detrimental to prisoners (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a0145 above).",

Moreover, throughout the entire period 2007-10 the floor on which Mr Yordanov was kept was overcrowded as a whole, as was Pleven Prison in general (see paragraph 55 above). In addition, until September 2008 Mr Yordanov was forced, as a result of the lack of ready access to toilet facilities at night, to relieve himself in a bucket in the cell in the presence of his cellmates (see\u00a0paragraph 54 above). There is no information on the amount of space per inmate in Lovech Prison, where Mr Yordanov was transferred in July 2010, but the data supplied by the Government shows that on 31 December 2013 it was overcrowded. Moreover, in this prison there were apparently problems with heating in winter and with hygiene in the toilets. In Atlant Prison Hostel, where Mr Yordanov was transferred in January 2012, he is apparently also kept in overcrowded conditions, in a cell providing between\u00a04.2 and 2.7 square metres per person, without discounting the space taken by furniture and fixtures in the cell (see paragraph 61 above).",

For instance, resorting to alternative modes of punishments, such as probation, and the re-distribution of prisoners between correctional facilities had led to a reduction in the amount of overcrowding. There had been about 11,000 prisoners in the country in 2007, and only about 9,000 at the end of 2013. Significant advances had been made in material conditions: a new medical centre had been built in Sliven Prison with Norwegian financing; all cells in Varna Prison had been renovated and fitted with toilets; the heating system in Lovech Prison had been fully renovated; a number of urgent repairs had been carried out in most prisons; and a new hostel attached to Burgas Prison was due to be built soon. The Government had devised a strategy for developing the correctional facilities in 2009-15, but its full implementation had been postponed until 2019, with a view to bringing conditions in these facilities in line with international standards. That strategy had been accompanied by an action plan for the period 2012-13. The main difficulty standing in the way of the full realisation of these instruments had been the lack of funds.",

They referred to a statement by the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Punishments that said that unsatisfactory buildings, poor material conditions and overcrowding in the prisons were justifiably being criticised by various international bodies. The penitentiary system had for several decades experienced serious difficulties relating to the old and dilapidated prison buildings, which had to be operated above capacity. The main prison buildings in Lovech, Pazardzhik, Vratsa, Stara Zagora, Varna and Burgas had been built in the 1920s and 1930s. The oldest was Sofia Prison, which had been built about a century ago. The prisons in Bobov Dol and Pleven were former workers\u2019 dormitories adopted for use as prisons. The capacity of closed-type correctional facilities, which housed the highest number of inmates, had not been increased for years. The funds earmarked for their refurbishment were minimal. Space in correctional facilities was insufficient and they were overcrowded, largely because for years no new prison had been built. Bulgaria was the only member State of the European Union that had not constructed a new prison building for more than 80 years. It was difficult to adapt antiquated and dysfunctional prison buildings to modern requirements. Moreover, for years no serious financial means had been set aside for the refurbishment and modernisation of these buildings. As a result, most were in a poor state of repair and provided bad material conditions. The available budgetary funds were scarce, and for this reason the Ministry of Justice was trying to find external financing.",

In recent times, there had been a discernible improvement in material conditions and the provision of medical care to inmates. The situation in the present case was different from that obtaining in Orchowski and Norbert Sikorski (both cited above), as in Bulgaria the Constitutional Court had not given any ruling with respect of conditions of detention. Nor were the prison authorities systemically failing to provide proper conditions of detention; any failings in relation to the refurbishment of old facilities and the construction of new ones, and the resulting poor conditions and overcrowding, were not due to a lack of efforts on the part of these authorities but to financial difficulties engendered by the country\u2019s economic situation.

Overcrowding in Bulgarian prisons was also a systemic problem noted by the Committee of Ministers and the CPT. In view of its prevalence, there were no effective remedies available. Another systemic problem was the lack of proper medical care in prisons, due to an acute shortage of qualified medical personnel and excessive reliance on feldshers. The lack of properly functioning administrative preventive remedies in respect of conditions of detention was also a structural problem requiring legislative amendments. Lastly, the judicial preventive remedy under the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 required improvements to start operating effectively.",

While the breaches in these cases, and in the present case, related to various detention facilities, the underlying facts were very similar. The most recurring issues were lack of sufficient living space, unjustified restrictions on access to natural light and air, poor hygiene, and lack of privacy and personal dignity when using sanitary facilities. The breaches were therefore not prompted by isolated incidents or the particular turn of events in each individual case; they originated in a widespread problem resulting from a malfunctioning of the Bulgarian penitentiary system and insufficient safeguards against treatment incompatible with Article 3. This can be seen from the decisions of the Committee of Ministers relating to the execution of these judgments (see\u00a0paragraphs 140-142 above).

The Government also submitted that the problem had recently been addressed, chiefly as a result of the reduction of the number of inmates in these facilities. However, the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Punishments, the authority in charge of the penitentiary system in Bulgaria, accepted that unsatisfactory buildings, poor material conditions and overcrowding in Bulgarian prisons were justifiably being criticised, and pinpointed a number of problem areas (see paragraph 259 above). The reality of the problem is also confirmed by several recent reports. In the report on its 2012 to Bulgaria, the CPT found that conditions in Varna and Burgas Prisons were totally unacceptable, with \u201cdisturbing\u201d levels of overcrowding. It went on to say that overcrowding remained a major problem in Bulgaria\u2019s penitentiary system. The CPT also expressed concern at the lack of progress with respect to prison staffing levels, at the large number of allegations of corrupt practices by prison staff, and at the slight progress with respect to inter-prisoner violence (see paragraph 73 above). In his annual report for 2012, the Ombudsman of the Republic, having visited most prisons in the country, concluded that conditions in almost all prisons and closed-type prison hostels could be characterised as inhuman and degrading, and noted that all prisons in the country, except two correctional institutions for juveniles and Sliven Prison, which housed female prisoners, were overcrowded (see paragraphs 78-81 above). In 2013 he made similar findings with respect to Belene, Burgas and Varna Prisons (see paragraphs 83-87 above). Similar findings were also made in the 2011 report drawn up by the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee (see paragraph 74 above), and in the 2014 McManus report, which, while noting progress in some respects, pointed to a number of ongoing problems (see paragraphs 88 and 89 above). The decision of the Bulgarian authorities to postpone the introduction of the rule requiring a minimum of four square metres per inmate until 2019, said to be made necessary by the impossibility of complying with it in practice, also shows the persistent nature of the problem (see paragraph 115 above). Lastly, the statistical data supplied by the Government to the Department for the Execution of Judgments (see\u00a0paragraph 143 above) shows that, based on official capacity, presumably calculated on the basis of four square metres per inmate, on 31\u00a0December 2013 nine out of the eleven male prisons in the country were overcrowded, some slightly and some horrendously so, the worst case being Burgas Prison, where overcrowding was to the tune of 239%. Two out of the four closed-type prison hostels in the country were likewise overcrowded.",

It is true that this figure may seem insignificant in comparison with those in pilot cases such as Ananyev and Others (cited above, \u00a7 184) and Torreggiani and Others (cited above, \u00a7 89). However, the identification of a systemic problem that justifies the application of the pilot-judgment procedure is not necessarily linked to the number of applications that are already pending; the potential inflow of future cases is also an important consideration (see Hutten-Czapska v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a035014/97, \u00a7 236, ECHR 2006-VIII). This is confirmed by the wording of Rule 61 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court, which says that the \u201cstructural or systemic problem\u201d justifying a pilot-judgment procedure can be one that \u201chas given\u201d or one that \u201cmay give\u201d rise to similar applications. In 2013, there were 9,347 prisoners in Bulgaria (see paragraph 219 above). The latest available number stands at just over 9,000 (see paragraph 89 above). As noted in the above-cited reports, many of these prisoners are kept in overcrowded and otherwise unsatisfactory conditions. Moreover, as already found, they are likely to face obstacles when seeking monetary compensation in respect of these conditions, and do not have an effective remedy enabling them to obtain their improvement (see paragraphs 195-205 and 209-212 above). The question whether any individual domestic authority is at fault for this state of affairs is immaterial, because what is at issue in proceedings before the Court is the responsibility of the State under international law, not that of individual domestic authorities or officials (see, mutatis mutandis, Finger v. Bulgaria, no. 37346/05, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, 10 May 2011). As noted above, under Article 3 of the Convention it is incumbent on a High Contracting State to organise its penitentiary system in a way that does not give rise to inhuman and degrading conditions of detention, regardless of financial or logistical difficulties (see paragraph 229 in fine above). Contrary to what was suggested by the Government in their observations, under the Court\u2019s settled case-law the fact that it is not intended to place a detainee in poor conditions does not preclude these conditions from constituting inhuman or degrading treatment in breach of this Article (see paragraph 230 above).",

The Court has held that if a High Contracting State is unable to ensure that prison conditions comply with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention, it must either abandon its strict penal policy or put in place a system of alternative means of punishment (see Orchowski, cited above, \u00a7 153 in fine).

Measures recommended or undertaken in other cases before this Court have included reduced recourse to imprisonment as a form of penalty, resorting to shorter custodial sentences, replacing imprisonment with other forms of penalty, increasing the use of various forms of early release, and suspending the enforcement of some custodial sentences (see \u0141atak v.

The Court notes with disappointment that, in spite of the many reports that have highlighted the problem for years, the authorities have not done more to tackle it. At this stage, the only way to do so is either by carrying out major renovation works or by replacing these buildings with new ones. Having regard to the fundamental nature of the right protected by Article 3 of the Convention and the importance of urgently putting an end to conditions of detention which result in inhuman or degrading treatment for a considerable number of persons, this should be done without any delay.",

Examples of such authorities are the Independent Monitoring Boards (formerly Boards of Visitors) in the United Kingdom and the Complaints Commission (beklagcommissie) in the Netherlands (see\u00a0Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 215), as well as judges for the execution of sentences in Italy, with the powers that they were granted in 2014 (see Stella and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 48-49, as well as Orchowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0154 in fine).",

This means that if Bulgaria chooses to comply with this judgment by amending the procedure for complaining to a supervising prosecutor, it should, as a minimum, make provision for the complaining prisoner to be given an opportunity to comment on any factual submissions made by the prison authorities at the prosecutor\u2019s request, to put questions, and to make additional submissions to the prosecutor.

Another option is to put in place special rules laying down in detail the manner in which claims concerning conditions of detention are to be examined and determined, as was recently done in Italy (see Stella and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 19-20 and 56-63).",

In Ananyev and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0222-26) the Court expressed some misgivings in relation to this form of redress. However, more recently, in Stella and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a019\u00a0and 58-60), it upheld it as capable of providing adequate and sufficient redress to persons who are still incarcerated. However, it should be emphasised that, as noted in that decision, a reduction of the sentence can only constitute adequate and sufficient redress if it entails an acknowledgement of the breach of Article 3 of the Convention and provides measurable reparation of this breach. Obviously, such a remedy can only be adequate in respect of persons who are still in detention.",

Moreover, the amount of compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage that can be obtained must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards of just satisfaction made by this Court under Article 41 of the Convention in similar cases. The principles outlined by the Court in paragraph 299 below may serve as guidance in this respect. It should be emphasised in this connection that the right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is so fundamental that the domestic authority or court dealing with the matter will have to give exceptionally compelling reasons to justify a decision to award lower or no compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 228-30).",

It is also known that an initial period of adjustment to poor conditions exacts a heavy mental and physical toll on the person concerned (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 172).

However, the claim made by him within the time-limit fixed under Rule 60 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court was EUR 10,000, which means that, under the principle ne ultra petitum the Court should not award him a bigger sum (see Mikryukov and Others v.

Bearing in mind that Mr Yordanov was legally represented (see paragraph 2 above), the Court does not find that it should take into account the amended claim that he made after the expiry of this time-limit (see Rule 60 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court, and, mutatis mutandis, Mancini v.\u00a0Italy, no. 44955/98, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2001-IX; Fad\u0131l Y\u0131lmaz v.

Bulgaria, no. 49438/99, \u00a7 114, 12\u00a0October 2006). That said, the Court finds that Mr Zlatev, who does not have his left hand, and who recently carried out acts of serious self-harm (see paragraphs 66, 69 and 70 above), must have suffered considerably as a result of the breach of his rights under Article 3 as a result of the conditions of his detention in Burgas Prison since 2002. Ruling on an equitable basis, as required under Article 41 of the Convention, and taking in particular into account the amount of time spent by Mr Zlatev in these conditions, the Court finds that he would in principle be entitled to an award of EUR\u00a023,250. However, Mr Zlatev failed to make his claim for just satisfaction within the time-limit fixed under Rule 60 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court. The only explanation that he gave for this was that he did not speak English and could not understand the Court\u2019s letter advising him of the date on which this time-limit would expire. But the Court informed Mr Zlatev of the time-limit\u2019s existence and importance when the Government were given notice of his application, several months before the letter that advised Mr\u00a0Zlatev of the date on which the time-limit would expire. This was done by means of an information note drafted in Bulgarian. This note also specified the language in which the Court would conduct correspondence with Mr Zlatev and informed him of the possibility to seek legal representation and apply for legal aid under Rule 100 et seq. In these circumstances, under Rule 60 \u00a7 3, the options available to the Court are to reject the claim in whole or in part. In the circumstances of this case, which concerns a serious breach of Article 3 of the Convention suffered by a disabled and particularly vulnerable applicant, it would be unduly harsh fully to reject his claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage. Therefore, the Court finds it equitable to award Mr Zlatev EUR 11,625, plus any tax that may be chargeable on this sum.",

The only explanation that he gave for this was that the letter advising him of this time-limit had only reached him on 20 November 2014. However, even assuming this was so, it cannot be overlooked that Mr\u00a0Tsekov was advised of his omission in a letter of 24 October 2014, to which he replied on 29 October 2014 without saying anything about his claim (see paragraph 6 above). Nor can it be overlooked that even in his letter dated 23 November 2014 Mr Tsekov did not make a quantified claim for just satisfaction. In view of that, and having regard to Rule 60 \u00a7 3 of its Rules and point 5 of the Practice Direction on Just Satisfaction Claims, which says that claims set out on the application form but not resubmitted at the appropriate stage of the proceedings will be rejected, the Court rejects Mr Tsekov\u2019s claim.",

The lower court had also failed properly to analyse the unequivocally established facts that: (a) the inmate had been kept in a cell measuring about twenty-eight square metres together with twenty-four to twenty-six other inmates, and had as a result disposed with a little more than one square metre of floor space; (b) the cell had had no toilet or running water; and (c) there had been no access to the toilet at night, with the result that he had had to relieve himself in a bucket. The lower court needed to take all these facts into account and, based on their cumulative assessment, determine whether the inmate had suffered harm that went beyond the suffering inherent in serving a lawful sentence of imprisonment. In that connection, it was necessary to take into account a number of judgments of this Court in conditions-of-detention cases against Bulgaria.",

The court found that the inmate had been held in Burgas Prison at the time of the worst overcrowding there. There was no evidence in relation to the intake cell in which he had been kept during the first month, with the result that the claim in respect of that period was to be dismissed, but the evidence showed that between April and June 2012 the inmate had been in a cell where he had had at his disposal between 0.92 and 1.15 square metres of living space. The cell had not been properly aired and lit, chiefly due to the small windows, and, like all cells in that unit, had not been equipped with a toilet or running water, with the result that at night the inmate had had to relieve himself in a bucket in the presence of his cellmates. The court also had regard to the findings of the CPT in its report on its 2012 visit to Bulgaria (see paragraph 73 of the judgment). On that basis, the court held that, when taken together, as required under this Court\u2019s case-law, the conditions of the inmate\u2019s detention could be regarded as, inter alia, inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. The lack of evidence on the impact of these conditions on the inmate\u2019s psychological well-being was not relevant, as these conditions could be presumed to cause suffering to any normal human being. Bearing the amount of time spent in poor conditions, the equitable amount of compensation for that was BGN\u00a01,250, plus interest.",

Unlike medical expert evidence, the witness evidence put forward by the inmate could not prove negative changes in his physical or neurological health. The conditions in which the inmate had been held had not been in breach of Bulgarian law or causing suffering of such intensity as to amount to treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention.

The conditions in his cell \u2013 in particular the lack of enough natural light, the constant light at night, the lack of a table \u2013 had not caused him serious discomfort either. There was no evidence that the cell had been dirty or unhygienic.

It went on to find that, before the installation of a toilet in the cell in which the inmate had been kept, he had had to relieve himself in a bucket in the presence of other inmates, which had caused him to feel humiliated.

The court held that there was no statutory requirement for in-cell toilets, and that the mere lack of such a toilet could not give rise to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Having reviewed the witness evidence, which was contradictory on that point, the court found that the inmate had not been denied access to the common toilets. It went on to say that there was no evidence that the food given to the inmate had been substandard. However, it found that the inmate had been provided with less than four square metres of personal space, but did not find it established that he had fallen ill with hepatitis C as a result of the conditions of his detention, or that he had suffered mentally as a result of these conditions. On that basis, the court concluded that the authorities had not carried out any unlawful acts or omissions within the meaning of section 1 of the 1988 Act.",

The court found that the inmate had been allowed to visit the toilet at all times, sometimes with a slight delay. It was true that for a period of time the inmate had been held in a cell with no access to daylight, and that the detention facility had no place where the detainees could take their outdoor walk. However, these were objective constraints, entirely due to the lack of resources, and not the fault of the facility\u2019s administration. In any event, there was no evidence that the inmate had suffered any damage as result of that. His allegations that he had felt debased and humiliated as a result of the impugned conditions were not supported by any evidence. Neither the witnesses had said anything on that point, nor was there any medical evidence on it. While the conditions had probably caused him some discomfort, none of the witnesses had said that he had seen the inmate feel despondent, fearful or humiliated as a result of them. There was no indication that he had made complaints in relation to that either. Any negative feelings experienced by him could have been due to the criminal proceedings against him and the mere fact of his deprivation of liberty. The judgment was apparently not appealed against and became final on 23\u00a0January 2014.",

The salient issue in the case, which the lower court had failed to recognise, had been whether the conditions of the inmate\u2019s confinement had breached his rights under Article 3 of the Convention.

It went on to say that, although the domestic law rules requiring a minimum of square metres per inmate and ready access to the toilet at all times had not yet come into effect, the problems that the inmate had encountered in relation to that had to be assessed by reference to the general prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment, laid down in, inter alia, Article 3 of the Convention, as interpreted in this Court\u2019s case-law. The evidence showed that he had been kept in severely overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, and had had to use a bucket inside the cell to relieve himself. That had degraded him, in breach of his rights under, inter alia, Article 3 of the Convention. In the light of this Court\u2019s case-law, it had to be presumed that this had caused the inmate non-pecuniary damage in the form of emotional distress. There was no evidence that the prison authorities had wilfully put the inmate in such conditions, but that was immaterial because liability under section 1 of the 1988 Act did not require fault on the part of the defendant authority. Having regard to the amount of time spent by the inmate in these conditions \u2013 forty-three days in total \u2013 the court assessed the non-pecuniary damage suffered by him at BGN 650. It is unclear whether that decision has become final.",

It was unclear why the lower court had decided that the claims concerning the period before 1 June 2009 had solely been directed against the Ministry of Justice; there was evidence in the case file that the inmate had directed them against both the Ministry and the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Punishments, both of which had taken part in the proceedings. It was thus unclear why the lower court had not examined these claims vis-\u00e0-vis the Directorate. On remittal, the lower court had to do that. The part of the lower court\u2019s judgment allowing the prisoner\u2019s claims against the Directorate in relation to the period after 1 June 2009 was wellfounded and correctly reflecting the substantive law.",

The court held that the inmate bore the burden of proving not only the unlawful acts or omissions of which he complained, but also the damage flowing from these acts or omissions. The court found that the inmate had been kept in a cell that measured approximately five by six metres, housed between twenty and twenty-four inmates, and had an in-cell toilet separated from the rest of the cell with a wall. It was true that the amount of floor space available to the inmate was less than four square metres, because twenty inmates lived in forty square metres, but the rule requiring a minimum of four metres of floor space per inmate had not yet come into effect. The allegations of lack of proper hygiene, medical care and food did not appear to be true.

The court found that Mr Neshkov\u2019s claims in relation to the failures of the administration of Varna Prison to provide him with bed linen for a total of nine days on two occasions in November 2007 and December 2008 was well-founded. It ordered the Ministry of Justice to pay Mr Neshkov BGN 300 in non-pecuniary damages in respect of that. Based on the expert and documentary evidence, the court turned down Mr Neshkov\u2019s remaining allegations, which concerned the material conditions in his cell. It also held that Mr Neshkov\u2019s claims in respect of the thirteen earlier occasions on which he had been placed in Varna Prison were time-barred.

The court found that conditions in that hostel, in which the inmate has spent in total of a year and five months, were very poor, with no access to the toilets at night, dilapidation of the premises and extremely bad hygiene. On that basis, it held that even though the specific rules governing inmate accommodation had not yet come into effect, the conditions ran counter to the general prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment set out in, inter alia, Article 3 of the Convention. That had caused the inmate psychological suffering. Since he had not suffered damage to his health, the equitable amount of compensation was BGN 2,000, plus interest.",
