Concerning access to a court, it pointed out that while excessively high court fees could in some circumstances be an obstacle to access to a court, this was not the case in this instance as the applicants had to pay only EUR 15,000, a sum it considered reasonable. On the subject of fair compensation, the Constitutional Court found that compensation for the loss suffered as a result of expropriation was quite unrelated to the matter of court fees, and that there was accordingly no reason why court fees should not exceed the sum awarded in compensation.",

In the context of the general rule enunciated in the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1, ascertaining whether such a balance existed requires an overall examination of the various interests in issue. Thus, without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value, a deprivation of property would normally constitute a disproportionate interference. On the other hand, the States must be able to take the measures they consider necessary to protect the balanced funding of their justice systems in the general interest. Lastly, in situations akin to that in the present case, the conduct of the parties to the dispute, including the means employed by the State and their implementation, must also be taken into consideration (see Beyeler, cited above, ibid.).",
