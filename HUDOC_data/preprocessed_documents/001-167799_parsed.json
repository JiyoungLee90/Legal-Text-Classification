At the time the article had been published, the Land of Carinthia had owned 49.4% of the bank. The claimant\u2019s father had been a regional government member responsible for finances and had also been on the bank\u2019s supervisory board until April 2003. The claimant had been the head of the bank\u2019s treasury department since 1999. He had not been active in politics nor had he been in the public eye in connection with his professional activity. The Regional Court noted that the task of a bank\u2019s treasury department was to carry out liquidity and finance planning for the bank. Hypo Alpe-Adria\u2019s treasury department had been directly answerable to the executive board. The transactions which had subsequently led to such enormous losses had been carried out between the end of September and the beginning of October 2004 and the claimant had been the main person in charge. On 5 April 2006 the FMA had sent information to the Klagenfurt public prosecutor\u2019s office on three members of the executive board, who were suspected of manipulating the bank\u2019s balance sheets, and on the claimant who was suspected of embezzlement for carrying out unauthorised foreign currency transactions. Following receipt of that information the public prosecutor\u2019s office had started preliminary enquiries. From 24 May 2006 preliminary investigations (Voruntersuchung) had been conducted by the Regional Court. Criminal proceedings against the claimant had been discontinued in\u00a02008.

However, the article should have confined itself to mentioning the head of the bank\u2019s treasury department without disclosing his name. The public interest in reporting on the criminal offences at issue had not in itself been sufficient to justify disclosing the claimant\u2019s identity. The fact that the claimant had been answerable to the executive board, although he had an important position in the bank, and that the criminal proceedings against him had been at an early stage, meant that the claimant\u2019s interest in protecting his identity outweighed the public interest in the disclosure of his name.",

Austria (no. 3) (no. 34702/07, 10 January 2012), its article had revealed political and personal links and had put the events surrounding the bank, partly owned by the Land of Carinthia (\u201cLandesbank\u201d) in their proper context. Furthermore, if it had been lawful to publish the position of the person responsible for the losses at the bank, as the Court of Appeal had found, the identity of the claimant would have become known anyway because of the key position he had occupied within the treasury department. Moreover, at the time of the publication of the article at issue the identity of the claimant in the domestic proceedings had already been revealed in other publications. Describing that key position had been the only way to explain to readers how one person had been able to take decisions which had resulted in such large losses. Moreover, the claimant\u2019s professional advancement had not been harmed because of the article as his employer had already known about the allegations. The disadvantages he had faced were due to the criminal proceedings and not the article. Furthermore, many other journals and newspapers had disclosed the claimant\u2019s name. His name therefore had been known publicly before the release of the article in question. In addition, it had not been correct to speak of the criminal proceedings as being at an early stage as the Financial Market Authority had already carried out an investigation which had led to the institution of criminal proceedings.",

The national courts had applied standards that were in accordance with the principles enshrined in Article 10 and they had based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the facts. In contrast with the article examined by the Court in Standard Verlags GmbH (cited above), the material at issue could not be qualified as a contribution to a current debate of public interest. It had essentially confined itself to describing the bank\u2019s speculative losses and to related suspicions of criminal acts. The theme of the intertwining of politics and the speculative losses had only been discussed as a side issue. Even if it had been in the public interest to be informed about the events connected to the speculative losses, that had not justified disclosing the claimant\u2019s name. Moreover, the claimant had to be protected against a \u201ctrial by the media\u201d as the report had been published at a very early stage in the criminal proceedings, namely only five days after the information gathered by the Financial Market Authority had arrived at the public prosecutor\u2019s office, which had been around six weeks prior to the institution of judicial investigation proceedings. The sanction imposed on the applicant company, compensation of EUR 3,000, was extremely moderate, taking into account the legal upper limit of EUR 20,000 and the magazine\u2019s high circulation.",

As regards the necessity test to be carried out under Article 10 \u00a7\u00a02, it agreed with the assessment of the Austrian courts that the claimant was not a \u201cpublic figure\u201d and that he had not been in the public eye. However, the Court observed that the question of whether or not a person whose interests had been harmed by reporting in the media was a public figure was only one element among others to be taken into account. Another important factor, when it came to weighing conflicting interests under Article 10 and Article\u00a08 was the contribution made by articles or photographs in the press to a debate of general interest. The Court observed that it was not in dispute that the article had reported on an issue of public interest as it had dealt with the issue of politics and banking being intertwined and on the opening of an investigation by the public prosecutor. Considering that the disclosure of a suspect\u2019s identity may be particularly problematic at the early stage of criminal proceedings, the Court observed that the article as a whole had focused mainly on the political dimension of the banking scandal and had not dealt with the conduct or contents of the criminal investigation as such. Instead, it had focused on the extent to which politics and banking were intertwined and on the political and economic responsibility for the bank\u2019s enormous losses, giving names. As names, persons and personal relationships were clearly of considerable importance in that sphere, the Court considered it difficult to see how the applicant company could have reported on those issues in a meaningful manner without mentioning the names of all those involved, including Mr.\u00a0Rauscher. Moreover, it dismissed the argument that the disclosure of Mr.\u00a0Rauscher\u2019s identity had been detrimental to him, namely to his professional advancement, and affirmed the Regional Court\u2019s argument that his name and position at Hypo Alpe-Adria must have been well known in business circles before the publication of the article at issue.",

Nonetheless, the Court is not persuaded by the findings of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court that the claimant was only in a subordinate management position when in charge of the bank\u2019s treasury department. It is clear that the claimant had the ability to authorise contracts which resulted in transactions worth many millions of euros. Even if not a member of the executive board, the claimant held one of the leading management positions in the bank. As nearly 50% of the bank was owned by the Land of Carinthia, it was ultimately the taxpayer who bore a large share of the losses. In addition, even if the Financial Market Authority was not a body which investigated criminal conduct, it was the main authority which supervised the banking sector in Austria (Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7 72). That body found sufficient grounds to file criminal information. The public therefore had a right to be informed about the bank\u2019s losses and the people who were in charge. Even if the ordinary courts had not yet formally instituted a preliminary investigation, criminal enquiries had already started. The Court therefore finds that the article at issue contributed to a debate of general interest where the issue of what stage the criminal proceedings were at is one, but not the sole criterion of evaluation.
