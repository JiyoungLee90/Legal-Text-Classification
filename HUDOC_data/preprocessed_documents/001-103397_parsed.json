Therefore, in the Government's view, there had been a justified reason, as required by Chapter 5, section 5, subsection 2, of the Coercive Measures Act, to conduct the search at 10 p.m. The search had been performed for the purposes of the prevention of crime and it had therefore pursued a legitimate aim. It had not been possible to inform the applicant about the possibility to be present during the search as neither her telephone number nor that of her counsel had been known to the officers. The applicant had, however, been immediately informed about the search by a hand-written note left in her apartment, mentioning, inter alia, the contact details of the officers who had carried out the search. The written search warrant and the records of the seizure had been communicated to the applicant as soon as she had been located for the purposes of questioning, namely a day and a half after the search.

It was true that the civil liability of the officers conducting the search could be invoked but this possibility was neither effective nor capable of providing redress for the interference with her right to respect for her home as she would have to show that she had actually suffered damage. None of the private prosecutions initiated against officers having conducted or ordered a search had been successful. This remedy was therefore theoretical as well as illusory. The same was true for lodging a complaint with the Parliamentary Ombudsman (eduskunnan oikeusasiamies, riksdagens justitieombudsman) and the Chancellor of Justice (oikeuskansleri, justitiekanslern).

Although there was no explicit possibility to challenge a search before a court, this did not mean that there was no effective remedy. Under Chapter 4, section 13, of the Coercive Measures Act the legality of a seizure could be examined by a court. An unlawful search could also result in the civil or criminal liability of the State or the officer carrying out the search. Moreover, an injured party could bring a private prosecution if the public prosecutor had decided not to press charges. Also, the possibility for the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of Justice to control the legality of measures taken by authorities should be taken into account. In the Government's view the applicant had thus had access to a court in respect of the search and seizure conducted at her home.
