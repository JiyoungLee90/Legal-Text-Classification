However, Article 94 of the Constitution only recognised the latter two kinds of compulsory payment to the State. Furthermore, unlike taxes and levies, the regulation fee was not paid into the State\u2019s coffers or to a local authority, but directly to the CAA. The Constitutional Court considered that in those circumstances the fee amounted to a special form of tax, which was a compulsory payment and which had the features of both a traditional levy (payable in exchange for a service or the granting of a right) and of a tax (payable on the annual income of the body concerned).",

The Constitutional Court dismissed that argument, pointing out that the regulation of transport activities meant the provision of a service by a public authority in exchange for the payment of a fee for that service. Such relationships could only arise within the framework of a mutual contract, freely entered into by the parties concerned. A fee received by a public authority for a service should therefore take the form of income received for work carried out on a contractual basis, in accordance with section 13(d) of the Public-Law Entities Act.",

However, regard being had to the principle of the freedom to choose services, even an undeniably necessary service should be the subject of a free agreement between the parties. The Constitutional Court thus concluded that if the matter at issue were settled in that way, then future situations in which the payment of considerable amounts imposed unilaterally by a public authority, in total disregard of the opinions of the companies concerned, would be avoided. The Constitutional Court emphasised that not even constitutional provisions could prevent a public authority in charge of the regulation of civil aviation from signing a contract with a private entity which included conditions and rules for services to be provided under that contract.",

However, \u201cthe judgment in question had not declared that it was unlawful for the CAA to provide its services to the companies concerned on the basis of negotiated contracts\u201d. According to the expert, the judgment indicated, on the contrary, that there was a \u201cneed for such contracts and a legal settlement of the issue in this way\u201d. The expert assumed that the applicant had taken the latter route, \u201cwhich had been suggested to him by the Constitutional Court\u201d. That had brought him to sign the impugned contracts with Sakaeronavigatsia and Tbilisi International Airport on 28 March 2003, that is to say, three days before the entry into force of the judgment in question. On 13 August 2003 the applicant had signed the same kind of contract with Air-GP-Georgia. In each case, the CAA\u2019s remuneration had been calculated on a monthly basis and was referred to as a fee for services provided in the field of regulation. The three contracts had been terminated on 1 October 2003.",

Had it not charged those amounts, the CAA would have been obliged to continue functioning without, though, paying its employees\u2019 salaries. The expert reiterated that the regulation fee paid to the CAA by the companies concerned was included in the price for the service that those companies offered to individuals (air travel tickets) or other companies (carriage of goods). Payment of the fee to the CAA did not therefore cause them any financial damage and, even if there had nevertheless been a loss, it would in the end have been passed on to the consumer.",

He again pointed out that the judgment of the Constitutional Court at issue authorised the CAA to continue to charge the fee for services, provided that the payment was based on negotiated contracts and not imposed, as hitherto. Contrary to the argument put forward by the investigator, the companies concerned could not be deemed to have incurred any substantial losses simply by having fulfilled contractual obligations which had been freely negotiated with the CAA. Moreover, those companies had never complained of the unlawfulness of the contracts in question. Lastly, the applicant argued that \u201cnone of the State\u2019s legal interests\u201d had been disregarded, given that the State could not claim to be a victim of contractual relationships between two entities which were independent of it.",

In particular, the investigator pointed out that everyone had to comply with the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 10\u00a0January 2003, which had the force of law, but which the applicant had failed to do. After 1 April 2003, the date of entry into force of that judgment, the applicant had continued to charge the regulation fee, referring to it as a \u201cfee for services provided in the field of the regulation of activities\u201d in order to conceal the nature of the activity. The Constitutional Court had considered, however, that revenues gained by the CAA in the form of a regulation fee were unconstitutional. The applicant and his employees had derived a personal profit from the amounts at issue in the form of salaries, and management and business trip fees. For example, the applicant had received total salary of GEL\u00a015,618 (some EUR\u00a07,500). According to the investigator, even if most of the companies concerned had declared that they had not incurred any loss from the applicant\u2019s activities, the charging by the CAA of the disguised regulation fee in breach of the judgment of the Constitutional Court had damaged the legal interests of the State. Furthermore, by giving retrospective effect to Order no. 1, registered by the Ministry of Justice on 27 November 2003, the applicant had jeopardised the well-being of the companies concerned.",

The applicant then argued that of the amounts which he had been unjustifiably accused of charging unlawfully, he had paid GEL 490,473 (some EUR 225,000) to the State, while the remainder had been used to fund the CAA\u2019s operations (see the aforementioned expert report cited at paragraphs 22-26 above). Consequently, neither he nor anyone else had derived any personal profit from the amounts in question. The applicant argued that the accountancy expert\u2019s report confirmed the legality of his actions. He explained that the reason the Constitutional Court had delayed the entry into force of its judgment of 10 January 2003 had been to grant Parliament sufficient time to legislate and fill the gap arising from its judgment. In order not to leave the CAA without funds, which would have meant flight safety might have been compromised, the Constitutional Court had clearly indicated in its judgment that the CAA could enter into contractual relationships with the aviation companies concerned, which would thus be able to negotiate conditions freely.",

That decree, as well as section 13(d) of the Public-Law Entities Act, gave a direct right to the applicant, as chairperson of the CAA, to collect duties by entering into contractual relations with companies working in civil aviation. Furthermore, the new law, required as a result of the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 10 January 2003, had been passed on 14 August 2003 and had entered into force on 15 September 2003. The applicant had issued Order no. 1 in compliance with that law and had subsequently submitted it to the Ministry of Justice for registration. The Ministry of Justice had registered it on 27\u00a0November 2003, approving its retrospective application as of 1\u00a0October 2003 under sections 33(4) and 54 of the Law on Normative Legal Acts, on the grounds that all the companies covered by the Order had the necessary legal identification numbers and codes. The applicant pointed out that if it had been unlawful to apply the order at issue retrospectively, the Ministry of Justice would have informed the CAA and instructed it to make the necessary amendments, in accordance with the law. The applicant concluded that the actions he had taken in the exercise of his official duties had not been contrary to the judgment of the Constitutional Court in question, or to any other legal provisions applicable at the material time, and thus could not qualify as abuse of power.",

However, a problem arose with the timing of such a hearing. Pursuant to Article 419 of the CCP, an admissibility hearing was required to be held within fourteen days or, for \u201ccomplicated cases\u201d, within a month of the delivery of a final judgment on the last, unrelated criminal case brought before the same judge, but the latter had no time constraints in deciding that \u201clast\u201d case.

However, having regard to the reasons given in the constitutional judgment in question, it cannot be resolutely concluded that the Constitutional Court outright forbade the CAA from entering into service agreements with the civil aviation companies. Admittedly, the constitutional judgment invalidated the statutory obligation to pay the \u201cannual regulation fee for transport activities\u201d under the law. However, in the reasoning of the same judgment, the Constitutional Court also entertained the idea, as an answer to the CAA\u2019s argument of its alleged inability either to function without being funded with fees for services and to sign services contracts with civil aviation companies, that it was, on the contrary, preferable from the constitutional point of view for the CAA and civil aviation companies to enter into freely-formed contractual relations, whereby the latter companies would undertake a contractual obligation to pay a fee in exchange for the regulatory services provided by the CAA, in accordance with section 13(d) of the Public-Law Entities Act (see paragraphs 11-12 and 60 above). That being so, the Court finds it difficult to understand why the Tbilisi City Court, when convicting the applicant for having entered into services agreements with the civil aviation companies, did not give any meaningful answer to the applicant\u2019s major defence argument that he had merely followed the Constitutional Court\u2019s indication to enter into such contractual relationships (compare paragraphs 43 and 47\u00a0above). Of further significance is the audit report of 20 July 2004, an investigative measure that had been commissioned by the authorities themselves, which suggested that the initiation and conclusion of the impugned contracts by the applicant in his capacity as chairperson of the CAA was apparently in accordance with the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling of 10 January 2003 (see paragraph 22-26 above). The Court further observes that at least one of those contracts, the second one, dated 13\u00a0August 2003, had been based on an additional legal ground, which was Presidential Decree no. 354 of 25\u00a0July 2003. That decree stated outright that the CAA was empowered to charge fees to civil aviation companies in exchange for regulatory services, on the basis of privately concluded contracts. Noteworthy in this regard was that the decree itself emphasised in its preamble that for the CAA to follow such a mode of operation \u201cwas in accordance with the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 10\u00a0January 2003\u201d (see paragraph 82 above).",

However, the Court considers that the domestic courts failed to address the self-evident fact that Order no. 1 had been based on section 24(5) of the State Regulation Act, a transitional provision which was introduced by the Amendment of 14 August 2003. Notably, that transitional provision read that the CAA, as a transport regulation authority, was entitled to set regulation fees on its own, pending the adoption of a new piece of legislation on the matter by Parliament. Given that a new law set rates for regulation fees as late as 30 June 2004 (see paragraph 83 above), it is difficult to understand why it was wrongful for the applicant to regulate the matter by issuing Order no. 1 on 25 November 2003 as head of the CAA, in accordance with the above-mentioned section\u00a024(5). Furthermore, if it was manifestly unlawful for the applicant to issue Order no. 1, which took effect from 1 October 2003, then the Ministry of Justice, the authority in charge of overseeing the lawfulness of various sub-legislative legal acts, should ordinarily have flagged up all the underlying legal defects of the order. Furthermore, the audit report of 20 July 2004, the only forensic item of evidence available in the case file (see paragraphs\u00a022, 24 and 42 above), again suggested that the applicant had apparently acted in conformity with the then existing legislation, when issuing Order\u00a0no.\u00a01 (see also paragraphs\u00a080 and 81 above).",

Indeed, it is irregular that none of the three judicial instances attempted in their decisions to have a discussion about the correlation between the applicant\u2019s actions, what exactly was said in the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 10 January 2003 and what the relevant statutory law was in the immediate aftermath of that constitutional judgment.",

The resultant incongruity renders the applicant\u2019s conviction for abuse of official authority far from being convincingly determined from the standpoint of an objective legal observer, such as the Court. What is at stake in the present case is not the applicant\u2019s individual criminal responsibility or the establishment of the elements of the offence, matters which are exclusively within the domestic courts\u2019 domain. Rather, the situation, prompted by the absence of sufficient reasons in the decisions of the domestic courts, is that of incomprehension for the Court as to why the applicant\u2019s acts \u2013 the collection of the fee on the basis of service agreements and the sub-legislative legal act \u2013 were described as criminal at all. In other words, the applicant cannot be said to have had the benefit of fair proceedings in so far as the criminal law \u2013 notably, the scope of the offence of abuse of official authority prosecuted under Article 332 of the Criminal Code \u2013 was inexplicably and thus arbitrarily construed to his detriment by the domestic courts.",

It can only be applied in conjunction with other Articles (see Gusinskiy v. Russia, no. 70276/01, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2004\u2011IV). As it has previously held in its case-law, the whole structure of the Convention rests on the general assumption that public authorities in the member States act in good faith. Indeed, any public policy or individual measure may have a \u201chidden agenda\u201d, and the presumption of good faith is rebuttable in theory. However, it is difficult to overcome this assumption in practice. Indeed, an applicant alleging that his rights and freedoms were limited for an improper reason must convincingly show that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed or which could be reasonably inferred from the context. A mere suspicion that the authorities used their powers for some other purpose than those defined in the Convention is not sufficient to prove that Article 18 was breached (see Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, \u00a7 255, 31 May 2011). When an allegation under Article 18 of the Convention is made, the Court applies a very exacting standard of proof. As a consequence, the Court has only been satisfied in a few cases that such a standard was met, such as Gusinskiy v.\u00a0Russia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73\u201378); Cebotari v. Moldova (no.\u00a035615/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046 et seq., 13 November 2007); or Lutsenko v. Ukraine, (no.\u00a06492/11, \u00a7\u00a0108, 3\u00a0July 2012). For a contrasting example, see Sisojeva and Others v.\u00a0Latvia (striking out) ([GC], no. 60654/00, \u00a7\u00a0129, ECHR\u00a02007I).",

In the instant case, the applicant\u2019s only argument backing up his allegation of an abusive initiation of criminal proceedings against him was a reference to the public statements of presidential candidate Mr\u00a0Saakashvili. The Court acknowledges the inappropriateness of the public statements in question, which can indeed be easily read as a threat to the applicant (see paragraph 55 above). However, it is still unable, in the absence of any other additional evidence or arguments and applying an exacting standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, to establish that the initiation of the criminal case against the applicant was necessarily linked to the threat uttered by Mr Saakashvili, or that the latter in any other manner unduly influenced the unfolding of the criminal case after he became President. Indeed, the mere suspicion of a hidden abusive agenda, no matter how arguable that suspicion may be, cannot be sufficient for the Court to conclude that the whole legal machinery of the respondent State in the present case lacked independence and was ab initio misused under alleged pressure from the President, or that from beginning to end the prosecution and judicial authorities acted in bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention (compare Khodorkovskiy, cited above, \u00a7 260). There was nothing in the present case to suggest that the prosecution or judicial authorities themselves showed, either through official or unofficial channels, the existence of any ulterior motives incompatible with the restrictions on the applicant\u2019s liberty which are permitted under Article\u00a05 of the Convention (contrast with Lutsenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0108-109; Gusinskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73\u201378; and Tymoshenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a049872/11, \u00a7 299, 30 April 2013).",

It reiterates its previous conclusions that a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was caused by lacunae in the well-established domestic law and practice at the material time, which was a structural problem that had no possible remedy. That being so, the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, which is closely linked to the one already examined under Article 5 \u00a7 1, must be also declared admissible. However, in the light of its previous comprehensive findings on the merits of the matter, the Court considers that there is no need for an additional, separate examination of that same structural problem from the viewpoint of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (compare with Gigolashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a014, 15 and 30-37).",

At present the standard of proof for Article\u00a018 violations is prohibitively high. The State is presumed to be operating in good faith. This presumption demands a standard of proof even higher than \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d, with no burden shifting even after the applicant makes a prima facie showing. The Court requires that the applicant must \u201cconvincingly show that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed\u201d; a \u201cmere suspicion\u201d is not enough. We must insist on a review of the current standard. While we have little reason to doubt the presumption of good faith of a State Party to the Convention, that presumption, as it is understood currently, imposes such a high standard of proof that the task of proving a violation is practically impossible and contrary to the spirit of the safeguards provided by Article 18. Where there are incomprehensible elements in the detention or conviction in question the current standard makes it practically impossible for the applicant to prove his or her case. If the Court itself cannot ascertain the domestic courts\u2019 reasons for a certain act it would be impossibly difficult to demand that the applicant do so in order to satisfy the standard of proof. There will seldom be written agreements outlining the true purpose of the detention or explicit statements to the effect that the applicant was detained for another reason. This standard results in a practically impossible burden of proof for Article\u00a018 violations.",

Khodorkovskiy, OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos and Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev (all cited above) have made the change. There is an irony in that out of these three cases, which have had the strongest bearing on the outcome of the Article 18 complaint, only Khodorkovskiy (cited above) has been cited in the relevant paragraphs (113\u2013115) of the judgment in the present case. On the other hand, it was in that case that the change finally crept in \u2013 although even that case had deep roots in cases decided much earlier, notwithstanding the fact that some of them produced a different result and violations of Article 18 were found. As a result, applications which a decade or less ago could have been considered prima facie admissible, but unsubstantiated by evidence other than \u201ccontextual\u201d evidence, sooner or later had to be treated as \u201cmanifestly ill-founded\u201d (as in the present case, which happened to be the first one given such treatment \u2013 but, if the approach does not change, by no means the last), because the Court, equipped with its ever tougher standards of admissibility, knows a priori that a complaint has no prospect of success if it is supported only by \u201ccontextual evidence\u201d (\u201cappearances\u201d) \u2013 hence the complaint may not even be communicated to the Government. It seems appropriate to admit that this is precisely what happened with the present applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 18 in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1, which, unlike the complaint under Article 18 in conjunction with Article 5, was not communicated to the Government.",
