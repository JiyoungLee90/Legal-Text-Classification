It follows from the very nature of interim measures that a decision on whether they should be indicated in a given case will often have to be made within a very short lapse of time, with a view to preventing imminent potential harm from being done. Consequently, the full facts of the case will often remain undetermined until the Court's judgment on the merits of the complaint to which the measure is related. It is precisely for the purpose of preserving the Court's ability to render such a judgment after an effective examination of the complaint that such measures are indicated. Until that time, it may be unavoidable for the Court to indicate interim measures on the basis of facts which, despite making a prima facie case in favour of such measures, are subsequently added to or challenged to the point of calling into question the measures' justification.",

The Court doubts that it was impossible for the prosecutor's office to send a prosecutor to an urgent hearing called by the trial court.

Of course, the Court could find a violation of Article 34 of the Convention if it were shown that during the period of non-compliance the applicant had been subject to a risk of irreparable damage to his life or health capable of depriving the proceedings of their object. However, in my view, the applicant's state of health, although serious, was not put at risk as the result of his transfer to the prison hospital, where qualified medical personnel could administer all the treatment which had been prescribed for him. In these circumstances I conclude that the applicant was not exposed to a risk of irreparable damage capable of depriving the proceedings of their object and that the Court was not prevented from examining the case.",

On the particular facts of the present case, I am unable to find that the delay in implementing the interim measure can be said to have hindered the effective exercise of the applicant's right of individual petition within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. In this respect the case is very different from those where the removal of an applicant from a country in disregard of the terms of a Rule 39 indication has the inevitable consequence of rendering nugatory the exercise of the right by preventing the Court from conducting an effective examination of the Convention complaint and, ultimately, from protecting the applicant against potential violations of the Convention rights invoked.",
