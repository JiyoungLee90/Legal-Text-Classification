This left the applicant in a state of uncertainty as to the grounds for his detention. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities for their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time is incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Nakhmanovich, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-71, and Sta\u0161aitis v.

However, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires that after a certain lapse of time, the persistence of a reasonable suspicion does not in itself justify the deprivation of liberty, and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention (see Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v.
