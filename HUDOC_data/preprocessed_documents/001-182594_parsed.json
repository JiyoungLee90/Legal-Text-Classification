However, the applicant\u2019s claims for compensation could only be satisfied if unlawful actions by the authorities had been established. The restitution process was carried out by the National Land Service and its territorial divisions.

The relevant domestic law valid at the material time when the case had been examined had provided that, until 1\u00a0March 2015, citizens could change the method of restitution and ask to have their property rights restored by being provided with a plot of forest of equal value in a rural area. If no method was chosen, property rights were restored by means of monetary compensation.

On 10 July 2015 the Supreme Administrative Court held that it was clear from the case material that there was no more vacant land in the area where the applicant\u2019s father had had his land. For this reason, the applicant\u2019s demand that the authorities be obliged to return her father\u2019s land in natura within one month of the court\u2019s decision becoming final (see paragraph 32 above) was unfounded. As regards the applicant\u2019s argument that her father\u2019s plot of land of 0.0498 hectares had been sold to R.N. owing to unlawful actions by the National Land Service, the court held that this argument had been rebutted by the decisions issued by the domestic courts in other proceedings (see paragraph 31 above). As regards the length of the restitution process, the court decided that there was no information indicating that the authorities had acted unlawfully, and thus the firstinstance decision to award the applicant compensation of EUR 600 had been unfounded. In 1991 the applicant had expressed her wish to have her father\u2019s land returned to her in natura (see paragraph 5 above). In 2003 she had asked for compensation \u201cin a convertible currency at world market prices\u201d (see paragraph 11 above); in 2009 she had asked for compensation at market prices in accordance with the land value map for 2009 (see paragraph 16 above); in 2010 she had asked for compensation at market prices plus 15% interest (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above); and in 2015 she had stated that her choice as to the method of restitution had been expressed in 1991, and she was not going to change her mind (see paragraph 37 below). The authorities had informed the applicant several times that her requested methods of compensation were not possible under domestic law. In 2003 the applicant had been informed that if a citizen did not express a decision as to a method of restitution before 1 April 2003, the authorities had to issue decisions taking into account the method indicated in the citizen\u2019s last request (see paragraph 10 above). In June 2009 the authorities had indicated the method by which the compensation would be calculated and had stated that the value of the 2.5469 hectares of land which had to be restored to the applicant would be LTL 20,167 (approximately EUR 5,841) if the applicant preferred to acquire the land in another area, and LTL\u00a032,267 (approximately EUR 9,345) if she preferred compensation in securities (see paragraph 16 above). In June 2010 the authorities had asked the applicant to choose the method of restitution: receiving either an area of land, forest or water of equal value (see paragraph 18 above). In October 2010 the authorities had repeatedly explained that the applicant could receive either a plot of land of equal value or compensation in securities, and should she fail to make a decision then she would be paid compensation in securities (see paragraph 21 above). In November 2010 the applicant had been asked to come to the Kaunas Division of the National Land Service to discuss the issue of restitution (see paragraph 23 above). In November 2014 the authorities had informed the applicant that it had become possible to have a plot of forest of equal value in a rural area (see paragraph 25 above). The court further held that the actions of the National Land Service had been lawful, considering that the applicant\u2019s requests had not been possible under domestic law. Moreover, the authorities had stated that a decision to pay the applicant monetary compensation would be issued. The court therefore decided to change the first-instance decision and not award the applicant any compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

There was a public interest in using that land, thus the land was State redeemable and compensation had to be paid for it. The court further assessed the actions of the National Land Service and held that the authorities\u2019 actions had been lawful. This was because the applicant had not agreed with the information indicating that her father\u2019s land was not vacant, and because on one hand she had asked for her property rights to be restored in natura, and on the other hand had asked for compensation at \u201cmarket\u201d and \u201cworld market\u201d prices, although there was no such possibility under domestic law. Fair compensation was also a way to restore property rights, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 53 below). The value of the land had been calculated in accordance with the method approved by the Government (see paragraph 52 below), and the amount calculated for the applicant had been in accordance with that method. Moreover, the court referred to the case-law of the Court, where it had been established that no right to receive a higher amount of compensation was guaranteed under the applicable domestic law or by a decision of the domestic court (see paragraph 54 below).

The Court has also already accepted that Lithuania has chosen the principle of partial restitution to rectify old wrongs, and has found it pertinent that a similar methodology adopted by the Lithuanian Government on land-price calculation was used in a high percentage of cases in Lithuania (see Pauk\u0161tis, cited above, \u00a7 81). The Court thus finds that no right to receive a higher amount of compensation was guaranteed under the applicable domestic law (see paragraph 52 above). The Court has regard to the margin of appreciation that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 affords national authorities, the extensive jurisprudence of the domestic courts (see paragraph 54 above), and the line of reasoning that the Court has already adopted regarding the restitution of property in Lithuania (see Kavaliauskas and Others, cited above, \u00a7 55; Valan\u010dien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 67; and \u0160imaitien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a055056/10, \u00a7 54, 21 February 2017), from which it sees no reason to depart.

In December 1993 and April 1994, 0.66\u00a0hectares were returned to her in natura (see paragraph 9 above), and the remaining land in respect of which her rights were to be restored measured 2.74 hectares. On 21 October 2009 the authorities restored the applicant\u2019s property rights by giving her two plots of land measuring 0.0807 and 0.1124 hectares, and the remaining land in respect of which her rights were to be restored measured 2.5469 hectares (see paragraph 17 above).",

However, it notes that two sets of court proceedings did not directly concern the restoration of the applicant\u2019s property rights to the remaining 2.5469 hectares. One set of court proceedings concerned her alleged inability to use the land that had already been returned to her (see paragraphs 26-28 above), and the other set concerned land that had allegedly been unlawfully sold to a third party (see paragraphs 29-31 above). Moreover, the court proceedings lodged by the applicant in 2013 concerned the length of the restitution process, but the courts found that the authorities had acted lawfully and found against the applicant (see paragraphs 32-36 above). Even after those proceedings were over in July 2015, it still took the authorities almost one year and five months to issue the decision on monetary compensation (see paragraph 39 above). While the Court accepts that the applicant is responsible for the fact that the compensation has not been transferred, it cannot accept that the Lithuanian authorities took the necessary actions in order to finalise the process of restitution for the applicant without undue delay. On the contrary, although responsibility for part of the overall delay in the restitution process falls on the applicant, the Court does not see why the authorities could not take the decision to pay her compensation if it was obvious that her requirements were not based on any provisions of domestic law, and that eventually they would take the decision to pay her monetary compensation anyway (see paragraph 47 above).",

Moreover, the applicant\u2019s legitimate expectation to have her property rights in respect of the remaining plot of land restored was unjustifiably affected by the authorities\u2019 failure to act. As a result of the lengthy proceedings, the balance which had to be struck between the general interest and the applicant\u2019s personal interest was upset, and she had to bear an individual and excessive burden, which is incompatible with Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention.",
