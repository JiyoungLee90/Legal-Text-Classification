The amount covered the period between 16 November 2004 and 28 April 2015, when the first-instance panel of the Supreme Court had rendered its decision. The Court recalls that according to established case-law, the reasonable time in civil matters may begin to run, in some circumstances, even before the dispute is submitted for adjudication by a court, namely where a court cannot be seized without prior recourse to a remedy before a non-judicial organ (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 65, ECHR\u00a02007II; Janssen v. Germany, no. 23959/94, \u00a7 40, 20 December 2001; and Bo\u017ei\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 22457/02, \u00a7 26, 29 June 2006). The Court therefore considers that in the present case, the time to be taken into account began on 27\u00a0July 2004, \u00a0when the applicant brought an appeal before the appeals commission against the decision by which his restitution claim had been dismissed (see \u00a7 6 above). As regards the level of the compensation awarded on non-pecuniary grounds, the Court notes that the amount is approximately 35% of what the Court generally awards \u00a0for non-pecuniary damage \u00a0in similar cases against the respondent State. The Court thus finds that the compensation awarded to the applicant by the domestic court is manifestly inadequate having regard to what the Court would have been likely to award the applicant under Article 41 of the Convention in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The award therefore cannot be regarded as sufficient in the circumstances of the case to remove the applicant\u2019s \u201cvictim\u201d status under Article 34 of the Convention (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2006V). Consequently, the Government\u2019s objection must be dismissed.",

Therefore, the Court will not assess the impact of the length remedy on the pending restitution proceedings for the purposes of the Article 13 complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Golha v. the Czech Republic, no. 7051/06, \u00a7 72, 26\u00a0May 2011).",

Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, \u00a7 123, 10 September 2010). The Court notes that the proceedings related to the applicant\u2019s complaint about the length of the restitution proceedings started on 3 July 2014 and ended on 21\u00a0March 2016. Accordingly, they lasted one year, eight months and eighteen days at two levels of jurisdiction (see paragraphs 7 and 12 above). The Court takes note of the delays related to the transfer of the case file (see paragraph 8 above) and the exchange between the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Justice of the respondent State, on the one hand, and between the Macedonian and Serbian Ministries, on the other (see paragraph\u00a010 above), which affected the duration of the proceedings before that court. Although the overall duration of the proceedings related to the applicant\u2019s length complaint exceeded the statutory six-month period prescribed by section 36(4) of the Courts Act (see paragraph 14 above), the Court does not consider that in the circumstances of the case such a period of time was incompatible with the requirement of speediness (see CE.DI.SA\u00a0Fortore S.N.C. Diagnostica Medica Chirurgica v. Italy, nos.\u00a041107/02 and 22405/03, \u00a7 39, 27 September 2011, in which the Court stated that, in principle, such proceedings should not exceed two years for two court instances, and in contrast, Vidas v.
