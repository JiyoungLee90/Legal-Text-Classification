The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002-VIII; and Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v. Serbia [GC], no. 17153/11, \u00a7 70, 25 March 2014). The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies therefore requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his or her Convention grievances. The applicants must further comply with the applicable rules and procedures of domestic law, including time-limits, failing which their application is likely to fall foul of the condition laid down in Article 35 \u00a7 1 (see, for example, Cardot v. France, 19 March 1991, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 200; Akdivar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV; and Vu\u010dkovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 72). The Court has, however, also frequently underlined the need to apply the exhaustion rule with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Akdivar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069; and Vu\u010dkovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 76).",

The Constitutional Court, however, ultimately rejected these claims as belated, referring, inter alia, to Article 85 \u00a7 3 of the Constitutional Court Act, as amended in 2011, requiring that such claims be \u201cbrought simultaneously with the lodging of a constitutional appeal\u201d (see paragraphs 22 and 27 above).
