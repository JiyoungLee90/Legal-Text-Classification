After representing a number of clients in three sets of expropriation proceedings, a certain amount was awarded to those clients for court expenses incurred, including lawyers\u2019 fees. Pursuant to domestic legislation, that amount was deposited in the Consignment Deposits and Loans Fund (\u03a4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd) to the benefit of the bar association with which the representatives of the person whose property was expropriated were registered. Under the law, such money should be deposited in the Fund so that the relevant bar association can then request the money and \u2013 having withheld for itself a percentage prescribed by law \u2013 forward the remainder to the lawyer concerned. The applicants complained under Articles 6 of the Convention and 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention about the judgments delivered by the domestic courts dismissing their applications to have those amounts handed over to the Athens Bar Association, holding that only the relevant bar association could directly initiate proceedings seeking the payment of that amount and that the applicants could only bring a subrogation action.",

Turning to whether there was a relevant \u201cright\u201d that could be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised in domestic law, the Court recalls in this regard that, pursuant to domestic legislation, the person liable for paying compensation, in these cases the State or State-owned companies, shall deposit the lawyers\u2019\u00a0fees, as fixed by the court, in the Consignment Deposits and Loans Fund to the benefit of the bar association with whom the lawyers are registered (see paragraph 26 above). It follows that the applicants, in their capacities as the lawyers who had represented certain clients in expropriation proceedings, had the right to such fees and could require their payment, after the Bar Association, to the benefit of which the fees were deposited, had withheld the relevant amounts. The Court therefore concludes that the dispute in question concerned the applicants\u2019 right under the domestic law to receive the amounts fixed as lawyers\u2019 fees by the court ruling on the expropriation.",

In their view, there was no provision in the Greek legal system (i) stipulating that a lawyer could not bring a direct action seeking that such a fee be deposited with the relevant bar association or (ii) explicitly authorising that bar association to bring a direct action seeking the payment of the fee of the lawyer in question, as determined by the relevant domestic judgments.

In particular, the said provision served the legitimate aim of ensuring that a lawyer would receive his fee, rather than that fee being withheld by his client, and that the bar association in question should not suffer any damage in so far as the percentage to be distributed to its members was concerned. Accordingly, the said provision was to the benefit of both the lawyer in question and all the members of the bar association to whom he belonged. The efficiency of that system was proved by the outcome of case 67463/12, in which the action brought by the Athens Bar Association had resulted in the applicant receiving his fees. It followed from the domestic legislation and relevant case-law that a lawyer was not hindered in seeking the payment of his fees, as he had two possibilities: he could either bring a subrogation action seeking that the amount deposited in the Consignment Deposits and Loans Fund be handed over to his bar association, or he could bring a direct action against his client in accordance with the procedure applicable to disputes arising from the provision of services and demand the fee that had been agreed upon.\u00a0\u00a0In view of the above-mentioned considerations, the Government were of the view that there had been no violation of the applicants\u2019 right of access to a court.",

In that case, the Court found the right of access to a court to be an inherent aspect of the safeguards enshrined in Article 6, referring to the principles of the rule of law and the avoidance of arbitrary power that underlay much of the Convention. Thus, Article 6 \u00a7 1 secures to everyone the right to have a claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court (see Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a032555/96, \u00a7 116; see also Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a029392/95, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2001V; Cudak v.\u00a0Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a015869/02, \u00a7\u00a054, ECHR\u00a02010 and Zubac v.

This observation is particularly true in respect of the guarantees provided by Article 6, in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial (see Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a042527/98, \u00a7\u00a045, ECHR 2001-VIII).

Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Zubac, cited above, \u00a7 78, and Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 89, with further references).",

It is not clear from the domestic framework provided why the applicants\u2019\u00a0actions (seeking to have the amounts awarded to their clients as lawyers\u2019\u00a0fees deposited with their respective bar associations) were rejected \u2013 especially if one takes into account judgment\u00a025/1993 issued by the Special Supreme Administrative Court by which such a right was recognised in respect of engineers for the recovery of fees against their clients (see paragraph 30 above). None of the provisions cited in the domestic judgments explicitly deprived the applicants of the right to bring a relevant action. The Court considers that the present cases and the system governing the lawyers\u2019 fees in expropriation proceedings differs from the case of engineers, which the Court examined in Philis (cited above) and resulted in the adoption of the aforementioned judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court. However, they share a common feature, given that, in Philis, as well as in the present cases, the beneficiaries were denied direct locus standi to assert their claims, in addition to the possibility offered by the domestic law to the relevant professional bodies to lodge a relevant action.",

As regards the subrogation action, the Court notes that it is generally agreed that such an action constitutes a sui generis action aimed at safeguarding the property of a debtor in the interests of a creditor. A person who brings a subrogation action must prove that he is the creditor of a debtor who has neglected to exercise his rights (see Philis, cited above, \u00a7 52). However, the Government have not adduced any domestic judgments in which a subrogation action brought by a lawyer seeking to have fees fixed by domestic courts in expropriation proceedings deposited with a bar association have been accepted by the domestic courts. What is more, the provisions relating to the possibility to bring a subrogation action relate to the relationship between a creditor and a debtor; therefore, the interpretation taken by the domestic courts was not easily inferred.",

Under the relevant domestic legislation this could constitute an effective remedy in proceedings in which a fee has been agreed upon by a lawyer and his client; however, in expropriation proceedings a lawyer\u2019s fee is fixed by the court and it appears that the system governing the lawyers\u2019 fees in expropriations differs from the ordinary system (see domestic legislation cited in paragraph 24 above). The Court takes note of the domestic judgments holding that that amount is separate from the actual fee agreed by a lawyer and his client. However, while those judgments affirmed a lawyer\u2019s right to seek independently and directly his fee from his client (irrespective of what the expropriation court had awarded), the Court has not been apprised of any actual instance of a lawyer successfully bringing such an action following expropriation proceedings. In this regard, the Court reiterates that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, among many other authorities, Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, \u00a7 272, 13\u00a0September 2016). The fact that there exist some remedies available in theory should not lead the Court to ascertain that they are available in practice, especially when the Government have failed to provide any relevant domestic decision illustrating the effectiveness of such remedy. In the present cases, the domestic decisions adduced by the Government refer to procedures other than expropriation, which, however, as said above, is governed by a different system relating to lawyers\u2019 fees.",

The above-mentioned conclusions are not contradicted by the fact that the applicants in the end received some, or even all, the fees awarded in the respective cases, following the actions brought by the Athens Bar Association. The applicants were still faced with the lack of a coherent system to assert their claims, namely to request that the amounts fixed as lawyers\u2019 fees by the courts ruling on expropriation be deposited to the Bar Association with whom they were registered, and, in the absence of an alternative domestic remedy, could claim to be victims of a violation of their right of access to a court.",

In addition, having regard to the nature of the alleged violation, the Court considers that the effects of the possible violation have also been addressed by the applicant having received the relevant amount. The Court finds therefore that both conditions for the application of Article\u00a037 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention are met. The matter giving rise to the applicant\u2019s complaints can therefore now be considered to be \u201cresolved\u201d within the meaning of Article 37 \u00a7 1 (b). Finally, no particular reason relating to respect for human rights as defined in the Convention requires the Court to continue its examination of the application under Article 37 \u00a7\u00a01 in fine. Consequently, the case should be struck out of the list in so far as the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention is concerned.",
