The trial court established that on 22 June 2004, a certain N. (the last name of Mr K.N., as established in the course of the domestic proceedings, later\u00a0referred to as Mr\u00a0K.N.) and the third applicant had arrived at the first applicant's house where she lived with the second applicant, her stepson. The applicants bought 1,012 g of heroin from N. for 7,500 euros (EUR). After keeping some drugs back at the house, the applicants divided the remaining 952 g into two packs to sell to Mr\u00a0N.N., an unidentified end buyer whom they had arranged to meet in a car park near Gevgelija. The second applicant hired a taxi and the remaining applicants took N.'s car to meet Mr N.N. The police stopped the cars and found the drugs in the taxi. N. escaped. The trial court established these facts on the basis, inter alia, of the statements of the second and third applicants given in the pre-trial proceedings. The court also referred to the first and third applicants' statements at the hearing, notably that they had been victims of a constructed scenario and that they had not known N. before the date when the offence was committed, but disregarded them as self-serving. The testimonies of two witnesses, as well as items of real evidence, were also taken into account.",

They further maintained that Mr K.N. had cooperated with the police in other cases, setting up other people in order to help his cousin who was serving a prison sentence for drug trafficking. The police's involvement in the crime was supported, inter alia, by the following: they had allowed Mr K.N. and Mr N.N., the unidentified end buyer, to leave the scene at the time of the applicants' arrest; the drugs had not been found in a routine police check, but on the basis of advance information about their whereabouts; and two detectives with known identities had been present at the scene.

An appeal on points of law was therefore an effective remedy against the final decision of 25 March 2005 which upheld their conviction (see Gorgievski, cited above, and Mamudovski, cited above). On 16 May 2005 the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court. The detailed grounds of the appeal were dated 30\u00a0May 2005 (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). The Supreme Court rejected the appeal as having been submitted outside the thirty-day time-limit provided for in section 411 of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraph 15 above). In doing so, the court took 13 April 2005 as the date of service of the Court of Appeal's decision. The court did not, however, take into consideration the copy of the return receipts bearing the detention centre's receipt stamp and the applicants' signatures. This was because, as the Government conceded, they had not been included in the case file forwarded to the Supreme Court. While the Court cannot speculate which authority affixed the stamp of 13 April 2005, it is clear that the Court of Appeal's decision was received by the detention centre on 14 April 2005. According to the applicants' signatures on those receipts, the first applicant received this decision on 18 April 2005, the second applicant on 14\u00a0April\u00a02005 and the third on 16 April 2005. In these circumstances, the applicants' appeal on points of law of 16 May 2005 was, in view of section 84 of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraph 14 above), submitted in good time.",
