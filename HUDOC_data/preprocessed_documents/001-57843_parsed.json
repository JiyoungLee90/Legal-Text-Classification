It is clear that he would have rejoined TGWU had he received a form of apology acceptable to him (see paragraphs 10-11 above) and that accordingly his case, unlike theirs, does not also have to be considered in the light of Articles 9 and 10 (art. 9, art. 10) of the Convention. Furthermore, the present case is not one in which a closed shop agreement was in force (see paragraph 12 above). Above all, the applicants in the earlier case were faced with a threat of dismissal involving loss of livelihood (see the judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 23, para. 55), whereas Mr Sibson was in a rather different position: he had the possibility of going to work at the nearby Chadderton depot, to which his employers were contractually entitled to move him (see paragraphs 10 and 14 above); their offer to him in this respect was not conditional on his rejoining TGWU; and it is not established that his working conditions there would have been significantly less favourable than those at the Greengate depot (see paragraph 25 above).",

I regret to be unable to agree with the reasoning of the majority and with its conclusion that there has been no violation of Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention in the present case. The facts, established in paragraphs 7 to 15 of the judgment show, on the contrary, that Mr Sibson\u2019s freedom of association was violated as a result of the compulsion exerted by his employer threatening either to move him to another place of work or to suspend him without pay if he did not rejoin the union that he had previously abandoned. In my view the termination of the applicant\u2019s contract of employment that followed his refusal to join a union against his will amounts to a relevant and unjustified interference with his rights under Article 11 (art. 11) for which the United Kingdom is responsible, in accordance with Article 1 (art. 1) of the Convention, since the infringement resulted from the failure of the United Kingdom to fulfil its positive obligation to adapt the legal system in order to secure that freedom.",

Protection of freedom of association would be incomplete if it extended to no more than the positive aspect. It is one and the same right that is involved\".",

Ireland judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, p. 24, para. 51). In this respect, Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, when defining the right to freedom of association, expressly declares in paragraph 2 that \"no one may be compelled to belong to an association\". The omission of that clause in the European Convention should not be interpreted, in my view, as limiting the exercise of that right: the Convention - according to its Preamble - was created as a step towards the collective enforcement of certain of the rights stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with the aim of \"the maintenance and further realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"",

In the same paragraph of the said judgment, the Court also stated that even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the general rule stated in Article 20 para. 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was deliberately omitted from the Convention, \"it does not follow that the negative aspect of a person\u2019s freedom of association falls completely outside the ambit of Article 11 (art. 11) and that each and every compulsion to join a particular trade union is compatible with the intention of that provision. To construe Article 11 (art. 11) as permitting every kind of compulsion in the field of trade union membership would strike at the very substance of the freedom it is designed to guarantee\". And, finally, as to the necessity of the measure taken against an employee for refusing to join a specific trade union, in paragraph 63 of its judgment the Court said that \"a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position\".",

They also narrow the doctrine of the Court as set forth in the previous case by diluting the concept of compulsion to one of \"treatment\" and by not considering the pressure exerted on Mr Sibson to join a union against his will, which resulted in a loss of his livelihood, as striking at the very substance of his freedom of association.",

Having regard to these various distinguishing factors, they come to the conclusion that \"Mr Sibson was not subjected to a form of treatment striking at the very substance of the freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11 (art. 11)\".",

If, as the English Court of Appeal decided (paragraph 14), the case is covered only by the law of contract and Mr Sibson was not unfairly dismissed for refusing to move to the nearby depot indicated by his employer since he failed to show the prejudice that he suffered from such a measure, no question arose as to the reasons for his resignation when he considered himself \"constructively dismissed\" (paragraph 19); this being the case the reference to Young, James and Webster seems unnecessary since it would not be applicable. If, on the contrary, the present case is covered by Article 11 (art. 11) as interpreted in the previous case, such circumstances are irrelevant and the motive for his transfer becomes an essential issue.",

I also consider that the motive of the applicant\u2019s employer in exercising his contractual rights to transfer the applicant is a decisive element in reaching this conclusion. The transfer of the applicant was not made for genuine operational reasons, \"the sole purpose being to avoid a strike\" (paragraph 12) threatened by his fellow employees if Mr Sibson did not rejoin the TGWU since they had voted for a closed shop which had not existed at Greengate (paragraph 10).",

As regards Mr Sibson\u2019s motives for refusing to rejoin TGWU to the point of not accepting the pressure exerted on him by his employer and his fellow workers and to consider himself \"constructively dismissed\" (paragraph 19), it further appears from the facts that he was not satisfied with the decision to dismiss a complaint that he had lodged with the local branch of the union, concerning an alleged accusation of appropriation of the funds of the union when he was branch secretary, something that he considered deprecatory (paragraph 9). In my view, his objection was not whimsical or opportunist, but was based on his sense of self-esteem and honour that, in my view, are part of the freedom of association protected by Article 11 (art. 11) and deserve to be treated in the same way as other conscientious objections such as those of Mr Young, Mr James and Mr Webster.

It violated a fundamental freedom of an employee and clearly amounted to an abusive imposition of a de facto closed shop, where it did not exist, in order to force him to act against the dictates of his conscience.
