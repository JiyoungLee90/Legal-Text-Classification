Although Article 3 of the Convention cannot be construed as laying down a general obligation to release detainees on health grounds, it nonetheless imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well-being of persons deprived of their liberty, for example by providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see Hurtado v.\u00a0Switzerland, 28 January 1994, Series A no. 280-A, opinion of the Commission, pp.\u00a015-16, \u00a7 79).",

On the other hand, a psychiatrist treated her during her detention in the CFECC and initially considered her state of health satisfactory. The Court considers that in such circumstances the need to offer the applicant additional medical assistance was not self-evident.

The Court also notes that despite an improvement in the applicant's health by the date of her transfer, noted by the doctor (see paragraph 22 above), it was still considered necessary to transfer her to a specialised hospital. This supports the overall impression that her detention at the CFECC after 17\u00a0August 2006 was incompatible with her medical condition.",

Moreover, the higher court, and subsequently another investigating judge, gave no consideration to any of these arguments in their decisions, apparently treating them as irrelevant to the question of the lawfulness of the applicant's pre-trial detention, even though they were obliged to consider such factors under Article 176 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see Sarban, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 101). This is striking, given the fact that on 29 July 2006 an investigating judge had found that a number of those factors militated against the applicant's detention (see paragraph\u00a010 above). The courts limited themselves in their decisions to repeating in an abstract and formulaic way the formal grounds for detention provided by law. These grounds were cited without any attempt to show how they applied to the applicant's case or on which specific facts the courts had relied when assessing the risks posed by the applicant. There was, moreover, no examination of alternative preventive measures such as house arrest or detention in a specialised medical institution, which would also have prevented any attempt by the applicant to influence witnesses. It is also important to note that it was never argued that during the time when she was subjected to a non-custodial preventive measure the applicant had tried to abscond or interfere in any manner with the investigation. The courts failed to take this into account, just as they did not devote sufficient attention to her state of health, which was also relevant for the decision applying the preventive measure of arrest.",
