It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents.

The Court also considers it justified to draw a negative inference from the Government\u2019s failure to provide the necessary information about the occupancy of the applicant\u2019s cells in the period from 17 August 2005 to 7 August 2007, from 17\u00a0July 2008 to 13 August 2009 and from 8 January to 26 April 2010, and to conclude that the applicant himself was affected by the general and systemic problem of overcrowding.

In consequence, the Court further considered that all situations in which a detainee was deprived of the minimum of 3\u00a0sq.\u00a0m of living space inside his or her cell would be regarded as creating a strong indication that Article 3 of the Convention had been violated (ibid.).",
