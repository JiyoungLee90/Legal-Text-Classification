[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. The Court finds further that rape is for its victim an offence of manifestly debasing character and thus emphasises the State's procedural obligation arising in this context (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 November 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0335B; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 November 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0335C; and M.C. v. , no.\u00a039272/98, \u00a7\u00a0153, ECHR 2003XII). The effective official investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Assenov and Others v.

The case was remitted for fresh investigation and later discontinued by the prosecution for, among other things, the acknowledged inability to remedy the breaches of the domestic procedure committed by the investigators during the first five months of the inquiry (see paragraphs 58 and 59). Owing to the nature of the evidence declared inadmissible by the trial court, it could not apparently be re-used after remittal of the case for additional investigation, and in these circumstances it is not surprising that the criminal proceedings were ultimately discontinued for lack of evidence of a crime.",

The Court further indicates, as it has held on many occasions, that the authorities have an obligation to protect the physical integrity of persons in detention and that in assessing evidence it has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18\u00a0January 1978, Series A no.\u00a025, pp. 64-65, \u00a7 161). Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.
