A group of guards headed by captain Al. and major Mak. entered cell no. 40 where the applicant was held. The guards, kicking the inmates and hitting them with rubber truncheons, forced them to leave the cell. In the hallway the applicant saw two rows of some twenty to twenty-five guards. The inmates were told to run between them down the hallway. While the applicant was running, he received several blows to his back and head with rubber truncheons. The inmates then had to walk up the stairs where guards continued to hit them with truncheons. On the next floor the applicant again saw rows of guards between which he was forced to run. At the end of the corridor the inmates were told to squat down and remain in that position, with their faces turned to the wall. The beatings continued. The guards also searched the inmates one by one. They searched the cell and seized the inmates\u2019 personal belongings, documents related to criminal proceedings, letters, photos and money. On 14 April 2002 a prison doctor allegedly visited cell no. 40, but refused to record the inmates\u2019 injuries.",

However, it is obvious that hitting a detainee with a truncheon was not conducive to the desired result, that is, to facilitate the search. In the Court\u2019s view, in that situation the blows with the truncheon were merely a form of reprisal or corporal punishment (see Dedovskiy and Others v.

The applicant asserted that he had been beaten up by guard L. The Government, however, submitted that the use of force against the applicant had been in compliance with the law. Guard L. had had to subdue the applicant to carry out a search. According to the medical documents, a day after the altercation the applicant had a bruise on his left forearm. While the Court does not exclude that this injury could have resulted from the use of force against the applicant, it is nevertheless not persuaded that, in the circumstances of the case, the use of force by guard L. was excessive and that it reached the level of severity required under Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",

First, solitary confinement measures should be ordered only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules. Second, the decision imposing solitary confinement must be based on genuine grounds both ab initio as well as when its duration is extended. Third, the authorities\u2019 decisions should make it possible to establish that they have carried out an assessment of the situation that takes into account the prisoner\u2019s circumstances, situation and behaviour and must provide substantive reasons in their support. The statement of reasons should be increasingly detailed and compelling as time goes by. Finally, a system of regular monitoring of the prisoner\u2019s physical and mental condition should also be put in place in order to ensure that the solitary confinement measures remain appropriate in the circumstances (see Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, \u00a7 139).\u201d",

Accordingly, his solitary confinement lasted over one year and nine months. The Court notes that a period of such length may give rise to concern per se because of the risk of harmful effects upon mental health. However, when assessing whether the length was excessive under Article 3 the Court must also take into account the conditions of the detention, including the extent of the social isolation (see Rohde v. , no. 69332/01, \u00a7 97, 21 July 2005).",
