It also found that, during the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention in Burgas Prison, his cell had had no toilet facilities but he had had free access to toilets outside the cell. Since 1999, when the applicant had been transferred to Lovech Prison, he had shared a cell with one or two inmates and had been allowed to use the toilet facilities three times a day; the rest of the time he had had to relieve himself in a bucket in the cell. The cell had had only one window, which had constantly remained closed, preventing the flow of fresh air. Furthermore, until 2001 the window had been covered with tin blinds, which had not allowed natural light into the cell. The applicant had not been given any newspapers. The court found that none of the above measures had been required under the legislation or regulations governing the execution of sentences; in particular, the requirement that life prisoners be kept under heightened supervision (see paragraph 41 below). Those conditions had been attributable to unlawful omissions of the prison administration, had amounted to illtreatment, and had caused the applicant harm.",

By section 71(2), persons placed under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d must be kept in constantly locked cells and be under heightened supervision. Section 71(3), which was inserted in December 2012 and came into effect on 1 January 2013, provides that persons sentenced to life imprisonment with or without commutation and placed under the \u201csevere regime\u201d are similarly to be kept in constantly locked cells and be placed under heightened supervision unless it is possible, having regard to the requirements of section 198(2), to place them with the general prison population. According to the explanatory note to the draft bill laid before Parliament, this new provision was necessary to prevent legal challenges brought by lifers to their being kept constantly under lock and key even though their regime had been changed from \u201cspecial\u201d to \u201csevere\u201d (see paragraphs\u00a05660 below).",

However, if the claim was eventually wholly or partly dismissed, the court was to order the claimant to pay \u201cthe court fees and costs due\u201d. The courts construed that provision as meaning that the claimant should pay fees calculated pro rata the part of the claim which had been dismissed. As a result, where a court held that a claim for damages under the Act was wellfounded but excessive as to quantum, it ordered the defendant State authority to pay damages to the claimant and at the same time ordered the claimant to pay court fees to the State budget. Where the claimant indicated too high an amount in the statement of claim, the fee could exceed the sum awarded in damages. As a result, the overall financial award could be in favour of the State despite the finding that the claimant had suffered damage that called for compensation under the Act (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1095 \u043e\u0442 25 \u044e\u043b\u0438 2000 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 139/2000 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, and \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 805 \u043e\u0442 1 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442 2005 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 56/2004 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421).

Parliament enacted the bill on\u00a017\u00a0April 2008 and the amending Act came into force on 30 May 2008. Section 10(2) was changed and now deals solely with costs. Court fees are presently governed by a newly added section 9a(1), which provides for a fixed fee, at a level to be set by the Government. Under the tariff of fees collected by the courts under the Code of Civil Procedure, as currently in force, the fee is BGN 10 (EUR 5.11) in respect of firstinstance proceedings, BGN 5 (EUR 2.56) in respect of appellate proceedings, and BGN 5 (EUR 2.56) in respect of cassation proceedings.

Bulgaria, nos. 4473/02 and 34138/04, \u00a7\u00a7 46, 50 and 5456, 10\u00a0February 2011, and Radkov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 53). The Court had earlier come to a similar conclusion in respect of the effectiveness of purely compensatory remedies in a number of cases against Poland (see Norbert Sikorski v. Poland, no. 17599/05, \u00a7 116, 22 October 2009; Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04, \u00a7 109, 22 October 2009; \u0141omi\u0144ski v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 33502/09, \u00a7\u00a7 6876, 12 October 2010; and \u0141atak v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 52070/08, \u00a7\u00a7 7785, 12 October 2010). However, in several cases the Court found that claims under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act had proved ineffective as a result of the unduly formalistic approach of courts in the assessment of the nonpecuniary damage sustained by the prisoners (see Iovchev v. Bulgaria, no. 41211/98, \u00a7 146, 2 February 2006; Iliev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 48; Radkov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 3839; and Shahanov v.

It is true that in the second set of proceedings brought by the applicant the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal touched upon that issue. However, that court, perhaps straying somewhat from the actual claim put before it by the applicant (see paragraph 25 above and, mutatis mutandis, Shahanov, cited above, \u00a7 39), did not rule in terms that the requirement for life prisoners to remain constantly isolated from the general prison population and constantly locked cells gave rise to a claim for damages under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act. It confined itself to holding that the requirement that life prisoners be subjected to heightened supervision could not justify keeping them in filthy and unsanitary conditions, depriving them of unimpeded access to a toilet, and depriving them of access to newspapers (see paragraph 28 above). It should in addition be noted that the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court have refused to entertain claims under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act relating to conditions of detention which flow directly from the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the \u201cspecial regime\u201d (see paragraphs 27, 60 and 63 above). The Government have not pointed to any caselaw to the contrary (see Chervenkov v. , no.\u00a045358/04, \u00a7 56, 27 November 2012). It follows that in the particular circumstances of this case the applicant was not required to bring a further claim under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act in relation to the period after April 2006.",

The Court found in Mr Radkov\u2019s case that the compensation that he had been awarded in those proceedings could not be regarded as adequate redress for two reasons. First, the courts, although acknowledging that the conditions of his detention had been in breach of Article 3 of the Convention and had continued for a long time, had awarded him a much lesser amount than he had sought, on the sole ground that he had failed to adduce evidence that he had suffered nonpecuniary damage.

Bulgaria (no. 41035/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06265, 18 January 2005). The principles governing the application of that provision in relation to the regime and conditions of detention of life prisoners were recently summarised in the Court\u2019s judgment in Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom (nos. 24027/07, 11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09, \u00a7\u00a7 20014, 10 April 2012). The Court has in particular held that an impoverished regime which isolates a life prisoner for a long time is likely, in the long term, to have damaging effects, resulting in deterioration of mental faculties and social abilities (see Iorgov v. Bulgaria, no. 40653/98, \u00a7\u00a7 8384, 11 March 2004), and that such a regime cannot be regarded as warranted unless based on proper risk considerations, and should not be maintained after such risk has subsided (see Babar Ahmad and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 20711).",

It therefore lasted about nine years. During that time the applicant was placed under the socalled \u201cspecial regime\u201d, which required that he be kept constantly in a locked cell under heightened supervision (see paragraph 41 above).

This Court, for its part, found a breach of that provision in relation to the conditions of detention in the life imprisonment unit of Lovech Prison in the case of Radkov (no. 2) (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 4452). In view of that, and taking into account the cumulative effect of those conditions, regardless of whether they flowed from the applicable regulatory framework or from its practical implementation \u2013 in particular, the need for the applicant to resort to a plastic bucket for his sanitary needs and his strict isolation for a long period of time (contrast Petyo Petkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 5355) \u2013 the Court considers that the distress and hardship endured by him exceeded the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and went beyond the minimum threshold of severity required by Article 3 of the Convention. It should be noted in this connection that in contrast to the situation of Mr Iorgov, whose regime was gradually relaxed by way of an \u201cexperiment\u201d in Pleven Prison in 200304 \u2013 favourably commented upon by the CPT \u2013, initially as regards access to the lavatories and then as regards isolation from other prisoners (see Iorgov v.  (no. 2), no. 36295/02, \u00a7\u00a7 2123 and 42, 2 September 2010, and paragraph 71 in fine above), the applicant in the present case remained under the full strictures of the \u201cspecial regime\u201d throughout the period under consideration.",
