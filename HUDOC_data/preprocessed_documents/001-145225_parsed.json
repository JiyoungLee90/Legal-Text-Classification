In this connection, the Court notes that according to the available evidence, the police cells had no furniture except beds and that the Government did not clarify whether the applicant had been given cutlery (see paragraph 11 above). In addition, it appears that the leaking water pipes in the ceiling in Bac\u0103u Prison were not repaired until August 2012 (see paragraph 17 above).
