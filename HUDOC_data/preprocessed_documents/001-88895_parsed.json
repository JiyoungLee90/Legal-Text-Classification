However, on 25\u00a0November\u00a01998 the applicant had informed the public prosecutor at the  that he had been made to sign his police statements without reading them, but no action was taken in respect of this allegation. The public prosecutor did not even ask the applicant to detail his statements. Furthermore, the applicant demonstrated his intention to bring proceedings in respect of his allegations of illtreatment by the document dated 17 January 1999, prepared for his lawyers, whose authenticity was not challenged by the respondent Government, and by applying to the Human Rights Foundation the day after his release from police custody. The Court therefore considers that it is not its role to speculate on the reasons for the inactivity of the applicant\u2019s representatives in respect of the formal complaint. In any event, under Article 102 of the former Criminal Code, in force at the material time, taken together with Articles\u00a0243 and 245 of the same Code, there was a five-year time-limit for prosecuting offences of illtreatment committed by civil servants. Indeed, the public prosecutor could not and did not dismiss the criminal complaint on the ground that it had been submitted too late. Consequently, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s submission that the applicant\u2019s allegations were unsubstantiated as he had failed to lodge a complaint earlier.",

As to the report of 4 August 1999, the Court observes that it was drafted following very detailed medical examinations which were conducted over five days. It included not only physical but psychological findings, and an interpretation as to the probable relationship of these findings to possible torture or ill-treatment (see, in this respect, the \u201cIstanbul\u00a0Protocol\u201d, cited above, paragraph 81).
