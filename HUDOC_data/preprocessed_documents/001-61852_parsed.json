With regard to the suspicion against the applicant and the danger of absconding and of a repetition of the offences, the court referred to its decision of 14\u00a0January\u00a01998. Invoking Article 131 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung), according to which detention on remand must not exceed six months unless the investigations are particularly complex, it found that the present proceedings concerned an exceedingly complex case of white-collar crimes. The offences to be investigated had been committed by a number of co-accused over a period of four years, numerous companies with links to foreign countries were involved and a great number of witnesses had to be heard, many of them under letters rogatory. A period of detention of up to one year appeared proportionate, all the more so because, given the maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, even a further prolongation of the detention to up to two years would be admissible under Article 131.

In particular, it must be adversarial, i.e. it must ensure \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the parties, the prosecutor and the detained person (Nikolova v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999-II with further references).",

As to the lack of legal representation at the hearing of 19 September 1997 concerning the applicant\u2019s request for release, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s legal aid request was refused on the day of the hearing on the ground that he was not indigent. Moreover, he was represented by counsel of his own choosing in a second set of criminal proceedings. The Court of Appeal could, therefore, assume that the applicant was in a position to appoint counsel if he wished to be represented. The Court does not see any particular circumstances which would have required the court to ensure, of its own motion, that the applicant be represented by counsel (see, mutatis mutandis, Megyeri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23). Consequently, the applicant\u2019s rights as guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 have not been infringed in this repect.",

At the beginning of the hearing of 17 December counsel drew the court\u2019s attention to this fact and submitted that his preparation had been limited to two hours\u2019 consultation with the applicant while he had not had a possibility to study the voluminous file.

Belgium, judgment of 30 March 1989, Series A no.\u00a0151, pp. 16-17, \u00a7 29, Sch\u00f6ps v. Germany, no. 25116/94, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2001-I). The Court considers that lack of adequate time to prepare a hearing bearing on the lawfulness of pre-trial detention may also infringe Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a74. However, in the present case, it must examine whether the applicant validly waived his right to an effective preparation of the said heaing. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the waiver of a right guaranteed by the Convention - insofar as it is permissible - must be established in an unequivocal manner, a waiver of procedural rights requiring in addition minimum guarantees commensurate to its importance (see Sch\u00f6ps, cited above, \u00a7 48).

The Court observes that what was at stake in the present case was the prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention for a substantial period of time, i.e. half a year, involving the assessment of new elements which had not yet been the subject of the previous decision, namely the complexity of the investigations. Moreover, the court had to decide whether the danger of absconding and of a repetition of the offences persisted, and two months had elapsed since the last hearing at which the applicant had been able to address this issue. The lack of a hearing appears all the more important as the applicant was not given an opportunity to comment on the requests of the investigating judge and the public prosecutor to extend the maximum duration of his detention. In sum, the proceedings before the Court of Appeal were not truly adversarial and did not ensure equality of arms between the parties. The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that any procedural shortcomings were remedied on appeal, as the Supreme Court also did not hold a hearing when dealing with the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of 11 February 1998.",
