The applicants in applications nos.\u00a021041/12, 21066/12, 21068/12, 21072/12 and 42535/12 also complained under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3\u00a0(c) of the Convention that they had allegedly not been given access to a lawyer after their arrest and at the first-instance trial, and the applicant in application no.\u00a057141/12 complained under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3\u00a0(b) of the Convention about a lack of time and facilities to prepare his defence. The Court considers that as it has already concluded that the administrative proceedings, taken as a whole, were conducted in violation of the right to a fair hearing, it is not necessary to address the remainder of the applicants\u2019 complaints under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (b)-(d) of the Convention (see Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7 168).",
