The Presidium of the Supreme Court amended the applicant's sentence and adopted a different legal classification of his actions, thereby re-determining the criminal charge against him (see Stanislav Zhukov and Aldoshkina, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a024 and \u00a7\u00a024 respectively). The prosecution was present at the supervisory review hearing and made oral submissions in support of the reclassification. The Presidium court was under an obligation to exercise a full review of the case and could dismiss the application for supervisory review, quash the conviction and/or the previous judgments, discontinue the criminal proceedings, or amend any of the earlier decisions (see paragraph 40 above). In such circumstances the applicant should have been afforded an effective opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the authorities' application for supervisory review and their oral submissions to the Presidium court and to plead his case in adversarial proceedings (see Vanyan, Aldoshkina and Stanislav Zhukov, all cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a024, 24 and 67 respectively). However, nothing suggests that he was afforded such an opportunity. Firstly, the Government failed to substantiate their submission that the applicant had been apprised of the hearing on 8\u00a0August 2001 and of its adjournment until 3 October 2001. Furthermore, the authorities disregarded the applicant's requests for leave to appear before the Presidium court and thus he was absent from the hearing. Lastly, although the applicant submitted his written comments on the prosecution application, it does not transpire from the text of the judgment of 3 October 2001 that they were considered by the Presidium court.",

The acknowledgment of that \u201cinsignificant\u201d breach of the applicant's rights had constituted, in their view, an adequate redress and thus, he was no longer a victim of the alleged violation. On the merits, they argued, with reference to a certificate issued by colony LIU-2, that throughout his detention before and after conviction the applicant had sent 296 letters and complaints to various public authorities and had received 204 replies, including his correspondence with the Court. In the Government's view, that fact refuted his allegation that LIU-2 had interfered with his correspondence with the Court. Relying on the results of the domestic inquiries, they submitted that Z. had automatically unsealed the Court's letter. Having seen that the letter and the enclosed documents were in the English language, she had immediately passed the envelope and all enclosed documents on to Kh., head of the applicant's brigade. She had never withheld any documents. The Government stressed that Z. had had no command of English and could not have grasped the contents of the documents.

In this connection the Court accepts the Government's argument that the breach of the applicant's right to respect for his correspondence had been, at least in substance, acknowledged by the domestic authorities and in the proceedings before it (see paragraphs 26, 30 and 51 above). As to the issue of redress, the Court does not exclude that in a situation like the one in the present case adequate redress would not necessarily imply monetary compensation but might take other forms, the adequacy of such redress being assessed with regard to the particular circumstances of each case. However, in the present case the Court finds nothing to suggest that there was any decision or measure on the part of the domestic authorities which could be regarded as adequate redress for the alleged breach of the applicant's rights under Article 8 of the Convention. In this connection the Court takes note of the applicant's submission, uncontested by the Government, that a proper inquiry had only been initiated after the Court had given notice of the applicant's complaints, that no measures had been taken in respect of the officials identified during the inquiry as responsible for the opening of the Court's letter and that no one had apologised to the applicant.",
