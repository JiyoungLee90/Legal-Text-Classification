In this connection, it recalls that its findings in the above-cited case applied solely to criminal proceedings since, according to the established practice of the Court of Cassation, the latter\u2019s decisions in criminal cases are not served on the defendants. In civil law cases, however, the Court of Cassation\u2019s decisions are served on the parties upon payment of the postage fee. Therefore in the present case, the authorities were required to serve the final decision on the applicants\u2019 lawyer. The Court further refers to the Government\u2019s submission that the applicants\u2019 representative had failed to inform the authorities of his new address. However, it is clear from the documents in the case file that the applicants\u2019 representative had indicated his new address in his rectification petition. The applicants lodged their application with the Court on 2 February 2006, six months and twenty-seven days after the delivery of the final judgment. Having regard to the Government\u2019s failure to serve the final decision at the correct address of the applicants\u2019 representative, in the special circumstances of the present case the Court concludes that the applicants must be considered to have complied with the six months rule laid down in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.
