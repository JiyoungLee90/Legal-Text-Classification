However, the length of the proceedings had been due, inter alia, to the great complexity of the case that had required the hearing of witnesses as regards the validity of the deceased\u2019s testamentary dispositions and their interpretation, the taking of several expert opinions at first and second instance regarding the value of her estate as well as the consultation of files in separate proceedings conducted before the Berlin-Charlottenburg District Court. The\u00a0Government maintained that considerable delays had further been caused by the conduct of the applicant, in particular during the first instance proceedings. The applicant\u2019s repeated changes of counsel had been accompanied by requests for the extension of deadlines and necessitated the rescheduling of hearings. His numerous requests to be granted access to court and expert files and his contradictory requests regarding the commissioning of further expert opinions had also significantly contributed to render the proceedings more complex. As regards the importance of what was at stake in the proceedings, the Government, while accepting that the dispute was of great personal significance to the applicant, adduced that his case did not fall within the category of cases that required particularly swift action because of their pre-eminent importance in terms of Convention law.",
