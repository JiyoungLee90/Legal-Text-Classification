A delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances. But the delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (loc. cit., \u00a7 27). The Court notes that the Lithuanian legislation on restitution of property rights leaves it to the discretion of the administrative authorities to determine whether a plot of land can be returned to its former owner in kind, and if not \u2013 to decide on appropriate compensation in land or money (loc. cit., \u00a7 22; also see the judgment of the Supreme Court of 22 May 2000 in the present case, \u00a7\u00a7 17-19 above).",

The impugned judgment only ordered the administrative authorities to use legitimately their discretion in returning the land in kind where appropriate, or offering compensation in land or money for the remainder of the original land.",

As a result of those decisions, the restitution of the applicants' property rights or the compensation have been finalised in respect of 24.82 hectares of their father's former property. In regard to the remaining 9.05 hectares of the original land, offers have been made to the applicants to be compensated in land (see \u00a7\u00a7 20-26 above). While in connection with some of the administration's decisions the relevant formalities for the transfer of property rights to the applicants have not yet been finalised, this circumstance is imputable only to the applicants, not the authorities (see \u00a7\u00a7 20, 23 and 24 above, also see the Government's and the applicants' comments, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30).",

The question is only whether there were unjustified delays in the authorities' actions. In this regard the Court observes first that the applicants in the present case had themselves prevented the administration from finalising some of the restitution decisions, by way of neglecting the authorities' efforts to finalise the formalities pertaining to transfer of the property rights to the applicants.",

Russia case, no. 59498/00, 7.5.2002, ECHR 2002-III, where the refusal of execution could thus not be justified by any substantial delay). By contrast, in the present case, the impugned judgment empowered the executive to carry out a complex set of actions under the domestic legislation on restitution of property rights, namely to choose an appropriate form of restitution (return in kind or compensation in land), find an adequate location for the land to be offered in compensation to each of the four applicants, carry out all the necessary actions to delimit the land, as well as complete the formalities needed to enter the applicants' name in the land register. It follows that the execution of the judgment of 22 May 2000 necessitated not only the analysis of various historical, legal and technical documents and the possible consultation of experts, but also required the participation by the applicants themselves.",

Thereafter slightly more than two years passed until the last offer of compensation was made on 19 July 2004 (see \u00a7\u00a7 20-26 above). While the Court finds such a lapse of time regrettable, it cannot be compared with the circumstances in the Jasi\u016bnien\u0117 case cited above, where even at the time of the adoption of the Court's judgment in 2004 no appropriate executive decision had been taken regarding the court decision on restitution adopted as far back as 1996 (loc. cit., \u00a7\u00a7 27-32). In view of the above considerations, and in particular on account of the lack of activity established on the part of the applicants themselves, the Court considers that the delays in the execution of the judgment of 22 May 2000 were not such as to infringe upon the essence of the applicants' right to a court guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention (see, by contrast, Jasi\u016bnien\u0117 cited above, ibid.; also see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34-38; Hornsby v.

Hence the judgment indeed provided the applicants with an enforceable claim to constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
