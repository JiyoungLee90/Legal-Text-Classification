The Administrative Offences Council also held that its decision to apply the protective measure was influenced by the fact that the applicant had been unable to provide sufficient evidence to justify his earlier money transfers to accounts in Tunisia and Jordan belonging to S.K. and S.K.\u2019s wife, totalling EUR 882,900 in the period between 2005 and 2008, and the fact that he had stated that he had opened a non-resident\u2019s account in his name in order to do a favour to S.K., namely in order to transfer money from the sale of S.K.\u2019s wife\u2019s house, deposited on his account, to S.K.\u2019s wife\u2019s accounts.

In that regard, it noted that the penalty provided for in Article 9 of Regulation No. 1889/2005 did not seek to penalise possible fraudulent or unlawful activities, but solely a breach of the obligation to declare laid down in Article 3 of the Regulation (\u00a7 31). The Court of Justice also noted that Article 4 (2) of the Regulation provided for the possibility to detain, by administrative decision, cash which had not been declared, in order, among other things, to allow the competent authorities to carry out the necessary controls and checks relating to the provenance of that cash and its intended use and destination (\u00a7 33). In his opinion, Advocate General Wathelet explained that these controls and checks could lead to the finding that other offences had been committed, to which other fines and confiscation measures could then be applied (see in particular \u00a7\u00a7 59-62 and 84 of the opinion).",
