At the same time, in the decision to institute criminal proceedings of 18 October 2000 and subsequent decisions to suspend and resume the investigation which have been made available to the Court, it is stated that Yusup Satabayev and the other three men were arrested on 1 August 2000. However, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that it should not attach weight to the interim findings of the domestic investigation in this respect, for the following reasons. First of all, it is inconsistent with the Government's latest submissions that Yusup Satabayev was arrested on 4\u00a0August 2000. Secondly, despite the Court's request the Government submitted neither documents related to Yusup Satabayev's detention, nor any documents from the investigation file which would allow the Court to determine on which basis those interim findings were founded. Moreover, the contention that Yusup Satabayev was released between 1 and 4 August 2000 contradicts the Government's account of the information received from remand prison IZ-20/2, according to which Yusup Satabayev had been held in the remand prison until 1 August 2000, when he was transferred to the detention facility of the Urus-Martan VOVD.",

After the Court's decision as to the admissibility of the application they stated that after the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against Yusup Satabayev on 27\u00a0July 2000, detention as the measure of restraint applied to him had been lifted. He had been released as soon as the relevant decision had reached remand prison IZ-20/2, that is, on 1\u00a0August 2000. However, on 4\u00a0August 2000 he had again been detained under the Decree on Measures for the Prevention of Vagrancy and Mendicancy since he had had no identification documents. His detention in the detention ward of the Urus-Martan VOVD had lasted for ten days until 14 August 2000, when he was released. The Government also pointed out that the applicant had never lodged any complaints concerning Yusup Satabayev's detention before the domestic courts. They concluded that there had been no violation of Article 5 of the Convention in respect of Yusup Satabayev's detention.",

However, as regards the period before 1\u00a0August 2000, even assuming that Yusup Satabayev remained in detention due to the fact that the decision on his release had not reached the detention facility with sufficient expedition, the Court reiterates that it must scrutinise complaints of delays in the release of detainees with particular vigilance (see Nikolov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, \u00a7\u00a080, 30 January 2003). Whereas some delay in implementing a decision to release a detainee is understandable and often inevitable in view of practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the observance of particular formalities, the national authorities must attempt to keep it to a minimum (see, among other authorities, Mancini v.

However, in the decision to institute criminal proceedings of 18 October 2000 and subsequent decisions to suspend and resume the investigation which have been made available to the Court, it is stated that Yusup Satabayev and three other men were arrested on 1 August 2000. At the same time, according to the Government's account of the information received from remand prison\u00a0IZ-20/2, Yusup Satabayev was held in the remand prison until 1\u00a0August\u00a02000, when he was transferred to the detention facility of the Urus-Martan VOVD.",

Should the Court rely on the Government's submission that Yusup Satabayev was detained on 4 August 2000 on the basis of Presidential Decree no. 1815 of 2\u00a0November 1993 on Measures for the Prevention of Vagrancy and Mendicancy, this would lead to the conclusion that from 1 to 4 August 2000 he was detained without any legal basis. However, even relying on the Government's initial submissions that Yusup Satabayev's detention pursuant to the Decree began on 1\u00a0August\u00a02000, the Court notes, firstly, that it harbours doubts as to whether the Decree in question could in principle constitute a legal basis for his detention, since it does not provide grounds for detention, but establishes the time-limits for placement in rehabilitation institutions. Furthermore, the Court finds it difficult to accept that the Decree could have been applicable in the present circumstances, and that the detention could therefore have fallen within the scope of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e), since it is far from clear how a person can be arrested for vagrancy having already been placed in custody and remained continuously in detention. Yet, even assuming that the Decree could have been applied in the present case and constituted a legal basis for Yusup Satabayev's detention, the Government have failed to submit to the Court a prosecutor's order for his detention which, according to section 3 of the Decree, was a prerequisite for placement in a rehabilitation centre. Thus, Yusup Satabayev's detention from 1 to 14\u00a0August 2000 was not in conformity with either the domestic law or with Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e) of the Convention (Bitiyeva and X v. , nos. 57953/00 and 37392/03, \u00a7\u00a0115, 21 June 2007).",

Therefore, his detention was not acknowledged, was not logged in any custody records and there exists no official trace of his subsequent whereabouts or fate. In accordance with the Court's practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their possession without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the wellfoundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention. In a case where the application raises issues as to the effectiveness of the investigation, the documents of the criminal investigation are fundamental to the establishment of the facts and their absence may prejudice the Court's proper examination of the complaint both at the admissibility and at the merits stage (see Tanr\u0131kulu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7 71, ECHR\u00a01999-IV).",
