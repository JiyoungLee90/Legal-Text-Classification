As regards the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant introduced the complaint out of time, the Court considers that it would indeed have been preferable if the applicant had acted with greater expedition in bringing his case before the Court for examination (see Artyomov v. Russia, no. 14146/02, \u00a7\u00a0115, 27 May 2010); nevertheless, since his detention constitutes an \u201congoing situation\u201d and the Court is not prevented from establishing the facts on account of the amount of time that has already lapsed, his complaint cannot be rejected as belated or manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention (see Dolgov and\u00a0Silayev v.

In the Court\u2019s view, such conditions diminish human dignity and arouse feelings of anguish and inferiority in the applicant capable of humiliating and debasing him (compare Kasperovi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a05487208, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 20 November 2012).
