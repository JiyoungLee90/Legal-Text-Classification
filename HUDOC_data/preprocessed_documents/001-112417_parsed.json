However, the Court has held in other contexts that this investigative procedure does not comply with the principles of an effective remedy, because the enquiring officer can take only a limited number of procedural steps within that procedure while a victim\u2019s procedural status is not properly formalised (see Davydov and Others v.\u00a0Ukraine, nos. 17674/02 and 39081/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0310-312, 1 July 2010). The full-scale investigation was commenced only on 30 December 1998 (see paragraph 37), that is with four months delay. That delay undermined the effectiveness of the subsequent proceedings.",

The authorities did not look into the matter of whether the two key witnesses might have been improperly inclined to support the police version under various pretexts, including threats that they would become suspects themselves as it had been unclear why the applicant had been so severely injured. Indeed, as admitted by the sales assistant, the police officer Kh. went to see him during the night of the incident and demanded explanations, after stating that the man about whom the sales assistant had complained had been severely beaten up (see paragraph 41).

At the same time, the absence of the precise information on the height of the fences, from which the applicant might have fallen, suggests that the on-site investigations of the theory of an accident were superficial (see paragraph 39).",

This rigorous concentration on a particular detail in the applicant\u2019s submissions appears surprising, given that the applicant had always referred to numerous blows he received to the whole of his body and the detail, dragged out by the investigator, had been specified by the applicant after the lapse of a considerable period of time from the incident (see paragraph 38).

Mostly, the issue has been examined under Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c) of the Convention, the provision which expressly requires free legal representation in criminal proceedings against the person concerned. The Court has also held that Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention may in certain circumstances compel the State to provide for the assistance of a lawyer when such assistance proves indispensable for effective access to court (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 26, Series\u00a0A no. 32, and Bertuzzi v. France, no. 36378/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a023-32, ECHR 2003III) or ensuring the principle of equality of arms (see Steel and Morris v. the , no. 68416/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063-72, ECHR 2005II). Also a lack of legal assistance may prevent an individual from effectively exercising his right under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention (see Megyeri v.\u00a0, 12\u00a0May 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 23-27, Series A no. 237A, and A.A.\u00a0v.Greece, no.\u00a012186/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078-79, 22 July 2010). The considerations concerning access to legal aid may be relevant when assessing the adequacy of procedural protection under Article 8 of the Convention (see StewartBrady v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 27436/95 and 28406/95, 2\u00a0July 1997). Lastly, the absence of free legal representation has been regarded as indication to the ineffectiveness of domestic remedies for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15\u00a0November 1996, \u00a7154, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V, and Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. , no. 30471/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0114115, ECHR 2009...

A copy of that decision was received by the applicant only on 12\u00a0May 2011, which means that before that date he did not know the precise reasons for it and thus was not in a position to appeal effectively against it (see Akulinin and Babich v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a05742/02, \u00a7\u00a029, 2 October 2008). Moreover, the absence of legal advice resulted in the remedy suggested by the Government being unavailable to the applicant.

As noted in previous cases, it appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of such a distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 167; Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 96, ECHR 1999-V). In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element to torture, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which in Article 1 defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering for such purposes as obtaining information or a confession, punishing, intimidating, coercing, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.",

The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s access to this kind of information was sufficiently closely linked to his private life in the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention (compare Gaskin v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-37, Series A no. 160; McGinley and Egan v. the United Kingdom, 9\u00a0June 1998, \u00a797, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III; Odi\u00e8vre v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 42326/98, \u00a7\u00a029, ECHR 2003III; and K.H. and Others v. , no. 32881/04, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2009 (extracts)) which gives a fair basis to characterise the relevant right, recognised by the domestic courts, as a civil one.
