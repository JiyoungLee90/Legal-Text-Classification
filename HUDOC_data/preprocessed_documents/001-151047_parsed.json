It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. In determining whether a particular form of ill-treatment should be classified as torture, consideration must be given to the distinction, embodied in Article 3, between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment. As noted in previous cases, it appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of such a distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element to torture, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture, which in Article 1 defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 90).",

The authorities could have been expected to lend a certain weight to the question of the applicant\u2019s vulnerability. However, not only was there no concern to provide extra protection to the minor in question, but the impunity which ensued was enough to shed doubt on the ability of the judicial machinery set in motion in this case to produce a sufficiently deterrent effect to protect anybody at all, minor or otherwise, from breaches of the absolute prohibition enshrined in Article\u00a03 (see Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070).",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, this shortcoming cannot be considered as compatible with the Convention standard of protection from illtreatment. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, suspension of such sentences undeniably falls into the category of the \u201cmeasures\u201d which are unacceptable as its effect is to render convictions ineffective (see Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78, and Zeynep \u00d6zcan v. Turkey, no. 45906/99, \u00a7\u00a7 40-46, 20 February 2007). In this respect, the Court notes that the suspension of the pronouncement of the judgment, regulated by Article 231 of the Code on Criminal Procedure (Law no.\u00a05271), has a stronger effect than the deferral of the execution of the sentence and results in the impunity of the perpetrators. That is because the former\u2019s application cancels the judgment with all its legal consequences, including the sentence, provided that the offender abides by the suspension order, whereas in the latter, neither the sentence nor the judgment ceases to exist (see para. 12 above). The Court considers therefore that the impugned court decision suggests that the judges exercised their discretion to minimise the consequences of an extremely serious unlawful act rather than show that such acts could in no way be tolerated (see Eski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036, and Taylan v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 32051/09, \u00a7 46, 3 July 2012).",
