The applicant also exhausted domestic remedies as, in particular, a complaint to the Federal Constitutional Court would not have been a remedy capable of affording him adequate redress for the length of the civil proceedings brought by him (see S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7\u00a7 103-108, ECHR 2006..., and Herbst v. Germany, no. 20027/02, \u00a7\u00a7 63-66 and 68, 11 January 2007). His complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of \nArticle 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The Court further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.",

It notes, in particular, that the proceedings, which were of some complexity and necessitated the consultation of medical experts, were pending before the  for some seven years and before the Social Court of Appeal for some six years and seven months. It considers that the applicant delayed the proceedings in that he did not submit reasons for his appeal until July 1999 after having consulted the case-file in February 1998. Moreover, his requests for consultation of three additional medical experts under section\u00a0109 of the Social Courts Act (see paragraphs 18, 20 and 35 above) contributed to the length of the proceedings. However, the fact that the applicant availed himself of the possibility to request the consultation of further experts under the said provision does not warrant the conclusion that the time elapsed for obtaining these reports will be attributed only to him. The courts remained under a duty to obtain the necessary expert advice in an efficient and speedy manner, a duty which they did not comply with in the present case. The Court further reiterates in that connection that a legal provision which provides for the possibility to request a further expert opinion even though the expert advice considered necessary by the court to take its decision has already been obtained will contribute, as in the present case, to the length of the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Gl\u00fcsen, cited above, \u00a7 83). The said provision also does not exempt the domestic courts from the obligation to ensure compliance with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement (see, inter alia, Vaas v. , no. 20271/05, \u00a7 68, \n26 March 2009).",
