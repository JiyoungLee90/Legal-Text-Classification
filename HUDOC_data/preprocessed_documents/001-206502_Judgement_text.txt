This case concerns the authorities’ failure to enforce final judgments in the applicant’s favour in the part concerning the indexation of periodic compensation payments.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Kimry.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
In 1986 the applicant took part in emergency operations at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site and suffered from extensive exposure to radioactive emissions. He became entitled to various social benefits in this connection.
On 2 August 2006 the Kimry Town Court of the Tver Region (“the Town Court”) ordered the Military Commission of the Tver Region (“the debtor authority”) to pay the applicant in arrears a lump sum in respect of certain compensation payments, and to make monthly and yearly payments in future. The court set the amounts of the periodic payments at 2,089 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of monthly food allowance, RUB 10,124 in respect of compensation for health damage and RUB 2,957 in respect of yearly compensation for health damage, and ordered the debtor authority to index-link the monthly and yearly payments. The court did not specify the method of indexation.
The judgment was not appealed against and became enforceable ten days later. Shortly thereafter the lump sum and monthly payments were paid to the applicant. The debtor authority refused to index-link subsequent payments, arguing that it was not competent to increase compensation payments if they had been awarded by a court.
On 13 July 2007 the Town Court allowed the applicant’s separate claim for indexation of the periodic payments due to him under the judgment of 2 August 2006 for the year 2007. Referring to the inflation rate in Russia for the reference period, the court ordered the debtor authority to pay the applicant RUB 10,133.87 in arrears and to index-link the monthly and yearly payments on a yearly basis, in accordance with domestic law.
The debtor authority refused to index-link the monthly payments from August 2007 on the basis that the court had failed to specify the amounts due to the applicant. They argued, referring to instructions of the financial unit of their military circuit, that there was no legal mechanism allowing a military commission to index-link amounts awarded by a court and exceed those specified in Law no. 1244-1 of 15 May 1991 (“the Chernobyl Law”) in respect of monthly compensation for health damage and food allowance.
On 8 February 2008 the Town Court clarified its judgment of 13 July 2007 at the applicant’s request, setting the specific amounts of the payments (as applicable on 1 August 2007) in respect of relevant allowances.
According to the Government, shortly after the above clarification the debtor authority paid the arrears and started making monthly payments in the amounts determined by the Town Court.
On 30 June 2009 the Town Court clarified its judgment of 2 August 2006 at the applicant’s request, specifying that the amounts of compensation were to be index-linked in future in line with indexation coefficients established by governmental decrees. Accordingly, the court explained that subsequent payments in respect of food allowance and compensation for health damage were to be made in higher amounts than those determined in August 2006, and were to be reviewed and increased annually in line with the relevant coefficients. The clarification was not appealed against and became enforceable on 13 July 2009.
On 18 November 2009 the Town Court allowed a claim by the applicant for indexation of the monthly payments for the period between 1 January 2008 and 1 November 2009, increased the periodic payments in line with inflation and ordered the debtor to pay him RUB 81,497 in arrears. It appears that shortly thereafter the debtor authority paid the arrears.
It appears that from November 2009 the debtor authority made periodic payments to the applicant in the amount determined by the court but did not index-link them.
On 27 May 2010 the Town Court allowed a complaint by the applicant, finding that the debtor authority had acted unlawfully, as since November 2009 it had submitted “claims and registers” («заявки и реестры») in respect of the payments due to the applicant in amounts lower than those established by the final judicial decisions in his favour. The court ordered the debtor authority “to put an end to the identified shortcomings” and to submit “claims and registers” in respect of the compensation due to the applicant in good time and in compliance with the judicial decisions of 2 August 2006 and 30 June 2009. The judgment was not appealed against.
In late 2010 the applicant brought a new set of proceedings seeking indexation of the monthly payments for the period starting from November 2009. In a final decision of 23 December 2010 the Town Court discontinued the examination of his claim, finding that he had sought, in essence, to have the amounts awarded to him on 2 August 2006 completely recalculated. In the court’s view, that had to be done in a separate civil action.
The applicant again asked the Town Court to clarify the judicial decisions of 2 August 2006, 30 June 2009 and 27 May 2010 in his favour.
On 9 March 2011 the Town Court allowed his request in part and clarified that, in accordance with the judgment of 27 May 2010, the amounts due to the applicant (a) were to be index-linked using coefficients established by the government; (b) were to be increased on a yearly basis; and (c) had to be higher than those established in August 2006. The court refused to order payment of any specific sums, so as not to alter the substance of the initial judgment. On the same date the Town Court, in a separate ruling, drew the debtor’s attention to its obligation to comply with the final judicial decisions of 2 August 2006, 30 June 2009 and 27 May 2010, and ordered it to put an end to the violation of the applicant’s rights.
On 3 May 2011 the Tver Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) allowed an appeal by the debtor authority against the above ruling, quashed the clarification of 9 March 2011 and dismissed the applicant’s request in full, finding that the operative part of the judgment of 27 May 2010 was sufficiently clear and did not require further clarification.
In December 2011 the debtor authority requested clarification of the judgment of 13 July 2007, arguing that pursuant to the internal instructions of the Ministry of Defence it could not index-link the amounts awarded by a court if they were higher than those specified in the relevant governmental decrees. The applicant argued in reply that the judgment was sufficiently clear and that, contrary to the debtor authority’s assertion, did not refer to any specific “amounts” contained in some governmental decrees, but to the inflation coefficients determined by the government on a yearly basis.
On 22 December 2011 the Town Court dismissed the request, agreeing with the applicant’s submissions. It held that his right to receive yearly compensation for health damage was provided for by domestic law, which meant that he was not required to reapply for it every year.
In February 2013, when the latest exchange of observations by the parties took place, the judgments of 2 August 2006 and 27 May 2010 remained unenforced in the part concerning the indexation of the monthly and yearly social benefits.
Article 208 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for indexation of judicial awards: the court which made the award may adjust it at a party’s request in line with the increase in the official retail price index until the date of actual payment.
