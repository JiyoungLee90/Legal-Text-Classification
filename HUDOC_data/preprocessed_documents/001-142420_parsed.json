As regards the authorities, they failed firstly to challenge the initial judgment with a view to restricting the extent of the entitlement of members of the applicant\u2019s family to a flat together with the applicant, inter alia under Article 2 of the Russian Family Code; secondly to terminate execution of the judgment once the applicant had accepted the first flat; and thirdly to prevent the privatisation of the first flat in 2006.
