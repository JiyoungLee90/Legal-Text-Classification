He stated in essence the following in support of his application. Following the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, he had served in the new Iraqi army, which he had joined in October 2003 and which had involved work with the American troops. As a consequence of his military service, he claimed that he had been subjected to threats and ill-treatment. At the end of 2004, terrorists had thrown a grenade at him and his colleagues and he had injured his foot. In March 2006, when his unit had guarded a recruitment session at a military base, two suicide bombers had detonated bombs that killed 25 Iraqi soldiers and 5 Americans. One of the bombs had detonated close to the applicant and he had been severely injured. He had been hospitalised for approximately two and a half months. He had ended his military service in March 2006, after this incident. Upon release from hospital he had moved to Mosul to live with his family for one year. In June 2007, while he had been with his sister in the front yard, a car had approached them and opened fire on them. His sister had been hit by four shots and had become paralysed. The applicant himself had been hit once in the shooting and had again been taken to hospital for care. While still in hospital, he had been told by his brother that a letter had been left for him at his house containing death threats against him. When he had left the hospital, he had gone into hiding for five months at a friend\u2019s house in Mosul before leaving Iraq. The applicant also referred to the injuries he had sustained and submitted photographs and extracts from medical journals.",

The Board first accepted that the documentation supplied by the applicant showed that he had served in the Iraqi army and that he had been shot at and had, as a consequence, sustained serious injuries. It went on to note that the incidents in late 2004 and March 2006 had been connected to the applicant\u2019s military service and had not been directed at him personally. He had not received any personal threats or been subjected to ill-treatment while serving in the army or during a period of 15 months after he had left the army. Having regard to this 15-month period without incidents and noting that the applicant did not know who had shot at him and his sister or the reason for the June 2007 attack, the Board considered that the shooting was connected to the difficult security situation at the time rather than the applicant\u2019s previous military service. Further, the applicant had remained in Mosul for five months after the threatening letter had been received without anything happening to him. Moreover, the applicant had been in contact with his family since he had left Iraq and had been informed that they had not been subjected to threats or ill-treatment after his departure. Nor was there any indication that the applicant was being searched for in Iraq. In conclusion, he had failed to make plausible that he would be at risk of persecution or ill-treatment if he were to return to Iraq. Furthermore, his state of health was not such that it gave reason to grant him a residence permit, as a return to Iraq was not deemed to cause any danger to his life or health.",

Armed groups are also thought to be responsible for targeted attacks on government and security officials, politicians, tribal and religious leaders, and members of religious and ethnic minorities, among others. Occasionally, local cells manage to coordinate attacks across the country. The number of civilian casualties, though less than at the peak of violence in 2006 and 2007, remains nonetheless significant with around 4,000 civilians killed in both 2010 and 2011, respectively. At least 464 civilians were killed in January 2012, in what appeared to be a surge in mass casualty attacks. Shi\u2019ite civilians have been the most affected. After a short lull in violence, several major attacks across central Iraq were again reported in late February, March and April 2012.",

The number of civilian deaths from suicide attacks and car bombs decreased in 2011 compared to previous years, to an average of 6.6 per day. While these attacks still account for the highest number of civilian deaths each month, the number of civilians killed from gunfire/executions rose to an average of 4.6 per day in 2011. This suggests that an increasing number of Iraqis, especially government and security officials, are being individually targeted. Violence is mostly concentrated in the predominantly Sunni or mixed central governorates of Al-Anbar, Baghdad, Diyala, Ninewa, Kirkuk, and Salah Al-Din, but occasionally moves into the mainly Shi\u2019ite governorates further south. Armed Sunni groups such as Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq and Ansar Al-Islam are thought to be responsible for most of the violence. Shi\u2019ite armed groups have to a large extent been integrated into the ISF [Iraqi security forces] and the political process, though they reportedly maintain their independent military capabilities and at times threaten to use it to further their political agendas. Armed groups target civilians on the basis of their (imputed) political views, religion, ethnicity, social status or a combination of reasons. As a result of the weak law enforcement and justice system, persons at risk of persecution are reportedly unable to find protection or judicial redress. Observers mention undue political influence, the lack of trained legal professionals and corruption as further obstacles to the administration of justice, including in the Kurdistan Region. Legal professionals continue to work in a very difficult security environment, and remain a target of armed groups. Crime is widespread and some armed groups reportedly engage in extortion, kidnappings and armed robberies to fund their other, politically \u2013 or religiously, or ideologically \u2013 motivated activities, conflating acts of persecution and criminality. Consequently, the line between persecution and criminality appears to be increasingly blurred.\u201d",

In the autumn of 2011 the applicant had been told by one of his brothers that he had been sought after in his former home in Iraq on several occasions by unknown persons. The applicant \u2013 as well as his family \u2013 were accordingly of the opinion that the threat against him was still present.",

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a046827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v.

In this respect, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker\u2019s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and Akaziebie v.

However, the applicant ended his job in the Iraqi army in March 2006, more than seven years ago, and it would seem unlikely therefore that he would be at risk of personal attacks today. In this connection, the Court considers that the attacks that occurred at the end of 2004 and in March 2006, although they inflicted serious injuries on the applicant, must be seen as events that affected him solely because he was on duty at the places in question and not as attacks directed at him personally. Following the applicant\u2019s retirement from the army, 15 months passed without anything happening to him or his family. Then, in June 2007, the drive-by shooting of him and his sister, leaving her paralysed, happened while they were in the front yard of the family\u2019s house. This appears to have been an attack specifically targeting him or his family. Still, the perpetrators and their motive are unknown and, according to the applicant, there does not seem to have been any police investigation or other proceedings as a result of the incident. While not questioning that the attack may have been made in retaliation for the applicant\u2019s former military service, the Court again notes that it occurred more than six years ago, at a time when violence in Iraq reached its highest levels. There is no indication that members of the applicant\u2019s family, who appear to have stayed in Iraq, have been subjected to attacks or other forms of ill-treatment since and the applicant\u2019s claim that unknown persons have been searching for him on several occasions remains unsubstantiated.

However, the threshold under Article 3 for concluding that a medical condition precludes the deportation of an individual is very high (see \u00a7 43 above). Medical evidence showing the applicant\u2019s present health status has not been presented to the Court but, according to the medical certificate of 6\u00a0\u00a0August 2010 and the physician\u2019s letter of 7 December 2010, both of which have been submitted to the Court, the applicant\u2019s injuries did not require urgent treatment and no further surgery except amputation of the leg could be done. As the applicant had refused amputation, all that remained was treatment for his pain and discomfort. Noting that the applicant had received medical care for his injuries in Iraq, the Court cannot find that the remaining treatment would be unavailable in Iraq, although the care given may well not meet the standards of the care available in Sweden. Furthermore, there is no evidence that, because of his injuries, he will be unable to travel to Iraq. In these circumstances, the threshold set under Article 3 for preventing the applicant\u2019s deportation on account of his physical health problems has not been met. The same conclusion must be drawn in relation to the applicant\u2019s alleged mental suffering which, moreover, has not been confirmed by any medical evidence.",

Individuals associated with or perceived to be supporting the Iraqi authorities or the US forces, as well as their families, are at risk of being targeted by non-State actors. The UNHCR considers that such individuals are, depending on the circumstances, likely to be in need of international refugee protection on account of their (imputed) political opinion. The applicant\u2019s general credibility was not questioned by the domestic authorities. Indeed, they accepted that documentation submitted in his case showed that he had served in the Iraqi army and that he had sustained serious injuries in grenade and bomb attacks connected with his military service (\u00a7 8). The applicant\u2019s profile thus places him, to my mind, within a specific risk category of Iraqi asylum seekers.",

The domestic authorities and the Respondent State make much of a distinction drawn between attacks connected with the applicant\u2019s military service and attacks based upon the applicant personally. For example, the Migration Board found that the military attacks in 2004 and 2006 were based upon his military service and not directed at the applicant \u2018personally\u2019. When suicide bombers attacked a military base precisely because it was a military base and the applicant was a member of the military injured in that attack, it is difficult to see how the attack was not directed at him \u2018personally\u2019 precisely because he was a member of the army. The applicant left the army and was the subject of a further serious attack and a death threat while living in Mosul. Because the applicant \u2018did not know\u2019 the identity of his attackers or \u2018the reason for the attack\u2019 the Migration Board considered that this shooting was not connected to him \u2018personally\u2019 but was rather connected to the \u2018difficult security situation\u2019. Why, precisely, are victims of targeted violence supposed to \u2018know\u2019 he identity of those who terrorize them in arbitrary and unpredictable attacks and how or why would such \u2018knowledge\u2019 strengthen an asylum claim? To be required to meet such an onerous test of knowledge of the identity of an attacker is to impose upon a person seeking asylum an unreasonable and disproportionate burden.",

The majority, whilst noting the existence of the indiscriminate and deadly violence, nevertheless, considers that \u2018the overall situation has been slowly improving since the peak in violence in 2007\u2019 (\u00a7 39) and it sees no reason to depart from the position it took over four years ago in F.H. v Sweden (no. 32621/06). I cannot share this perspective. It has been reported that 2013 has, thus far, been the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008. The Interior Ministry has put the death toll for the month of November alone at 1,121 and the number of people injured at 1,349. Thus, even if one were to accept that the general situation in Iraq is not to be regarded as being sufficiently serious as to cause by itself a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the event of an individual\u2019s forcible return thereto, the significant escalation in violence this year is, nevertheless, of sufficient seriousness as to weigh heavily in the balance when assessing, cumulatively, whether this applicant would face a real risk of exposure to treatment that would violate Article 3 of the Convention.",

Whilst I accept that according to the court\u2019s jurisprudence his state of health alone is not sufficient to support his claim against deportation, nevertheless I consider that, in the overall circumstances of this case, the applicant\u2019s serious disability is an important factor to which regard should be had when considering his deportation to a country where random violence and terrorist attacks are widespread.",
