The State\u2019s duty after the judicial proceedings had been concluded was merely to organise and properly conduct the enforcement proceedings in order to ensure that the private individuals were evicted and the applicant was able to occupy the flat.

However, the judgment of 8\u00a0April 1999 has remained unenforced due to the occupants\u2019 privatising the flat and the municipal authorities\u2019 lack of alternative housing (see paragraphs 13 and 16 above). The Court will not speculate to what extent the privatisation of the flat affected the length of the proceedings, since, in any case, it is clear that the judgment remains unenforced also as a result of the municipal authorities\u2019 lack of housing. Since lack of funds cannot excuse the authorities for not honouring a judgment against them, the length of the proceedings ensuing after 1 October 2004 is therefore attributable to the State, even if the applicant did not appeal on points of law against the court decisions which confirmed the last decision of the bailiffs by which they had discontinued the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 19 above), and it is undetermined how the conduct of the occupants of the flat in issue affected the length of the proceedings after 1\u00a0October 2004.",
