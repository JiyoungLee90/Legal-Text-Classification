The Court draws attention to the delay of nearly two years and two months in the proceedings before the Supreme Court (see paragraph\u00a021 above). It further observes that there was a delay of five months, between 13 November 1996 and 9 April 1997 (see paragraph\u00a016 above), when no hearing took place. The Court also notes that almost eight months elapsed between the date on which the trial court ordered that evidence be obtained from the experts and the date of the hearing on the merits of the case (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). The Court considers that the Government's observations do not explain these delays.",
