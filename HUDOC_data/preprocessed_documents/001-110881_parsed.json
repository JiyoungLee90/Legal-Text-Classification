They observed that in spite of their numerous endeavours they could not gain access to the radio station\u2019s studios and equipment, thus finding it impossible to secure the enforcement of the decision of 6 December 2002 and, consequently, being unable to exercise their profession of radio journalist. They mentioned that before and after the partnership agreement they had run the newsroom of Radio M Plus. In their submission, and contrary to what the Government had claimed, the radio station had continued to broadcast even after October 2002 when they were first refused access to the newsroom, the work of which had then been taken over by other journalists from the company Tele\u00a0M. The applicants asserted that this situation was the result of a conflict between the first applicant and the local representatives of a major political party, who were annoyed by the first applicant\u2019s independent journalism. In this connection, the applicants referred to the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that dismissal from employment following \u201ca course of action made up of an indeterminate number of acts of communication or expression that [the applicants] had committed over a period of several months, in the particular context of a labour dispute between them and their employer\u201d represented a breach of their right to freedom of expression (C\u00e2rstea and Grecu v. Romania (dec.), no. 56326/00, 21 September 2004). In their opinion, even though the present case did not concern a dismissal, in several aspects their situation was tantamount to a de facto dismissal, with similar effects: the inability for the applicants to exercise their profession as radio journalists. Moreover, they observed that the Court had previously examined, under Article 10 of the Convention, the impact of unlawful actions by third parties which were perceived as de facto obstacles to freedom of expression.",

In addition, following the failure to enforce the decision of 6 December 2002, the applicants had not had access to the technical facilities for the transmission of radio programmes, whereas the Convention also protected the means used for the imparting of information and ideas (they referred to Autronic AG v.

They pointed out that the Court had already noted the existence of such an obligation, under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, in cases concerning individuals\u2019 obligations to act. In their view, the transposition of such an obligation to the subject-matter of Article 10 of the Convention would be consistent with the principle of proportionality between the general interest and the interest of individuals and would not represent an impossible or disproportionate burden for the State, given that no new obligations would be imposed on it. Lastly, the applicants took the view that, in determining the positive obligation in the present case, it had to be taken into account that freedom of expression was exercised by professional journalists and that the de facto obstacles complained of affected the diversity and plurality of means of expression. In addition, it was also necessary to take into account the situation of the press in Romania in the relevant period (2002-2004), as described in a number of reports by various national and international organisations.",

They further argued that the bailiff, under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, could have sought police assistance. In actual fact the bailiff had merely paid a visit, on his own, to see the radio equipment on the second floor of the building. Moreover, the bailiff had not closed the enforcement procedure, leaving them in a state of uncertainty.

They argued that, unlike the situation in V\u00e9rit\u00e9s Sant\u00e9 Pratique SARL v. France (no. 74766/01, 1 December 2005), where the applicant company had been able to transmit information by other means, such as via the Internet, and had continued the publication of that information in a different magazine, in the present case the applicants had not been able to transmit information by equivalent means \u2013 and indeed had not done so. For the applicants, journalists specialising in radio and television, the occasional writing of articles in newspapers was not a real alternative because that was a different style of journalism. As the Court had already noted in other cases, the potential impact of the means of transmission of opinions was of particular importance for freedom of expression, because it was commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media had a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (the applicants referred to Purcell and Others v. Ireland, no. 15404/89, Commission decision of 16 April 1991, Decisions and reports 70, p.\u00a0262). Lastly, the applicants observed that they had been editors in a local radio station which broadcast information and programmes of local interest; they were thus addressing a local audience which had a good knowledge of the subjects covered. As a result, the possibility offered to the second applicant of publishing a few articles in a national daily newspaper, which by definition was aimed at a nationwide readership, was not an equivalent means and could not be construed as \u201cexercising her profession\u201d. Moreover, the first applicant had not exercised his profession (not even by writing a few articles) for several years after the events at issue. In any event, the possibility of exercising their profession \u2013 and thus their freedom of expression \u2013 by other means (writing in a gazette, taking part in a television programme) was purely speculative and theoretical because such activities did not depend only on the good will of the applicants, but rather on that of third parties. In addition, that type of argument could have stifled all applications in which the dismissal of journalists was at issue, because in all such cases the applicants could have found another job in the media. Moreover, to have the opportunity to write an article from time to time for a newspaper, or to be invited to take part in a radio or television programme, did not constitute the exercise of their profession and did not represent an equivalent means to that of an editor in a radio station.",

Genuine, effective exercise of this freedom does not depend merely on the State\u2019s duty not to interfere, but may require positive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals. Thus, in the case of Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a044306/98, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2003VI), the Court had to examine the United Kingdom\u2019s obligations in relation to the refusal by a private company which owned a shopping centre to allow the applicants to set up a stand there and distribute leaflets in which they sought to draw the attention of their fellow citizens to their opposition to the local authority\u2019s plans to develop a playing field and thus to deprive their children of green areas to play in. The Court decided that, where the bar on access to property had the effect of preventing any effective exercise of freedom of expression or it could be said that the essence of the right had been destroyed, it would not exclude that a positive obligation could arise for the State to protect the enjoyment of the Convention rights by regulating property rights.",

It notes that the NAC certificate refers to the granting and assignment of audiovisual licences held by the companies at issue, namely Radio M Plus and Tele M, and concludes that the radio station Radio M Plus had no broadcasting activity in the period 2002-2004. However, the Court notes that the orders addressed by the NAC following the various unlawful assignments were never followed up by a decision to withdraw audiovisual licence no. 246/1997, exploited by Radio M Plus, in accordance with the Audiovisual Act (Law no.\u00a0504/2002). Neither was any withdrawal decided under Article 57 of that Act, which allows the NAC to withdraw an audiovisual licence in cases where its holder stops broadcasting programmes for 45 days, for technical reasons, and for 96 hours, for any other reason (see paragraph 35 above). Having regard to the foregoing, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the failure to enforce the final decision of 6 December 2002 did not breach the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression on the ground that Radio M Plus had no broadcasting activity in the period 2002-2004.",

In conclusion, an essential element of freedom of expression, namely the form of its exercise, was at stake for the applicants. Moreover, it was not merely an aspiration to exercise such a right, as the applicants had the technical facilities to transmit radio programmes. The Court notes that, as can be seen from documents in the file, the applicants were able to publish a few articles in the national and local press in 2002 and 2003 (see paragraphs 33-34 above). However, it accepts that the possibility of writing articles in newspapers cannot compensate for the freedom of journalists to choose their form of expression. In accordance with the Court\u2019s case law, Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see Jersild v.\u00a0Denmark, 23 September 1994, \u00a7\u00a031, Series A no. 298; News Verlags GmbH & Co.KG v. Austria, no.\u00a031457/96, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, ECHR 2000I; and V\u00e9rit\u00e9s Sant\u00e9 Pratique SARL, cited above). It is not for this Court, nor for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists (see Jersild, cited above, \u00a7 31). It is also necessary to take into account the potential impact of the medium concerned, which is an important factor in relation to freedom of expression, it being commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (see Purcell and Others, cited above). Consequently, the Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s argument that the applicants had other alternatives by which to manifest their freedom of expression.",

Austria, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 276). That role becomes all the more indispensable where the independence of the press is subjected to external pressure by politicians and economic decision-makers. Consequently, particular weight should be given to the Romanian context as regards the freedom of the press at the relevant time. According to reports published by various national and international organisations, the situation of the press in Romania during the period 2002-2004 does not appear to have been satisfactory ... One of the main findings of those reports was that the local press was directly or indirectly under the control of political or economic figures in the region. The Court cannot disregard the first applicant\u2019s claim that he was subjected to political and economic pressure, leading to the sale of part of his stake in a television company (see paragraphs 10-12 above). In those circumstances, the measures that the State was required to take, in view of its role as guarantor of the pluralism and independence of the press, are of genuine importance.",

As a result, a bailiff accompanied them on two occasions to the head office of the radio station, but the applicants were received in an empty room on the ground floor of the building, and only the bailiff was able to visit the studios containing special equipment on the second floor of the building (see paragraphs 19-22 above). Even though the bailiff noted that the enforceable decision was clear and that there was no need to apply to a court in order to clarify the meaning and scope of its operative provisions, he did not seek the police support or assistance that was necessary in view of the uncooperative attitude of the other party, and took no other steps to obtain the enforcement of the decision in the applicants\u2019 favour. Given what was at stake in these proceedings for the applicants, who were seeking to exercise their profession as radio journalists, and in view of the fact that the decision in question had been obtained through an urgent application, the enforcement procedure called for urgent measures. The Court cannot accept the reasons given by the bailiff to the Government in 2008 in order to justify the non-enforcement of the decision of 6 December 2002 (see paragraph 29 above). It does not appear from the evidence in the file that those reasons were notified to the applicants, being raised for the first time in the proceedings before the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Svipsta v. Latvia, no.\u00a066820/01, \u00a7\u00a0110, 9 March 2006).",

In particular, the Government did not provide any examples of domestic case-law to prove that the applicants could have held the bailiff liable for failing to notify them of his refusal to continue the enforcement and of the official discontinuance of the procedure. Neither did the Government indicate how the disciplinary action could have been a remedy directly accessible to the applicants and capable of securing the enforcement of the final decision, bearing in mind that such action could be brought only by the governing board of the Bailiffs\u2019 Association or by the Minister of Justice and could only lead to the bailiff\u2019s suspension from his duties (see Topciov v.\u00a0Romania (dec.), no. 17369/02, 15 June 2006).",

Even supposing that, having regard to its special nature, the obligation to enforce required the obligor\u2019s personal intervention, and that such means of coercing the obligor could, in principle, have proved to constitute effective and accessible remedies, the Court observes that, in the present case, the applicants had already used other indirect means, namely the two criminal complaints, without securing the enforcement of the final decision. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant must have made normal use of domestic remedies which are likely to be effective and sufficient and, when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Ghibusi v. Romania, no. 7893/02, \u00a7 28, 23 June 2005).",
