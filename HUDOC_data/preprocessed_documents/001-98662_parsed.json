Where the applicant makes out a prima facie case and the Court is prevented from reaching factual conclusions owing to the lack of such documents, it is for the Government to argue conclusively why the documents in question cannot serve to corroborate the allegations made by the applicants, or to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred.

Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor's office and the other law-enforcement authorities after the circumstances of the abduction had been communicated to them by the applicants, contributed significantly to the subsequent killing, because no necessary steps were taken in the crucial first hours and days after the arrest.
