The Court notes, however, that, even assuming that the bills of costs submitted by the applicant covered the total amount claimed in this respect, the costs in this case were not caused by the length of proceedings but were costs normally incurred in the context of the proceedings. Thus, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim.",
