In particular, the applicant\u2019s case does not appear to have been particularly complex although it involved three defendants. Furthermore, although the investigation against the applicant was concluded rather speedily (see paragraphs 5-7 above), the Court notes a number of delays at the judicial stage, which were attributable to the authorities, such as a delay of about a year because of the remittal of the case due to procedural breaches, and repeated adjournments because of absent witnesses or co-accused (see paragraphs 8-11 above). Even if four of the hearings were adjourned because the applicant\u2019s lawyer did not attend, in view of the overall length of the proceedings and the number of hearings (ibid.), the delay thus caused does not appear to be significant.",
