The applicant\u2019s counsel argued that this had made the whole trial unfair and that the prosecutor\u2019s actions had amounted to a deliberate hindering of\u00a0his procedural rights.

With regard to the allegations that the\u00a0applicant\u2019s defence rights had been breached, the Court of Appeal established that\u00a0the applicant and his counsel had been duly summoned and had\u00a0appeared at the hearing of NA. It reiterated that the decision whether to\u00a0allow access to the case file at the investigation stage of the proceedings lay with the prosecutor, and that ensuring the confidentiality of the materials at\u00a0that\u00a0stage had been important for the outcome of the investigation. It was for this reason that the CCP authorised the applicant\u2019s counsel to examine the case file only at the final stage of the investigation. The\u00a0fact that the\u00a0applicant and his\u00a0counsel were to\u00a0take part in the hearing of\u00a0the witness did not make it\u00a0obligatory for the prosecutor to allow them access to the case file.

In addition, the Court underlined that its primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, also Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, 16\u00a0November 2010, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of\u00a0the\u00a0public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted (see\u00a0G\u00e4fgen\u00a0v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 175, ECHR 2010...) and, where necessary, to the rights of\u00a0witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26\u00a0March\u00a01996, \u00a7\u00a070, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II). Furthermore, the admissibility of evidence is\u00a0a\u00a0matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the\u00a0Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 162, and references therein).",

In those circumstances, the Court accepts that\u00a0there was a degree of urgency in proceeding with the hearing of\u00a0NA and that it was reasonable to refuse access to the case file in order not to delay the hearing of that witness. The Court is not persuaded that the\u00a0prosecutor\u2019s refusal to allow consultation of the file on the day of\u00a0the\u00a0hearing and his earlier decision of 2 April 2002 to authorise consultation of the case file only as from 12 April 2002 reveal any intention to hinder the rights of\u00a0the\u00a0defence.
