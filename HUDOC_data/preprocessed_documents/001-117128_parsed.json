The courts had omitted to establish whether the applicant had been fully informed of the conditions of the deposit agreement and whether, by accepting the deposit agreement terms, he had also authorised an eventual reduction of the interest rate by the bank in the absence of his prior explicit approval. Furthermore, the courts had disregarded the clarifications of the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 14 July 2004 providing authoritative interpretation of the relevant domestic law provisions and establishing, in particular, that the bank deposit agreements issue should have been governed by the Fundamentals of the USSR Civil Law of 31 May 1991 and not the Civil Code of the Russian Federation of 1996. The prohibition of a unilateral change of the interest rate was introduced by the Civil Code of the  and could not be applied retroactively. Thus, the domestic courts\u2019 retroactive reference to the provisions of the Civil Code constituted a manifestly wrong application of material law. Hence this judgment had had to be quashed.

Romania [GC], no.\u00a028342/95, \u00a7 62, ECHR 1999-VII; Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05658, ECHR 2003IX). In certain circumstances legal certainty can be disturbed in order to correct a \u201cfundamental defect\u201d or a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. Departures from the legal certainty principle are justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Kot, cited above, \u00a7 24; Protsenko v. Russia, no. 13151/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a025-34, 31 July 2008; and Tishkevich v. Russia, no. 2202/05, \u00a7\u00a7 2526, 4\u00a0December 2008). In such cases, the Court has to assess, in particular, whether a fair balance was struck between the interests of the applicants and the need to ensure the proper administration of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Kurinnyy v. Russia, no. 36495/02, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 2728, 12 June 2008). The judgment in question can be quashed exclusively in order to rectify an error of truly fundamental importance to the judicial system (see Shchurov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 40713/04, \u00a7 21, 29 March 2011). The \u201cright to a court\u201d would be illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final and enforceable judicial decision to be quashed by a higher court merely on the ground of disagreement with the assessment made by lower courts with the view of carrying out a fresh examination (see Kot, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02730).",

The Court does not find that the proceedings in question had been tarnished by a fundamental defect. Indeed, the judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour was set aside on the ground that the Proletarskiy District Court had incorrectly applied the substantive domestic law and incorrectly established the facts of the case, that ground not constituting a fundamental defect within the meaning of the Court\u2019s caselaw (see Luchkina v.
