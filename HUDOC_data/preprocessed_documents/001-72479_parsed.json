This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that the killing was caused by an agent of the State. Nor is it decisive whether members of the deceased\u2019s family or others have lodged a formal complaint about the killing with the competent investigation authority. The mere fact that the authorities were informed of the killing of an individual gives rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death (see Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 103, ECHR 1999IV). The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfies the minimum threshold of an investigation\u2019s effectiveness depends on the circumstances of each particular case. It must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Velikova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2000-VI, and \u00dclk\u00fc Ekinci, cited above, \u00a7144).",
