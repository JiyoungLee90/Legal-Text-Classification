The Court attaches importance to the fact that the material published by the applicant was an interview and not a general article. Thus the applicant did not publish his own statements but those made by a third person, namely A.R. The text of the interview had been sent to A.R. prior to publication in order to allow A.R. to ascertain whether her statements had been accurately cited and, possibly, to make corrections. A.R. returned the text to the applicant without any comments or corrections. This was confirmed by A.R. before the Regional Court in the course of criminal proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 14 above).

A.R. stated that two men \u2013 K.Z. and B.S. \u2013 had sexually propositioned her. She also mentioned K.S. from whom she had allegedly requested help at a party (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above).

M.C.\u2019s name did not appear in the interview in the context of the \u201csex scandal\u201d; it was mentioned by A.R., who said that B.S. had promised to support her candidature for a position at M.C.\u2019s office in Brussels. The applicant only then asked whether she had got the job and A.R. replied that the job had been given to M.C.\u2019s daughter. The Court notes in this context that the interview did not focus on M.C.; his name only appeared there because A.R. had mentioned it only in connection with B.S.\u2019s promise. In these circumstances the Court is of the opinion that the applicant could not have been reasonably expected to ask M.C. to comment, as he did with K.Z., B.S. and K.S. who, according to the applicant\u2019s statements, were either directly involved in the \u201csex scandal\u201d or witnessed the situation discussed in the interview (as regards the requirement of establishing the truth of reported statements made by third persons see, mutatis mutandis, Thorgeir Thorgeirson v.

In the present case the courts conditionally discharged the applicant; however the information about this fact appears in the National Criminal Register (see paragraph\u00a035 above). Although the Court has found on many occasions that a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Radio France and Others v.\u00a0France, no. 53984/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2004-II) it considers that, in the instant case, which concerns recourse to a criminal prosecution resulting in a finding of criminal responsibility must be seen as a wholly disproportionate measure (see, mutatis mutandis, D\u0142ugo\u0142\u0119cki v. Poland, no.\u00a023806/03, \u00a7 47, 24 February 2009).",
