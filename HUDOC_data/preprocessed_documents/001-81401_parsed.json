However, in the Government's view, such an approach created confusion. If the sum awarded by a court was a pensioner's \u201cpossession\u201d, it should not be affected by any subsequent increase in pension rates. Therefore, in Pravednaya the applicant would have had to return the money she had already received from the Pension Fund by virtue of the more recent changes in the legislation on State pensions.

The Court notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that this principle applies as well in the present case, having regard to the violations found (cf. Poznakhirina v. Russia, no. 25964/02, \u00a7\u00a033, 24\u00a0February 2005). The applicants were prevented from receiving money they had legitimately expected to receive under the judgment of 12\u00a0April 2000.",

The applicants alleged that they had been entitled to pensions with an IPC of 0.7 until the date when the IPC was once again increased and they had started to receive pensions with an IPC of more than 0.7. The Government made the recalculation with an IPC of 0.7 until 1 January 2002, when the IPC was abolished. In this connection the Court notes that the Government did not dispute that the applicants had been entitled to pensions with an IPC of more than 0.7 when the IPC was increased. Moreover, it appears that when the IPC was increased in 2001 the applicants started to receive pensions calculated on the basis of the increased IPC. Further increases of the IPC also affected the applicants' pensions. It follows that in accordance with the judgment of 12 April 2000, as upheld on 30 May 2000, the applicants were entitled to pensions calculated with an IPC of 0.7 until an increased IPC was introduced under the Russian pension legislation.",
