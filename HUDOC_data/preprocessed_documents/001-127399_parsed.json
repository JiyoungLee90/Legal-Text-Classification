It considered that, apart from the applicant\u2019s previous confessions, there were the testimony of his co-defendants, the victims, some of whom were eye-witnesses, and other witnesses in the case, as well as the material evidence, including part of the stolen goods found in the dwellings of the applicant\u2019s mother and his cohabitant, which were sufficient evidence for finding the applicant guilty.

The following injuries were recorded: \"on the neck there was a 2 by 1 cm pink-purple mark; on the back a 15 by 10 cm light brown mark consistent with injuries of the skin; traces of four injuries of the skin on the shoulder; whitish-reddish marks on the back of the hip which could be old injuries of the skin; 2.5 by 2 cm traces of injuries on the gluteus; on the radial-dorsal side of the right wrist was a 1 by 0.5\u00a0cm brown pigmented linear mark; on the dorsal left side of the penis a whitish scar was visible\". The expertise concluded that the injuries dated from roughly six months previously, and were consistent with the allegations made by the man. Upon examination by a medical member of the delegation, the mark on the wrist and the scar on the penis, consistent with an allegation of electrical shocks, were found to be still visible.\u201d",

He also noted that he had not had a proper opportunity to challenge the admissibility of the evidence obtained through coercion, and his complaints of torture and forced confession had never been properly examined. He went on to note that, in assessing his allegations of coercion, the domestic court had shifted the burden of proof of the alleged ill-treatment to him, having required that he prove beyond reasonable doubt that he had been ill-treated.

It should also be noted that according to the Government in October 2001 the applicant himself requested for being present in the court (see paragraph 24 above) and the applicant did not deny that statement of fact in his observations. However, the Court is not convinced that the arrangements provided by the domestic authorities could ensure the effective participation of the applicant in the court hearings on 21 December 2001. From the available materials it appears that the applicant could not walk or sit and that he had to be brought and remain on a stretcher throughout the hearing in question. This appears, in the particular circumstances of the case, to be a sufficiently serious reason to doubt the effectiveness of his participation in the trial. The Court notes in particular that the applicant could not make his closing statement due to his health problems (see paragraph 27). Furthermore, the reason for his health situation was neurological pain in the lumbar area, which was established to be the main location of the bruises after his ill-treatment by the police. Given the correlation between the location of pain and the place of bruises, the Court finds that the state of the applicant\u2019s health may, at least in part, have been related to his torture by the police and that his health condition had been incompatible with the principle of equality of arms and had seriously impaired his right to defend himself in person.",

At the same time, the defence motion for the ambulance doctor to be called as a witness had been refused because the court had already ordered a forensic medical examination of the applicant that day. After the medical examination had been completed, neither the applicant nor his lawyer had asked the court to summon any other witnesses and had agreed that the judicial investigation in the case could be completed. Therefore, the Government considered the applicant\u2019s submissions under this head to be unsubstantiated. They noted that only one witness, the ambulance doctor, had not been summoned and the applicant had not explained in his cassation appeal and in his application to the Court in what way the testimony of the said witness would have led the domestic courts to establish the applicant\u2019s innocence. They concluded that the applicant\u2019s right guaranteed by Article 6\u00a0\u00a7 3 (d) had not been violated in the present case.",

Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused\u2019s behalf; its essential aim, as indicated by the words \u201cunder the same conditions\u201d, is full equality of arms in the matter (see Vidal v. Belgium, 25\u00a0March 1992, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 235-B). An applicant claiming a violation of his right to obtain the attendance and examination of a defence witness should show that the examination of that person was necessary for the establishment of the truth and that the refusal to call that witness was prejudicial to his defence rights (see Guilloury v. France, no.\u00a062236/00, \u00a7 55, 22 June 2006). Although it is normally for the national courts to assess the evidence before them, as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a person as a witness was incompatible with Article 6 (see Bricmont v.\u00a0Belgium, 7\u00a0July 1989, \u00a7 89, Series A no. 158, and Destrehem v. France, no.\u00a056651/00, \u00a7 41, 18 May 2004).",

According to him, the testimony of those witnesses would have been of importance for establishing the circumstances in which he had sustained injuries at the initial stages of the investigation, and the Court acknowledges its relevance for the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 70 above). That testimony could also have shed light on whether the applicant was forced to confess, but its relevance to the outcome of the criminal proceedings against the applicant depends on whether and to what extent the domestic courts relied on the applicant\u2019s confession in securing his conviction. As the Court mentioned above, the applicant\u2019s confession did not play a crucial role in establishing his guilt. The applicant\u2019s plea of not guilty was given due consideration by the trial court, which based its conclusions on wide range of evidence (see paragraph 29 above). Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s complaint is not supported entirely by the case-file materials. It appears that the applicant sought to have three witnesses called, two of whom were in fact examined by the trial court, while the third one, the ambulance doctor, was not summoned because the court decided to order a comprehensive medical examination of the applicant. Thus, the applicant did not demonstrate that the court failed to question any witness whose testimony would have affected the fairness of the proceedings against him.",
