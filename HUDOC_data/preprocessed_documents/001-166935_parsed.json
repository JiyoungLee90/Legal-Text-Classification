This was clearly provided by the relevant provisions of the domestic law and the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law. Furthermore, on 15 December 2008, prior to the applicant bringing his administrative action, the Civil Division of the Supreme Court had adopted an opinion stating that the ordinary civil courts had subject-matter jurisdiction over disputes concerning the salaries of civil servants. The applicant, being represented by a qualified lawyer, should have been aware of this. Therefore, instead of bringing an administrative action before the High Administrative Court, he should have brought a civil action in a municipal court. Further to this, the applicant had had the possibility to lodge an appeal on points of law against the Slavonski Brod County Court\u2019s judgment of 12 August 2013; such an appeal was possible when the case-law of domestic courts had to be re-examined in the light of changes in the domestic legal system. Moreover, he could have lodged a constitutional complaint against the Slavonski Brod County Court\u2019s judgment of 12\u00a0August 2013.",

The fair, public and expeditious characteristics of judicial proceedings are indeed of no value at all if such proceedings are not first initiated. And in civil matters one can scarcely conceive of the rule of law without there being a possibility of having access to the courts (see, among many other authorities, Kreuz v. Poland, no. 28249/95, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2001VI, and also Golder v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 21 January 1975, \u00a7\u00a7 34 in fine and 35-36, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a018, and Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a029392/95, \u00a7\u00a7 9193, ECHR 2001-V). For the right of access to be effective, an individual must have a clear, practical opportunity to challenge any act interfering with his or her rights (see, for example, Bellet v. France, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 36, Series A no.\u00a0333B).",

Where the individual\u2019s access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the Court will examine whether the limitation imposed impaired the essence of the right and, in particular, whether it pursued a legitimate aim and whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0May 1985, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 93; Zwi\u0105zek Nauczycielstwa Polskiego v.\u00a0Poland, no. 42049/98, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2004IX; and Szwagrun-Baurycza v.\u00a0Poland, no. 41187/02, \u00a7 49, 24 October 2006).

It further observes that the decision of the High Administrative Court was adopted on 4 January 2012 and that it became final on the same day (see paragraph 16). Accordingly, the deadline for bringing a fresh action in order to interrupt the statutory limitation period expired on 4 April 2012.",

At that time \u00a0the three-month time-limit under section 243(1) of the Civil Obligations Act had already expired. In this respect the Court notes that there was nothing to prevent the applicant \u2013 nor does he claim otherwise \u2013 from bringing his civil action for payment of salary arrears within the three-month time-limit. Had the applicant complied with the time-limit, this would have interrupted the running of the statutory limitation period prescribed by section 183 of the Labour Act and allowed the municipal court to examine his claim on the merits. The proceedings the applicant instituted before the Constitutional Court had no relevance in this connection. It is true that the Slavonski Brod Municipal Court in dismissing the applicant\u2019s civil action as being time-barred relied on Section 242 of the Civil Obligation Act (see paragraph 20), without even considering that his administrative action had actually been declared inadmissible for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and that the Section 243(1) of the Civil Obligation Act was applicable in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 25). However, in any event his claim was undoubtedly time bared. Therefore, the Court cannot accept the applicant\u2019s argument that his civil action would have not had any prospect of success if it had been submitted within the prescribed time-limit.",
