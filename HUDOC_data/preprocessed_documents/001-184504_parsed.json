                        "content": "5.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants complained that they had been unfairly convicted of drug offences following entrapment by State agents. In application no.\u00a048523/15, the applicant also raised other complaints under the provisions of the Convention. As regards application no. 3436/15, on 31\u00a0October 2013 the Levokumskiy District Court of the Stavropol Region found the applicant guilty of three counts of an attempted drug sale \u201ccommitted with the same intent\u201d on 10 and 17 May and 19 June 2013, as well as declared him guilty of unlawful purchase and storage without an intent to sell of a large quantity of drugs, seized from him on 19 June 2013. The applicant was sentenced to ten years and a month of imprisonment. The conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal by the Stavropol Regional Court on 23 January 2014. In May 2015 the Deputy Prosecutor of the Stavropol Region asked the Presidium of the Regional Court to amend the conviction by excluding episodes of 17 May and 19 June 2013 \u201cin view of the lack of a criminal conduct [in the applicant\u2019s actions]\u201d and to uphold the conviction in respect of the episode on 10 May 2013. The Deputy Prosecutor argued, in particular, that the \u201coperative experiment\u201d in the course of which the applicant had sold drugs on 10 May 2013 had been properly authorised by the acting head of the district police department and had been recorded, and thus there was no need to perform subsequent \u201coperative experiments\u201d in the form of the test purchase on 17\u00a0May and 19\u00a0June 2013. On 30 June 2015 the Presidium of the Stavropol Regional Court accepted the Deputy Prosecutor\u2019s request for the revision of the final conviction by virtue of Article 401 of the Russian Criminal Code, annulled the conviction in respect of the two episodes of drug sale on 17 May and 19\u00a0June 2013, declared the applicant guilty of an attempted drug sale on 10\u00a0May 2013 and sentenced him to eight years and one month of imprisonment. The Presidium noted that having conducted \u201cthe operative experiment\u201d on 10 May 2013 the police had already established and recorded the applicant\u2019s criminal activity. However, the police officers had not prevented the applicant\u2019s subsequent criminal activities and \u201chad again, on 17 May and 19 June 2013 performed similar operative measures\u201d. The Presidium concluded that the applicant\u2019s conviction of episodes of 17\u00a0May and 19 June 2013 had therefore been based on unlawfully obtained evidence and thus should be voided. As regards the episode on 10 May 2013, it observed a video recording of the \u201ctest purchase\u201d and noted that the applicant had talked about future drug sales. It then read out a statement by a witness M. who had testified that \u201cthe buyer had not incited anyone to sell drugs\u201d when they were in the \u201ccompany drinking alcohol\u201d. The Presidium concluded that there was no indication of the police entrapment on 10\u00a0May 2013.",

In particular, there is nothing in the Presidium\u2019s decision to suggest that it has properly examined the issue of police incitement in the applicant\u2019s case in respect of the first episode of the attempted drug sale on 10 May 2013. The Presidium merely noted the absence of the need for the two test purchases on 17 May and 19 June 2013, as the episode on 10 May 2013 had already been properly recorded. It then looked into a vague statement by a witness and a video recording of the actual test purchase, which in its view did not contain any indication of the police entrapment. The Court observes that the Presidium did not verify the existence of information implicating the applicant in drug trafficking prior to the first contact between him and the buyer, acting upon the police instructions, on 10 May 2013, and did not assess the content of that information. It did not request relevant materials concerning the allegedly pre-existing \u201coperational information\u201d incriminating the applicant before the \u201coperative experiment\u201d on 10\u00a0May 2013 and did not hear a single witness about the early stages of police involvement when they had allegedly learned about the applicant\u2019s drug dealings. The Presidium made no attempts to check the allegations of the police and accepted their uncorroborated argument that they had had good reasons for suspecting the applicant.",

From a theoretical point of view, it is true that the Court should award nothing in just satisfaction where two criteria are satisfied concurrently: a finding of a violation and full compensation for (or\u00a0total elimination of) the consequences at domestic level after the European ruling. At first sight, that approach appears entirely in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity. This would be true provided that the subsequent reopening of proceedings at domestic level were carried out in good faith (see Emre v. Switzerland (no. 2), no. 5056/10, 11 October 2011), completed within a reasonable time and fair compensation awarded for the damage where appropriate. In our case those guarantees have not been supplied by the State, which bears the burden of proof. It confines itself, in its observations, to indicating that a finding of a violation of the Convention would be sufficient because of the possibility of reopening the criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, despite the existence of that statutory basis (see paragraph 11), we have no information about its actual results.\u00a0Furthermore, we do not know whether the applicants, in the event of an acquittal, will be able to sue the State on grounds of a malfunctioning of the public judicial service. And even if that were possible, the Grand Chamber has already ruled that it would appear excessive to require victims to institute fresh proceedings at domestic level in order to obtain just satisfaction. Such journeying through the courts has been deemed \u201chardly consistent with the effective protection of human rights\u201d as it would lead \u201cto a situation incompatible with the aim and object of the Convention\u201d (see Jalloh v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2006IX).",

Latvia, no.\u00a025282/07, 8 January 2013; Sepil v. Turkey, no. 17711/07, 12\u00a0November 2013; and P\u0103tra\u015fcu v. Romania, no. 7600/09, 14 February 2017).",
