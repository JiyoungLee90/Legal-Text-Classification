The Court notes that the fourth custody proceedings lasted from May 2009 until April 2013 (see paragraphs 27\u00a0to\u00a035 above). During this period the courts issued several decisions but their only outcome was to order the applicant and his former wife to undergo therapy. The latter failed mostly due to the applicant\u2019s former wife hostile attitude. The Court further observes that the applicant\u2019s former wife had for many years avoided appearing before the court by sending health certificates which only in 2015 were object of the court\u2019s scrutiny (see paragraphs 30, 32, 39 above).
