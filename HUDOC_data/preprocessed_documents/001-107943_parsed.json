Thousands of applications are declared inadmissible ratione materiae each year \u2013 at single judge, committee or Chamber level \u2013 by application of this basic principle. The classic formulation of this principle remains that enunciated in Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain (21 January 1991), \u00a728: \u201c...it is not [the function of the Court] to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention.\u201d",

Malta dec. 16 March 2000; Bl\u00fccher c. R\u00e9publique Tch\u00e8que 11 janvier 2005 \u00a7 56-57). All these cases are very fact-specific and do not easily lend themselves to the formulation of a general principle or rule which can be said to have made any serious inroad into the doctrine of quatri\u00e8me instance. This is even more so with regard to the two cases cited in the majority judgment at \u00a7 32. In De Moor the Court, in \u00a7\u00a7 55 and 56, vacillates between the domestic tribunal\u2019s reasoning not being a \u201clegally valid one\u201d and the proceedings not having been held in public. Indeed, the majority decision in the instant case relies on part of \u00a7 55 by the exegetic formula of mutatis mutandis. Likewise in Dulaurans, although one senses that the bottom line is that the French domestic courts did not provide adequate reasons for their judgments, there is also a wavering between lack of proper reasoning and conflicting conclusions of fact.",

This appears to have been simply an oversight, an error. Furthermore, we are not convinced that a decision of the  declaring a provision unconstitutional necessarily and automatically makes this provision inapplicable to the circumstances of the case before the national courts. This would normally depend on the procedural or substantive nature of the said provision as well as on the period to which its applicability must be assessed. However this assessment falls within the competence of the national courts. In our view the present case file discloses no arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness, such as flying in the face of established case-law or absurd conclusions of law or fact (which would fall to be regarded as violating the implicit requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to give reasons for decisions). We see no difference between the wrong application of a law and what happened in this case.",
