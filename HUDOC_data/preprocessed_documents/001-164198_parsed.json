The facts of that case and the present cases are similar to a significant degree. The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz Mammadov case also apply to the present cases. In particular, the Court noted the existence of serious concerns about the foreseeability and precision of the legislation governing public assemblies, and about the possibility of public assemblies being abusively banned or dispersed (ibid., \u00a7 55); doubts about the credibility of the formal ground, namely Article 310.1 of the CAO, relied on by the authorities to arrest and convict the participant of an unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 56 and\u00a062); a failure by the authorities to take into consideration the fact that the demonstration had been notified (ibid., \u00a7 60); a lack of relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration which had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner (ibid., \u00a7 61); and a lack of any acknowledgment that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article\u00a011 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64). Having regard to the above, in the Gafgaz Mammadov case the Court found that the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of assembly had been violated on account of the dispersal of the demonstration and his arrest and conviction.",

In addition, there had been a strong reliance by the domestic courts on the administrative offence report prepared by and statements given by the police (ibid., \u00a7 85), utter disregard by the domestic courts of important factual circumstances and legal issues of the case, inter alia, the peaceful nature of the unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7 86), an absence of legal assistance at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-91), a failure to provide an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of one\u2019s own choosing (ibid., \u00a7 92), and formalistic representation by the State-funded lawyer (ibid., \u00a7 93).
