Therefore, the use of the \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d procedure might have speeded up the examination of the case but could not have made up for the delays which had occurred prior to its introduction and had already had a significant impact on the overall duration of the proceedings (see, among others, Djangozov v. , no. 45950/99, \u00a7 52, 8 July 2004 and Rachevi v.\u00a0Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 67). Furthermore, after the delivery of the Plovdiv Regional Court's judgment in December 1999 the main delay in the proceedings was due to the remittal of the case in 2001 and the reopening (see paragraphs 11 and 14-17 above), in respect of which the \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d cannot be considered an effective remedy (see mutatis mutandis, Givezov v.
