To control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers; there were numerous clashes between the two sides. At 5.30 p.m. the police ordered the meeting to finish early and began to disperse the participants. It took them about two hours to clear the square.",

In the absence of other grievances the Court is not in a position to rule that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment (see, mutatis mutandis, Topal v. the Republic of Moldova (dec.), no. 37509/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-38, 18 March 2014).

The Court reiterates that while Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for detention within criminal proceedings, Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention deals with the possible justification for such detention.

Firstly, the domestic courts considered that the applicant, faced with the risk of prison, was likely to abscond, influence witnesses, or interfere with the administration of justice. Secondly, they seemed to suggest that the very nature of the offences in question, together with information about the applicant\u2019s character, made it likely that he would reoffend and obstruct the course of the criminal proceedings. In addition, the courts dismissed his requests for an alternative preventive measure on the grounds that no other measure could secure the course of justice in the case.",

Turkey, no. 17526/10, \u00a7 116, 19 January 2016, and the cases cited therein). In this case, the Court notes that the first-instance court did not verify the applicant\u2019s account of events. In particular, it rejected his statement that he had not thrown pieces of tarmac or inflicted K.\u2019s injury as unsubstantiated, while refusing to question a defence witness, Officer Sh., who could have confirmed the applicant\u2019s statements. The appellate court did not address those drawbacks, despite the applicant\u2019s complaint. In those circumstances it cannot be said that the applicant enjoyed a procedural safeguard against arbitrary interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention in the domestic proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0114). In any event, even assuming that the prison sentence of one year and four months under Article 318 of the Criminal Code for using violence against a public official was justified, it is noteworthy that it was more lenient than the partly concurrent three-year prison sentence for participation in acts of mass disorder.",

The gravity of the punishment was thus attributable to the general context of the applicant\u2019s assault on the policeman, not to the harm he thus inflicted. As stated above, causing injury to Police Officer K. entailed a sentence of one year and four months. Regard being had to the other acts imputed to the applicant, it transpires that his staying at the site of the rally and chanting anti-government slogans accounted for an additional two years and two months to his prison term under Article 212 of the Criminal Code. Those acts, unlike throwing pieces of tarmac (already imputed under Article 318 of the Code), were peaceful and constituted an act of protest, a form of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention (see Taranenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070, and the cases cited therein). If the domestic courts had taken into account the fact that the applicant had chanted slogans in connection with the exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, they might have considered it a mitigating factor. On the contrary, they penalised the applicant for the political message he had intended to express by his presence at the venue and his chanting of non-violent political slogans.",

Just as in Yaroslav Belousov (cited above, \u00a7 179), there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the applicant was among those responsible for the onset of clashes between the protesters and the police. As far as can be discerned from the indictment, the applicant threw pieces of tarmac at the height of the clashes, when the police were already arresting protesters. The overall conduct imputed to the applicant, although involving violence, was sporadic in nature and did not attain the degree of aggression which the Court found in other cases to amount to violence calling for resolute measures, in particular the subsequent sentencing of protesters to lengthy prison terms (see, by contrast, Osmani and Others v. the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001, and Primov and Others v.
