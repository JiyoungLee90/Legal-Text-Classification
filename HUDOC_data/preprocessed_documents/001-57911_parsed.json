The Court of Appeal noted that, according to a medical report of 8 September 1992 by Dr Araj\u00e4rvi, Sini was physically and mentally healthy and a psychological test had shown that she was clearly of above average intelligence for a twelve-year-old; she should not therefore be forced to meet the applicant but be allowed to decide for herself.

In this regard he also relied on Article 5 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-5) (right to equality of spouses in their relations with their children). He further complained that, contrary to Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, he had not been given a fair and oral hearing before the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court in 1991 to 1992. In addition he alleged a breach of this provision in that the custody proceedings had not been concluded within a reasonable time and that the Supreme Court had failed to give reasons for its refusal of 21 January 1992 to grant leave to appeal. Finally, he complained that he had not been afforded an effective remedy as required under Article 13 (art. 13), in respect of the failure to take measures to facilitate reunion, the excessive length of the proceedings and the ineffectiveness of the administrative fines imposed upon the grandparents in view of their financial circumstances.",

In the Government\u2019s submission a distinction should be drawn between, on the one hand, a parent\u2019s custody and visiting rights in respect of a child and, on the other hand, the enforcement of such rights. Although there may be plausible reasons for a parent to have custody and access rights, it does not necessarily follow that these should be enforced, especially if it would be incompatible with the interests and welfare of the child. That was the position under Finnish law, which viewed a parent\u2019s custody of a child as a right first and foremost in the interest of the well-being and balanced development of the child and not primarily for the benefit of the parent. They referred also to Article 3 of the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 19 para. 1 (b) of the 1980 European Convention on the Enforcement of Decisions Concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children (European Treaty Series no. 105) and Articles 1 and 12 para. 3 of the 1980 Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (done at  on 25 October 1980).

The Court recalls that the obligation of the national authorities to take measures to facilitate reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with a child who has lived for some time with other persons may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures being taken to this effect. The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention. Where contacts with the parent might appear to threaten those interests or interfere with those rights, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them (see the above-mentioned Olsson (no. 2) judgment, pp. 35-36, para. 90).",

What is more, at least from the Supreme Court\u2019s judgments of 17 May 1988 until the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 25 September 1991, the Finnish courts considered not only that the applicant was best suited as custodian but also that the child should return to live with him (see paragraphs 14, 16, 18 and 27 above).  Arrangements for his access to the child were specified in the District Court\u2019s interim decision of 14 November 1990 and in the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 25 September 1991 (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above). Since the grandparents failed to comply with the access arrangements set out in these decisions, the County Administrative Board, at the applicant\u2019s requests, ordered their enforcement subject to administrative fines being imposed upon them (see paragraphs 26 and 35 above); but these measures proved to be of no avail in face of the grandparents\u2019 persistent refusal to comply.",

Nonetheless the Court does not accept that responsibility for the failure of the relevant decisions or measures in actually bringing about contacts can be attributed to the applicant. Both the District Court\u2019s and the Court of Appeal\u2019s decisions regarding access had recognised the need to arrange meetings at a neutral place outside the grandparents\u2019 home (see paragraphs 23, 25 and 29 above). Whilst the grandparents consistently refused to comply with these decisions, the applicant actively sought their enforcement. The suggestion by the Government that the situation would have been any different had he requested the imposition of the administrative fines or not omitted for some time to renew his enforcement request is highly improbable (see paragraphs 26 and 34 above).",

On 30 May 1990, steps to have the custody transferred to the grandparents were recommended by the National Social Welfare Board (see paragraph 22 above) and, on 13 August 1990, the local Social Welfare Board instituted proceedings to this effect before the District Court. The Board\u2019s request was dismissed by it on 8 May 1991 but upheld by the Court of Appeal on 25 September 1991; leave to appeal was refused by the Supreme Court on 21 January 1992 (see paragraphs 23, 27, 29 and 31 above).",

The Court sees no reason to doubt that the transfer of custody was \"necessary in a democratic society\". The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment, which was based on expert opinion, had regard to the length of the girl\u2019s stay with the grandparents, her strong attachment to them and her feeling that their home was her own (see paragraphs 29 and 31 above). These reasons were not only relevant but also sufficient for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2). The competent national authorities, which were in principle better placed than the international judge in evaluating the evidence before them (see, amongst many authorities, the above-mentioned Olsson v.  (no. 2) judgment, pp. 35-36, para. 90), did not overstep their margin of appreciation in arriving at the decisions they did. Even taking into account the failure of the authorities to secure the applicant access to his child, the measure cannot be regarded as disproportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting her interests.",
