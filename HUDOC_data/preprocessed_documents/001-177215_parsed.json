It further found that the information in question was damaging to the claimants\u2019 reputation for the following reasons. The allegations that investigators and experts had tried to help the Navy officers escape criminal responsibility had suggested that these officials had lacked the requisite impartiality when performing their duties. The District Court found the expression \u201cto help escape criminal responsibility\u201d defamatory, as it contained an allegation of criminal conduct. The applicants had failed to provide evidence that the claimants had committed a crime. The District Court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicants\u2019 reference to the fact that the second article had merely reproduced B.K.\u2019s position as reflected in his book. Furthermore, the District Court reasoned that the applicants had been under an obligation to verify the truthfulness of the information before publishing it. It dismissed the applicants\u2019 assertion that the impugned statements amounted to value judgments. The District Court found in the claimants\u2019 favour, ordered the retraction of the statements concerning the claimants\u2019 involvement in an abuse of public office, and awarded each claimant 50,000 and 7,000 Russian roubles (RUB \u2013 approximately 1,470 and 205 euros (EUR)), to be paid by the applicant company and the second applicant respectively. To reimburse court fees, the applicant company was ordered to pay RUB\u00a085 and the second applicant was ordered to pay RUB 15 to each claimant.",

However, this does not give public prosecutors immunity from any media criticism of their actions performed in the official capacity. To suggest otherwise would undermine the vital public watchdog role of the press (see Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 216).

In the circumstances of the present case, the Court has doubts as to whether the impugned articles could be considered an attack reaching the requisite threshold of seriousness and capable of causing prejudice to the enjoyment of Article 8 rights by the three civil servants and the Chief Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office. It considers it appropriate, however, to leave this issue aside, since the primary task incumbent on the Court in the present case is to ascertain whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the Convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases, namely freedom of expression protected by Article\u00a010 on the one hand, and the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 on the other (see, among many other authorities, Delfi AS, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0138).",

A general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press\u2019s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see Thoma, cited above, \u00a7 64). In the Court\u2019s view, the District Court did not provide any particularly strong reasons when finding the applicants liable for defamation for disseminating B.K.\u2019s opinions. It rejected the applicants\u2019 argument that the impugned statements had emanated from B.K., merely because the phrases employed in B.K.\u2019s book and in the articles were not identical. The District Court considered it completely irrelevant whether the journalist had expressed her own views or those of a third party \u201cwhere damage [had] been unlawfully inflicted on ... the honour, dignity and business reputation of an individual\u201d (see paragraph 23 above). The City Court endorsed this one-sided approach by upholding the judgment on appeal (see paragraph\u00a025 above).",

The impugned articles made it clear to readers that the second applicant was reporting the opinions of R.K. and B.K. about acts which, in B.K.\u2019s view, constituted an abuse of public office. These opinions had been expressed in B.K.\u2019s and R.K.\u2019s complaints brought at national level and before the Court, as well as in B.K.\u2019s book. In the Court\u2019s view, in such circumstances, it cannot be said that the applicants failed to provide at least some factual basis for the impugned statements (see, by contrast, Novaya Gazeta and Borodyanskiy v. Russia, no. 14087/08, \u00a7 43, 28 March 2013). The Court is thus satisfied that the applicants acted in good faith in accordance with the ethics of journalism and, as regards the second applicant, with the diligence expected of a responsible journalist reporting on a matter of public interest (see Erla Hlynsd\u03ccttir v.\u00a0Iceland, no.\u00a043380/10, \u00a7 72, 10\u00a0July 2012, and Bj\u00f6rk Ei\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir v.\u00a0Iceland, no.\u00a046443/09, \u00a7 81, 10 July 2012).",
