They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Mocanu and Others v.

Thus, the mere fact that appropriate steps were not taken to reduce the risk of collusion between alleged perpetrators amounts to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 330, ECHR\u00a02007II, and Turluyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a063638/09, \u00a7 107, 20 June 2013).

It should result in a reasoned decision to reassure a concerned public that the rule of law has been respected (see, mutatis mutandis, Kelly and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, \u00a7 118, 4\u00a0May 2001).",

During this period, which amounted to approximately eighteen months, six decisions were taken by the domestic authorities refusing the institution of criminal proceedings against police officers for lack of evidence that a crime had been committed. All these decisions, except the last one, were quashed by the supervising prosecutor as unfounded, and additional pre-investigation inquiries were ordered. As a result of its refusal to open a criminal case, the domestic investigating authority has therefore never conducted a preliminary investigation into the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment, that is, a fully-fledged criminal investigation in which the whole range of investigative measures are carried out, such as questioning, confrontation and identification parade (see paragraph 32 above).",

The latter was held on 21 April 2011. The appeal court appointed legal-aid counsel for the applicant, and those services were accepted. Both the applicant and his counsel participated in the hearing. By its fresh judgment, the appeal court reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence. The applicant did not complain before the Court that the legal assistance provided to him at the appeal hearing of 21\u00a0April 2011 had been ineffective or otherwise in breach of the Convention (see Timoshin, cited above; Lozhkin v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a016384/08, 22 October 2013; and, by contrast, Sakhnovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a099-109).
