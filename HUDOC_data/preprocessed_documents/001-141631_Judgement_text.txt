The Constitution of the Republic of Estonia (Eesti Vabariigi põhiseadus) provides:
“The guarantee of rights and freedoms is the duty of the legislative, executive and judicial powers, and of local governments.”
“(1)  Everyone whose rights and freedoms are violated has the right of recourse to the courts. Everyone has the right, while his or her case is before the court, to petition for any relevant law, other legislation or procedure to be declared unconstitutional.
(2)  The courts shall observe the Constitution and shall declare unconstitutional any law, other legislation or procedure which violates the rights and freedoms provided by the Constitution or which is otherwise in conflict with the Constitution.”
“Everyone has the right to compensation for moral and material damage caused by the unlawful action of any person.”
Article 46 § 4 of the Code of Administrative Court Procedure sets a three-year time-limit for compensation claims filed with an administrative court.
By a decision of 30 December 2008 (case no. 3-4-1-12-08) the Constitutional Review Chamber of the Supreme Court dealt with a complaint concerning the length of criminal proceedings. It rejected the complaint, considering that the complainant could have had recourse to another effective remedy. The Supreme Court held:
“25.  In the examination of [the complainant’s] request for compensation for the damage caused by the violation of fundamental rights, the Chamber agrees with the opinion expressed in the written opinions of the parties to the proceedings that [the complainant] can demand compensation for damage in an administrative court on the bases and pursuant to the procedure established by the State Liability Act.”
This decision of the Supreme Court is extensively quoted in the case of Malkov v. Estonia (no. 31407/07, § 32, 4 February 2010).
In a judgment of 22 March 2011 in the case of Osmjorkin (no. 3318509) the Supreme Court, sitting in plenary session, held that Article 14 of the Constitution provided for a fundamental right to an effective remedy. Taken together with Article 15 of the Constitution, these provisions provided for a fundamental right to effective judicial proceedings. The right to an effective remedy also encompassed the right to claim that the proceedings took place within a reasonable time. The Supreme Court also made reference to the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to the right to an effective remedy in Article 13 of the Convention. The Supreme Court found that the State Liability Act (Riigivastutuse seadus) did not provide for compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by excessive length of a preliminary investigation in criminal proceedings, declared it unconstitutional in this respect and awarded the complainant a sum of money relying on Article 25 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court further considered that the enactment of a special regulation for compensation for damage arising from criminal proceedings was required (for a more extensive summary of the judgment, see Raudsepp v. Estonia, no. 54191/07, §§ 38-42, 8 November 2011).
By a decision of 23 May 2011 (unpublished) the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court decided not to examine an appellant’s appeal in civil case no. 2-04-1159. In respect of a compensation claim concerning excessive length of proceedings made in the appeal the Supreme Court noted that a civil court had no jurisdiction of such matter. Referring to the decision of 30 December 2008 of the Constitutional Review Chamber of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 51 above) and the judgment of 22 March 2011 of the Supreme Court’s plenary session (see paragraph 52 above), the Civil Chamber explained that a claim for compensation for damage for excessive length of proceedings had to be lodged with an administrative court.
By a judgment of 27 February 2012 (case no. 3-10-3326) the Tartu Administrative Court awarded a complainant a sum of money for non-pecuniary damage caused by, inter alia, excessive length of criminal proceedings and lengthy application of a preventive measure (obligation not to leave the place of residence). Criminal proceedings against the complainant had already been discontinued because of the length of the proceedings. The Administrative Court referred to Articles 14, 15, 25, 34 and 35 of the Constitution and to the Supreme Court’s judgment in the case of Osmjorkin.
By a judgment of 30 November 2012 (case no. 3-11-1108) the Tartu Administrative Court awarded a complainant a sum of money as compensation for the non-pecuniary damage caused by the excessive length of the criminal proceedings and the obligation not to leave his place of residence. The Administrative Court referred to Articles 14, 25, 34 and 35 of the Constitution and to the Supreme Court’s judgment in the case of Osmjorkin (these administrative court proceedings have been summarised in Mets v. Estonia (dec.), no. 38967/10, §§ 14-15, 7 May 2013).
By a decision of 8 May 2012 (case no. 3-11-1146) the Tallinn Administrative Court confirmed a compromise agreement between a complainant and the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry agreed to pay the complainant a sum of money in compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by lengthy criminal proceedings.
