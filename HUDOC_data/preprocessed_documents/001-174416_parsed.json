The Court will not dispute the authorities\u2019 choice to arrest and question the assistant during that very moment. It is not for it to assess the suitability of a particular investigative measure, and in this particular case, due to the care assistant\u2019s intimate involvement in the applicant\u2019s movements and activities, he might well have been considered a suspect or a key witness. It has not been claimed by the Government, however, that no other person trained to provide care to a person with disabilities could have been found; it is significant in that regard that the events under discussion occurred within the context of a planned operation of the prosecution authorities (see paragraph 10 above), who have never claimed that they were unaware of the first applicant\u2019s handicap and daily needs.",
