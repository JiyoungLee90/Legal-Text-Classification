This understanding of Article 5 (art. 5) has far-reaching consequences.  Even if the conditions provided for by national law are not satisfied, the detention remains nevertheless \"lawful\" if the national law distinguishes (which is often not the case) between decisions which are void ab initio and other decisions. Such a distinction - which leads often, including in the present case, to extremely unclear results - neglects the situation and the interests of the detained person.  Decisive are the degree of the violation of the national law, the corresponding error of the judge concerned and the difference between void and \"voidable\" decisions.
