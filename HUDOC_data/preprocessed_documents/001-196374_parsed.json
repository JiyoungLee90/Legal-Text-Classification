He was charged with covering up the preparation of a crime, owing to his failure to inform the relevant authorities of the possible involvement of the Abkhaz separatist forces in the rebellion, and with aiding and abetting high treason aimed at overthrowing the constitutional order by force. The first charge concerning the applicant\u2019s alleged failure to inform the relevant authorities of the possible involvement of the Abkhaz separatist forces in the rebellion was based solely on the applicant\u2019s telephone conversation with E.K. as aired on Rustavi\u00a02 on 25\u00a0July 2006 (see paragraph\u00a015 above). As regards the second charge, namely aiding and abetting high treason, it was alleged that the applicant had provided intellectual support to E.K. by giving him instructions, advice, information, and the encouragement necessary to achieve his aims. According to the document containing the charges, the applicant further promised to create a favourable image of E.K. and his plans in public, and called E.K. a hero in one of his public speeches while calling on the government not to forcibly quell the rebellion in another speech. He further advised E.K. on his public speeches and image. The second charge was based on several recordings of telephone conversations between the applicant and E.K. during the period of 23-25\u00a0July 2006, the applicant\u2019s speeches and comments broadcast by the media, E.K.\u2019s speeches and other evidence.",

They submitted that the reasons justifying the use of pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant had persisted throughout all four months of his pre-trial detention. Therefore, there was no need to refer separately to individual judicial decisions ordering and subsequently extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention. As for the grounds relied on to justify the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, the Government submitted the following. First, the risk of reoffending had been demonstrated by the fact that the charge against the applicant consisted of aiding and abetting the military rebellion aimed at overturning the constitutional order and was based on his support for the rebels expressed through telephone conversations \u2013 an activity which the applicant could have resumed if released, given that the rebels had still been at large, issuing threats against the government. Second, if released, the applicant could have interfered with the investigation by influencing the witnesses that remained to be questioned. It was in this context that the complexity of the criminal investigation in question justified the applicant\u2019s continued detention. Third, the applicant\u2019s release would have threatened public order owing to the risk of him continuing to influence public opinion in order to gain public support for the rebels. The Government maintained that in sensitive cases such as the applicant\u2019s, involving matters of state security and the territorial integrity of the country, a genuine requirement of public interest existed that outweighed the rule of respect for individual liberty. Furthermore, the domestic courts also relied on other grounds such as the risk of absconding. These reasons, taken cumulatively, were adequate and sufficient to justify the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention. In any event, the overall duration of four months\u2019 pretrial detention, following which the applicant had been released, had not been unreasonable.",

While the applicant\u2019s argument regarding the investigating authorities\u2019 failure to question E.K.\u2019s brother in August 2006 (see paragraph\u00a034 above) was apparently not addressed, it does not appear to have been the sole investigative measure to be carried out as part of the investigation. The domestic courts noted the absence of arbitrary delays on the part of the investigative authorities (see paragraphs\u00a035 and\u00a039 above). The Court is further mindful of the fact that the applicant was released upon the completion of the investigation (see paragraphs 40, 51 and 56 above). In such circumstances, the investigating and judicial authorities cannot be said to have displayed a lack of special diligence in handling the applicant\u2019s case.",

A \u201ccriminal charge\u201d exists from the moment that an individual is officially notified by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence, or from the point at which his situation has been substantially affected by actions taken by the authorities as a result of a suspicion against him (see, among other authorities, Simeonovi v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 21980/04, \u00a7\u00a0110, 12 May 2017, with further references therein). The Court notes that no plea of inadmissibility for incompatibility\u00a0ratione materiae\u00a0with Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention was made by the Government in their observations. However, since this is\u00a0a matter which goes to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, the Court must examine it of its own motion (see Mirovni In\u0161titut v. Slovenia, no. 32303/13, \u00a7\u00a027, 13 March 2018, see also Ble\u010di\u0107 v. Croatia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a059532/00, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2006 III). The relevant case-law in the context of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 2 of the Convention was summarised by the Court in Blake v. United Kingdom ((dec.), no.\u00a068890/01, \u00a7\u00a7 120-121, 25\u00a0October 2005).",

By not giving the Government an opportunity to address this complaint at domestic level, the applicant, in the Court\u2019s view, did not meet the requirements of Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see Tuskia and Others\u00a0v.

Conversely, the refusal by the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office to open a criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning tampering with evidence explicitly confirmed the existence of a full transcript of the audio recording, using it as an argument to conclude that it must have been the private television channel which had shortened the conversation based on their own operational needs (see paragraphs 41-42 above). The full transcript of the recording that the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office referred to, and which was available in the criminal case file, was prepared by the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraph\u00a022 above) and its authenticity and reliability were never put in question.

Therefore, the existence of two versions of the audio recording, even if the full version of that recording was not included in the applicant\u2019s criminal case file, is confirmed by the full transcript of the recording prepared by the Ministry of the Interior, and the reference made to it by the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office (compare paragraphs\u00a022 and 42 above).

As regards the Government\u2019s argument before the Court, they submitted that it was within the private television company\u2019s remit to transmit whichever parts of the conversation it deemed relevant (see paragraph\u00a075 above).

First, the argument regarding the operational needs of the television channel and the limited airtime is not convincing considering that the recording aired in the media lasted one minute and forty-four seconds, the same length as the recording in respect of which the full transcript was available in the criminal case file (compare paragraphs 15 and 22 above). Second, as regards the related but more general argument that the television company could have aired whichever parts of the conversation it considered relevant, that is not consistent with the Government\u2019s position before the Court that only one official version of the recording existed and that it was identical to the one transmitted by the television channel in question (see paragraph 75 above).",

In that regard, the Court reiterates that when assessing evidence it is not bound by formulae and adopts the conclusions supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions (see Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], no.\u00a072508/13, \u00a7\u00a0315, 28\u00a0November 2017).

In particular, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the recording in question had been obtained as part of the preliminary criminal investigation opened on 22\u00a0July 2006, which subsequently, on an unspecified date, also included the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a09, 19, 26, 27, and 39 above). More importantly, the investigating authorities manipulated that recording before providing it to the media on 25\u00a0July 2006 to insinuate that E.K. had been cooperating with the Abkhaz separatist forces in the context of his rebellion, and that the applicant had approved such actions (see paragraphs\u00a087-93 above). The applicant was questioned on 26\u00a0July 2006 as a witness, and he complained about the manipulation of the audio recording (see paragraph\u00a019 above, in fine). The authorities decided to formally charge and arrest him only four days later, on 29\u00a0July 2009 (see paragraph\u00a026 above). One of the charges was based solely on the manipulated audio recording, as disseminated in the media (see paragraph\u00a026 above). This sequence of closely inter-connected events, considered as a whole, indicates that the applicant\u2019s situation was substantially affected, for the purposes of the applicability of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention, by the conduct of the investigating authorities which wrongly created a suspicion in respect of the applicant by tampering with evidence and having it disseminated, in order to subsequently charge him with a crime based on that material (contrast and compare, Blake, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0123).",
