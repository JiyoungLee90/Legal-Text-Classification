The fact that news is a perishable commodity (see Observer and Guardian v. the , 26 November 1991, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 216) made unsuitable any request for access to information, as suggested by the Government, since it would have taken too long to obtain an answer. Moreover, it is difficult to see how a request from a newspaper could have succeeded where requests made by Members of Parliament had failed (see paragraph 9 above). In addition, the lack of any official information on the matter at issue, despite the applicant newspaper's attempts to obtain such details, plus the other uncontested facts raising legitimate doubts as to the legitimacy of the distribution of the apartments (see paragraphs 6-9 and 42 above), could reasonably have prompted the journalist to report on anything that was available, including unconfirmed rumours (see Timpul Info-Magazin and Anghel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036). Significantly, the applicant newspaper clearly informed its readers in the article itself that it had been unable to verify the truth of the information received, and thus avoided presenting the rumours on which it was reporting as established facts.",

It is also noted that if an enforcement warrant is not submitted within three years from the date of the award, it can only be enforced thereafter if the debtor wishes to pay (see paragraph 22 above). It follows that if the enforcement warrant has still not been submitted, the 2005 warrant can no longer be submitted for enforcement.
