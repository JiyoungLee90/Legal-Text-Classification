The Government considered that contesting the admissibility of evidence in the framework of criminal proceedings could not be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of a complaint under Article 8. The aim of such a remedy was to exclude unlawfully obtained evidence from the list of evidence examined during the trial. It could therefore provide appropriate redress for a complaint under Article 6, but not for a complaint under Article 8. Indeed, the purpose of the criminal proceedings was to establish whether the defendant was innocent or guilty of the criminal charges levelled against him or her, rather than to attribute responsibility for the alleged violations of his or her right to respect for private life, home or correspondence.

The applicant further argued that he had preferred the procedure under Article 125 of the CCrP to the procedure under Chapter 25 of the CCP and that the Plenary Supreme Court had explained that it was the correct avenue in cases where criminal proceedings were pending (see paragraph 62 above).

The Court has occasionally accepted that that remedy was apparently effective and sufficient and therefore the applicants who had pursued it complied with the exhaustion requirement (see Dragojevi\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a068955/11, \u00a7\u00a7 35, 42, 47 and 72, 15 January 2015; \u0160antare and Labaz\u0146ikovs v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 34148/07, \u00a7\u00a7 25 and 40-46, 31 March 2016; and Radzhab Magomedov v. Russia, no.\u00a020933/08, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 77-79, 20\u00a0December 2016, where the applicants had challenged the admissibility of the evidence obtained as a result of the allegedly unlawful covert surveillance measures in the criminal proceedings against them). On a closer examination, however, the Court has found that the courts in criminal proceedings were not capable of providing an effective remedy in the following situations: although they could consider questions of the fairness of admitting the evidence in the criminal proceedings, it was not open to them to deal with the substance of the Convention complaint that the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private life and correspondence was not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d or not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d; still less was it open to them to grant appropriate relief in connection with the complaint (see Khan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a035394/97, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000V; P.G.\u00a0and J.H. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2001IX; Goranova-Karaeneva v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a012739/05, \u00a7 59, 8 March 2011; and \u0130rfan G\u00fczel v.

It has already found that Russian law did not provide for an effective remedy against covert surveillance measures in cases where no criminal proceedings had been brought against the subject of the surveillance, in particular because the remedies invoked by the Government were available (a) only to persons who had at least minimum information about the judicial decision authorising interception of their communications, such as its date and the court which issued it (in the case of a supervisory review application); (b) only to participants to criminal proceedings while a pre-trial investigation was pending (a complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP); or (c) due to the distribution of the burden of proof, only to persons who were in possession of information about the interception of their communications (a judicial review complaint under the Judicial Review Act, Chapter 25 of the CCP and the new Code of Administrative Procedure). It has, however, left open the question whether those remedies would be available and effective in cases where an individual learned about the interception of his or her communications in the course of criminal proceedings against him or her (see Roman Zakharov v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no.\u00a047143/06, \u00a7\u00a7 294-98, ECHR 2015).",

As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or after the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice toward the applicant. At the same time, Article 35 \u00a7 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, the Court considers that it may be appropriate, for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1, to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a016064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2009; El-Masri v.\u00a0the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7 136, ECHR 2012; and Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09 and\u00a02 others, \u00a7 260, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). Also, if an extraordinary remedy is the only judicial remedy available to the applicant, the six-month time-limit may be calculated from the date of the decision given regarding that remedy (see Ahtinen v. Finland (dec.), no.\u00a048907/99, 31 May 2005).",

The Court discerns nothing in the parties\u2019 submissions to suggest that the applicants were aware, or should have become aware, of the futility of such a course of action. Indeed, the domestic courts could, and did, examine whether the surveillance measures had been lawful and therefore addressed, in substance, part of the applicants\u2019 Convention complaints.

The Court does not need to determine whether the flat in question was the applicant\u2019s \u201chome\u201d within the meaning of that Article. It has already found on many occasions that a person\u2019s private life may be concerned by measures effected outside his or her home. In that connection, the person\u2019s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor. Private-life considerations may arise once any systematic or permanent record comes into existence, even if an audio or video recording is made while the person is in a public place (see Uzun v.\u00a0Germany, no. 35623/05, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2010 (extracts), with further references). The Court finds that the covert video surveillance of the applicant while on private premises where his expectations of privacy were high, the recording of personal data, the examination of the tapes by third parties without the applicant\u2019s knowledge or consent, and the use of the videotapes as evidence in the criminal proceedings amounted to an interference with the applicant\u2019s \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a08 \u00a7 1 (compare Khan, cited above, \u00a7 25, and Vetter v.

The Court notes in this connection that in the case of Roman Zakharov v.

In cases arising from individual applications, the Court must as a rule focus its attention not on the law as such but on the manner in which it was applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances (see Goranova-Karaeneva, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

The Court notes in this connection that there may be good reasons to keep a covert surveillance authorisation, or some parts of it, secret from its subject even after he or she has become aware of its existence. Indeed, a full disclosure of the authorisation may in some cases reveal the working methods and fields of operation of the police or intelligence services and even possibly to identify their agents (see, mutatis mutandis, Roman Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7 287). At the same time, the information contained in decisions authorising covert surveillance might be critical for the person\u2019s ability to bring legal proceedings to challenge the legal and factual grounds for authorising covert surveillance (see Avanesyan, cited above, \u00a7 29). Accordingly, in the Court\u2019s opinion, when dealing with a request for the disclosure of a covert surveillance authorisation, the domestic courts are required to ensure a proper balance of the interests of the surveillance subject and the public interests. The surveillance subject should be granted access to the documents in question, unless there are compelling concerns to prevent such a decision (see Radzhab Magomedov, cited above, \u00a7 82).",
