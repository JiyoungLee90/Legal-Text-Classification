Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

In particular, the Court reiterates the Government's argument that the force was used in compliance with the requirements of the Police Act. The Court observes that the Police Act and Custody Act prescribe that the police may resort to force only in an exhaustive number of situations and only when non-violent methods have not ensured the desired result (see paragraphs 36 to 39). While noting the Government's argument that the police officers resorted to special means to put an end to the applicant's refusal to comply with their orders, the Court is mindful of the fact that there is no indication in the Government's submissions that the police officers tried to resort to non-violent methods before using truncheons against the applicant. In any event, the manner in which the domestic law regulates the use of force against detainees does not absolve  from its responsibilities under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch, cited above, \u00a7 34, and Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7\u00a064, 12 April 2007).

The police officers ordered the applicant to stop his unruly behaviour, but the applicant refused to comply. The Court accepts that in these circumstances the officers may have needed to resort to physical force to prevent further disruptions and calm the applicant down. However, the Court is not convinced that hitting a detainee with a truncheon was conducive to the desired result. In this connection, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant's handcuffing, of which he did not complain, was, as is apparent from the Government's submissions, more effective in facilitating the police officers' task of restoring order. The Court reiterates that the use of handcuffs or other instruments of restraint does not normally give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention where the measure has been imposed in connection with lawful detention and does not entail the use of force, or public exposure, exceeding what is reasonably considered necessary. In this regard, it is important to consider, for instance, the danger of the person's absconding or causing injury or damage (see Raninen v.\u00a0Finland, 16\u00a0December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, \u00a7 56, and Mathew v.\u00a0the Netherlands, no. 24919/03, \u00a7\u00a0180, ECHR 2005). However, the manner in which the applicant is subjected to the measure in issue should not go beyond the threshold of a minimum level of severity envisaged by the Court's case-law under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nevmerzhitsky v. Ukraine, no. 54825/00, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR\u00a02005). Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court observes that the applicant did not contend that the handcuffing had affected him physically. Nor has he alleged that the handcuffing was aimed at debasing or humiliating him. Given the nature of the applicant's complaints and assessing the Government's description of the events which allegedly occurred in the police station on 14 December 2002, the Court finds it striking that, in the circumstances, as described by the Government, the police officers used truncheons against the applicant without examining the possibility of using other less intrusive means to obtain the desired result. The Court thus rejects the Government's argument that the use of truncheons was inevitable or even beneficial.",

It was not until 24\u00a0October 2003 when an investigator of the Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor's office included in his decision statements by an emergency doctor who had examined the applicant on 16\u00a0December 2002. However, the investigator confined himself to mere reiteration of the doctor's statements (see paragraph 25 above) and did not attempt to examine the medical evidence before him or to draw conclusions on that basis. Furthermore, the Court finds it particularly striking that despite direct orders from higher-ranking prosecutors to perform an expert medical examination of the applicant (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above), no steps were taken until November 2004.

Although excerpts from the applicant's testimony were included in the decisions not to institute criminal proceedings, the prosecution authorities did not consider that testimony to be credible, apparently, because it reflected a personal opinion and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant. The Court finds it necessary to note that the investigating authorities, when assessing the testimonies given by the applicant, deemed them to be subjective,. However, the credibility of the police officers' testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation was supposed to establish whether the officers were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v.

While the investigating authorities may not have been provided with the names of individuals who could have seen the applicant at the police station and might have witnessed his alleged beatings, they were expected to take steps on their own initiative to identify possible eyewitnesses. The Court therefore finds that the investigating authorities' failure to look for corroborating evidence and their deferential attitude to the police officers must be considered to be a particularly serious shortcoming in the investigation (see Ayd\u0131n v. Turkey, 25 September 1997, Reports 1997VI, \u00a7\u00a0106).",

The Court entertains doubts that in such short periods of time the investigating authorities could have taken any additional steps to establish the true circumstances of the case. The inertia displayed by the authorities in response to the applicant's allegations was inconsistent with their procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention. It further appears that the reaction of the investigating authorities to the applicant's ill-treatment complaints was no more than an attempt to find some justification for the police officers' actions. In fact, the Court is of the opinion that the investigating authorities did not make any meaningful attempt to bring to account those responsible for the ill-treatment.",
