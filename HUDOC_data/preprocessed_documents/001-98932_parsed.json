Thus, the county court established the tort liability of the journalist and awarded the applicant 100,000,000 Romanian lei (approximately 3,300 euros (EUR) at the time) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. By the same decision, the county court dismissed the objection to the effect that the appeal on points of law was inadmissible as having been lodged outside the 10-day time-limit. The county court referred to the provisions of Article 363 of the Romanian Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP), according to which the period during which an appeal may be lodged starts to elapse on the date of delivery of the judgment if the party concerned was present either at the hearing or at the delivery. As the applicant was not present at the hearing, although her representative was, the period did not start to elapse on the date of delivery of the judgment, and thus the appeal was lodged within the legal time-limit.",
