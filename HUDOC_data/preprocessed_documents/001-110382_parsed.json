According to the report the Centre for Abused Children carried out an investigation into the case after they were informed by O.M.M. that the child\u2019s father had behaved inappropriately towards his daughter by bathing with her without wearing underwear, and had neglected the child when she was left alone with him. The report also stated that following a discussion with both parents they accused one another of inappropriate behaviour towards the child which negatively influenced the minor\u2019s behaviour. In addition O.M.M. also accused the applicant of being physically aggressive towards her in January\u00a02006. Consequently, both parents were invited, and agreed, to attend psychological counselling sessions at the County Centre for Abused Children. The child\u2019s father was informed on several occasions that his behaviour in bathing naked with his daughter could influence his relationship with her and could have unforeseen negative consequences. The report concluded that the child\u2019s situation needed to be monitored and that the parents needed to continue the psychological counselling sessions within the centre.",

The report stated, inter alia, that the child was developing normally for her age. She felt closer to her mother and evaluated her in positive terms. She started being upset when she was asked about her father. The father was represented in a negative way because of the tense situation between the parents. None of the father\u2019s actions were received positively, and she did not wish her father to visit, because of the tense situation with her mother. She considered her father\u2019s visits to be a negative process. Her father was excluded from the description of her family, which in her opinion consisted of her mother and her maternal grandparents. She refused to discuss any potential sexual abuse by her father. The report concluded that the child was scarred by the tense situation between her parents, and that consequently she did not wish to receive visits from her father.

Relying on the statements of the parties\u2019 witnesses and on the report produced by the  for Abused Children attached to the Child Social and Protection Services, the court held that the father could visit the child and spend a few hours per week with her in the mother\u2019s absence. The absence of her mother would avoid any stressful situation for the child caused by the tension between the parents. Also the contact with her father would be welcomed by and beneficial for the child as long as N.M.E.P. needed the attention of both parents for her balanced emotional and physical development, which could not be achieved in the presence of both parents. According to the social investigation carried out at the applicant\u2019s home, his living conditions were appropriate. The fact that the supplement to the social investigation, which the court did not order, mentioned that the rooms of his home looked unwelcoming, without providing details on why they would be unfit to host a child, could not be considered a well-grounded reason for refusing the applicant contact with his daughter. Moreover, O.M.M.\u2019s arguments that the applicant was not capable of taking care of the child were rebutted by the available witness statements.",

The paternal relatives met the child and had her wellbeing at heart. In N.M.E.P.\u2019s case, she enjoyed ties with both Romanian and French cultures, and she could not be denied the right to maintain those direct contacts with the two countries. In addition, no evidence supported O.M.M.\u2019s argument that the applicant would fail to return the child to Romania. The child had been left alone with the applicant before and he had always returned her to her mother. Moreover, the witnesses stated that whenever O.M.M. did not agree to leave the child alone with him he did not insist on O.M.M. doing so. Also, she never expressed concern that the applicant would fail to return the child to her. The applicant\u2019s failure to indicate the dates for travelling abroad and for returning to Romania by providing plane tickets could not be considered arguments for the dismissal of his request, as it was the court\u2019s task to set those dates. Also, the applicant had provided the names and addresses of all his relatives, where he would like to take the child. Consequently, after it had been established that the schedule suggested by the applicant was not in the minor\u2019s best interest, the court set a contact rights programme for the applicant and allowed him to take the child away from O.M.M.\u2019s home, even in her absence and without her consent: on Sundays, on 14\u00a0July and between 1 and 15\u00a0August; every second year on 8\u00a0June, a week at Easter and a week at Christmas. In addition, the court allowed the applicant to take the child out of Romania, even without O.M.M.\u2019s consent, every second year for a week at Easter and for Christmas and yearly between 1 and 15\u00a0August. The parties appealed against the judgment. O.M.M. asked the court, inter\u00a0alia, to order a psychological evaluation of the child, but the applicant contested O.M.M.\u2019s request.",

However, the court considered that the schedule suggested by the applicant was too tiring for the child, taking into account her young age and her need to attend school. In this respect the court held that the Orthodox Easter period would prove a good opportunity for the applicant to visit his daughter at her home and would give him the opportunity to meet the child in a familiar environment for the latter. For the winter and summer holidays, when the applicant and his daughter could spend more time together, he was allowed to take his daughter away from her mother\u2019s home, since there would be enough time for the child to rest and play. Moreover, the court considered that the parents must share the child\u2019s travelling expenses for the summer and winter holidays, while the travelling expenses for Easter would be incurred by the father. Furthermore, on account of O.M.M.\u2019s previous obstructive behaviour with regard to the enforcement of judgments, the court ordered her to pay a RON\u00a050 (approximately EUR\u00a013) daily compensation for any delay if she failed to comply with the contact schedule established by the court, as follows: yearly at Orthodox Easter at the child\u2019s home in the United Kingdom, at the applicant\u2019s expense and between 1 and 15\u00a0August at both parents\u2019 expense; and one week every two years for Christmas at both parents\u2019 expense.

The expenses would be borne by both parents and the child would be accompanied by the mother on the outbound flight from the United Kingdom and by the father on the return flight home. Moreover, the father could travel to visit his daughter every second month for the last weekend of the month, while the mother had to bring the child to Romania to her father\u2019s home every second month for the last weekend of the month.

It held that the court could not establish the amount of the fine due, as the applicant had not been able to show how many times he had been obstructed in the enforcement of the judgment of 7\u00a0June\u00a02007 after O.M.M.\u2019s duty to pay a fine was set by the court on 10\u00a0July\u00a02008.

It underlined, inter\u00a0alia, that, according to a report produced by the County Centre for Abused Children attached to the Child Social and Protection Services following counselling sessions with the parties which were quit by the father, the child was affected by the conflict between her parents and considered her mother to be \u201cgood\u201d and her father to be \u201cbad\u201d and wanted him to \u201cleave her alone\u201d and to stop visiting her.

In this context, the court held that although O.M.M. obstructed the enforcement of final court judgments it could not be argued that she did not have in mind the best interest of her child. She allowed the father to visit the child at her home and in her presence. Consequently, given the tense relations between the parents and the need of the child, convicting O.M.M. would not serve any purpose, as it would preserve, inter\u00a0alia, the child\u2019s feelings of uncertainty.",
