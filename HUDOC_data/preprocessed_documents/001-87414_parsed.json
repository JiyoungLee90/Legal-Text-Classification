If a \u2019s decision is consistent with Convention principles, the Court will, when examining the question of the exhaustion of domestic remedies, refrain from dealing with the length of the proceedings subsequent to that decision.

Although in that period three requests by the applicant \u2013 two for judges to stand down and one for the case to be transferred to a different appellate court \u2013 were also examined, the Court does not see how deciding these procedural issues could justify such lengthy appellate proceedings. In this connection, it notes the Government\u2019s submission that the applicant\u2019s requests were unsubstantiated, a factor which, in the Court\u2019s view, would, if anything, have made it easier to decide the requests. However, the first decision, which concerned the applicant\u2019s request for a transfer of the case from the Rijeka County Court, was not adopted by the Supreme Court until the appellate proceedings had already been pending for about three years and three months. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that it is the normal task of a court in judicial proceedings to decide upon the circumstances which might call for the removal of judges participating in a particular case (see Cerin v. Croatia, no.\u00a054727/00, \u00a7\u00a026, 15 November 2001).
