The property \u2013 while formally registered in the second applicant\u2019s name \u2013 was treated by the court as belonging to the first applicant who may have chosen not to have had the ownership title registered in his own name in order to hide such property and, if necessary, to protect it against any possible sanctions. The property concerned was therefore sealed. On 26\u00a0September 2005 a certain Mr\u00a0M.K., acting through a representative (the same as the one of the applicants) and arguing that the house in the village of Kvariati had belonged to him since 26\u00a0April 2004, applied to the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office to have the seizure order lifted in respect of that house. The prosecutor responded that the selling of the house in question had been regarded by the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office as the first applicant\u2019s attempt to evade the payment of potential damages. In February 2006 M.K., the second applicant and N.K. (M.K.\u2019s relative) instituted judicial proceedings requesting to have the provisional seizure order lifted. M.K.\u2019s appeal related to the house in Kvariati, while the second applicant and N.K. complained in respect of other property. On 31\u00a0January 2008 the International Investment Company substituted M.K. as the claimant based on the record of the Public Registry indicating that M.K. was no longer registered as the owner of the house in Kvariati (see paragraph\u00a017 below). On 11\u00a0June 2008 the Chamber of Civil Cases of the Tbilisi City Court ruled that it had not been competent, ratione materiae, to decide on the matter, and indicated to the parties the proper forum for lodging their applications. The decision was subject to an appeal. It is unclear whether the parties pursued the proceedings related to the provisional seizure order.",

The second applicant was charged with preparing and using the document in question. According to the document listing the charges, between 1998 and 2001 the first applicant built a two-storey house in the village of Kvariati, a resort on Georgia\u2019s southern Black Sea coast (\u201cthe house\u201d).

In November\u00a02003, in order to further conceal the origin of the property, the first applicant decided to arrange for the fictitious sale of the property to a third party.

Even assuming that the sale contract did constitute such a document, it would only have been forged if any of the signatures or the notary seal affixed to it or any other essential elements of the agreement had been forged. In that connection, even in the event that the agreement had not been concluded for the purpose that it had been intended for \u2013 that is to say the sale of the property \u2013 it should have been declared null and void through civil proceedings. Furthermore, they submitted, among other things, that the initial illegality of the acquisition of the house by the first applicant had never been proved. The applicants further submitted that the conviction had been based on an anonymous source. Furthermore, neither M.K. nor his relatives had been questioned regarding the fictitious nature of the agreement. As the property had been sealed soon after its sale, the buyer had not been able to exercise his ownership right over it, as confirmed by his letter addressed to the lower court. Some of the witnesses had confirmed having seen M.K.\u2019s family being prevented from entering the house. In such circumstances, the second applicant had been obliged to continue to maintain the house until such time as the new owner became capable of taking it over. M.K. had eventually taken his money back. Finally, according to the applicants\u2019 submissions, the initiation of the criminal proceedings and the conviction had been due to the personal interests of the Minister of Internal Affairs \u2013 who had moved into the house while the proceedings against them had still been pending \u2013 rather than any evidence confirming their guilt.",

The lawyer submitted that as a party to the second set of criminal proceedings, the first applicant had been entitled to express his opinion on the case, including his misgivings about the impartiality of the judge in question. He requested that the court renew the expired time-limit and consider the first applicant\u2019s appeal on the merits, as his failure to appeal within one month of the date of the lower court\u2019s judgment should have been excused, given that the first applicant had had good reason for not appealing within the time-limit. Specifically, neither the applicant nor his lawyer nor his relatives had been informed of the criminal proceedings in question, and it had been for that reason that the appeal had been lodged out of time. Furthermore, failure to duly inform the applicant of the proceedings had not been excusable, given that the applicant\u2019s address and telephone number in Switzerland had been known to the relevant authorities. Given that such information had been readily available, no need had existed to appoint a legal-aid lawyer. Furthermore, in addition to failing to inform the applicant of the criminal proceedings against him, the legalaid lawyer had not appealed against the judgment convicting the applicant within the prescribed time-limit. It had been only on 2\u00a0November 2010 that the legal-aid lawyer had orally informed the applicant\u2019s lawyer of the judgment of 30\u00a0September 2010. The criminal proceedings had therefore been carried out with manifest disregard to the procedural legislation and had been in breach of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (a), (b), and (c) of the Convention, justifying the reinstatement of the time-limit for lodging the appeal against the first-instance court\u2019s judgment.",

Owing to his being a fugitive, the first applicant\u2019s interests had been defended by a legal-aid lawyer, on whom the judgment had been served. The Khelvachauri District Court continued to note that the law placed the burden of proving the existence of an excuse (by way of arguing for the reinstatement of a time-limit) upon the party who had missed the time-limit in question. As the law did not define what such circumstances could be, it was up to the courts to decide such matters on the basis of the particular circumstances of each case.

It was based on a body of witness statements (including statements by the applicants\u2019 relatives, and the first applicant\u2019s attorney) and other evidence (see paragraph\u00a021 above) pointing to the applicants\u2019 \u201cde facto ownership\u201d (\u201c\u10e0\u10d4\u10d0\u10da\u10e3\u10e0\u10d8 \u10e1\u10d0\u10d9\u10e3\u10d7\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e3\u10e4\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0\u201d) of the house after the conclusion of the sale contract. In that connection, under the Court\u2019s case-law concerning reasoning of judicial decisions cited above, the domestic courts were obliged to provide a specific and explicit reply only to those arguments which would have been decisive for the outcome of the proceedings. In this connection, among other arguments, the applicants had argued (i) the alleged absence of proof that the property had been obtained through illegal means; (ii) the anonymity of the source of the allegation that the first applicant had acquired the property unlawfully; and (iii) the fact that the Minister of Internal Affairs had allegedly moved into the house at the time the criminal investigation had commenced. Although these arguments were not given an explicit reply by the domestic courts, they were not relevant to the determination of whether the applicants had prepared and used a fictitious sale contract for immovable property within the meaning of Article\u00a0210 of the CC. While the Court takes note of the Minister\u2019s subsequent conviction in relation to his occupancy and renovation of the house in\u00a0Kvariati (see paragraph\u00a041 above), it does not lose sight of the fact that the Minister\u2019s conviction concerned a different crime, established only after the proceedings against the applicants had ended, and had no direct impact upon the crime of forgery imputed to the applicants.",

However, neither those arguments nor the absence of an explicit reply in the relevant judgments should be assessed in the abstract. In particular, in a case such as the present one \u2013 where domestic judgments are based, among other things, on a body of evidence obtained from multiple witnesses \u2013 arguments concerning the allegedly insufficient reasoning should be treated with some caution.",

In that connection, the applicants submitted that the sale contract had been annulled, and the sum of money paid by the buyer returned, because of M.K.\u2019s inability to exercise his rights as an owner. Such annulment was, according to the applicants, a proof that the sale contract had not been fictitious, and that the applicants had to ensure the maintenance of the house. Yet, while such a fact was susceptible of proof, the applicants presented no appropriate evidence (such as, for instance, a receipt or payment order) to substantiate their claim. Even though it appears from the case-file material related to the first set of criminal proceedings that M.K. had instituted proceedings to have the provisional seizure order in respect of the house lifted (see paragraph\u00a013 above), it remains unclear to what extent the applicants drew the domestic courts\u2019 attention to that fact. In any event, and more importantly, the institution of such proceedings does not in and of itself call into question the domestic courts\u2019 finding that the sale contract had been fictitious. Lastly, the applicants\u2019 related complaint that M.K. had not been questioned does not appear to have been attributable to the courts given that the applicants\u2019 request to question M.K. was not accompanied with his contact information, and later it became apparent that he had not resided in Georgia (compare paragraphs\u00a019-20 and 48 above). Furthermore, as M.K.\u2019s letter had been added to the case-file material, M.K.\u2019s version of the events was known to the domestic courts, and the applicants did not justify what new information the witness could have adduced before the domestic courts (see\u00a0Murtazaliyeva v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no.\u00a036658/05, \u00a7\u00a0158, 18\u00a0December 2018). In such circumstances, and given the witness evidence contained in the case file (which the appellate court reproduced in its judgment), the answer to the applicants\u2019 objections was, even if only implicitly (see Sawoniuk v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 63716/00, 29\u00a0May 2001), effectively set out in the judgment in question.",

As concerns the definition of forgery, the Court takes into account the fact that the particular definition of forgery under Article 210 of the CC used in the case at hand had been wellestablished in the jurisprudence of the domestic courts at the material time (see paragraphs\u00a025 and\u00a051 above) and cannot qualify it as manifestly unreasonable. Furthermore, the Court takes note of the fact that the Supreme Court did respond to the applicants regarding this particular argument, noting the existence of a well-established practice on the application of Article\u00a0210 of the CC to similar cases (see paragraph\u00a025 above).",
