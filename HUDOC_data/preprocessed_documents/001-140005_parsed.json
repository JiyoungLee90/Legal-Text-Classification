Be that as it may, the requirement that the pain or suffering be inflicted by a public official does no more in my view than identify the author and the public context in which the author must be acting. It does not lend to the acts of torture themselves any official or governmental character or nature, or mean that it can in any way be regarded as an official function to inflict, or that an official can be regarded as representing the state in inflicting, such pain or suffering.

He noted that the House of Lords in Pinochet (No.\u00a03) (see paragraphs 44-56 below) had considered that there would be no immunity from criminal prosecution in respect of an individual officer who had committed torture abroad in an official context. It was not easy to see why civil proceedings against an alleged torturer could be said to involve a greater interference in the internal affairs of a foreign State than criminal proceedings against the same person. It was also incongruous that if an alleged torturer was within the jurisdiction of the forum State, he would be prosecuted pursuant to Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention against Torture (see paragraph 62 below) and no immunity could be claimed, but the victim of the alleged torture would be unable to pursue any civil claim. Furthermore, there was no basis for assuming that, in civil proceedings, a State could be made liable to indemnify or otherwise support one of its officials proved to have committed systematic torture.",

Firstly, he considered it impossible to identify any settled international principle affording the State the right to claim immunity in respect of claims directed against an official, rather than against the State, its Head of State or diplomats. He was of the view that the legislation and case-law of the United States of America (see paragraphs 112-25 below) militated strongly against any such settled principle and supported a contrary view. In so far as counsel for the Government purported to refer to evidence of settled practice, Mance LJ noted that the case-law to which he had referred related either to the immunity of the State itself or to the immunity of individual officials for alleged misconduct that bore no relationship in nature or gravity to the international crime of systematic torture. He considered the dicta in the separate opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans and Buergenthal to the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the \u201cArrest Warrant\u201d case (see paragraphs 84-85 below) to provide further confirmation that there was no settled international practice in this area.",

[I]t seems to me that any absolute view of immunity must at the very least yield in the face of assertions of systematic torture to a more nuanced or proportionate approach. As it is, having regard to the [European Convention on Human Rights], it is sufficient to decide this appeal that, whether issues of state immunity are or are not treated as theoretically separate from issues of jurisdiction in English law, the permissibility, appropriateness and proportionality of exercising jurisdiction ought to be determined at one and the same time. Such a conclusion reflects the importance attaching in today\u2019s world and in current international thinking and jurisprudence to the recognition and effective enforcement of individual human rights. It fits harmoniously with the position already achieved in relation to criminal proceedings. It caters for our obligation under article 6 of the [Convention] not to deny access to our courts, in circumstances where it would otherwise be appropriate to exercise jurisdiction applying domestic jurisdictional principles, unless to do so would be in pursuit of a legitimate aim and proportionate. ...\u201d",

Although the applicants referred to a substantial body of authority showing that the courts of the United States would not recognise acts performed by individual officials as being carried out in an official capacity for the purposes of immunity if those acts were contrary to a jus cogens prohibition, Lord Bingham found it unnecessary to examine those authorities since they were only important to the extent that they expressed principles widely shared and observed among other nations.

Firstly, given the conclusion of the International Court of Justice in the \u201cArrest Warrant\u201d case, the applicants had to accept that State immunity ratione personae could be claimed for a serving foreign minister accused of crimes against humanity. It followed that the prohibition of torture did not automatically override all other rules of international law. Secondly, Article 14 of the Convention against Torture did not provide for universal civil jurisdiction. Thirdly, the 2004 United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property (see paragraphs\u00a075-80 below) did not provide any exception from immunity for civil claims based on acts of torture; although such an exception was considered by a working group of the ILC, it was not agreed (see paragraph 79 below). Lord Bingham noted in this respect that although some commentators had criticised the United Nations Convention because it did not include a torture exception, they nonetheless accepted that this area of international law was \u201cin a state of flux\u201d and did not suggest that there was an international consensus in favour of such an exception. Finally, there was no evidence that States had recognised or given effect to any international-law obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction over claims arising from alleged breaches of peremptory norms of international law, nor was there any consensus of judicial or learned opinion that they should. For these reasons, Lord Bingham agreed with the Court of Appeal that the claim brought by Mr Jones against Saudi Arabia was to be dismissed.",

He quoted with approval the observation of Hazel Fox\u00a0QC (The Law of State Immunity (Oxford University Press, 2004), p.\u00a0525) that State immunity did not \u201ccontradict a prohibition contained in a jus cogens norm but merely divert[ed] any breach of it to a different method of settlement\u201d.

The offence is one which could only be committed in circumstances which would normally give rise to the immunity. The international community had created an offence for which immunity ratione materiae could not possibly be available. International law cannot be supposed to have established a crime having the character of a jus cogens and at the same time to have provided an immunity which is co-extensive with the obligation it seeks to impose.\u201d",

On the question posed in this case, Lord Phillips, like Lord Saville, considered that State immunity ratione materiae could not coexist with the notion of international crimes. Since, in the case of torture, the only conduct covered by the Convention against Torture was conduct which would be subject to immunity ratione materiae if it applied, the Convention was incompatible with the applicability of such immunity.",

He highlighted that there was no evidence of any consideration being given to a waiver of State immunity in the negotiations leading to the Convention against Torture. He further pointed out that if immunity ratione materiae were excluded, former heads of State and senior public officials would have to think twice about travelling abroad, for fear of being the subject of unfounded allegations emanating from States of a different political persuasion.

At the inter-state level, it serves to internationally de-legitimise any legislative, administrative or judicial act authorising torture. It would be senseless to argue, on the one hand, that on account of the jus cogens value of the prohibition against torture, treaties or customary rules providing for torture would be null and void ab initio, and then be unmindful of a State say, taking national measures authorising or condoning torture or absolving its perpetrators through an amnesty law. If such a situation were to arise, the national measures, violating the general principle and any relevant treaty provision, would produce the legal effects discussed above and in addition would not be accorded international legal recognition. Proceedings could be initiated by potential victims if they had locus standi before a competent international or national judicial body with a view to asking it to hold the national measure to be internationally unlawful; or the victim could bring a civil suit for damage in a foreign court, which would therefore be asked inter alia to disregard the legal value of the national authorising act. What is even more important is that perpetrators of torture acting upon or benefiting from those national measures may nevertheless be held criminally responsible for torture, whether in a foreign State, or in their own State under a subsequent regime. In short, in spite of possible national authorisation by legislative or judicial bodies to violate the principle banning torture, individuals remain bound to comply with that principle.

The debate here is about the need to protect the interests of the international community as a whole and, correspondingly, the fact that these interests, as well as the need to combat grave international crimes, most often perpetrated by State officials, dictate the need to call them to account for their crimes in any State which has jurisdiction. This, in turn, requires that exceptions to the immunity of officials from foreign criminal jurisdiction exist. Exceptions ... are reasoned in various ways. The principal rationales boil down to the following. Firstly, as already noted, the view exists that grave criminal acts committed by an official cannot under international law be considered as acts performed in an official capacity. Secondly, it is considered that since an international crime committed by an official in an official capacity is attributed not only to the State but also to the official, then he is not protected by immunity ratione materiae in criminal proceedings. Thirdly, it is pointed out that peremptory norms of international law which prohibit and criminalize certain acts prevail over the norm concerning immunity and render immunity invalid when applied to crimes of this kind. Fourthly, it is stated that in international law a norm of customary international law has emerged, providing for an exception to immunity ratione materiae in a case where an official has committed grave crimes under international law. Fifthly, a link is being drawn between the existence of universal jurisdiction in respect of the gravest crimes and the invalidity of immunity as it applies to such crimes. Sixthly, an analogous link is seen between the obligation aut dedere aut judicare and the invalidity of immunity as it applies to crimes in respect of which such an obligation exists. ...\u201d (footnotes omitted)",

Some members considered that any act that had been, or appeared to have been, carried out by an \u2018official\u2019 must be defined as an official act for which immunity was enjoyed. However, other members supported a restrictive definition of an \u2018official act\u2019, excluding conduct that might, for example, constitute an international crime. Some members were in favour of treating the concept of an \u2018official act\u2019 differently depending on whether the act was attributed to the State in the context of responsibility or to individuals in the context of criminal responsibility and immunity.\u201d",

None had considered the specific situation of State officials. The responses were therefore largely hypothetical and analytical, rather than evidence-based.

It noted that prior to the enactment of the FSIA, the courts deferred to the executive on the question whether to recognise immunity of foreign sovereigns and their instrumentalities under the common law. These principles had survived the enactment of the FSIA. As to the existence of a jus cogens exception, the court referred to its finding in Smith v.

Germany (No. 04-475040, 3 January 2006), a judgment later upheld by this Court in Grosz v. France (dec.), no.\u00a014717/06, 16 June 2009.",

The applicant had argued that there was, under customary international law, a jus cogens exception to the rules on State immunity. The court accepted that there was evidence of a trend in the future development of international law towards the limitation of State immunity before foreign courts in cases of alleged human rights violations. However, the evidence was not demonstrative of general State practice recognised as a law and thus creating such a rule of international customary law.",

It concluded that the legal doctrine and case-law no longer unanimously confirmed that residual ratione materiae immunity covered all acts committed while in office where allegations of serious violations of human rights had been made.

The fact that the act of a State official was attributable to the State itself as a matter of international law did not mean that the State alone was responsible for the act as a matter of municipal law. There were many instances where damages for a civil wrong in municipal law and reparation against a State for an internationally wrongful act had been pursued simultaneously. The assumption in the House of Lords appeared to have been that the purpose of the law of immunity was to provide a procedural defence to the forum State\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over any act which, in international law, would be attributable to the State. This was an unorthodox and disquieting justification for State immunity. It was clear from the Draft Articles on State Responsibility that the definition of State was solely for the purpose of attribution and not for any other reason. This was demonstrated by the fact that a breach of contract by a State organ constitutes an act of the State for the purposes of State responsibility, pursuant to the Draft Articles, but conduct related to commercial activities does not generally attract State immunity in civil proceedings, pursuant to the broadly accepted jure gestionis exception to that principle. Similarly, acts of torture committed on the territory of the forum State engaged State responsibility but did not benefit from State immunity. Further, the applicants emphasised that there was no obligation on States in international law to satisfy a judgment properly rendered against their individual officials. There were therefore no grounds for contending that an action against an official in these circumstances indirectly impleaded the State itself. Damages awarded in domestic proceedings would be taken into account by an international tribunal in its evaluation of appropriate remedies, to prevent double recovery.",

The dichotomy was not between official acts and private acts, but between official acts entitled to State immunity, and official acts not so entitled. The applicants disputed the suggestion that there was an inconsistency between this approach and the definition of torture in the Convention against Torture: Article 1 of that Convention was the gateway to the primary obligations under the Convention against Torture; it was not a rule of attribution for the purposes of State responsibility. The applicants pointed to a series of cases supporting the proposition that, where a State official engaged in acts amounting to a violation of a peremptory norm, there was no immunity from jurisdiction (citing, inter alia, Prefecture of Voiotia, Ferrini and Furund\u017eija, all cited above). This approach was particularly clear in the United States (citing, inter alia, Fil\u00e1rtiga and Samantar, cited above). The recent judgment of the ICJ in Germany v. Italy, cited above, was only relevant to claims against the State itself: it had no application to the applicants\u2019 claims against State officials. As regards the rejection of a jus cogens exception by the ICJ in that case, the applicants criticised the judgment for the lack of any real engagement with the actual principles underlying the doctrine of State immunity. They also criticised the court for its formalistic approach to the question of the alleged conflict between jus cogens rules and the rule of State immunity and invited this Court to decline to follow the ICJ\u2019s example in deciding how to strike the balance between the two sets of norms in the context of Article 6.",

The applicants referred to the French Ould Dah case, where civil parties in criminal proceedings were awarded compensation and the question of immunity was not considered. Furthermore, the applicants contended that it would be inconsistent to suggest that criminal responsibility was abrogated by the Convention against Torture but not civil. Article 4 \u00a7 2 of that Convention required States to make the offence of torture punishable by appropriate penalties, which clearly encompassed the payment of compensation, and Article 14 on compensation was not territorially limited. The proposal during the negotiations to limit Article 14 by reference to territory under a State\u2019s jurisdiction had been deleted from the final version of the text and, according to the applicants, the clear implication was that no territorial limitation was intended. Thus, principles of State immunity could not prohibit the courts of the forum State from ordering a foreign official to pay compensation to victims of torture.",

They argued that there was a margin of appreciation as regards access to a court, which permitted States to act on their own views, provided that they were reasonably tenable, as to the extent of their obligations under public international law. In the present case, it could not be said that the approach of the United Kingdom conflicted with general principles of international law or fell outside any generally accepted international standards. The Government distinguished Waite and Kennedy, cited above, in so far as it required examination of the alternative means of redress on the ground that there was an important difference between cases involving the immunity of international organisations in which there was no alternative forum, and cases of State immunity where jurisdiction over a particular claim lay with another State. A municipal court could not, contrary to the rules of customary international law, create an exception to State immunity in order to remedy the substantive failing of a foreign court which had jurisdiction but chose not to exercise it.

The question, therefore, was not whether State immunity extended to such officials, but whether the official was part of the State such that State immunity automatically applied. Acts of State officials acting in that capacity were not attributable to them personally but only to the State. There was therefore a symmetry between the international law on State immunity and that on State responsibility. The 1978 Act reflected obligations owed by the respondent State to other States under public international law. This was supported by the definition of \u201cState\u201d in international agreements, including the UN\u00a0Jurisdictional Immunities Convention and the Draft Articles on State Responsibility; in domestic legislation and case-law; and in the decision of the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in Bla\u0161ki\u0107. Accordingly, if an act was attributable to the State so that the State bore responsibility for it on the international plane, the same act was to be treated as the State\u2019s act for the purposes of the international law right of State immunity in proceedings in a municipal court. This reflected the practical reality of the situation. If the official of the State was sued in the domestic courts of another State for acts performed in the exercise of his official functions, then, in practice, the State was indirectly impleaded, for not only were its acts called into question but it would be expected to satisfy any award of damages and, in all probability, would be the only source from which such an award of damages could be satisfied.",

The argument was unsound for several reasons. Firstly, the rule of State immunity did not authorise or condone torture and was therefore not incompatible with the prohibition of torture. It merely diverted any breach to a different method of settlement. Secondly, the argument had been rejected whenever it had been raised before an international court (citing, inter alia, the \u201cArrest Warrant\u201d case and AlAdsani, cited above). Thirdly, the question whether there ought to be State immunity for torture had been raised in the negotiations on the UN\u00a0Jurisdictional Immunities Convention and it had been decided that based on the current state of customary international law no exception could be made. Lastly, the argument had been rejected by most national courts which had been faced with the question (citing, inter alia, Bucheron, Siderman de Blake, Princz and Bouzari, all cited above). Although some national courts in Greece and Italy had accepted the jus cogens argument, these cases were not persuasive and did not establish an accepted generalised practice in international law. Reliance on isolated judgments was not enough to establish a change in customary law. This view was endorsed by the ICJ in its Germany v. Italy judgment, which was carefully reasoned and based on an extensive review and analysis of State practice. The Government added that case-law in the United States, where jurisdiction had been asserted over major violations of international law perpetrated by non-nationals overseas, did not express principles widely shared and observed among other nations.",

Secondly, in the House of Lords judgment in Pinochet (No.\u00a03) the majority reasoned that there was no immunity in respect of criminal prosecution for torture on the basis of the Convention against Torture and the fact that all three countries involved in that case were parties to the Convention against Torture. Thirdly, criminal responsibility of the individual was not, as a matter of international law, part and parcel of the responsibility of the State but something which was separate from that responsibility. Finally, civil liability for acts performed in an official character was necessarily bound up with the responsibility of the State itself as, in practice, the State could be expected to meet any award of damages made against the official and the satisfaction of any such award of damages would, in its turn, affect the liability of the State to make compensation in any proceedings which might be taken against it.

The purpose of immunity ratione materiae was to prevent suits against State officials when they incurred no independent responsibility but merely acted as the mouthpiece of the State. That aim did not apply where torture was alleged, as it fell within the personal responsibility of the official.

While the Court is not formally bound to follow its previous judgments, it is in the interests of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law that it should not depart, without good reason, from precedents laid down in previous cases (see, for example, Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2002VI; Scoppola v.

If it were otherwise, State immunity could always be circumvented by suing named officials. This pragmatic understanding is reflected by the definition of \u201cState\u201d in the UN Jurisdictional Immunities Convention of 2004 (see paragraph 76 above), which provides that the term includes representatives of the State acting in that capacity. The ILC Special Rapporteur, in his second report, said that it was \u201cfairly widely recognised\u201d that immunity of State officials was \u201cthe norm\u201d, and that the absence of immunity in a particular case would depend on establishing the existence either of a special rule or of practice and opinio juris indicating that exceptions to the general rule had emerged (see paragraph 96 above).",

Thus in Propend Finance Pty Ltd v. Sing and another (1997, 111 ILR 611), the English Court of Appeal held that immunities conferred on the State pursuant to the 1978 Act must be read as affording to individual State officials \u201cprotection under the same cloak as protects the State itself\u201d (see paragraphs 42-43 above). In Canada, the Court of Appeal in Jaffe concluded that the notion of \u201cState\u201d in the SIA covered employees of the State acting in the course of their duties (see paragraph 127 above). In Fang, the High Court in New Zealand held that State immunity incidentally conferred immunity ratione materiae in claims against individuals whose conduct in the exercise of the authority of the State was called into question (see paragraph 135 above). In Zhang, an Australian Court of Appeal held that individual officers were covered by Australia\u2019s Immunities Act since they were entitled to immunity at common law and this had not been changed by the Act (see paragraph 138 above). Although the US Supreme Court in Samantar held that officials did not fall under the notion of \u201cState\u201d within the meaning of the FSIA, it clarified that their immunities were governed by common law, as the statute was deemed to be only a partial codification of immunity rules in the United States (see paragraph 122 above). The Court of Appeals (Fourth Circuit) subsequently accepted that, in principle, State officials could enjoy immunity for acts performed in the course of their employment by the State (see paragraphs\u00a012224 above). In Bla\u0161ki\u0107, the ICTY described State officials acting in their official capacity as \u201cmere instruments of a State\u201d and explained that they enjoyed \u201cfunctional immunity\u201d (see paragraph 81 above). In Djibouti v. France, the ICJ referred to the possibility open to the Djibouti government to claim that the acts of two State officials were its own acts, and that the officials were its organs, agencies or instrumentalities in carrying them out (see paragraphs 86-87 above).",

However, after an extensive review of the sources of international law, this reasoning was rejected by a unanimous House of Lords.

The applicants do not seek to deny that the acts of torture allegedly inflicted on them engaged the responsibility of the State of Saudi Arabia. However, it should be noted that the Draft Articles only concern the question whether a State is liable for the impugned acts, because once a State\u2019s liability has been established, the obligation to provide redress for the damage caused may arise under international law. There is no doubt that individuals may in certain circumstances also be personally liable for wrongful acts which engage the State\u2019s responsibility, and that this personal liability exists alongside the State\u2019s liability for the same acts. This potential dual liability is reflected in Article 58 of the Draft Articles, which provides that the rules on attribution are without prejudice to any question of the individual responsibility under international law of any person acting on behalf of the State (see paragraph 109 above). It is clearly seen in the criminal context, where individual criminal liability for acts of torture exists alongside State responsibility (see paragraphs 4456, 61 and 15054 above). Thus, as the existence of individual criminal liability shows, even if the official nature of the acts is accepted for the purposes of State responsibility, this of itself is not conclusive as to whether, under international law, a claim for State immunity is always to be recognised in respect of the same acts.",

However, the applicants have not pointed to any decision of the ICJ or international arbitral tribunals which has stated this principle. This interpretation has furthermore been rejected by courts in both Canada and the United Kingdom (see paragraphs 15, 2930 and 128 above).

The matter is not directly addressed in the Basle Convention or in the UN Jurisdictional Immunities Convention. Prior to the adoption of the latter, a working group of the ILC acknowledged the existence of some support for the view that State officials should not be entitled to plead immunity for acts of torture committed in their own territories in either civil or criminal actions, but did not propose an amendment to the Draft Articles (see paragraph 79 above). While some movement towards the establishment of an exception to State immunity in this respect was thus identified, there was acknowledged not to be any consensus as yet. It is noteworthy that three of the fourteen States that are parties to the UN Jurisdictional Immunities Convention made declarations that the Convention was without prejudice to developments in international law concerning human rights protection (see paragraph 80 above). A 2009 resolution of the Institute of International Law urged States to consider waiving immunity where international crimes were allegedly committed by their agents; but it also declared that no ratione materiae immunity from jurisdiction, defined as including civil jurisdiction, applied with regard to international crimes. The resolution was expressed to be without prejudice to rules on attribution of acts to the State and rules on the immunity of the State itself (see paragraphs 10306 above). In Furund\u017eija (cited above), discussing the effect of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition on torture, the ICTY commented that the victim of a State measure authorising or condoning torture or absolving perpetrators \u201ccould bring a civil suit for damage in a foreign court\u201d (see paragraph 82 above); what precisely the court intended to convey by this sentence is not clear from the judgment. Judges Higgins, Kooijmans and Buergenthal, in their joint separate opinion in the ICJ \u201cArrest Warrant\u201d case, also referred to growing claims that serious international crimes could not be regarded as official acts and observed that the view was gradually finding expression in State practice (see paragraph 85 above), although in the House of Lords ruling in the present case both Lord Bingham and Lord Hoffmann offered legal reasons why they were not convinced by such claims (see, notably, paragraphs 30 and 35 above).",

There are, however, some other examples from other common-law jurisdictions. In Canada, in the case of Hashemi, the Quebec Court of Appeal found that the SIA applied to individual agents of a foreign State even in a case concerning allegations of torture. It relied on the definition of torture in the Convention against Torture, its previous ruling in Jaffe and Lord Hoffmann\u2019s opinion in the House of Lords in the applicants\u2019 case (see paragraphs\u00a012933 above). However, the case is currently pending before the Supreme Court (see paragraph 134 above). In New Zealand, the High Court in Fang also relied on the House of Lords judgment in the applicants\u2019 case to reject the arguments in favour of an exception to State immunity in cases against State officials for torture, considering it inappropriate for the courts of New Zealand to \u201ctake the lead\u201d in recognising new trends in international law (see paragraph 13536 above). In Australia, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in Zhang refused to accept the argument that jus cogens violations could not be official acts for the purpose of State immunity, relying on the unambiguous nature of the national legislation and the Australian courts\u2019 obligation to give effect to that law (see paragraphs\u00a013839 above).",

Following the Court of Appeals finding in Chuidian that the term \u201cState\u201d in the FSIA could cover officials but that the legislation would not shield an official acting beyond the scope of his authority, federal district courts have denied immunity in cases involving torture on the basis that the acts could not be considered as falling within the scope of the officials\u2019 lawful authority (see paragraph 119 above). Subsequent courts of appeals in Belhas and Matar granted immunity ratione materiae in cases concerning alleged violations of jus cogens norms (see paragraphs 12021 above). However, the authority of these judgments is now in doubt following the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent finding in Samantar that the FSIA did not extend to State officials at all and that the matter was governed solely by common law (see paragraph 122 above). The recent judgment of the Court of Appeals concerning the extent of common-law immunities in Samantar denied immunity ratione materiae to State officials on the ground that jus cogens violations were not legitimate official acts (see paragraphs 12224 above). At the date of adoption of the present judgment, the matter was pending before the Supreme Court (see paragraph\u00a0125 above).",

In Pinochet (No.\u00a03), Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Hutton considered there to be strong grounds for saying that following the entry into force of the Convention against Torture the implementation of torture could not be a State function (see paragraphs 4748 and 51 above), although this was not the approach preferred by the other judges in the case (see, in particular, the opinion of Lord Hope at paragraph 49 above). In Bouterse, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal held that the commission of very serious offences (in this case, torture) could not be considered to be one of the official duties of a Head of State (see paragraph 151 above). The matter was discussed by the Swiss Federal Criminal Court in A. v. Attorney General and Others, although the rejection of the immunity plea did not directly rest on a finding that torture could not be an \u201cofficial act\u201d (see paragraphs\u00a015253 above). Mr Kolodkin, appointed as Special Rapporteur by the ILC in the context of its study of the immunity of State officials from foreign criminal jurisdiction, referred in his second report to the \u201cfairly widespread\u201d view that grave crimes under international law could not be considered as acts performed in an official capacity (see paragraph 99 above). However, the statement did not meet with unanimous agreement in the ILC and further comment on the issue is expected from the new Special Rapporteur, Ms\u00a0Hern\u00e1ndez, by 2014 (see paragraph 100 above). It is clear that in light of the possibility for victims in some States to lodge a civil claim for damages in the context of criminal proceedings, any difference in the approach to immunity ratione materiae between civil and criminal cases will have an impact on the degree to which civil compensation is available in the different States. However, while this is a matter which no doubt requires some further reflection in the context of judicial decisions on immunity or activities of international law bodies, it is not in itself sufficient reason for this Court to find that the grant of immunity in the present case did not reflect generally recognised rules of public international law.",

Taking the applicants\u2019 arguments at their strongest, there is evidence of recent debate surrounding the understanding of the definition of torture in the Convention against Torture; the interaction between State immunity and the rules on attribution in the Draft Articles on State Responsibility; and the scope of Article 14 of the Convention against Torture (see paragraphs\u00a020608 above). However, State practice on the question is in a state of flux, with evidence of both the grant and the refusal of immunity ratione materiae in such cases. At least two cases on the question are pending before national Supreme Courts: one in the United States and the other in Canada (see paragraphs 125 and 134 above).

In a lengthy and comprehensive judgment (see paragraphs 2438 above), it concluded that customary international law did not admit of any exception \u2013 regarding allegations of conduct amounting to torture \u2013 to the general rule of immunity ratione materiae for State officials in the sphere of civil claims where immunity is enjoyed by the State itself. The findings of the House of Lords were neither manifestly erroneous nor arbitrary, but were based on extensive references to international-law materials and consideration of the applicants\u2019 legal arguments and the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which had found in the applicants\u2019 favour. Other national courts have examined in detail the findings of the House of Lords in its 2006 judgment and have considered those findings to be highly persuasive (see paragraphs 13133 and 135 above).",

In that regard I disagree with the somewhat declaratory nature of the majority\u2019s following findings: \u201cthe immunity which is applied in a case against State officials remains \u2018State\u2019 immunity: it is invoked by the State and can be waived by the State. Where, as in the present case, the grant of immunity ratione materiae to officials was intended to comply with international law on State immunity, then, as in the case where immunity is granted to the State itself, the aim of the limitation on access to a court is legitimate\u201d (see paragraph\u00a0200).",

This appears to suggest that torture is by definition an act exercised on behalf of the State. That is a far cry from all international standards, which not only analyse it as a personal act, but require the States to identify and punish the individual perpetrators of torture \u2013 contrary to the \u201cpragmatic understanding\u201d of the majority that \u201c[i]f it were otherwise, State immunity could always be circumvented by suing named officials\u201d.
