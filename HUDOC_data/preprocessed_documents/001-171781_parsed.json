The Government provided no comment whatsoever in this regard, nor did they refer to any relevant domestic case-law. In view of that, and similarly to the remedies provided for in the General Administrative Proceedings Act and the Administrative Dispute Act, the Court considers that the request for review could have been of little use to the applicants given that the Administrative Court in principle ruled within the statutory time-limits. While a request for review could have perhaps slightly expedited only that particular part of the proceedings on those few occasions when the Administrative Court failed to rule within the said limits, in any event it could not have expedited the proceedings ongoing before various administrative bodies beforehand, nor could it have prevented the repeated remittals of the case and the consequent overall delay, which is the issue in the present case. As noted above the Government offered no comment or case-law to the contrary. In view of that, the Court cannot but conclude that, whereas the said remedy could be used in order to expedite only the proceedings before the Administrative Court itself, that is an administrative dispute (u upravnom sporu) (see Vukeli\u0107 v. Montenegro, no. 58258/09, \u00a7 85, 4 June 2013), it cannot be used and hence considered an effective domestic remedy in respect of the part of the proceedings that are ongoing before various administrative bodies beforehand.",
