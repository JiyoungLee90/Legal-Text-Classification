Furthermore, in their submission, the restriction imposed on the applicant\u2019s access to a lawyer had not infringed his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention. Referring to the case-law of the Court (see, in particular, Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275; John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I; Averill v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a036408/97, ECHR 2000VI; Magee v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a028135/95, ECHR 2000VI; and Brennan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a039846/98, ECHR 2001X), they maintained that in assessing whether or not the trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings.

Thus, Article 6 \u2013\u00a0especially paragraph 3 thereof \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (see Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 36). As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention is one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 37, and Brennan, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

Nevertheless, Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) does not specify the manner of exercising this right. It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court\u2019s task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial. In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to \u201cguarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\u201d and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused (see Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

However, this right has so far been considered capable of being subject to restrictions for good cause. The question, in each case, has therefore been whether the restriction was justified and, if so, whether, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, it has not deprived the accused of a fair hearing, for even a justified restriction is capable of doing so in certain circumstances (see John Murray, cited above, \u00a7 63; Brennan, cited above, \u00a7 45; and Magee, cited above, \u00a7 44).",

Austria, no.\u00a09300/81, Commission\u2019s report of 12 July 1984, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 96). At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2006IX, and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, \u00a7 51, 2 August 2005). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see, mutatis mutandis, Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 101). In this connection, the Court also notes the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) (see paragraphs 3940 above), in which the CPT repeatedly stated that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies.",

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Magee, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044).

As a result, he did not have access to a lawyer when he made his statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively. Thus, no other justification was given for denying the applicant access to a lawyer than the fact that this was provided for on a systematic basis by the relevant legal provisions. As such, this already falls short of the requirements of Article 6 in this respect, as set out at paragraph 52 above.",

It is also noted that the applicant repeatedly denied the content of his statement to the police, both at the trial and on appeal. However, as is apparent from the case file, the investigation had in large part been completed before the applicant appeared before the investigating judge on 1 June 2001. Moreover, not only did the \u0130zmir State Security Court not take a stance on the admissibility of the applicant\u2019s statements made in police custody before going on to examine the merits of the case, it also used the statement to the police as the main evidence on which to convict him, despite his denial of its accuracy (see paragraph 23 above). In this connection, the Court observes that in convicting the applicant, the \u0130zmir State Security Court in fact used the evidence before it to confirm the applicant\u2019s statement to the police. This evidence included the expert\u2019s report dated 1 June 2001 and the statements of the other accused to the police and the public prosecutor. In this respect, however, the Court finds it striking that the expert\u2019s report mentioned in the judgment of the first-instance court was in favour of the applicant, as it stated that it could not be established whether the handwriting on the banner matched the applicant\u2019s (see paragraph 15 above).

Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000). However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, a waiver of the right to take part in the trial must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2006II; Kolu, cited above, \u00a7 53; and Colozza v. Italy, 12 February 1985, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 89).

The applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03 (c) of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1, were accordingly violated on account of this lack of legal assistance.

This principle is consistent with the Court\u2019s earlier case-law and is clearly sufficient to enable the Court to reach a finding of a violation of Article 6 on the facts of the present case. However, I share the doubts of Judge Zagrebelsky as to whether, in appearing to hold that the right of access to a lawyer only arises at the moment of first interrogation, the statement of principle goes far enough. Like Judge Zagrebelsky, I consider that the Court should have used the opportunity to state in clear terms that the fairness of criminal proceedings under Article 6 requires that, as a rule, a suspect should be granted access to legal advice from the moment he is taken into police custody or pre-trial detention. It would be regrettable if the impression were to be left by the judgment that no issue could arise under Article 6 as long as a suspect was given access to a lawyer at the point when his interrogation began or that Article 6 was engaged only where the denial of access affected the fairness of the interrogation of the suspect. The denial of access to a lawyer from the outset of the detention of a suspect which, in a particular case, results in prejudice to the rights of the defence may violate Article 6 of the Convention whether or not such prejudice stems from the interrogation of the suspect.",

It thus replied to the applicant\u2019s complaint \u201cthat his defence rights had been violated in that ... he had been denied access to a lawyer while in police custody\u201d. That complaint, raised by the applicant under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c), was rightly formulated more precisely by the Court, which linked it with Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

But the fairness of proceedings against an accused person in custody also requires that he be able to obtain (and that defence counsel be able to provide) the whole wide range of services specifically associated with legal assistance, including discussion of the case, organisation of the defence, collection of evidence favourable to the accused, preparation for questioning, support to an accused in distress, checking his conditions of detention and so on.",
