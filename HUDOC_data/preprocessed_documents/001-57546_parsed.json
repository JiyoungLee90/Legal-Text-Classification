She claimed that that statement was erroneous and infringed the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) and Article 5 (paragraphs 1 and 3) (art. 5-1, art. 5-3) and Article 6 (paragraphs 1 and 2) (art. 6-1, art. 6-2) of the Convention. The court caused the conviction to \"become final\" posthumously, thereby prejudicing her as the defendant\u2019s widow with regard to the rights relied on and, in particular, entailing a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention. It was as if it were sought to obtain a final (abschliessend) conviction of the deceased by a side wind in the form of a decision as to costs although no final (rechtskr\u00e4ftig) judgment had been handed down confirming that he had committed the offences with which he was charged. The  likewise disregarded the presumption of innocence in stating that the grounds of appeal afforded no reason to suppose that the defendant would have been acquitted. It ought at most to have decided, after a summary examination of the case, that the appeal on points of law had some prospects of success, or it should have refrained from expressing a view. It was precisely for that reason that the applicant had requested an adjournment to await the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice in the appeal proceedings brought by one of the co-defendants. The court, however, had prejudged the Federal Court\u2019s decision by holding that the plea alleging a breach of substantive law again provided nothing to support the hypothesis of an acquittal: the court should have known that vital points in Mr. N\u00f6lkenbockhoff\u2019s appeal were also relied on by the co-defendant M.",

Since criminal law was based on the principle of individual guilt, it was quite simply unacceptable - and, once again, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 2 (art. 6-2) - to judge the deceased by the conduct of three of the co-defendants. In any case, the fact that those co-defendants had withdrawn their appeals on points of law could not be regarded as an admission of guilt; besides, they had held responsibilities within Stumm AG different from those of her husband.",

In support of this conclusion, the Regional Court referred in particular to his conviction at first instance, after a trial lasting more than three and a half years; the final conviction of three co-defendants and their heavy prison sentences; the submissions made by the defence on appeal, \"which afford[ed] no reason to suppose that [he] would have been acquitted had the proceedings continued\"; and the fact that the aforesaid co-defendants had withdrawn their appeals, which \"argue[d] decisively in favour of the correctness of the judgment\" delivered (see paragraph 17 above). To the extent that the proceedings had been provisionally stayed under Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 23 above), the Regional Court added, there were no grounds for ordering the Treasury to pay the necessary costs and expenses, \"because in view of the reasons given for the judgment, it would have been much more likely ... that if the proceedings had continued, the defendant would have been convicted\" (see paragraph 17 above).",

In this respect too, the instant case very clearly differs from the Minelli case, as also from the cases decided by the  on 26 March 1987 (see paragraph 27 above). The Swiss courts had directed that Mr. Minelli should bear part of the costs of the proceedings and had ordered him to pay the private prosecutors compensation in respect of their expenses (see the judgment previously cited, ibid.), thus treating him as guilty. Nothing comparable occurred in the instant case : Mrs. N\u00f6lkenbockhoff did not have to bear the costs of the proceedings but only the costs and expenses of her late husband, and she was not awarded any compensation in respect of his detention on remand. The competent courts, acting on an equitable basis and having regard to the strong suspicions which seemed to them to exist concerning Mr. N\u00f6lkenbockhoff, did not impose a sanction but merely refused to order that the said costs and expenses or any compensation should be paid out of public funds. And, as the Court has already pointed out, the Convention - more particularly Article 6 \u00a7 2 (art. 6-2) - does not oblige the Contracting States, where a prosecution has been discontinued, to indemnify a person \"charged with a criminal offence\" for any detriment he may have suffered.",
