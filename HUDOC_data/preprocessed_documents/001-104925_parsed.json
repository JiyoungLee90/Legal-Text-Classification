In this regard, the Court firstly observes that the criminal case at issue was a complex one. The Court takes note of the seriousness of the charges brought against the applicant. A large amount of evidence had to be examined in the course of the proceedings. The complexity of the case thus undoubtedly prolonged its examination and contributed to the length of the applicant\u2019s detention (see, by way of comparison, Dudek, cited above, \u00a7 36).",

The applicant was committed to trial on 31\u00a0January\u00a02007 and the trial ended with his conviction on 3 October 2008, when the applicant was also released.

The Court accepts that a certain amount of time was necessary for the trial court to prepare the trial. In view of the volume of the case file and the large number of relevant documents in it, the Court accepts that the fact that the first hearings were scheduled for July 2007, about five months after the indictment had been lodged, appears reasonable in the circumstances. These hearings were adjourned at the request of the applicant\u2019s defence counsel, since the applicant had appointed new defence counsel shortly before the beginning of the hearings. The Court therefore accepts that the adjournment of the July hearings was attributable to the applicant and benefited his defence rights.",
