The judgment of the Berlin Court of Appeal of 20\u00a0November 1990 confirms this assertion. In fact, the German court clearly stated that, in accordance with the \u201ctacit legal choice of the parties\u201d (stillschweigende Rechtswahl der Parteien), German substantive law was subsidiary to the contract, regard being had, among others factors, to the choice of the German courts as the courts with jurisdiction to rule on any disputes arising out of the contract and the choice of the German Federal Travel Expenses Act (Bundesreisekostengesetz) as the law regulating the payment of travel costs. In accordance with German substantive law, the Berlin Court of Appeal rejected the claim for payment of DM 197,196 in respect of construction plans, travel expenses and tender documents (Bauaufnahmen, Reisekosten and Ausschreibungsunterlagen) as unfounded (nicht begr\u00fcndet) and provisionally rejected two interim claims for payment (Zwischenrechnungen) in the amount of DM 638,803 on the grounds that the sums were not yet due (mangels F\u00e4lligkeit jedenfalls zur Zeit nicht begr\u00fcndet). The court concluded that the applicant had not submitted a final claim for payment (Schlussrechnung) and that the interim claims submitted could not be recognised as a final claim (Ihre Zwischenrechnungen sind nicht als Schlussrechnung anzuerkennen). This judgment became res judicata.",

Thus, the Turkish courts had no competence to rule on this new dispute, which concerned the applicant\u2019s final claim for payment. Nor could they even enforce the previous judgment of the  court of 20\u00a0November 1990, since it was obviously not a final and enforceable judgment. Still less could they consider that judgment as \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of the existence of a final fee owed to the applicant by the German authorities. In other words, section 42 of the Turkish Private International Law and Procedures Act was not applicable. The unavoidable conclusion to be drawn from the above is that there were no legal grounds for the Turkish courts to assess the applicant\u2019s new claim under the Turkish Code of Obligations and find it time-barred.",

This applies in particular to the interpretation by the courts of rules of a procedural nature such as time-limits (see Rodoplu v. Turkey, no. 41665/02, \u00a7 23, 23 January 2007).",
