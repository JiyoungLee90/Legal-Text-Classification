At the same time, the delay caused by these actions cannot be attributed to the State when determining whether the proceedings lasted longer than the \u201creasonable time\u201d (see Eckle v.

The Court is nevertheless hesitant to attribute decisive importance to this delay. The applicant\u2019s renewed motions had no effect on the schedule of hearings, and the courts dealt with the motions within a few months.
