However, his role in the proceedings was only to represent his company and not to act on his own behalf. The Government disagreed with the Court\u2019s position in Ankarcrona v. Sweden ((dec.), no. 35178/97, ECHR 2000-VI) and maintained that a limited liability company had its own legal personality and provided limited liability to its owners who could be liable for its obligations only in extreme circumstances leading to the piercing of the corporate veil. The same applied to limited companies which were owned by one shareholder only. As a general remark, the Government also stated that any compensation awarded to the owner would have an effect only in his personal sphere and would not mean anything for the company, which could theoretically also cause detriment to the company\u2019s creditors. One could not therefore say that there was no potential conflict of interest between a limited liability company and its only shareholder. While the Court\u2019s position in Ankarcrona v. Sweden could perhaps be acceptable in respect of unlimited companies, it could not be accepted in respect of companies with limited liability for the owners.",

There must, however, be a sufficiently direct link between the applicant and the harm which he considers he has sustained on account of the alleged violation (Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. , no. 62543/00, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2004III). The Court further reiterates that where the acts or omissions complained of affect a company, the application should in principle be brought by that company. Disregarding a company\u2019s legal personality as regards the question of being a \u201cvictim\u201d will be justified only in exceptional circumstances (see, among others, Agrotexim and Others v.\u00a0Greece, 24 October 1995, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 330A). However, the sole owner of a company can claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in so far as the impugned measures taken in respect of his company are concerned, because in the case of a sole owner there is no risk of differences of opinion among shareholders or between shareholders and a board of directors as to the reality of infringement of Convention rights or to the most appropriate way of reacting to such an infringement (see Ankarcrona, cited above; Nosov v. Russia (dec) no.\u00a030877/02, 20 October 2005; and Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-126, ECHR 2007XII (extracts)).",

The Court notes that while the applicant did not claim that there were any obstacles for the company to apply to the Court, it is also not in dispute between the parties that the applicant was the sole owner and the director of the company. Having regard to the case-law on the issue, which also concerns companies with limited liability (see paragraph 25 above), and since the Government failed to establish that in the present case there existed competing interests between the applicant on the one hand and any other person or entity on the other (see, by contrast, Vesel\u00e1 and Loyka v.\u00a0Slovakia (dec.), no. 54811/00, 13 December 2005), the Court concludes that the applicant could reasonably claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.

In the absence of any plausible arguments as to why these remedies would be ineffective with respect to the enforcement proceedings, the Court finds that this part of the application must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

While accepting that there can be cases in which there exists a conflict of interest between the company as such and the owner and where there would be a necessity to recognize the standing of the owner as an applicant in his own right, separate from that of the company, I fail to see the need for it in a case like the one before us.
