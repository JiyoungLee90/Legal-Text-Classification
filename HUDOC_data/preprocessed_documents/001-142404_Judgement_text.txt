The case originated in an application (no. 54244/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr László Palásti (“the applicant”), on 15 September 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr G. Révész, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 17 October 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Budapest.
On 16 June 1998 criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant and his associates for embezzlement and other offences.
On 7 June 2002 a bill of indictment was preferred.
A first instance judgment was adopted on 17 November 2009. The Budapest XX/XXI/XXIII District Court took into account as a mitigating factor the lapse of time and imposed only a fine.
This judgment was quashed on appeal.
In the resumed proceedings, a first-instance judgment was adopted afresh, in which the lapse of time was again appreciated as a mitigating factor.
This judgment was also quashed on appeal.
The case was then resumed before the Budapest High Court. On 23 April 2013 this court convicted the applicant and imposed only a fine, holding that the lapse of time was an important mitigating factor.
An appeal by the public prosecutor is currently pending before the Budapest Court of Appeal.
