With particular reference to the concept of behaviour contra bonos mores, the Government accepted that the power was broadly defined, but claimed that the breadth was necessary to meet the aims of the power, and sufficient to meet the requirements of the Convention. They stated that the power to bind over to be of good behaviour gave magistrates a vital tool in controlling anti-social behaviour which had the potential to escalate into criminal conduct. They also noted that the breadth of the definition facilitated the administration of justice as social standards altered and public perception of acceptable behaviour changed. The Government disagreed with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that there was no objective element to help a citizen regulate his conduct: they pointed to the Chorherr case, where an administrative offence of causing \u201ca breach of the peace by conduct likely to cause annoyance\u201d fell within the scope of the concept of \u201cprescribed by law\u201d (Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-B, pp. 35-36, \u00a7 25). They also pointed to the test under English law of whether a person had acted \u201cdishonestly\u201d for the purpose of the Theft Acts 1968 and 1978 which was, at least in part, the standard of ordinary reasonable and honest people (R. v. Ghosh [1982] Queen\u2019s Bench Reports 1053), and to the test for whether a publication was defamatory, namely whether the statement concerned would lower a person in the opinion of right-thinking members of society. Finally, the Government submitted that, on the facts of the case, the applicants should have known that what they had done was contra bonos mores and they should have known what they should do to avoid such behaviour in the future: they had acted in a way intended to disrupt the lawful activities of others, and should not have been in any doubt that their behaviour was unlawful and should not be repeated. The Government recalled that the Court was concerned with the case before it, rather than the compatibility of domestic law with the Convention in abstracto.",

They were avowed hunt saboteurs and as such they deliberately tried seriously to disturb other people\u2019s lawfully organised pleasure and leisure activity or even make it impossible.

In the Steel and Others case the Court was satisfied that binding-over orders had been imposed after a finding that the applicants had committed a breach of the peace, the elements of which \u2013 according to the Court\u2019s findings \u2013 \u201cwere adequately defined by English law\u201d (see the Steel and Others judgment, p.\u00a02739, \u00a7 75).

It is true that the requirement is broadly defined, but taking into account the nature of the disturbance and the limited number of offenders, the institution of binding over to be of good behaviour imposed an unmistakable obligation on the applicants, namely to refrain from any offensive and deliberate action which could disturb the lawfully organised activity of others engaged in fox hunting. In my view, the \u201ckeep the peace or be of good behaviour\u201d obligation has to be interpreted in the light of the specific anti-social behaviour committed by the applicants. In this context, I think that the binding-over requirement was foreseeable and enabled the applicants to a reasonable extent to behave accordingly.",
