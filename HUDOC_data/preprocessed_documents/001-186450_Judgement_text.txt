The case originated in an application (no. 27228/14) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Mr Ivan Kobaš (“the applicant”), on 3 April 2014.
The applicant was represented by Ms D. Vidović, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.
The applicant alleged that he had not had a fair trial in that the session of the appeal panel in the criminal proceedings against him on charges of causing a road accident had been held in his absence, contrary to Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention.
On 21 April 2016 the complaint concerning the applicant’s absence from the session of the appeal panel was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Županja.
On 5 July 2011 the applicant was indicted before the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court (Općinski kazneni sud u Zagrebu) on charges of causing a road accident under Article 272 of the Criminal Code.
The applicant was tried in summary proceedings (skraćeni postupak). On 4 May 2012 the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court convicted the applicant as charged and gave him a suspended sentence of four months’ imprisonment with two years’ probation.
On 23 May 2012 the applicant appealed against his conviction and asked to be allowed to appear at the session of the appeal panel.
On 15 January 2013 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu), without informing the applicant or his lawyer, examined the case without holding a hearing. It dismissed the appeal and upheld the applicant’s conviction and sentence.
The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), complaining, inter alia, that he had not been allowed to appear at the session of the appeal panel.
On 18 September 2013 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. That decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 4 October 2013.
The relevant domestic law is set out in the judgment of Arps v. Croatia, no. 23444/12, §§ 12-15, 25 October 2016.
