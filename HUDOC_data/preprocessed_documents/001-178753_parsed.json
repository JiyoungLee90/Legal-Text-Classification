Yet he had been arrested by an investigator from the district prosecutor\u2019s office of Western Georgia, and charged by a prosecutor from the same office. His arrest and the criminal proceedings against him were therefore unlawful. Moreover, his arrest had been in breach of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 144 below). The alleged risk that he would flee was not supported by concrete evidence, and was belied by his repeated appearances before the investigating authorities and his public pledge that he would cooperate with them. Also, he had been out of Georgia many times and had not once tried to flee, including after the opening of the investigation. On the day of his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning. There had therefore been no need to detain him without a judicial warrant. The alleged risk of his obstructing the investigation was also not specifically borne out. Moreover, the investigation had already lasted several months without any instances of his having interfered with it being reported. Counsel for the applicant also invited the court to take into account the applicant\u2019s achievements in combating crime and police reform during his time in office.",

In particular, by law only acting, not former, members of the Government had to be prosecuted by the Minister of Justice rather than a regular prosecutor. The court went on to say that there was enough information to show that there\u00a0was a reasonable suspicion against the applicant and Mr Z.T. The other pre-requisites for placing the applicant in pre-trial detention were also in place. A number of investigative steps were yet to be carried out, and as was apparent from the prosecution\u2019s request, there was a risk that the applicant would tamper with the evidence or put pressure on witnesses. That was borne out, in particular, by the applicant\u2019s having already tried to put pressure on a witness against him. Another factor which suggested such a risk was that the applicant had for many years held high public office and was still an influential figure in some circles of Georgian society, especially bearing in mind that the charges against him related to his time in office. Many witnesses were former subordinates of his or people under his professional or personal influence. The court also agreed with the prosecution that there was a risk that the applicant would flee. That was borne out, in particular, by his facing serious charges and the possibility of a severe sentence.

He argued that on a proper reading of the relevant statutory provisions the Minister of Justice alone was competent to prosecute offences committed by anyone in their capacity as member of the Government, not only someone who was such a member at the time when the prosecution was being brought. He also argued that the Kutaisi City Court had erred by not examining in detail the lawfulness of his arrest. That arrest had been in breach of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in particular because on the day of the arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning. It was also hard to believe that the Kutaisi City Court, which had ruled on the prosecution\u2019s request just three or four hours after it had been made, had really studied the evidence said to give rise to a reasonable suspicion against the applicant. There were no facts or information in the case file to suggest that he had committed the offences. The lower court had also expected him to disprove the risks of flight and obstruction of justice alleged by the prosecution rather than require the prosecution to establish those risks. Its finding that the applicant had put pressure on a witness ran counter to the presumption of innocence. He had never called or threatened the head of the Border Police. The Kutaisi City Court had also disregarded the fact that in the months before his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning several times. Neither that court nor the prosecution had pointed to evidence showing that he would flee abroad. He had travelled out of Georgia many times since the investigation had been opened. The argument that his being an influential figure in some circles suggested that he could influence witnesses made it clear that he was a victim of political persecution. His character showed that there was not even a minimal risk of his fleeing, putting pressure on witnesses or destroying evidence.",

He stated, inter alia, that on\u00a04 February 2015, while in court for a pre-trial hearing in the \u201cKortebi\u201d case, he had heard one of his co-accused, Mr G.G., former deputy head of the special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and former head of the special forces of the Ministry of Prisons (see paragraphs 93 and 96 above), say that he had been one of those who had transported the applicant on\u00a014\u00a0December 2013, and that for that reason it would not be in the authorities\u2019 interests to keep him in detention for a long time. According to Mr G.Ts., that conversation had been recorded by the video camera in the courtroom, and overheard by another of the co-accused, Mr I.P. (see paragraphs\u00a096 above and 109 below). Mr G.Ts. also stated that about a month later, in March 2015, Mr G.G. and the other special-forces officers accused in the \u201cKortebi\u201d case, including Mr I.M., had been placed in a cell in Prison no. 9 adjacent to his. Mr G.Ts. had then heard Mr G.G. tell his cellmates that he and Mr I.M. had transported the applicant on 14 December 2013, and that it had been agreed with the authorities to release the specialforces officers if they agreed to give evidence against Mr I.P. and others connected with UNM in the \u201cKortebi\u201d case. (From the materials in the case file it appears that those officers, who had been charged with aggravated murder under Article 109 of the Criminal Code, were released in August 2015 under personal surety.) Mr G.Ts. had been able to hear the entire conversation through the wall as they had talked in loud voices. Mr\u00a0G.Ts. also stated that during his stay in Prison no. 9 a prison officer had told him about the applicant\u2019s removal from his cell. When asked why he had not spoken about that earlier, Mr G.Ts. replied that it was because he had no trust in the prosecuting authorities. He also stated that he had no incentive to bend the truth in favour of the applicant as the applicant had dismissed him from his post and had caused him to be detained in connection with a fight.",

Not only should selective or politically motivated justice not take place, it should also be seen as not taking place.\u201d",

The specific points in the report highlighted by the applicant related to the criticisms, in paragraphs\u00a0222-29, of the Georgian courts\u2019 failure to give appropriate reasons regarding the credibility of the witness and other evidence against him, of the cogency of those courts\u2019 findings in relation to each of the elements of the offences of which he was convicted, for example the exact manner in which he had exceeded his powers, and of the quality of their reasoning in relation to the factors determining his sentence.",

There were, however, some aspects which raised concerns in that respect, such as the practices of transferring judges between courts, allocating cases without a fully transparent procedure, and changing judges in the course of ongoing proceedings with no explanation. Another issue was comments by public officials about ongoing criminal proceedings made in a manner implying that they had some control over the prosecuting authorities (see paragraph\u00a07 of the executive summary). Public officials had also expressed their views on the guilt of some defendants before they had been convicted, which raised an issue with regard to the presumption of innocence (see paragraph\u00a09 of the executive summary). The report also expressed concern about the courts\u2019 failure in some cases to give reasons for their decisions to order pre-trial detention or to reject requests for release, and about the lack of provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure for periodic review of pre-trial detention. That had contributed to a practice of automatic prolongation of pre-trial detention up to the maximum statutory time-limit of nine months (see paragraph 11 of the executive summary).",

However, the court went on to examine whether that had been the real aim of the decisions. It took as its starting point the presumption that the authorities had acted in good faith. But it noted four strongly worded public statements by the then president, Mr Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, made shortly before the decisions, that the licence would not be renewed because the television station was hostile to the government. Analysing those statements jointly, the court concluded that the refusal to renew the licence had in reality been meant to silence criticism of the government. Though not referring to Article 30 of the American Convention, it held that this had been a misuse of power (see Judgment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Granier et al.

The absence of a timelimit in the decisions to place the applicant in pre-trial detention, which was consistent with the Georgian courts\u2019 practice at that time, did not make that detention unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, since Article 205 \u00a7 2 of the 2010 Code made it clear that pre-trial detention could not last longer than nine months, which was a point that the applicant could easily have understood through the advice of his counsel. Moreover, under Article 206 of that Code he could at any point during those nine months have sought release on the basis that the grounds for his pre-trial detention had ceased to obtain.

The Georgian courts\u2019 practice of not fixing time-limits for pre-trial detention was in breach of the requirement of legal certainty.

Those two expressions, which overlap to an extent, refer essentially to domestic law and lay down the obligation to comply with its substantive and procedural rules (see, among other authorities, Winterwerp, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 45; Kemmache (no. 3), \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 42; K.-F. v.

That is not, however, sufficient; Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention also requires that domestic law itself be compatible with the rule of law. This in particular means that a law which permits deprivation of liberty must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application (see, among other authorities, Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a050, Reports 1996-III; J\u0117\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 56; Baranowski v. Poland, no.\u00a028358/95, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2000-III; and Kakabadze and Others v. Georgia, no.\u00a01484/07, \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 68, 2 October 2012). It also means that an arrest or detention must be compatible with the aim of Article 5 \u00a7 1, which is to prevent arbitrary deprivation of liberty (see, among other authorities, Winterwerp, \u00a7 39; J\u0117\u010dius, \u00a7 56; Baranowski, \u00a7 51; Assanidze, \u00a7 171; and Kakabadze and Others, \u00a7 63, all cited above). This presupposes, in particular, that a deprivation of liberty genuinely conforms with the purpose of the restriction permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 39; Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0May 1985, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 93; and Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013229/03, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2008).",

Its power in that respect is, however, subject to inherent limits, because even where the Convention refers to domestic law, it is in the first place for the national authorities to interpret and apply that law (see Winterwerp, \u00a7 46; Kemmache (no.\u00a03), \u00a7 37; and Lukanov, \u00a7 41, all cited above).",

Accordingly, she answered the first question directly and the second one implicitly. The Court does not find that her findings on those two points, which should not be revisited with the benefit of hindsight, were arbitrary or patently in breach of Article 171 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Whilst a fuller explanation of why the risk of the applicant\u2019s fleeing was sufficiently serious and could not be averted otherwise than by arresting him would have been desirable, nothing suggests that the level of detail of the reasons set forth in the record of the applicant\u2019s arrest clearly fell short of the requirements of Georgian law.",

Georgian law provided a clear basis for the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention and itself limited its duration. Admittedly, in three judgments the Court has said that if a national court does not fix the duration of pre-trial detention, that gives rise to uncertainty even if its maximum is clear from domestic law (see Lutsenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 6492/11, \u00a7 73, 3 July 2012; Gal, cited above, \u00a7 37; and Kleutin v. Ukraine, no. 5911/05, \u00a7 105, 23 June 2016). But those rulings must be understood in context. In all three cases the national courts had also failed to give even minimally cogent reasons for ordering pre-trial detention. They are similar to several cases in which the Court found a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention owing to the combination of a lack of any reasons for ordering pre-trial detention and a failure to fix its duration (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7\u00a7 136-37, ECHR 2005-X (extracts); Vladimir Solovyev v. Russia, no. 2708/02, \u00a7\u00a7 95-98, 24 May 2007; Gubkin v. Russia, no. 36941/02, \u00a7\u00a7 111-14, 23 April 2009; Arutyunyan v. Russia, no. 48977/09, \u00a7\u00a7 92-93, 10 January 2012; and Pletmentsev v. Russia, no. 4157/04, \u00a7 43, 27 June 2013, with further references). Those judgments should not therefore be read as laying down a requirement under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for the national courts to fix the duration of pre-trial detention in their decisions regardless of how the matter is regulated in domestic law. All that this provision requires is rules that are foreseeable in their application.",

The first time was on 28 May 2013, six days after he was first placed in pre-trial detention (see paragraph 56 above). Those charges, though leading to a separate decision on 30 May 2013 by the Tbilisi City Court to place him in pre-trial detention (ibid.), did not serve as a basis for keeping him in such detention for longer than nine months, as he was convicted in the criminal case under consideration here less than nine months after his arrest. The second time was on 24 June 2013, one month and five days after he was first placed in pre-trial detention (see paragraph\u00a057 above). Those charges did not, however, become a basis for keeping the applicant in pre-trial detention, as the Tbilisi City Court turned down the prosecution\u2019s request to that effect (ibid.). All those factors, and in particular the relatively short interval between bringing the initial and the subsequent charges, make it hard to see those subsequent charges as an expedient on the part of the prosecuting authorities to circumvent the statutory rule capping the amount of time that the applicant could be kept in pre-trial detention.",

The initial decisions had endorsed both reasons cited by the prosecution for placing the applicant in custody: the risk that he would flee and the risk that he would obstruct the proceedings. The latter risk had been substantiated by reference to the applicant\u2019s former high position and by his conduct during the incident of 30 November 2012. The former risk had been borne out by the applicant\u2019s possession of a fake passport, his wife\u2019s hasty departure abroad on the day he had been summoned for questioning, and the discovery of large sums of cash in his flat.

Pluralism, free elections and political parties were key among those values. That was particularly relevant in this case, in which criminal proceedings had been used to prevent a major opposition politician from taking part in the political process. The role of Article\u00a018 was to prevent such abuses. The question how complaints under that provision were to be made out had been answered inconsistently by the Court in its case-law. Divergences could be detected in particular with respect to the standard of proof and the types of evidence capable of showing an ulterior purpose. Those points had to be resolved in a flexible and realistic way, for instance by requiring applicants to make a prima facie case and then shifting the burden of proof to the Government, or by taking account of the broader context. In cases in which the authorities had pursued more than one purpose, the presence of even one purpose not prescribed by the Convention was sufficient to give rise to a breach.",

The statements by prison officers during the internal inquiry had been very brief and formulaic. Neither Mr\u00a0O.P. nor Mr D.D., the main protagonists, had been interviewed in the course of that inquiry. Nor had any attempt been made to take the applicant to Mr D.D.\u2019s office in order to check his assertion that he could recognise it. It was odd that in their statements gathered during the criminal investigation all the prison officers had been able, without referring to contemporaneous records, to recall their movements and actions on a particular day two and a half years earlier; that called their credibility into question. There was evidence from three inmates, Mr G.Ts., Mr I.P. and Mr K.T., which supported the applicant\u2019s account and which had not been properly rebutted by the Government. The statements of Mr O.P. and Mr D.D. during the second investigation were not credible. There had been no attempt to verify the applicant\u2019s allegations by checking the mobile telephone records of the men in the car transporting him from Prison no. 9 to the Penitentiary Department or by carrying out an identity parade. Lastly, no proper explanation had been given for the exorbitant bonuses paid to various prison officials in December 2013.",

An International Prosecution Advisory Panel, set up in 2014 at the initiative of Georgia\u2019s Chief Public Prosecutor to review the materials in high-profile cases processed by the Georgian prosecuting authorities and consisting of three foreign criminal-justice professionals, had found the evidence in those cases sufficient to justify prosecution.

Mr Kamma had been detained on extortion charges, and the police had used his period in custody to question him about his alleged involvement in a murder.

Mr Khodorkovskiy, a wealthy businessman who was also active in politics, complained that the real aims of a criminal case against him and his related pre-trial detention were to take him out of the public arena and enable the State to appropriate the assets of his company, Yukos, one of the biggest oil producers in Russia (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 249 and 251). The Court found no breach of Article 18. It started from the general assumption that the High Contracting States\u2019 authorities acted in good faith, and held that it could only be rebutted if applicants \u201cconvincingly show[ed] that the real aim of the authorities [had] not [been] the same as that proclaimed (or as [could] be reasonably inferred from the context)\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 255). In relation to such allegations, the Court \u201capplie[d] a very exacting standard of proof\u201d, and the burden of proof remained on the applicant throughout the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7 256). The Court then found that the authorities\u2019 perception of Mr Khodorkovskiy as a serious political opponent and the benefit accruing to a State-owned company as a result of Yukos\u2019s demise were not enough to establish a breach of Article 18 because the criminal prosecution of anyone with such a high profile would benefit his opponents, and because the charges against Mr Khodorkovskiy had been genuine (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 257-58). The opinions of others \u2013 political institutions, non-governmental organisations or public figures \u2013 regarding the political motivation behind the case against him were not evidence in the legal sense (ibid., \u00a7 259). The rulings of courts which had refused to extradite associates of his to Russia, or had denied legal assistance to, issued injunctions against, or made awards against the Russian authorities in Yukos-related cases, although a strong argument, were not sufficient because the evidence and arguments before those courts could have differed from those before the Court, and because, in any event, the standard of proof applied by the Court in cases under Article 18 was very high and could be different from those applied domestically. The claim that the authorities had acted in bad faith throughout the entire criminal proceedings required \u201cincontrovertible and direct proof\u201d, which, in contrast to Gusinskiy, was lacking (ibid., \u00a7 260).",

It again held that such finding could only be based on \u201cincontrovertible and direct proof\u201d adduced by the applicant (ibid., \u00a7 663). With reference to its conclusions regarding Yukos\u2019s substantive complaints, it found that the authorities had legitimately acted to counter tax evasion and that it was for the applicant company to show that in doing so they had had an improper purpose (ibid., \u00a7 664). As in Khodorkovskiy, the Court held that the opinions of others on the political reasons behind the case against Yukos were of little evidentiary value for the purposes of Article 18. Since there was no evidence of further defects in the tax proceedings, it could not conclude that the authorities had misused them to destroy Yukos and take control of its assets (ibid., \u00a7 665).",

The cases concerned the pre-trial detention of, respectively, an opposition politician and blogger critical of the Government, and that of a well-known human-rights activist. In both cases the Court analysed the factual and legal aspects of the charges and found that the detention had not been based on a reasonable suspicion, in breach of\u00a0Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Ilgar Mammadov, \u00a7\u00a7 93-101, and Rasul Jafarov, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0121-34, both cited above).

Moreover, an approach that simply focuses on proof of bad faith does not sit well with that taken by the Court with respect to the restriction clauses in the Convention, which Article\u00a018 is intended to complement. For example, in examining whether an interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 8 to 11 is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for the pursuit of a legitimate aim, the Court always insists that its supervision is not limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State\u2019s authorities have exercised their discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith (see, for example, The Sunday Times (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7 59; Olsson v.

Its wording (\u201cshall not be applied for any purpose other than\u201d) matches closely the wording of those clauses (for example, Article 5 \u00a7 1, second sentence: \u201csave in the following cases\u201d; Article 8 \u00a7 2: \u201cno interference ... except such as ... is necessary in the interests of\u201d; Article 9 \u00a7 2: \u201cbe subject only to such limitations as ... are necessary ... in the interests of\u201d; and Article 11 \u00a7 2: \u201cNo restrictions ... other than such as ... are necessary ... in the interests of\u201d). The similarity is even clearer in the French text (Article 18: \u201cque dans le but\u201d; Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1: \u201csauf dans les cas suivants\u201d; Article 8 \u00a7 2: \u201cIl ne peut y avoir ing\u00e9rence ... que pour autant que\u201d; Article 9 \u00a7 2: \u201cd\u2019autres restrictions que celle qui\u201d; and Article 11 \u00a7 2: \u201cne peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019autres restrictions que celles qui\u201d). Since the Convention must be interpreted in a way which promotes harmony between its provisions (see, among other authorities, Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, \u00a7 68, Series A no. 28; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and\u00a065900/01, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2005-X; and A and B v. Norway [GC], nos.\u00a024130/11 and 29758/11, \u00a7 133, ECHR 2016), and since, when using the same terms, its different provisions must normally be taken to refer to the same concept (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 134 and 146, with further references), in interpreting Article 18 the Court must thus take into account its usual approach to those restriction clauses.",

In such situations, the mere presence of a purpose which does not fall within the respective restriction clause cannot of itself give rise to a breach of Article 18. There is a considerable difference between cases in which the prescribed purpose was the one that truly actuated the authorities, though they also wanted to gain some other advantage, and cases in which the prescribed purpose, while present, was in reality simply a cover enabling the authorities to attain an extraneous purpose, which was the overriding focus of their efforts. Holding that the presence of any other purpose by itself contravenes Article\u00a018 would not do justice to that fundamental difference, and would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 18, which is to prohibit the misuse of power. Indeed, it could mean that each time the Court excludes an aim or a ground pleaded by the Government under a substantive provision of the Convention, it must find a breach of Article 18, because the Government\u2019s pleadings would be proof that the authorities pursued not only the purpose that the Court accepted as legitimate, but also another one.",

In Nachova and Others (cited above, \u00a7 147), the Court further clarified that point, saying that when assessing evidence it is not bound by formulae and adopts the conclusions supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. It has also stated that it is sensitive to any potential evidentiary difficulties encountered by a party. The Court has consistently adhered to that position, applying it to complaints under various Articles of the Convention (see Baka, cited above, \u00a7 143, with further references).",

It is also true that, when it comes to allegations of ulterior purpose behind a criminal prosecution, it is hard to divorce the pre-trial detention from the criminal proceedings (see Lutsenko, \u00a7 108; Tymoshenko, \u00a7 298; and Tchankotadze, \u00a7\u00a0114, all cited above). Yet, there is no right as such under the Convention not to be criminally prosecuted (see I.J.L. and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 29522/95 and 2 others, \u00a7 101, ECHR 2000-IX; Patsuria v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 30779/04, \u00a7 42, 6 November 2007; Mustafa (Abu Hamza) v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31411/07, \u00a7 34, 18 January 2011; and International Bank for Commerce and Development AD and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 7031/05, \u00a7 129, 2 June 2016, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Artner v.

The authorities do not appear to have attempted to verify those statements by objective means, for example by obtaining the video recording from the pre-trial hearing during which Mr\u00a0G.G. was said to have spoken about his role in the events of 14 December 2013, or third-party evidence about Mr G.G.\u2019s whereabouts in the early hours of 14 December 2013. They instead focused their efforts on interviewing Mr G.G., Mr I.M. (the other special-forces officer with whom he was alleged to have acted in concert), and their former colleagues in the special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with whom they had shared a cell in Prison no. 9 (see paragraphs 110 and 111 above). The fact that they denied their involvement during those interviews is hardly surprising.",

Its reliability is somewhat weakened by Mr K.T.\u2019s previous position of subordination to the applicant, and much further still by the fact that a physical examination carried out by the investigators showed that the prison corridor could not be observed from Mr K.T.\u2019s cell because there was no gap in the door, by Mr\u00a0K.T.\u2019s reluctance to take part in the ensuing experiment which was supposed to test that point, and by the conflicting statements of all Mr\u00a0K.T.\u2019s cellmates (see paragraphs 113-115 above).",

The Minister of Prisons does not appear to have been aware of that when speaking about the case on 18 December 2013 (see paragraph\u00a070 in fine above). The deputy head of the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Prisons was equally unaware of that when he requested the footage two days later, on 20 December 2013 (see paragraph 73 above). The deputy Minister of Prisons who had been in charge of reforming the surveillance system in Georgia\u2019s prisons two years previously, in 2011, stated that the footage was kept for a month (see paragraph 77 above). Indeed, it is striking that surveillance footage from an establishment as prone to violence and accidents as a prison would be preserved for a shorter time than footage from road-traffic cameras \u2013 which was in this case still available twenty days after the alleged incident (see paragraph 84 above).",

If the restriction of his right to liberty is thus seen as a whole, it is hard to regard the attempt to use it as a means to obtain such information as its chief purpose.

To begin with, by the time the applicant was pressured to provide information about Mr Zhvania\u2019s death and Mr Saakashvili\u2019s bank accounts, the reasons for keeping him in pre-trial detention appear to have receded, which led the Court to find a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in relation to the period from 25 September 2013 onwards, which was shortly before the incident of December 2013 (see paragraphs\u00a0233-235 above). Then, at that time, December 2013, Mr\u00a0Saakashvili, who has since then become the target of several criminal investigations, had just left Georgia following the end of his term of office as President (see paragraphs 13 and 126 above). For its part, the investigation into Mr Zhvania\u2019s death, which had been renewed in late 2012, had apparently not made significant progress (see paragraph\u00a061 above). It is clear that both topics were of considerable importance for the authorities. The Government\u2019s statement at the hearing before the Grand Chamber that there was still a \u201chuge question\u201d for the applicant to answer in relation to Mr Zhvania\u2019s death is particularly telling in that regard (see paragraph\u00a061 above). At the same time, the prosecuting authorities had the power to drop all charges against the applicant at any point without judicial control, with the consequence that the courts would have had to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him (see paragraph 153 above), and thus cause him to be released from pre-trial detention, as promised to him by the Chief Public Prosecutor, Mr O.P., if he provided the requested information. The weight which the authorities attached to the matter is also apparent from the way in which the entire incident on 14 December 2013 unfolded and was later commented upon and investigated. The applicant was taken to meet with Mr O.P., who had been appointed to the post three weeks previously (see paragraph 60 above), in a covert and apparently irregular manner, in a clandestine operation carried out in the middle of the night. The authorities\u2019 initial reaction to the applicant\u2019s allegations in that respect was to issue firm denials (see paragraphs 68 and 70 above), and the ensuing inquiry and investigation were, as already noted, marred by a series of omissions from which it can be inferred that the authorities were eager that the matter should not come to light. Thus, the main protagonists, Mr O.P. and Mr D.D., were not interviewed during the inquiry but only in the course of the investigation, in September 2016, nearly three years after the events, and the crucial evidence in the case \u2013 the footage from the prison surveillance cameras \u2013 was not recovered.",

This aspect is particularly problematic for new democracies, the majority of which, more than two decades following the collapse of the Soviet Union, are still characterised by their almost invariably deeply fragile nature, with political structures that are porous to anti-democratic elements.

A lax interpretation of the legislation in order to justify pre-trial detention or its use on abusive grounds for keeping political opponents behind bars for an indefinite period of time is a highly likely prospect in those circumstances.

The only concrete indication that the judgment provides in this respect is that in certain situations, the Court will have regard to the \u201cnature and degree of reprehensibility\u201d of the alleged ulterior purpose in assessing which purpose is predominant (ibid.) and will bear in mind that the Convention was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society governed by the rule of law.

Russia (nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, 25 July 2013). Both approaches presuppose the existence of at least one Convention-compliant purpose in the government\u2019s actions. In the latter judgment, the Court stressed that the existence of a \u201chidden agenda\u201d was not enough to establish a violation of Article 18. A travesty of justice had to be demonstrated (ibid., \u00a7 906). If there is a \u201chealthy core\u201d to a case, a violation of Article 18 would be difficult to establish (ibid., \u00a7 907). As suggested by one of the leading textbooks on the Convention, the Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev case implies that \u201cthe Court is prepared to accept that a prosecution might not be completely free from a political agenda, but that such corrupting influence, if it exists, needs to have a decisive effect on matters, which it would not if the fundamental intention of the authorities had been legitimate, it being sufficient that the case against the applicants had a \u2018healthy core\u2019\u201d. The new test, even with its relaxed standard of proof and its general approach to the effect that the predominant purpose depends on all the circumstances and, in continuing situations, may vary over time (see paragraphs 307-08 of the present judgment), allows and possibly accepts prosecutions with ulterior motives, primarily ones with a political agenda, in a similar manner to the \u201chealthy core\u201d approach.",

The judgment provides a detailed account of relevant international and comparative-law materials (see paragraphs 155-68 of the judgment) in relation to the concepts of \u201cmisuse of power\u201d and non-extradition for politically motivated crimes. While the notion of \u201cmisuse of power\u201d (see paragraphs\u00a0283, 303 and 306 of the judgment) is readily accepted by the Court in its interpretation of Article 18, the judgment\u2019s approach is different in relation to extradition case-law and Interpol\u2019s practice (Article 3 of the Interpol Constitution directly prohibits intervention in matters of a political nature; see paragraphs 330-31 of the judgment). It could be argued that the examination by national courts and international organisations of political motives in extradition requests differs from the Court\u2019s assessment under Article\u00a018 (see paragraph 330 of the judgment). This argument, however, is not sufficient to conclude that the findings of bodies deciding on extradition requests will never be of any relevance to the assessment under Article 18, especially in view of the meticulous and broad consideration given, for example, by various domestic courts in the member States concerned to all the circumstances of extradition cases connected to the present case involving former high-ranking officials. Extradition-related sources are relevant as they do not presuppose the innocence of a person who is being\u00a0politically persecuted. This is exactly the kind of \u201cplurality of purpose\u201d\u00a0situation with which the Court was faced in this case (see paragraphs\u00a0292-308 of the judgment). It would have been expected for the Court to explore every possible avenue in this regard. The unequivocal rejection of well-developed mechanisms of extradition law which would have assisted the Court in identifying the existence of a disguised prosecution with political motives is a lamentable choice, especially in the light of the limited guidance available in this respect.",

In other words, all the facts of the case should be analysed in the light of the applicant\u2019s complaint that the purpose of the criminal proceedings against him and his pre-trial detention had been to remove him from the political scene and to prevent him from standing in the Georgian presidential election in October 2013 (see paragraph 241 of the judgment).

Only wellfunctioning democracies can ensure separation between political and criminal responsibility. The impartiality and independence of public prosecutors and courts is the main guarantee against misuse of power. The state of the Georgian criminal justice system, however, has been a matter of concern over the years. While some progress has been acknowledged, the erosion of public trust, the lack of judicial independence (owing in particular to practices such as transferring judges between courts and allocating cases among judges without a fully transparent procedure and in a manner that leaves room for manipulation and interference), the significant role of politics in the process of filing criminal charges and selective justice have been identified as major challenges, particularly in relation to politically sensitive cases (see also paragraphs 132-37 of the judgment). In this regard, the words of the Parliamentary Assembly\u2019s Rapporteur regarding pre-trial detention are instructive: \u201cI was also given specific examples of pressure on judges [in Georgia] who refused to order pretrial detention, and of forum shopping techniques designed to ensure that requests for pretrial detention against former officials are decided by judges considered as favourably disposed by the prosecution.\u201d The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe even called for the allegations of selective justice to be addressed at the \u201csystemic level\u201d (see paragraph 132 of the judgment).

Article 18 thus contains a general warning to abstain from abuses of power. That Article could be considered as a reminder of the devastating experience of the Second World War that led drafters of the Convention to strengthen the protection of the rights of individuals vis-\u00e0-vis the State, as well as a reminder of what the main purpose of the Convention is. In my view, an interpretation of Article 18 which accepts an abuse of power would run counter to \u201cthe aim of the Council of Europe\u201d, which is \u201cthe achievement of greater unity between its members\u201d, pursued through \u201cthe maintenance and further realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d (see Preamble to the Convention).

It is only by respecting and protecting human rights and the rule of law and other democratic values that the parasitic development of undemocratic tendencies which might eventually lead to totalitarianism can be prevented.",

Similarly, according to another Latin legal maxim, when anything is prohibited, all that relates to it is also prohibited \u2013 quando aliquid prohibetur prohibetur omne, per quod devenitur ad illud. These maxims, which simply assert that if something is prohibited it cannot be allowed in by the back door, may find application in the present case. If Article 18 of the Convention were to be interpreted in such a way as to encourage the national authorities to abuse their powers by manipulating the Convention provisions dealing with lawful restrictions and using them also for ulterior or extraneous or unlawful purposes, this would not only run contrary to Articles 18 and 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, but would be a kind of negation of the Convention system as a whole, which aims to secure the effective protection of human rights.",

Lastly, what is most important is that no one can profit by what is contrary to law, and that a State cannot have a reasonable expectation of gain from unlawfulness. All the above-mentioned principles apply, in my view, not only regarding private law but also regarding public law and especially public international law, including of course the Convention.

The statement in paragraph 300 of the judgment that in some cases \u201cif the Court is satisfied that the detention was for the purpose authorised under one sub-paragraph [of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention], it normally stops there, without checking whether it also pursued another aim\u201d does not provide us with any assistance in finding a solution regarding the issue here. This is so because in the cases where the Court did not proceed to check purposes under other sub-paragraphs of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1, there was no allegation \u2013 and therefore no proof \u2013 of an ulterior purpose, but only of parallel legal purposes. Since, under the proportionality test, only legitimate aims are the benchmarks against which necessity is measured, I wonder how, with this in mind, those benchmarks can lead to the conclusion drawn in the judgment that the mere presence of an illegitimate purpose which does not fall within a restriction clause cannot of itself give rise to a breach of Article 18.

Furthermore, account must be taken of the inter-relationship between Articles 17 and 18 of the Convention, the former explicitly prohibiting the \u201cabuse of rights\u201d and the latter setting \u201climitations\u201d on the \u201cuse of restrictions on rights\u201d.",

This important qualification of the scope and content of the predominant-purpose test under Article 18 is highlighted in paragraph\u00a0307 of the judgment, where the Court rightly states that in assessing whether the purpose for a restriction was \u201cpredominant\u201d it will have regard to the \u201cnature and degree of reprehensibility of the alleged ulterior purpose, and bear in mind that the Convention was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society governed by the rule of law\u201d.",

It is true that under Article\u00a0250 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the prosecuting authorities, which were under the overall control of Mr O.P., were free to drop the charges against the applicant at any point without judicial control of that decision (see paragraph 153 of the judgment). However, there is no basis in fact, founded on evidence submitted before the Court, to conclude that the authorities were actually considering that option. On the contrary, the applicant was a high-profile defendant in whose widely publicised case the prosecuting authorities had invested considerable time and resources. We are not persuaded by the facts before us that, even if they were eager to obtain the information which the Chief Public Prosecutor pressured the applicant to provide, they were prepared to reverse their actions and drop the charges against him mid-trial, or that they were able to give him credible assurances that they would do so. Moreover, for the applicant to go free, the charges in the other criminal case against him in Tbilisi, which was even more high profile (see paragraph 56 of the judgment), would have had to be dropped as well.",

Even assuming that the removal and the attempt to obtain information from the applicant was an advantage which the authorities hoped to derive from his being in their custody, we cannot accept that his pre-trial detention, in whole or in part, was merely a cover intended to enable them to attain that purpose.",

On this basis, the majority seem to accept that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was initially, and for the first seven months, adequately justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. However, at the point in time when the applicant was removed from his cell, the predominant purpose of his detention changed and that purpose was in violation of Article 18 of the Convention.",

In fact, the Court has consistently held that \u201cArticle 5 \u00a7 1 requires ... that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness\u201d (see Mooren, cited above, \u00a7 72). As to the \u201cnotion of arbitrariness\u201d, it is a general principle established in the case-law that detention will be \u201carbitrary\u201d where, despite complying with the letter of national law, \u201cthere has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 77). It follows that, due to this delicate interrelationship between the notion of arbitrariness \u2013 as an element inherent in Article 5 \u00a7 1 \u2013 and the notion of a predominant purpose restricting Convention rights under Article 18, the finding of no violation of the former, but a violation of the latter, can in reality only arise in exceptional circumstances. Such exceptional circumstances would only occur where the threshold for the applicability of Article 18 is reached, namely, in the most serious cases of particularly reprehensible abuse of power. In our view, the present case does not fall into that category for the following reason.",

Therefore, on the facts of this particular case and bearing in mind that the majority have correctly rejected the allegation that the applicant\u2019s detention was predominantly based from the outset on a purpose that falls under Article 18, we fail to see how the removal of the applicant from the cell could have, in and of itself, constituted a shift of purpose so serious as to warrant a finding of a violation of that provision, whilst at the same time not calling into question the legality, as such, of the applicant\u2019s detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

Viewing the case through this lens, it is clear that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was therefore justified throughout under Article 5 \u00a7 1 and did not give rise to a violation of Article 18 of the Convention.",
