It is also of note that shortly after the jury had retired they asked if they might hear the recordings again and, after some discussion, the recordings were played to them. It is perhaps pertinent to observe that had Pearman himself given evidence, what would have happened if there had been a request by the jury to be reminded of his evidence is that the judge would have summarised it to them from his notebook. Playing the recordings a second time to the jury, that, submits Miss Wass [counsel for the applicant], is something that elevates the importance of the hearsay evidence there contained. There is no doubt that the recordings were important evidence in the context of the case as a whole (at least so far as we are thus persuaded) and we have come to the conclusion that permission to appeal should be granted on all grounds advanced and the hearing will proceed in due course accordingly.\u201d",

The evidence of Rita Willott (described by the judge as an extremely important witness) was not challenged and was read at the trial. She said that the man who fired the gun was aged between 20 and 30, of average build and height, and he was wearing a baseball cap. Jack Doyle, a boy aged 10, said that the gunman was wearing a baseball cap and was in his mid-30s. Gordon Raggett described the gunman as white, in his 20s, athletic and about 5 feet 10 inches, of slim build. All these descriptions fitted the Appellant and not Pearman. Against these, one witness described the gunman as not appearing to be young. Miss Wass suggested that the evidence of the age of the gunman should be discounted because of the uncertainties of ascribing an age to a man wearing a baseball cap. However, the weight of the evidence points clearly to a young man such as the Appellant rather than Pearman.

Hearsay evidence is necessarily second best evidence and it is, for that reason, much more difficult to test and to assess. The jury never sees the person whose word is being relied upon. That person cannot be asked a single exploratory question or challenging question about what he said. Those very real disadvantages of hearsay evidence, which underlay the common law rule generally excluding it, remain critical to the assessment of whether the interests of justice call for its admission. The interests of justice test will require attention to be given to the difference between an admission against interest and an accusation against someone else (R v. Y [2008] 1 Cr. App. R. 34). Before reaching the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice to admit hearsay, the trial judge must carefully consider the alternatives, which may very well include the bringing of an available but reluctant witness to court. It by no means follows in practice that a witness who has declined to make a statement will in fact refuse to give evidence if brought to court. If he may do so, then consideration will also need to be given to whether justice would be better served by putting him before the jury so that they can see him (ibid.).",

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Schatschaschwili v. Germany [GC], no. 9154/10, \u00a7 101, 15\u00a0December 2015 and Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, 16\u00a0November 2010, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victim(s) that crime is properly prosecuted (see Schatschaschwili v.\u00a0Germany, cited above, \u00a7101 and G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7\u00a0175, ECHR 2010) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and\u00a022228/06, \u00a7 118, 15 December 2011). It is also notable in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 162, and the references therein).",

Armenia, no. 8088/05, 10 April 2012). Moreover, where a witness cannot be located, the Court has held that the authorities must \u201cactively search for the witness\u201d and do \u201ceverything which was reasonable to secure the presence of the witness\u201d (Lu\u010di\u0107 v.

The present case is therefore an instance of an available but reluctant witness, not an instance of a witness unable to attend. In the light of the strict approach adopted by the Court in some previous cases, the Court is not persuaded that \u201call reasonable efforts\u201d, to use the language of Al-Khawaja and Tahery (see paragraph 58 (i) above), can be said to have been made to secure the attendance of Mr\u00a0Pearman. The trial court could have compelled his attendance at trial, even if it could not have compelled him to give evidence; and, as the applicant has pointed out, if he had been compelled to attend, even if he did exercise his right to silence (as to which, see paragraphs 43-44 above), the jury would still have been able to see him in the witness box and assess his demeanour in response to cross-examination. However, the absence of a \u201cgood reason\u201d, in the AlKhawaja and Tahery sense, for the non-attendance of Mr Pearman at the trial of the applicant, is not the end of the matter. As pointed out in Schatschaswili v. Germany (see paragraph 59 above), this is a consideration which is not of itself conclusive of the lack of fairness of a criminal trial, although it constitutes a very important factor to be weighed in the overall balance together with the other relevant considerations.",

On the contrary, the Court of Appeal considered the other incriminating evidence against the applicant to be \u201coverwhelming\u201d (that evidence is summarised at paragraphs 22-29 and 38 above).
