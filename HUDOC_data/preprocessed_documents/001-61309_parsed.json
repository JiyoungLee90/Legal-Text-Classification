The prosecution maintained that the applicant's behaviour necessitated the arrest and the length of the detention. A court session was held on 26\u00a0June 1998, in which the applicant, represented by counsel, explained inter alia that she had refused to give her name to the ticket inspector partly because she was angry, partly because he already knew her. She alleged that the police did not question her or talk to her during the arrest, during the transportation to the police station, or after the arrival to the station. She had handed over various belongings among those, she believed, various letters from public authorities bearing her name. Four police officers were heard as witnesses on 17\u00a0September 1998. The two police officers who made the arrest explained inter alia that the applicant twice had refused to give her name and address on their request, once after they had warned her that she would be arrested did she not state the data required. It had been difficult to get in touch with the applicant, who screamed and appeared hysterical. At the police station she was brought before the officer on duty and again she refused to reveal her identity. She had not been in possession of any identification. The officer who had been on duty on 11 August 1995 explained among other things that after repeated attempts to obtain the applicant's name and date of birth, he gave up and the applicant was thereafter placed in a waiting room, whereto he went at least once without success to ask her to disclose her personal data before he was off duty at 11 p.m. The officer who had been on duty on 12\u00a0August 1995 as from 6.30 a.m. stated inter alia that several times during the morning he send a colleague down to try to get the requested data from the applicant, but they only succeeded around 10.45\u00a0a.m., whereupon she was released. A note of 9 July 1996 from the Chief of Police in \u00c5rhus was submitted, of which it appeared that the applicant's case had been thoroughly talked over with the group of duty officers. It had been discussed in particular that the applicant had not been attended to by a doctor in connection with her placement in the detention cell, that she had been detained for many hours, and that no documentation existed to substantiate which steps had been taken during the evening, the night and the early morning hours in order to gain knowledge of the applicant's identity. The duty officers were ordered, in the future, to appoint at the commencement of every duty period one among them to be responsible for the detainees.",

It recalls that in the Nowicka v. Poland, cited above, the applicant was born in 1940 and detained in order that she underwent psychiatric examination in the context of a private prosecution arising out of a neighbours' dispute. In the aforementioned McVeigh and Others decision, the applicants, three men between thirty-one and fiftyeight years old, were submitted to a security check on entering Great Britain, an obligation which was introduced in order to prevent terrorism. The Commission approached their case on the basis that they were, as stated by them, innocent holidaymakers, but also accepted that their arrest was based on the examining officer's appreciation on the basis of the information available to him, that there was a necessity to examine them in greater depth than was practicable at the port, to where they had arrived from Ireland. In the above mentioned Johansen decision the applicant was a man, born in 1956, who opposed to military service as well as civilian service. In B. v France the applicant was around forty years old when he was arrested twice having respectively intervened and hindered actions of police officers as regards third persons. In the Reyntjens decision the applicant was a thirty-five year old man who, as a matter of principle, refused to carry his identity card. In the present case, the applicant refused to disclose her identity to a ticket inspector, with whom she had had a dispute as to whether or not she had travelled without a valid ticket. The police were called, but she also refused to give them her name and address. Thus, although the applicant was arrested exclusively because she refused to furnish information about her identity to the police, their motive for approaching her was related to their task being the forces of law and order. Moreover, in the Court's opinion it would leave public as well as private transportation companies powerless, should they not be able to obtain an efficient assistance by the police, when confronted with passengers, who allegedly travel without a valid ticket and who refuse to identify themselves. The Court reiterates that the applicant was 67 year old when she was arrested. However, according to the report on the arrest, the police had estimated that she was approximately sixty years old. Furthermore, as to her state of health and her hospitalisation on 12\u00a0August 1995, the Court notes in particular that it has not been established that the police at the time of the arrest were aware that she suffered from high blood pressure. Also, the Court notes that before the High Court the applicant stated that she refused to reveal her identity to the police because she was angry, and that she maintained this anger and reluctance until 10.45 a.m. on 12\u00a0August 1995. In these circumstances the Court finds that it was in accordance with the Administration of Justice Act and Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention to detain the applicant in order to establish her identity.",

                                        "content": "41.\u00a0\u00a0As regards the length of the detention, the Court reiterates that in the aforementioned Nowicka v. Poland  the Court concluded that the applicant's detention, which lasted for a total period of eighty-three days was in breach of Article 5 of the Convention. In the above mentioned McVeigh and Others decision the Commission concluded that in the exceptional context of the case there were sufficient circumstances to warrant the applicants' arrest and detention for some fortyfive hours. As to the above mentioned B. decision the French legislation at the relevant time prescribed as follows: \u201cofficers of the criminal police may, for the purpose of judicial investigations or to prevent a breach of public order, request anyone to provide proof of his identity and, if necessary, take him to a police station for this purpose. No one taken to a police station for this purpose may be held for more than six hours\u201d. The Commission considered in the view of the brevity of the period for which the applicant had been held at the police station (one and four hours respectively) that a fair balance had been struck between the need to ensure the fulfilment of the obligation and the right to liberty. The same conclusion was reached in the Reyntjens decision where the applicant was deprived of his liberty for two and a half hours. In the present case the applicant was deprived of her liberty for thirteen and a half hours. The Court notes that the police several times in vain requested that she reveal her identity in the period from 9.30 until 11.00 p.m. on 11\u00a0August 1995, and from 6.30 until 10.45 a.m. on 12 August 1995, and relying on the findings of the domestic courts, the Court is satisfied that the applicant was not in possession of any documentation, which could have revealed her identity. \u00a0Also, it notes that it appears to be common ground that no efforts were made to identify her in the period between 11.00 p.m. and 06.30 a.m. The Government allege that the reason therefor can be attributed to considerations as to the applicant's need for sleep. While accepting that such considerations may be relevant in certain circumstances, it is in the Court's opinion not established that this was so in the present case. Furthermore, the Court would be reluctant to accept that such considerations could generally be given priority over the obligation to secure that the detention did not exceed a period proportionate to the cause of the detention. The Court notes in addition, having regard to the fact that the Chief Constable of \u00c5rhus on 18\u00a0July\u00a01996 found reason to regret that the applicant during her detention had not been attended to by a doctor as promised, that the involvement of such a third person might have broken the impasse, which the communication between the police and the applicant obviously had reached. Moreover, having regard to its finding above as to the applicant and the circumstances leading to her detention, and to the fact that the applicant's failure to comply with the obligation prescribed in section\u00a0750\u00a0of the Administration of Justice Act was a minor offence, which could carry only a fine, the Court considers that her detention in any event should not have been maintained for a longer period of time. It finds that the deprivation of the applicant's liberty for thirteen and a halfhour exceeded a period proportionate to the cause of her detention.",
