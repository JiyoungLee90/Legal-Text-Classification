Since Ukraine refused to sign such a treaty with it, the transfer was not possible. The applicant\u2019s mother went so far as to initiate court proceedings against the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denouncing its lack of action, but she was not successful.",

The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012122; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).
