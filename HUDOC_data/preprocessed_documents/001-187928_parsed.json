In the absence of detailed information regarding how much personal space he had between 21 and 27\u00a0September 2011, the Court will proceed on the assumption that he had less than 3\u00a0square metres of personal space during that period. The Court notes that in such circumstances the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 137). This presumption is normally capable of being rebutted if certain factors are cumulatively met (ibid., \u00a7 138). In the present case, the Court considers that the periods during which the second applicant did not have enough personal space were short, occasional and minor, because they lasted for six and seven days at a time (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 130; compare and contrast Daktaras v. Lithuania (dec.) [Committee], no. 78123/13, \u00a7\u00a048, 3 July 2018). Moreover, the applicant was able to spend time outside and move around the Prison Hospital\u2019s premises during the day (see paragraph 10 above, and Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 138). Finally, the second applicant\u2019s other grievances were dismissed by the domestic courts, and it can be concluded that the other material conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention were appropriate, and there were no other aggravating aspects of his detention (see paragraph 9 above, and Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0138).",
