At this juncture, the Court reiterates that \u201cthe fact that a person has entered into and forms part of a State social-security system (even if a compulsory one, as in the instant case) does not necessarily mean that that system cannot be changed, either as to the conditions of eligibility of payment or as to the quantum of the benefit or pension (see, mutatis mutandis, Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a042184/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a085-89, ECHR 2010; and Richardson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a026252/08, \u00a7 17, 10 April 2012). Indeed, the Court has accepted the possibility of amendments to social-security legislation which may be adopted in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance, and also to the evolution of individual situations (see Wieczorek v. Poland, no. 18176/05, \u00a7\u00a067, 8\u00a0December 2009)\u201d (see B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy, cited above, \u00a7 88). The Court would stress that, in present-day conditions, these considerations play a primordial role in assessing complaints going to the impairment of social welfare rights; and they undoubtedly provide the State with a wide margin of appreciation in rationalising their social-security systems (see paragraph\u00a031 below). Nevertheless, the examination of proportionality of such measures cannot be dispensed with.",

Such schemes are an expression of a society\u2019s solidarity with its vulnerable members (see B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy, cited above, \u00a7 116). An important consideration is whether the applicant\u2019s right to derive benefits from the social-insurance scheme in question has been infringed in a manner resulting in the impairment of the essence of his pension rights (see B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy, cited above, \u00a7 118).",

This element is aggravated by the fact that the applicant apparently had no other significant income on which to subsist and that he belonged to a vulnerable group of disabled persons (see B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0123).",

Once again, it must be stressed that the applicant suffered the removal of two-thirds of his benefit, whereas there was no indication that he had failed to act in good faith at all times, to co-operate with the authorities or to make any relevant claims or representations (see B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0121, 125 and 126).",

It therefore finds that, notwithstanding the State\u2019s wide margin of appreciation in this field, the applicant had to bear, in the period at issue; an excessive individual burden.
