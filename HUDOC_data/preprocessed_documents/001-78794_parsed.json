The Court's task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, p.\u00a0711, \u00a7 50). In particular, \u201cas a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses\u201d (see Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp.\u00a03233, \u00a7 33). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 38-39, \u00a7 91; Bricmont v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, \u00a7 89; and Perna v.

It is true that she did not provide the court with the names of the witnesses she wanted to call, but considering the lack of time and facilities to prepare her defence (see paragraph 45 above), the Court finds it reasonable that she should not be expected to have done so immediately.
