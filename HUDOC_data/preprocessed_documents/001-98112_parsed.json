Furthermore, the periods of transmittal and transfer of the case from the prosecutor to the court and back were often not covered by any decision. The Court further notes that the relevant domestic law regulates procedural steps concerning the study of the case file, the committal proceedings and transmittals of the case for further investigation, but does not set clear rules as to which authority may prolong the defendant's detention, on what grounds and for what term. The Court has held on many occasions that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without a specific legal basis or clear rules governing their situation \u2013 with the result that they may be deprived of their liberty for an unlimited period without judicial authorisation \u2013 is incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Svershov v.

Therefore, there had been no visible signs of a change of the applicant's situation during this very short period of formal but not actual liberty. Therefore, the Court concludes that the applicant's detention both prior and after 22 August 2001 was in reality the uninterrupted period of the applicant's detention on remand under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) as a criminal suspect.
