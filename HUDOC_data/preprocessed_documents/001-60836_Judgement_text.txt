The case originated in an application (no. 31012/96) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mrs Daniela Savio (“the applicant”), on 22 February 1996.
The applicant was represented by Mr P. Giacomazzo, a lawyer practising in Padova. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, and by their co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that she had been unable to recover possession of her flat within a reasonable time. Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, she further complained about the length of the eviction proceedings.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of Italy, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government appointed Mr G. Raimondi as ad hoc judge to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 2).
On 29 June 2000 the Court declared the application admissible.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Padova.
The applicant is the owner of an apartment in Padova, which she had let to F.C.
In a registered letter of 4 July 1989, the applicant informed the tenant that she intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1991 and asked him to vacate the premises by that date.
In a writ served on the tenant on 6 September 1989, the applicant reiterated her intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Padova Magistrate.
By a decision of 19 September 1989, which was made enforceable on 26 September 1989, the Padova Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1992.
On 20 April 1993, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises.
On 8 June 1993, she served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 17 July 1993.
Between 17 July 1993 and 27 February 1995 the bailiff made five attempts to recover possession.
Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession.
Thereafter, the applicant decided not to pursue the enforcement proceedings, in order to avoid useless costs, given the lack of prospects of obtaining the assistance of the police.
On 7 December 1995, the applicant made a statutory declaration that she urgently required the premises as accommodation for herself.
On 23 January 1998, the tenant vacated the apartment.
The relevant domestic law is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.
