The prosecutor noted that only the mess, kitchen, bathhouse and shared toilets on each floor had centralised water supply, whereas the individual cells had no running water or sewage connection. Water was supplied from an artesian well but it fell short of sanitary requirements because it contained too much iron and sediment. Cells had no ventilation. Prisoners were given buckets for their daily needs: one bucket of water for drinking and washing and one to use as a toilet. Every day prisoners took their toilet buckets to the toilet at the end of the corridor where they emptied and washed them. This had to do be done by the prisoners while their hands remained handcuffed behind their back, in compliance with standard practice. In 2009 the Federal Penitentiary Service had prepared an engineering and design blueprint for connecting all the cells to the mains and sewers but funding for the project had not been allocated. The prosecutor asked the court to require the facility\u2019s management and the regional branch of the Federal Penitentiary Service to connect all the cells to the water supply and sewers, to install ventilation and to improve the quality of the water.",

It would have been preferable if the second applicant had acted with greater expedition in bringing his case before the Court for examination (see Artyomov, cited above, \u00a7 115), yet as long as his detention constituted a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d and the Court is not prevented from establishing the facts on account of the amount of time that has already lapsed, his complaint cannot be rejected as belated or manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention.

The number of sleeping places was sufficient for the number of prisoners and it cannot be said that the overall dimensions of the cells were so small as to restrict the inmates\u2019 freedom of movement beyond the threshold tolerated by Article 3 (see Fetisov and Others v. Russia, nos. 43710/07, 6023/08, 11248/08, 27668/08, 31242/08 and 52133/08, \u00a7 134, 17 January 2012). The toilet was separated from the rest of the cell and had a door; this arrangement offered some privacy to those using it. Following the removal of metal shutters from the windows, the access to natural light and air also appears to have been sufficient (see paragraph 8 above). In those circumstances, the Court does not consider that the conditions of the first applicant\u2019s detention, although far from adequate, reached the threshold of severity required to characterise the treatment as inhuman or degrading within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. Therefore, there has been no violation of that provision in respect of the first applicant.",

Russia, no. 31535/09, \u00a7\u00a094, 6 March 2014). Such conditions diminished the applicant\u2019s human dignity and aroused in him feelings of anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him (see also Kasperovi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no.\u00a054872/08, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 20 November 2012). There has accordingly been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the second applicant.",
