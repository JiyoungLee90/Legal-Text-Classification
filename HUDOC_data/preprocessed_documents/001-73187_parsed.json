This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that the killing was caused by an agent of the State. Nor is it decisive whether members of the deceased\u2019s family or others have lodged a formal complaint about the killing with the competent investigation authority. The mere fact that the authorities were informed of the killing of an individual gives rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death (see Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a023763/94, \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 103, ECHR 1999IV). This involves, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of possible signs of ill-treatment and injury, and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see Salman\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2000VII, and Akdo\u011fdu, cited\u00a0above, \u00a7 54).

The Court has not found it proved beyond reasonable doubt that agents of the State carried out, or were otherwise implicated in, the abduction of the applicant\u2019s son. However, that does not preclude the complaint under Articles 3 and 5 from being an \u201carguable\u201d one for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention. These complaints were not declared inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded and therefore necessitated an examination on the merits (see Nuri Kurt v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 37038/97, \u00a7\u00a0116, 29 November 2005). Furthermore, the Court observes that it is not in dispute between the parties that the applicant\u2019s son was the victim of an abduction and illtreatment. The Court therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s complaints raised arguable claims of violations of the Convention for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention.
