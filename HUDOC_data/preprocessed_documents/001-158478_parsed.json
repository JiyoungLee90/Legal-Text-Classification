For example, there was a striking drop in price, by almost 50%, in respect of plots of lands located in the centre of Tirana, while the reference price in one of Tirana\u2019s suburbs, Paskuqan, had increased and was higher than the plot of land in the city centre. In their view, the valuation maps 2014 disregarded the market-based assessment and were adopted with the sole purpose of lowering the reference price. The whole process lacked transparency, because the Government had failed to provide factual evidence on how the calculations were reached for determining the reference price. They alleged that, in the absence of figures on which they would have commented, the Government might well have chosen the three lowest-value transactions, which would explain a drastic decrease of the reference price. The applicants further contended that the valuation map 2014 should not be used retroactively in respect of applications lodged prior to their entry into force.",

Alternatively, they submitted experts\u2019 reports arguing that the valuation maps did not reflect the real market value of the property. In determining the reference price, the experts took into consideration the price per sq. m of nearby apartment blocks, the rents in the nearby area, the fact that the property, insofar as relevant, was located in a residential and commercial area, the assumption that the property was free of any encumbrances and the development potential.",

Accordingly, the Court considers that there is no call to award the applicants any sum on that account (see, most recently, Apostu v. Romania, no. 22765/12, \u00a7 136, 3 February 2015). However, the Court considers that, in so far as the Commission decisions remain in force, the respondent State\u2019s outstanding obligation to enforce them cannot be disputed. Accordingly, the applicants are still entitled to enforcement of those decisions. The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see,\u00a0amongst others, S.C. Prodcomexim SRL v. Romania (no. 2), no.\u00a031760/06, \u00a7\u00a052, 6 July 2010). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well. It therefore considers that the Government must secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the Commission decisions in respect of applications nos.\u00a0347/10 and 33154/11.",
