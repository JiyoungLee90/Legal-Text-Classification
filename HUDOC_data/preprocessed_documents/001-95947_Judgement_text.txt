The case originated in an application (no. 34383/03) lodged with the Court against the  by a Bulgarian national, Mr Georgi Stefanov Gochev (“the applicant”), under Article 34 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on 22 October 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Marinov, a lawyer in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged that his freedom of movement, as guaranteed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention, had been unlawfully restricted.
On 25 January 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. As permitted by Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, he also decided that the Chamber would rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in . He is a graduate in international economic relations.
On 3 April 2001 the Sofia District Court, acting on a claim by a company V., issued an enforcement order against the applicant on the basis of a promissory note. The debt amounted to 55,331.03 Bulgarian levs (BGN) (or about 28,230 euros (EUR)), plus statutory interest. The costs of the proceedings amounted to BGN 1,108 (about EUR 565).
On 2 October 2001 company V. contacted the bailiffs’ service, requesting that the applicant be subjected to an order prohibiting him from leaving the territory.
On 2 November 2001 the bailiffs’ service suggested to the director of the Department for Identity Documents (“the director”) that the applicant’s passport be withdrawn. That request was based on section 76 (3) of the Bulgarian Identity Documents Act 1998 (see paragraphs 34 to 37 below), which provided for the possibility of prohibiting natural persons who had debts towards other natural or legal persons amounting to more than BGN 5,000 (about EUR 2,550) from leaving the territory.
On 12 November 2001 the applicant was invited to submit evidence that he had provided security to his creditor.
By a decision of 21 December 2001, the director, referring to section 76 (3) of the Bulgarian Identity Documents Act 1998 and the request by the bailiffs’ service, imposed the proposed measure for an indefinite period. He ordered that the applicant’s passport be withdrawn and instructed the relevant authorities not to issue him with a new passport.
The applicant brought an application for judicial review, arguing that the domestic legislation allowed for the imposition of those measures only where the existence of the debt had previously been recognised by a judicial decision that had become final. He submitted that, since his debt arose from a promissory note, that condition had not been met in his case.
On 30 May 2002, following a request submitted by the applicant, the director contacted the bailiffs’ service, requesting its opinion on the appropriateness of lifting the prohibition on leaving the territory, and indicated that the applicant had submitted evidence that he had provided security to his creditor. By a letter of 11 July 2002, the bailiffs’ service replied that the applicant had not paid his debts, that he had not provided security and that it was therefore appropriate to continue to apply the measure in question.
By a judgment of 11 February 2003 the  dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court held that a enforcement order issued by a court represented sufficient judicial recognition of the debt in question. It further noted that the applicant had not provided a security to his creditor, that he did not possess assets of a value equivalent to the amount of his debt and that he had not submitted evidence concerning a possible termination of the enforcement proceedings.
The applicant appealed on points of law.
By a judgment of 21 July 2003, a five-judge bench of the  dismissed the appeal and endorsed the reasoning given by the lower court.
On 7 May 2008 the bailiffs’ service suggested to the director that the decision of 21 December 2001 be revoked on the ground that the enforcement proceedings had been closed, given that the creditor had not requested new execution measures over a period of more than two years.
The decision in question was revoked on 17 May 2008.
On 25 October 1999 the Karlovo District Court, acting on a claim by a company B., issued an enforcement order against the applicant on the basis of another promissory note. This debt amounted to BGN 17,531 (about EUR 8,765).
By a request of 20 February 2002, company B. called for the imposition of a measure prohibiting the applicant from leaving the territory. Its representative argued that the applicant had disposed of some of his property that was under attachment, namely vehicles. He noted that company B. had succeeded in attaching real estate belonging to the applicant, but that its value was considerably lower than the sum owed.
On 5 March 2002 the bailiffs’ service, on instructions from company B., requested the imposition of an order prohibiting [the applicant] from leaving the territory under section 76 (3) of the Bulgarian Identity Documents Act 1998. On that date the amount of default interest due was BGN 7,421 (about EUR 3,786).
By a letter of 25 April 2002, the applicant was informed of the director’s intention to apply the requested measure. He was invited to submit evidence that he had provided security to his creditor.
By a decision of 27 May 2002, the director, again referring to section 76 (3) of the Bulgarian Identity Documents Act 1998 and to the proposal by the bailiffs’ service, ordered that the applicant’s passport be withdrawn and instructed the relevant bodies not to issue him with a new passport for an indefinite period.
The applicant brought an application for judicial review. He claimed that the order prohibiting him from leaving the territory had no legal basis, that he had intended to effect a set-off using a debt owed by company B., that he had provided security and that he had reimbursed part of his debt.
By a judgment of 29 December 2002, the  dismissed the applicant’s application. The court held that the judicial recognition of a debt within the meaning of section 76 (3) of the Bulgarian Identity Documents Act 1998 could arise from a judicial decision that was not res judicata, such as the decision to issue an enforcement order. The other arguments raised by the applicant were dismissed as unsubstantiated or of minor relevance.
The applicant appealed on points of law.
On 23 April 2003 a five-judge bench of the  upheld the contested decision.
It was common ground between the parties that the applicant had been free to leave the national territory since 17 May 2008.
The applicant’s daughters, T.G. and M.G., were born in 1986 and 1997 respectively.
On 19 December 2001 the Sofia District Court granted a divorce to the applicant and S.G., the mother of his children. A residence order in respect of the two girls was given in favour of S.G. The applicant was given contact rights, amounting to two weekends per month and two two-week periods during the winter and summer holidays.
S.G. subsequently settled in the  with the two children. Since September 2003, T.G. and M.G. have lived permanently in the , where they are being educated.
On 5 March 1999 the applicant created, in , a branch of the limited liability company “Univeks” OOD, of which he was an associate. He indicated that in 2002 the Russian market had stabilised and had opened up to Bulgarian products. The prohibition on leaving Bulgarian territory had prevented him from developing his commercial activity in Russia, as it had obliged him to remain permanently in .
On 12 March 2002 the applicant, representative and only associate of the limited liability company “Geomark” EOOD, signed a contract for the sale of Bulgarian cosmetics and cleaning products with a Russian company. This contract was worth 500,000 American dollars (USD) and was valid until 31 December 2004. Among the terms and conditions, a clause specified that the applicant was to have the products approved by the Russian authorities.
On 29 July 2002 the purchaser and the applicant signed an amendment to the contract, concerning the shipment of products with a value of USD 10,114.28. As the applicant could not travel to  in order to obtain approval for the goods, he subsequently withdrew. The reasons for his withdrawal were considered as a case of force majeure by the other party to the contract, and the applicant was not required to pay penalties. As the prohibition on leaving the territory was maintained until the end of the period of validity of the contract, it was not performed. The applicant indicated that he had expected to earn twenty percent of the value of the orders placed.
The Bulgarian Identity Documents Act 1998 (Закон за българските документи за самоличност – “the 1998 Act”), which entered into force on 1 April 1999, provides that the relevant bodies of the Ministry of the Interior may impose a prohibition on leaving the territory on an individual who has debt “established by judicial means” amounting to more than BGN 5,000 (about EUR 2,550) towards other physical or legal persons (section 76 (3) taken together with paragraph 1 (5) of the supplementary provisions to the 1998 Act). In addition, at the material time, the Act provided for two other measures, namely the withdrawal of passports and the refusal to issue a passport to a debtor.
These preventive measures cannot be imposed if the debtor has provided security to his or her creditor or if he or she possesses assets of sufficient value to be used as reimbursement of the debts (section 76 (3)).
The Supreme Administrative Court considers that the instruction by which a court issues an enforcement order on the basis of a promissory note constitutes judicial recognition of the debt within the meaning of the 1998 Act (see, inter alia, Decision no. 8907 of 23 November 2001 in case no. 4766/2001, and Decision no. 6937 of 7 July 2003 in case no. 4150/2003, Решение № 8907 от 23.11.2001 г. по адм. д. № 4766/2001 г., Решение № 6937 от 07.07.2003 г. по адм. дело № 4150/2003 г.).
Furthermore, the Supreme Administrative Court considers that the administrative body which imposes a prohibition on leaving the territory has discretionary power with regard to the appropriateness of that measure (see Decision no. 10998 of 9 December 2005 in case no. 4980, and Decision no. 10908 of 8 November 2007 in case no. 7909/2007, Решение № 10998 от 09.12.2005 г. по адм .дело № 4980/2005 г., Решение № 10908 от 08.11.2007 г. по адм. д. № 7909/2007 г.). Thus, courts were required merely to verify that the legal conditions set out in the 1998 Act had been fulfilled.
The liability of the maker of a promissory note lapses by limitation three years from the date on which it is payable (section 531 of the Commerce Act). The limitation period is interrupted if enforcement proceedings are brought, and the interruption causes a new limitation period to begin to run (sections 116 and 117 of the Obligations and Contracts Act).
If in the course of two years the creditor does not request new execution measures, the enforcement proceedings must be closed (Article 330 of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure). This provision was reproduced in similar terms in Article 433 of the new Code of Civil Procedure, in force since 1 March 2008.
