Considering, on the facts of the case, that the evidence adduced at the trial constituted a formidable case against the applicant, the Court found that the drawing of such inferences, which was moreover subject to important procedural safeguards, did not violate Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 in the circumstances of the case (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 48-58).",

In coming to that conclusion it had regard to the fact that although direct compulsion was brought to bear on the respective applicants as the registered keepers of a car, it had to be seen in the specific context of the regulatory regime for the use of motor vehicles in which car owners and drivers subjected themselves to certain responsibilities and obligations.

Furthermore, the Independent Administrative Panel had before it the applicant's written submission in which he claimed that he had not been driving the car, had not even been in Austria at the material time and was not in a position to provide the name and address of the driver as the car had been used regularly by a number of persons. The Court cannot find that in such a situation the only common-sense conclusion was that the applicant himself had been the driver.
