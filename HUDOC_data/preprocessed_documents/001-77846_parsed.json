Moreover, the decisions of the domestic courts, devoid of any sign of arbitrariness, served to adjudicate a civil-law dispute between private persons and cannot be regarded as deprivation of property by a State authority. The Court therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s submissions do not disclose any appearance of a violation of his rights under the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 and must be rejected, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
