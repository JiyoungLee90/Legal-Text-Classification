It further points out that applicants are required to exhaust only those remedies which are effective. Where an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 4\u00a0June 2001).",

No explanation has been given to the Court for this delay. As it has previously pointed out with regard to cases which concerned forced disappearances, with the passage of time witnesses may become untraceable, their memories fade, evidence deteriorates or ceases to exist, and the prospects of any investigation being undertaken will increasingly diminish (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC] (nos.\u00a016064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7 161, ECHR 2009). The same holds true for the case at hand. However, the Court notes that although the local domestic prosecuting authorities initially refused to institute a criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaint, the refusal was overruled five times by the supervising prosecutor, who considered the inquiry to have been incomplete and gave instructions on the investigative measures to be taken. Furthermore, in their observations the Government referred to a certificate issued on 24\u00a0March 2011, which in the Court\u2019s view constitutes an important piece of evidence in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraphs 11 and 41 above). Accordingly, it cannot be said that the domestic authorities considered any investigative efforts to be manifestly futile in view of the significant time that had elapsed. Therefore, despite the delay with which the applicant sought to institute criminal proceedings in connection with his allegations of ill-treatment, in the specific circumstances of the present case the Court finds that the ensuing investigation must be taken into account for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, by contrast, Finozhenok\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.\u00a03025/06, 31\u00a0May 2011).",

Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 62, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, and Ayd\u0131n v.\u00a0Turkey, 25 September 1997, \u00a7 81, Reports 1997VI). The Court further notes, as it has held on many occasions, that the authorities have an obligation to protect the physical integrity of persons in detention. Where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to have injuries at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4\u00a0December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336; see also, mutatis mutandis, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII). In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch, cited above, \u00a7 34, and Salman, cited above, \u00a7 100).",
