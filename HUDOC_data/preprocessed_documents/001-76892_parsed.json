Furthermore, in its decision of 7 May 2003 the District Court dismissed the mother\u2019s request for an injunction prohibiting the applicant from meeting the child. The decision stated that, at that time, it had not yet been established that the injunction which the mother sought to obtain was required in the interests of the child. The court of appeal upheld that decision (see paragraph 30 above). The reasons invoked indicate that a possible request of the applicant for an interim measure permitting him to meet his son was not clearly devoid of any prospects of success.
