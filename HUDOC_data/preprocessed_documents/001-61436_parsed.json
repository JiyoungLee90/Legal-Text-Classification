Consequently, as the damage for a plaintiff would not stop with the first-instance judgment but continued throughout the appeal proceedings, also this period had to be taken into account when awarding payment of coercive indemnity.

In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. Thus, the Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under Article\u00a010, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation (see, among many other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v.

However, in the present case the main issue is not the aspect of legal certainty, but rather the duties and responsibilities linked to the exercise of freedom of expression through the mass media. In this respect, the Court notes that the Procurator General's Office, of its own motion, lodged a plea of nullity for the preservation of law on 30\u00a0June 1998, considering unreasonable that a coercive indemnity be imposed for the period after the first instance court's decision of 17\u00a0December 1996, since after that decision the applicant company had to be considered as having acted in good faith when it did not publish another notice.
