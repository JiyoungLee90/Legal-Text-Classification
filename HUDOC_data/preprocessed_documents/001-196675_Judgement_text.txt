The case originated in an application (no. 46206/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Abu Kabilov (“the applicant”), on 20 July 2010.
The applicant was represented by Ms V. Kogan and Mr E. Wesselink from the Stichting Russian Justice Initiative, in partnership with another NGO, Astreya (“SRJI/Astreya”). The Russian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 7 January 2016 notice of the complaints concerning the investigation into the abduction of the applicant’s son and the lack of effective remedies in that regard was given to the Government and the remainder of the application, including a complaint under the substantive limb of Article 2 of the Convention and a complaint under Article 5 of the Convention, was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court. The Government did not object to the examination of the application by a Committee
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Grozny, Chechnya. He is the father of Mr Magomed Kabilov, who was born in 1984 and worked at the Zavodskoy district fire station in Grozny.
At about 5 p.m. on 25 August 2009 Mr Magomed Kabilov left his work place with two colleagues, Mr S.B. and Mr Kh.B. in the latter’s car. Several minutes later, as soon as they had left the premises of the Zavodskoy district fire station, they saw a grey VAZ-2110 car moving in the opposite direction. Mr Magomed Kabilov said that it was an acquaintance of his (apparently Mr R.S.) and asked Mr Kh.B. to stop. When the other car pulled over, Mr Magomed Kabilov got into it and was driven away to an unknown destination. Neither Mr Magomed Kabilov nor Mr R.S. have been seen since.
On 26 August 2009 the applicant lodged a complaint in respect of Mr Magomed Kabilov’s disappearance with the Zavodskoy district police department and the Zavodskoy district investigative committee in Grozny.
On 14 September 2009 the Zavodskoy district investigative committee opened a criminal investigation into Mr Magomed Kabilov’s disappearance (case no. 67057) under Article 105 of the Russian Criminal Code (murder).
On 15 September 2009, the applicant was granted victim status in the proceedings and questioned. He submitted that on 26 August 2009 he had spoken with his son’s colleagues, Mr Kh.B. and Mr S.B., who had told him that at about 5.10 p.m. on 25 August 2009 Mr Magomed Kabilov had got into a grey VAZ-2110 car near the Zavodskoy fire station in Grozny and had been driven away to an unknown destination. The applicant also submitted that his son’s acquaintance, Mr R.S., had disappeared on the same day, 25 August 2009.
On 30 September 2009 the deputy head of the Zavodskoy district investigative committee ordered the investigators: (i) to search Mr Magomed Kabilov’s place of residence; (ii) to obtain data from his telephone (including incoming and outgoing calls); (iii) to identify and question witnesses to the incident, Mr Kabilov’s colleagues and neighbours; (iv) to identify and question Mr R.S.; and (v) to take other investigative steps.
On 10 November 2009 the investigators questioned Mr Kh.B. and Mr S.B. Their statements describe circumstances similar to those described in paragraph 5 above. Mr Kh.B. also said that there had been two unfamiliar persons in the VAZ- 2110 car.
On 12 November 2009 the investigators questioned Mr R.S.’s father, wife and sister. They stated that Mr R.S. owned a grey VAZ-2110 car, that he had not returned home on 25 August 2009 and that he had not been seen since.
On the same day, 12 November 2009, and again on 14 November 2009 the investigators questioned Mr Magomed Kabilov’s mother and sister, whose statements were similar to that of the applicant.
On an unspecified date in November 2009 the transport police informed the investigators that Mr M.A. Kabilov had bought several tickets for public transport (apparently after 25 August 2009). The police did not provide the investigators with his personal information.
On 14 November 2009 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.
On 20 November 2009 the investigation was resumed. The deputy head of the Zavodskoy district investigative committee again ordered the investigators: (i) to examine Mr Magomed Kabilov’s place of residence; (ii) to obtain data from his telephone (including incoming and outgoing calls); (iii) to identify and question witnesses to the incident; and (iv) to take other investigative steps. The investigators were also to obtain detailed information about Mr M.A. Kabilov from the transport police.
On 3 and 20 December 2009 the investigators questioned several colleagues of Mr Magomed Kabilov. Their submissions did not contain any new information.
On 3 December 2009 at the investigators’ request the Zavodskoy District Court allowed them to access information concerning Mr Magomed Kabilov’s mobile telephone data from the service provider. On an unspecified date in 2010 the investigators established that after Mr Kabilov’s abduction, a telephone call had been made from his number to a telephone registered under the name of Ms L.B.
On 4 December 2009, the investigators searched Mr Magomed Kabilov’s flat. As material evidence they collected a skullcap belonging to him, which was later submitted for an expert biological examination. The presence of antigens A and H were found on the skullcap.
On 20 December 2009 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.
On an unspecified subsequent date the applicant requested the Federal Security Service in Chechnya to assist in the search of his son. In a reply of 25 January 2010 he was informed that his letter had been forwarded to the Chechnya Public Prosecutor’s Office.
On 18 February 2010 the investigation was resumed and then on 28 February 2010 it was suspended again.
On 4 June 2010, following a complaint lodged by the applicant with a domestic court (see paragraph 52 below), the investigators resumed the proceedings.
On an unspecified date the investigators identified the individual with whom Mr Magomed Kabilov had apparently spoken on the telephone. From the documents in the Court’s possession it is unclear as to whether the conversation took place on 25 August 2009 or later. That individual had been Ms A.Yu. On 9 June 2010 the investigators questioned her. She denied having used the telephone number to which the investigators referred or knowing Mr Kabilov.
On 14 June 2010 the investigation was suspended. It was subsequently resumed on 1 November 2010 and suspended again on 21 November 2010.
A month later, on 21 December 2010, the deputy prosecutor of the Zavodskoy district criticised the quality of the investigation. He noted that the investigators had failed: (i) to establish whether Mr R.S.’s car had left Chechnya; (ii) to put it on the list of wanted vehicles; (iii) to identify persons with whom telephone communication from Mr R.S.’s number had been made; and (iv) to take other investigative steps.
On 24 December 2010 the investigation was resumed. It does not appear that any investigative actions were taken, and the investigation was again suspended on 29 December 2010.
On 23 March 2011 the deputy prosecutor of the Zavodskoy district again criticised the investigators for their failure to establish whether Mr R.S.’s car had left Chechnya, or to put it on the list of wanted vehicles.
On 15 April 2011 the investigation was resumed and five days later, on 20 April 2011, suspended again.
On 19 August 2011 the deputy prosecutor of the Zavodskoy district noted that the investigators had not identified persons with whom telephone communication from Mr R.S.’s number had been made. He also ordered that the investigation into the disappearance of the applicant’s son be joined to the investigation opened into the disappearance of Mr R.S.
On 26 August 2011 the investigators resumed the proceedings.
On 7 September 2011 the deputy head of the Zavodskoy district investigative committee repeated his instruction of 20 November 2009 to obtain information about Mr M.A. Kabilov, who had bought public transport tickets (apparently after the alleged abduction). He also instructed the investigators to question Ms L.B.
On 7 September 2011 the aforementioned witness was questioned. She stated that she had never used the telephone number to which the call from Mr Magomed Kabilov’s telephone had been made.
On 16 September 2011 the investigation was suspended. Subsequently it was joined to the investigation into Mr R.S.’s disappearance (see paragraph 48 below).
On 26 August 2009 Mr R.S.’s father complained of his son’s disappearance to the Zavodskoy district police department.
On 8 October 2009 the Zavodskoy district investigative committee opened an investigation into Mr R.S.’s disappearance (criminal case no. 67061) under Article 105 of the Russian Criminal Code (murder).
On 12 October 2009 the deputy head of the Zavodskoy district investigative committee ordered the investigators: (i) to search Mr R.S.’s flat; (ii) to check registration logs at the road checkpoints; (iii) to obtain data from Mr R.S.’s telephone (including incoming and outgoing calls); (iv) to check whether Mr R.S. disappeared on the same day as the applicant’s son; and (v) to take other investigative steps.
On 15 October 2009 the investigators granted victim status to Mr R.S.’s father and questioned him. He stated that on 25 August 2009 Mr R.S. had gone to Grozny and had not been seen since. He also provided the investigators with his son’s telephone number, described his appearance and stated that his son could not have joined illegal armed groups.
On 10 November 2009 the investigators suggested that the abduction of Mr R.S. had been perpetrated either by law-enforcement officers on account of his criminal activity, or by private individuals on account of a feud, unpaid debts or personal hostility.
On 11 November 2009 one of Mr R.S.’s colleagues was questioned by the investigators. He submitted that at a formal meeting at the offices of the Chechen Government he had heard that Mr R.S. had joined an illegal armed group.
The following day, 12 November 2009, the investigators questioned Mr R.S.’s sister, who endorsed her father’s submissions.
On 13 and 16 November 2009 the investigators questioned the applicant and his wife respectively. They submitted that on 26 August 2009 the applicant had spoken with his son’s colleagues, Mr Kh.B. and Mr S.B., who had told him that at about 5.10 p.m. on 25 August 2009 Mr Magomed Kabilov had got into a grey VAZ-2110 car near the Zavodskoy fire station in Grozny and had been driven away to an unknown destination.
On 16 November 2009 the investigators questioned Mr Kh.B. and Mr S.B. Their statements described circumstances similar to those described in paragraph 5 above. Mr Kh.B. had noticed two unfamiliar persons in the VAZ-2110 car and stated that it had driven away at high speed.
On 26 November 2009 the investigators questioned another colleague of Mr R.S., who submitted that during a private briefing at the Chechen President’s residence it had been said that Mr R.S. had joined an illegal armed group.
On 30 November 2009 the investigators searched Mr Kh.B.’s place of residence and collected material evidence in the form of his skullcap. On 4 December 2009 they ordered an expert biological examination of the skullcap. The specialists later concluded that the owner of the skullcap had the antigen A.
In the meantime, on an unspecified date the investigators applied to the Zavodskoy District Court in Grozny seeking authorisation to seize from the telecommunications provider documents related to Mr R.S.’s telephone calls and billing information. The investigators’ request was granted on 3 December 2009.
On an unspecified date the investigators obtained information about the location of Mr Magomed Kabilov’s and Mr R.S.’s mobile telephones following the events of 25 August 2009. According to the data, on 26 August 2009 they had been physically located in the town of Khasavyurt, Dagestan.
On 8 December 2009 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. It was resumed on 15 November 2011. Subsequently, it was joined to the investigation into the disappearance of the applicant’s son (see paragraph 48 below).
On 23 November 2011 the investigators joined the investigation into the disappearance of Mr R.S. to the investigation into the disappearance of Mr Magomed Kabilov. The joined case was assigned number 67057.
On 5 December 2011, apparently without any investigative steps having been taken, the investigation was suspended.
Two days later, on 7 December 2012, the above-mentioned decision was overruled by the deputy head of the Zavodskoy district prosecutor’s office. Shortly thereafter the investigation was resumed. Copies of the case-file material submitted by the Government do not contain the resumption order.
On 15 February 2012 the deputy prosecutor of the Chechen Republic noted a number of shortcomings in the investigation. In particular, he stated that the investigators had failed to question some of Mr Magomed Kabilov’s and Mr R.S.’s friends or neighbours, the participants of the official meeting in which it had been mentioned that Mr R.S. had joined an illegal armed group, and the individuals whom the abducted men had contacted on 25 August 2009 by telephone. Moreover, the investigators had not followed up on information they had obtained from the telecommunications service provider that the abducted men’s telephones had crossed the Chechen border and had connected to the mobile telecommunications networks in Khasavyurt, Dagestan. The investigators had also failed to request the Dagestan authorities to inform them whether Mr R.S.’s vehicle had been seen in the area. Lastly, it appeared that the responses received in reply to the investigators’ requests had not been included in the case file.
On 1 June 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Staropromyslovskiy District Court in Grozny concerning the investigator’s decision of 28 February 2010 to suspend the investigation. On 4 June 2010 the court rejected the complaint, as the investigation had been resumed earlier the same day.
