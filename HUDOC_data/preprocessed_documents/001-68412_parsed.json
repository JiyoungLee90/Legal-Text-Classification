It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V, and Mifsud v. France (dec.), no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002VIII). The Court further observes that the domestic remedies must be \u201ceffective\u201d in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a0158, ECHR\u00a02000XI).",

The Court considers that after a competent State agency was served with a judgment the recourse by the applicant to another State agency should not in principle have been necessary to secure its enforcement. The Court considers that in the present case recourse to the bailiff service would only have produced repetitive results and could not be said to have constituted an effective remedy against nonenforcement (see Yavorivskaya v.

However, that right would be illusory if a 's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention.
