The case originated in an application (no. 14382/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr R. Tonderys (“the applicant”) on 5 April 2004. He was represented by Mr W. Hermeliński and subsequently by Ms A. Metelska, lawyers practising in Warszawa.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 7 February 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the applicant’s pre-trial detention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Wołów.
On 14 June 1999 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody on suspicion of, inter alia, murder and causing grievous bodily harm.
On 16 June 1999 the  ordered that the applicant be detained on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences. The court found that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings, having regard to the severity of the anticipated penalty.
In the subsequent decisions prolonging the applicant’s detention, the courts referred to the complexity of the case, the need to conduct further investigations and to take further evidence including psychiatric opinions. The court held that no other measures could prevent the applicant from attempting to exert unlawful pressure on witnesses.
Between 14 June 1999 and 1 March 2000 twenty-four witnesses were heard and eight expert opinions were submitted to the court, including with respect to the post-mortem examination. Several scene-of-crime inspections were conducted. The applicant was heard on two occasions.
On 1 March 2000 the prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the . The applicant was charged with numerous offences, including murder, attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm, possession of an unlicensed weapon and failure to pay child maintenance. The prosecutor requested that fifty-three witnesses be heard and sixty-one documents be produced in court.
Between 10 March 2000 and 6 September 2000 eleven hearings were held.
On 6 September 2000 the  gave a judgment. It convicted the applicant as indicted except for one charge – the failure to pay child maintenance. The applicant was sentenced to twenty-five years’ imprisonment. On 4 December 2000 the applicant appealed.
On 15 February 2001 the Rzeszow Court of Appeal upheld the judgment insofar as it concerned one of the charges (handling stolen goods), sentencing the applicant to one year’s imprisonment and counting towards the sentence the period from 14 June 1999 to 13 June 2000. The court quashed the remaining part of the sentence and remitted the case. It found that the written grounds for the judgment were inadequate, which made it impossible to follow and assess the reasoning of the lower court.
On 30 March 2001 the  remitted the case to the prosecution in order to remedy shortcomings in the bill of indictment.
On 1 August 2001 the prosecutor lodged a new bill of indictment with the court. The applicant was charged with four offences including murder, attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm and possession of an unlicensed weapon. Another forty-eight witnesses were called.
Between 10 September 2001 and 12 February 2002 the  held ten hearings.
On 12 February 2002 the  delivered a judgment. It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The applicant and the prosecutor appealed.
On 27 June 2002 the Rzeszow Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and remitted the case, finding that the lower court had applied the wrong legal provisions to the facts under examination.
Between 10 September 2002 and 25 March 2003 the  held fifteen hearings.
On 25 March 2003 the  gave a judgment. It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twenty-five years’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed.
On 4 March 2004 the Rzeszów Court of Appeal amended the judgment in part, but confirmed the sentence of twenty-five years’ imprisonment. On 25 May 2004 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court.
On 9 November 2004 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of the second-instance court and remitted the case for re-examination.
On 7 April 2005 the Rzeszów Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the first-instance court and remitted the case.
Between 27 April 2005 and 7 December 2005 the  held ten hearings.

On 6 April 2006 the Rzeszów Court of Appeal upheld the judgment. Apparently the applicant has not lodged a cassation appeal.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its prolongation, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in cases of Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, §§ 75-79, ECHR 2000-XI; Bagiński v. Poland, no. 37444/97, §§ 42-46, 11 October 2005; and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006.
