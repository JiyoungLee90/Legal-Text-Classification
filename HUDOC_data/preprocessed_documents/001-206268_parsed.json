The domestic authorities had taken all the measures necessary to secure the enforcement of the judgment of 20 July 2016. However, in the course of the enforcement proceedings it had proved impossible to hand the children over to the applicant owing to their refusal to go to their mother. Despite the psychologist\u2019s recommendation that the applicant should first restore her bond with her sons in order to make the enforcement possible (see paragraph 39 above), the applicant had not shown any willingness to do so; she had not asked either A. or his parents for such an opportunity, even though A. had had no objections. The Government concluded that, while the domestic authorities had met all of their obligations in trying to have the judgment enforced, there had been circumstances excluding the possibility of the immediate return of the children to Estonia.",

Austria, no. 4097/13, \u00a7\u00a0136, 15\u00a0January 2015). They furthermore stressed, referring to Article 11 of the Hague Convention, that the enforcement of the return order required urgent handling (see Maire v. Portugal, no. 48206/99, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR\u00a02003VII) and that, in the event of manifestly unlawful behaviour on the part of the children\u2019s father, the use of sanctions should not have been ruled out (see Shaw v. Hungary, no.\u00a06457/09, \u00a7\u00a076, 26 July 2011). The Estonian Government noted that the Russian Government had not submitted any evidence that steps had been taken to enforce the return order, but instead had tried to explain the reasons for it being impossible to secure the children\u2019s return. Those submissions had been contrary to the Russian courts\u2019 judgments ordering the return of the children, which had been in force and could not have been amended in the course of the enforcement proceedings. The children\u2019s unwillingness to return to their mother could not be considered as constituting legal grounds for accepting their nonreturn (see Bianchi v. Switzerland, no.\u00a07548/04, 22 June 2006, and Raw and Others v. France, no.\u00a010131/11, 7 March 2013). That unwillingness was attributable to the domestic authorities, whose passive attitude had caused the break in contact between the applicant and the children and the resulting alienation between them. Neither could the psychologist\u2019s report referred to by the Russian Government have constituted a basis for the failure to return the children. In the course of enforcement proceedings the implementing authorities (representing the executive branch of the State) had not been authorised to disregard the court judgments or to amend the court resolutions. The Estonian Government concluded that the failure on the part the domestic authorities to undertake adequate and efficient steps to enforce the return order had helped the \u201cabductor\u201d parent to benefit from his illegal actions, which had amounted to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (see Ignaccolo-Zenide v.

The Court considers that the children\u2019s reluctance to return to Estonia had been understandable given their young age and the fact that they had been in the sole care of their father for one year and nine months until the enforcement attempt of 7\u00a0November 2017. However, that reluctance had been due mainly to the fact that the domestic authorities in charge of the enforcement proceedings had failed to take any of the measures that could reasonably have been expected of them in order to be able to enforce the order for the children\u2019s return in a timely manner or, at the least, to ensure regular contact between the children and the applicant during the pending proceedings so as to prevent irreparable damage to their relationship and to preserve the prospects of a successful enforcement of the judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour. The Court reiterates in this regard that it is in the nature of return proceedings that a considerable lapse of time may compromise the position of the non-resident parent irretrievably. The Court considers, therefore, that the children\u2019s unwillingness to go to the applicant could not, in the circumstances of the present case, serve as legal grounds for justifying the non-enforcement of the return order.",
