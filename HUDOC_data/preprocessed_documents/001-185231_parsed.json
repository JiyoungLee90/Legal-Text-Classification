Moreover, even the remaining argument \u2013 namely that the applicant was not prevented from seeing his child (see paragraph\u00a08 above) \u2013 cannot be construed as constituting an effective examination of the child\u2019s best interests, but rather as a mere observation of the situation at that particular moment. The domestic courts did not examine the precariousness of the situation, nor did they respond to the applicant\u2019s request for a more structured visiting plan (see paragraph 7 above). In other words, they left the exercise of a right which was fundamental to both the applicant and his child at the discretion of the applicant\u2019s spouse with whom he had (at that time) a conflict of interest (see paragraph 6 above).",
