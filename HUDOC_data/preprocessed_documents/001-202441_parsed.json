It held that it did not need to determine whether the omission to forward the relevant document had been prejudicial to the applicant; the existence of a violation was conceivable even in the absence of prejudice (see Zahirovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48 and 49, and Loni\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 84).",

However, the Court has thereby, in principle, removed the possibility from the domestic courts of clarifying the domestic law, because the applicants have no incentive to test their possible response in such cases. Thus, in principle, the State Party, if it wishes to allow the possibility of seeking reopening of domestic proceedings also in the event of a decision by the Court to accept the Government\u2019s unilateral declaration, and not only in the event of a judgment finding a violation of the Convention, it could do so primarily by changing its legislation, which is often a longer and more cumbersome way of clarifying the law.",

It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court did not refuse to reopen the case because the request was based on the Court\u2019s strike-out decision and not on a judgment finding a violation of the Convention; its refusal was based on other grounds.

Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no. 19867/12, \u00a7\u00a050, 11 July 2017). In this context, the Court has acknowledged that it doesn\u2019t have the power to make any order for reopening and, furthermore, that the specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order for it to discharge its obligations under the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case (ibidem). Accordingly, the Court has recognised that a finding by the Court of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention does not automatically require the reopening of the domestic criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, it has held that this is, in principle, an appropriate, and often the most appropriate, way of putting an end to the violation and affording redress for its effects (ibidem, \u00a7 52).",

The ultimate purpose of reopening as a legal institution is to ensure substantive justice. On the other hand, reopening entails an exception to legal certainty, which in turn is the ultimate purpose of the finality of judgments that have acquired the status of res iudicata. Both principles involved in this conflict, i.e. effective respect for the individual\u2019s human rights and respect for legal certainty, underpin the Convention as well as domestic constitutions.

Although proceedings before the Court only deal with the rights of a given applicant, this feature does not justify disregard for the fact that the underlying domestic proceedings consist of a more complex exercise aimed at satisfying multiple requirements arising from all the rights involved.",

The reopening of proceedings already concluded by a final judgment will often have negative repercussions on other private parties than the individual in whose interest such reopening is granted. This is frequently the case also in the context of criminal proceedings, as many jurisdictions permit the victim\u2019s compensation claims to be examined and adjudicated upon in the context of the criminal proceedings conducted against the accused \u2013 an arrangement which offers significant benefits to the victim and is therefore frequently relied upon. In those situations, the finding of guilt is the basis for the criminal conviction and the associated penal sanctions as well as for the award of compensation to the victim. Thus, criminal proceedings often comprise, at the same time, both a criminal and a civil limb. Such proceedings are not only concerned with the \u201cvertical\u201d relationship between the State and the accused but, at the same time, also with the \u201chorizontal\u201d relationship between the accused and the alleged crime victim.",

This problem, however, is downplayed by stating that it already exists in the application of the ordinary domestic rules for reexamination of cases or reopening of the proceedings. The suggestion offered is that the solutions applied in these cases ought to be applicable, at least mutatis mutandis, also to cases where re-examination or reopening was ordered in order to give effect to judgments of the Court. What remains overlooked in those remarks is that the \u201csolution\u201d in those ordinary domestic rules primarily consists of two main elements, namely that the grounds for reopening are limited to exceptional and narrowly framed situations, and that their application is subject to specific, relatively short time-limits. By contrast, the possibility for reopening on the grounds of a finding by the Court of a violation of the Convention entails that no such limitations are in place: the grounds for reopening become very broad and imprecise, and the time-frames become indefinite and very much extended because of the long duration of the proceedings before the Court.",

It is to be noted that we are not now contemplating situations where reopening is based on the emergence of some new facts or evidence. Instead, we are dealing with situations where there has been an \u201coriginal\u201d violation of Convention requirements in the domestic proceedings. If such proceedings are undone by way of reopening after many years, the available evidence in a re-trial will often no longer enable a correct establishment of facts to the requisite standard of proof, whereby the chances of achieving substantive justice are undermined. Instead, the result may well be that one injustice is replaced by another, possibly a more serious one. In the context of criminal proceedings, for instance, a violation of the procedural rights of the accused may then result in a violation of the substantive rights of the victim, especially as a procedural deficiency in the original trial does not necessarily entail that the outcome was flawed.",

Clearly, there are situations where reopening will be the appropriate form of redress. But there are many situations where especially the repercussions on the position of other parties concerned by the underlying domestic proceedings may render this form of redress highly problematic, not least because of the long lapses of time involved. A very careful and differentiated approach is required. These difficulties should be better reflected in the recommended standards, in the relevant domestic provisions and practices, as well as in the manner in which the Court addresses these issues. There appears to be a need for some rethinking at all levels. The guiding principle should be to ensure appropriate redress in a manner whereby the State fulfils its responsibilities without causing adverse effects on third parties. Even in purely vertical situations, there may be circumstances where, for instance, the long lapses of time may render reopening suboptimal, or outright pointless, as a form of redress.

For example, some concern very serious crimes against another individual (such as attempted murder), whereas some appear to concern \u201cvertical\u201d situations such as economic crime or more trivial acts (such as damage caused to public property more than a decade ago and sanctioned by a reprimand).

However, unlike her, it seems to me that the Court\u2019s current practice, in fact, does not reflect a necessary and even less the only reading of that Recommendation. After all, as its preamble makes clear, the Recommendation seeks to do little more than give recognition to the fact that a finding of a breach of the Convention \u201cmay entail the adoption of measures, other than just satisfaction awarded by the Court in accordance with Article 41 of the Convention and/or general measures, which ensure that the injured party is put, as far as possible, in the same situation as he or she enjoyed prior to the violation of the Convention (restitutio in integrum)\u201d. This, of course, reflects the position on reparation under general international law and the duty on States to ensure restitution in integrum for an internationally wrongful act only insofar and to the extent that this is \u201cnot materially impossible\u201d; an assessment in relation to which position of third parties may not only have to be taken into account but may be determinative (see Articles 31, 34 and 35 of the International Law Commission\u2019s 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts and the commentary thereto).",
