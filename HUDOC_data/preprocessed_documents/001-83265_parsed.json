The Government enclosed a number of letters from various higher courts in  stating that the applicant had never lodged any such complaints with the courts in question. They also argued that the authorities had twice invited the applicant to visit the Chechen Republic Prosecutor's Office with a view to granting her victim status, but the applicant had failed to appear.",

She stated that an administrative practice consisting in the authorities' continuing failure to conduct adequate investigations into offences committed by representatives of the federal forces in  rendered any potentially effective remedies inadequate and illusory in her case. In this connection she relied on applications submitted to the Court by other individuals claiming to be victims of similar violations, and on documents by human rights NGOs and the Council of Europe. The applicant contended that, in any event, she had repeatedly applied to law-enforcement bodies, including various prosecutors, and had actively participated in the investigation. This avenue, however, had proved futile, given that the criminal investigation had by now been pending for over six years but had failed to identify those involved in the illegal detention and disappearance of Mr Sultan Isayev despite compelling evidence confirming the involvement of federal servicemen. The applicant also argued that the Government had failed to demonstrate that a court complaint against the actions or omissions of the investigating authorities would have been an effective remedy in her situation. She stated that under domestic law a court, in examining such a complaint, could order the investigating authorities to resume the investigation or to take certain investigative measures. In this connection she pointed out that the investigation into her husband's abduction had been resumed on several occasions following her complaints to higher prosecutors; however, so far it had produced no results. The applicant therefore argued that court complaints against the investigators would not have changed the situation, and therefore she had been under no obligation to make use of that remedy. She also referred to the Court's established case-law to the effect that, in any event, the authorities had to carry out the investigation of their own motion once the matter had come to their attention, without leaving it to the initiative of the next of kin to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures. The applicant also denied the Government's allegation that she had failed to appear at the Chechen Republic Prosecutor's Office and that this had prevented the investigators from granting her the victim status. She contended that on numerous occasions she had written to, and visited in person, various prosecutors' offices in  but had never been granted victim status.",

This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony (see, for example, Tanr\u0131kulu v.

These failures alone compromised the effectiveness of the investigation and could not but have had a negative impact on the prospects of arriving at the truth.

The applicant enclosed an invoice from the SRJI for the amount of EUR 14,739.25 with the billing sheet, the invoice for the translating services and DHL invoices relating to correspondence with the Court. Having regard to the rates for the work of the SRJI lawyers and senior staff, the Court is satisfied that these rates are reasonable and reflect the expenses actually incurred by the applicant in relation to the legal services. It is further satisfied that the translation and postal expenses, supported by relevant documents, were also actually incurred.
