He remained under their supervision throughout the entire period of his detention. They were best placed to determine the applicant\u2019s treatment and he was provided with the prescribed therapies.

Where the events at issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

Although no conclusive evidence is available concerning the time and other circumstances in which the applicant was injured, the exact nature and degree of force used against him and whether, in the circumstances, that force was proportionate, mainly because of the shortcomings in the domestic investigation (see paragraphs 95-99 above), the applicant\u2019s version of events, which he changed on several occasions during the proceedings (see paragraphs 12, 14, 15 and 17\u00a0above), cannot be accepted as presented. However, given the burden on the State to provide a plausible explanation for injuries sustained by a person under control of the police, the Court concludes that the Government have not satisfactorily established that the use of force against the applicant was lawful and absolutely necessary and that the applicant\u2019s injuries were wholly caused otherwise than by ill-treatment by the police (see Sylenok and Tekhnoservis-Plus v.

Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies (see Salduz v.

In the second stage, it must evaluate the prejudice caused to the rights of the defence by the restriction in the case in question. In other words, the Court must examine the impact of the restriction on the overall fairness of the proceedings and decide whether the proceedings as a whole were fair (see Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and 40351/09, \u00a7\u00a0257, 13 September 2016).",

Even though the Supreme Court in its decision of 16 December 2008 on the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal against his conviction noted that the applicant had confessed to some of the crimes at a particular stage of the investigation (see paragraph 63 above), it did not refer to the applicant\u2019s statements made before 24 June 2004 and generally carried out no reassessment of the evidence or facts relied upon by the Appeal Court in its decision of 11\u00a0August 2008.",

This confession was later used by the domestic courts as key evidence for his conviction on the murder charge. In rejecting the applicant\u2019s complaint, the majority accepted that contrary to his allegations, he had indeed been represented by a lawyer during his interrogation on 15 June 2004, relying on the finding of the domestic court. It is precisely on this point that we found ourselves unable to follow the majority and their holding that \u201cthere is no sufficient basis to put into doubt the domestic court\u2019s finding that the applicant had been questioned with the assistance of a lawyer\u201d (see paragraph 134).",

Croatia [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2015). Further, in order to implement that principle, a respondent Government has the evidentiary burden of proving that this right could effectively be exercised, particularly where the suspect was under arrest. On this second point, the Court has held recently in Simeonovi v. Bulgaria ([GC], no. 21980/04, ECHR 2017) that it falls on the respondent Government to prove that the applicant was duly informed of his right to a lawyer. As in that particular case the respondent Government had failed to present to the Court any document demonstrating that the applicant had been duly informed of his right to a lawyer, the Court could not conclude that the applicant had indeed been informed of his right to a lawyer, and consequently that he had validly waived this right (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012528). We find this evidentiary requirement for the respondent Government in the proceedings before this Court, and respectively vis-\u00e0-vis the prosecution in the domestic proceedings, to be a particularly important guarantee for the effective exercise of the right to a lawyer. Placing the evidentiary burden upon the Government is justified by various considerations and primarily because persons in custody are in a vulnerable position, as this Court has repeatedly acknowledged, and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (see, among other authorities, Salman v Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7\u00a099, ECHR 2000).",

No mention of the time of appointment or identity of the lawyer was made either. Further, no explanation was provided with respect to the obvious discrepancy between the finding that a lawyer represented the applicant on 15 June and the fact that a lawyer was appointed to represent the applicant on 24 June 2004 (see paragraph 38). Finally, the domestic court did not address another clearly pertinent issue, namely the fact that at the time of the applicant\u2019s interrogation on 15 June 2004 he was detained unlawfully. The applicant\u2019s administrative detention at the initial stage of the investigation (between 11\u00a0and 24 June 2004) was later found to be contrary to Articles 106 and\u00a0115 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as he had actually been arrested on suspicion of having committed crimes (see paragraph 52). The fact that the authorities had detained the applicant on a false pretext in order to avoid arresting him on the basis of the criminal procedure and the applicable guarantees for a fair trial, necessitated a closer examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint that he had no lawyer on 15 June 2004.

Most importantly, in our view, the respondent Government failed to submit the documents related to the 15\u00a0June 2004 charges against the applicant and his interrogation. Not only did they fail to present these documents to the Court, without any explanations, they have also refused the applicant\u2019s requests for copies of the relevant documents in the criminal file.

While the applicant\u2019s confession of 15\u00a0June 2004 was not the sole basis for his conviction, it appears to have had an impact on his conviction in both establishing the fact of the murder and in undermining the credibility of his subsequent statements during the trial (see paragraphs 49 and 53 of the judgment). In any event, the applicant\u2019s selfincriminating statements of 15 June 2004 formed an integral part of the body of evidence on which his conviction was based, and the Government did not demonstrate convincingly that the overall fairness of the trial was not irretrievably prejudiced by restricting his access to legal assistance.",
