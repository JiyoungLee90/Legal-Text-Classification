The case originated in an application (no. 50020/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Rafał Kacprzyk (“the applicant”), on 1 December 2006.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged that his pre-trial detention had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. He also complained under Articles 6 § 1 of the Convention of a shortcoming on the part of the trial court regarding the classification of one charge and of the unreasonable length of the criminal proceedings against him.
On 17 October 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1973. He is currently detained in Ustka Prison.
On 22 October 2004 the applicant was arrested on suspicion that he had committed a series of criminal offences against different banks, such as fraud, perjury and attempted unlawful disposal of property.
On 25 October 2004 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody. On 7 February 2005 the  (Sąd Okręgowy) upheld that decision.
The applicant’s pre-trial detention was subsequently extended by decisions of the Gdańsk District Court of: 13 January and 22 April 2005 (the latter upheld by the  on 23 May 2005) and 15 July 2005 (upheld by the  on 16 August 2005). Later, the preventive measure in question was extended by decisions of the Gdańsk Regional Court of 20 October 2005 (upheld by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal on 3 November 2005), 2 January, 23 March, 31 May and 3 July 2006 (upheld by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal on 19 July 2006), and 23 August 2006.
The domestic courts justified the applicant’s pretrial detention in its initial phase by the existence of strong evidence against the applicant and a likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed. Moreover, the authorities invoked the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings in the light of the risk that the applicant might go into hiding. He did not have a permanent residence and had been already sought by the police under a wanted notice. Finally, the domestic courts indicated that it had been necessary to examine new witnesses, to obtain psychiatric reports on the applicant and to run the necessary graphology tests, all of which had contributed to the delays in the pretrial proceedings.
At the later stage of the applicant’s pretrial detention, the authorities emphasised that the applicant had been charged with seventeen serious criminal offences and that holding him in detention was the only possible way to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings, since the applicant had already gone into hiding in the past.
Meanwhile, from 19 November 2004 to 27 February 2005, from 27 February to 13 May 2005 and from 20 July 2005 to 20 April 2006 the applicant was concurrently serving prison sentences which had been imposed by domestic courts in three unrelated criminal proceedings against him.
It appears that on 18 February 2005 the applicant, who beforehand had resided in Germany, became registered at a permanent address in .
On 30 September 2005 the applicant was indicted on numerous charges of fraud, perjury and attempted unlawful disposal of property. It was asserted in the indictment that he had tried to enter into financial transactions with different banks under false pretences and using false documents. The prosecutor asked the trial court to examine sixty-one witnesses, including nine expert witnesses.
The first hearing took place on 7 November 2005. Subsequently, between 2005 and the end of 2007 the trial court held twenty-four hearings.
When the length of the applicant’s pretrial detention appeared to reach the statutory twoyear timelimit laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego), the Gdańsk Regional Court asked the superior court to assume jurisdiction to take a decision on the measure. On 17 October 2006, however, the Gdańsk Court of Appeal decided not to hear the case, noting that the applicant’s actual pretrial detention had not lasted two years because it had been interrupted by the prison sentences which he had been serving at the same time, for approximately one year and three months.
Consequently, the applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended again by decision of the Gdańsk Regional Court of 19 October and 30 November 2006 and 10 January, 7 February, 12 April and 28 June 2007. Those decisions were upheld by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal on 7 November and 13 December 2006, an unspecified date, and 20 February, 24 April and 18 July 2007, respectively.
In the meantime, on 27 February 2007 the  dismissed a request by the applicant to lift the preventive measure in question.
At that stage, the domestic courts justified the applicant’s protracted pretrial detention by the complexity of the case, the need to examine two more witnesses and the fact that the investigation could not be completed for reasons beyond the prosecutor’s control, namely delays in obtaining the testimony of a witness who was to be heard by the court in a different administrative region under the courts’ mutual aid system.
On 28 December 2007 the court convicted the applicant of several offences and sentenced him to five and a half years’ imprisonment.
It appears that the applicant appealed and that the proceedings are currently pending before the secondinstance court. The applicant remains in detention.
The applicant did not use, in connection with his criminal trial, any of the domestic legal means designed to counteract and redress the undue length of judicial proceedings, such as those regulated in the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) or by Article 417 of the Civil Code (Kodeks Cywilny).
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are set out in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006, and Celejewski v.  , no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII, and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.
The relevant statistical data, recent amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure designed to streamline criminal proceedings and references to relevant Council of Europe materials including the 2007 Resolution of the Committee of Ministers, can be found in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kauczor (see Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, §§ 27-28 and 30-35, 3 February 2009).
