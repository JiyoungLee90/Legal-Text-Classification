Therefore, the proceedings had already lasted for one year and eleven months when the offence in question was decriminalised in September 2001. It is true that from that date, less must have been at stake for the applicant than previously, as he would be acquitted if the new law applied to the applicant's case, and if it did not, the legislator had given a clear sign that libel was not regarded as very serious. The proceedings, however, continued for at least two more years and one month, and it is unclear when exactly did they end or what was under consideration. Indeed, the domestic courts on two occasions remitted the case for additional investigation, which meant the applicant's further involvement in different investigatory activities, which could have brought even more uncertainty for the applicant as to whether the decriminalisation provision would apply to him. Given that the case has never been considered on the merits, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",

Referring to the witnesses' statements, the court found that the first applicant had come with his son (the third applicant) to L.'s office and the third applicant had helped his father to put the photocopier into the car. Although these findings could create an impression that the third applicant was considered an accomplice, the Court notes that the national court's findings were limited to establishing the circumstances of the crime committed by the first applicant, namely whether the third applicant was physically present in L.'s office, without examining whether the third applicant had any fraudulent intent to take L.'s photocopier or was just helping his father. The court judgment of 12 January 2004 did not contain any express or even indirect statements about the third applicant's guilt in respect of fraud or any other offence.",
