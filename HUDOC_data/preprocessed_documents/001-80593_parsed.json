The Court reiterates that Article 35 of the Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time provide effective and sufficient redress. An applicant does not need to exercise remedies which do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach (\u015een v.  (dec.), no. 41478/98, 30 April 2002). In the present case, as the presence of a military judge on the bench of the state security courts was in accordance with the domestic law at the material time and as such a judge was empowered to make detention orders, the Court finds that the applicant did not have any domestic remedy whereby he could seek redress for his complaints.",

However, the Court has held in several judgments that independence of the executive is one of the most important constitutive elements of the notion of a \u201ccourt\u201d (see Neumeister v. Austria, judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, \u00a7 24 and D.N. v.  [GC], no.\u00a027154/95, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2001III). In the Court's opinion, it would be inconceivable that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, relating, inter alia, to such a sensitive issue as the deprivation of liberty of a person, should not equally envisage, as a fundamental requisite, the impartiality of that court.",

The Court recalls that it has in the past examined the independence and impartiality of the state security courts from the standpoint of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and has found that the presence of a military judge on the bench constituted a breach of that provision. (see Incal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-73 and \u00d6zel v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 31-34, 7\u00a0November 2002). The Court's concerns about the status of the military judge have been summarised in paragraph 23 above. In\u00a0the present case, this time the Court is called upon to examine this question under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. However, in the Court's view, the concerns about the status of the military judges expressed in the Incal judgment in the context of Article 6 are equally valid in the context of Article 5 \u00a7 4, and the term \u201ccourt\u201d referred to in that provision must be construed as a body which enjoys the same qualities of independence and impartiality as are required of the \u201ctribunal\u201d mentioned in Article 6. It follows that, as with Mr Incal, the present applicant, charged with membership of an illegal organisation, could legitimately fear that because one of the judges of the  was a military judge it might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of his case. As a result, the Ankara State Security Court, which decided on the applicant's appeal against the detention order, lacked the necessary independence and impartiality for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
