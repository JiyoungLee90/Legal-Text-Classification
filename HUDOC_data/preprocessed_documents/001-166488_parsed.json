In each case involving an alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court must ascertain whether by reason of the State\u2019s interference, the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February 1986, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 98, and Amato Gauci v. Malta, no.\u00a047045/06, \u00a7 57, 15 September 2009). In assessing compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court must make an overall examination of the various interests in issue (see Perdig\u00e3o v. Portugal [GC], no. 24768/06, \u00a7 68, 16 November 2010), bearing in mind that the Convention is intended to safeguard rights that are \u201cpractical and effective\u201d (see, for example, Chassagnou and Others v.
