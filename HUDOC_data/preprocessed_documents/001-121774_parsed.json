The applicant explained that he had not been given the opportunity to challenge the statements made by his wife\u2019s attorney, in particular regarding: (i) the time it had taken the applicant to institute proceedings after the date of the wrongful removal or retention of the child, which according to the applicant had been 20\u00a0January\u00a02007 and not \u2013 as the court had assumed \u2013 January 2006; the result of the court using the latter date was that Article 12 of the Hague Convention came into play, to the effect that after a period of one year a child may not be returned if he has integrated into society; (ii) the contention that the child\u2019s health and psychological problems were imputable to the time he had spent with his father before moving to Italy, which finding had been based on medical documents to which the applicant had had no access; (iii) the allegation that M. had had his consent up to 1\u00a0January 2007, the date on which such consent was no longer necessary (Romania having joined the European Union), thus ignoring the notarial deed, which had stated a specific period of consent; and (iv) the fact that M. had changed their son\u2019s residence without his father\u2019s consent, as required by law. The applicant further explained that the Bologna Youth Court was considering custody issues in violation of its competence under the Hague Convention, custody issues being within the exclusive competence of the courts of the country of domicile, Romania. It would, moreover, not decide the case until the Romanian courts had made a decision in the divorce and custody proceedings. He further contested the evaluation of the potential harm for the child in the event of his return to Romania which had been made by the social services, stating that it had only made reference to the biased account of the child\u2019s mother, without any direct evaluation of the relationship between father and son and of the social environment if A. were to live in Romania. The applicant asked the Minister to forward his letter to the competent authority in  and to the Bologna Youth Court.",

It noted that divorce and custody proceedings were still pending in Romania; that M. had claimed that she and the child had lived in  since 2006; and that since June 2006 A. had been known to the Infant Neuropsychiatric Services (\u201cNPI\u201d) of the Parma Local Health Agency (\u201cAUSL\u201d). Moreover, it noted that M. had claimed to have had the required permission from her husband to keep the child in Italy in accordance with a notarial deed of 2005 and that the applicant had contested this on the basis that he had only given permission for A. to travel to Italy for tourist purposes, and that, albeit he had moved to Qatar in 2006, he wanted the child to be with him. In that light, the court considered that there were no grounds for returning A. and that, in view of the relevant international law, it could not be held that the mother had arbitrarily taken A. away from his father as legitimate custodian of the child. The Bologna Youth Court noted that the Romanian authorities had not yet taken a decision on custody, thus the parents had joint custody, and therefore the applicant did not have exclusive custody rights. Moreover, the applicant had consented to A.\u2019s transfer to Italy and had eventually moved to . Furthermore, the Bologna Youth Court observed that the child had been in  for more than a year and was integrated into Italian society, albeit with some problems. In this light, the court considered that psychological harm would ensue as a result of his return. Thus it was not obliged, according to Article 13 of the Hague Convention, to order his return. Indeed, from the social services report ordered by the court, it appeared that A. had arrived at the NPI\u2019s premises, accompanied by his mother, on the advice of his general practitioner and that since then A. had been subject to psychotherapy which included joint interviews with his mother. The doctor entrusted with the report had noted that the need for A.\u2019s psychotherapeutic treatment was due to early and prolonged periods of separation from his parents, frequent changes of residence, and continuous parental conflict. It was therefore necessary to give A. reference points and daily routines. Overall, his psychological condition had been improving, save for a worrying regression following his return from Romania and  in January 2007, from which he had recovered.",

The \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access is one aspect, is not absolute; it is subject to limitations permitted by implication, in particular where the conditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned, since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard. However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see Mikulov\u00e1 v. , no. 64001/00, \u00a7\u00a052, 6 December 2005).",

However, despite the absence of a similar clause for civil litigation, Article 6 \u00a7 1 may sometimes compel the State to provide for the assistance of a lawyer when such assistance proves indispensable to effective access to court, either because legal representation is rendered compulsory, as is done by the domestic law of certain Contracting States for various types of litigation, or by reason of the complexity of the procedure or of the case (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 26, Series A no. 32).\u00a0In discharging its obligation to provide parties to civil proceedings with legal aid, when it is provided by domestic law, the State must display diligence so as to secure to those persons the genuine and effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 6 (see, inter alia, Staroszczyk v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a059519/00, \u00a7\u00a0129, 22 March 2007; Sia\u0142kowska v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a08932/05, \u00a7\u00a0107, 22\u00a0March 2007; and B\u0105kowska v. Poland, no. 33539/02, \u00a7 46, 12\u00a0January 2010). An adequate institutional framework should be in place so as to ensure effective legal representation for entitled persons and a sufficient level of protection of their interests (ibid \u00a7 47). There may be occasions when the State should act and not remain passive when problems of legal representation are brought to the attention of the competent authorities. It will depend on the circumstances of the case whether the relevant authorities should take action and whether, taking the proceedings as a whole, the legal representation may be regarded as \u201cpractical and effective\u201d. Assigning counsel to represent a party to the proceedings does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance (see, for example, Sia\u0142kowska, cited above, \u00a7 100). It is also essential for the legal aid system to offer individuals substantial guarantees to protect those having recourse to it from arbitrariness (Gnahor\u00e9 v. France, no. 40031/98, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2000IX).",

As a result, the applicant only managed to contact a new lawyer through his own efforts on 23 September 2008, two months after the original list was sent.",

The information given subsequently by the Council of the Bar Association on 29 October 2007 contradicted the previous instruction and was erroneous, in so far as it indicated the wrong competent court, and again this information failed to give any guidance as to the applicable time-limits to appeal. In this light, the list of lawyers provided to the applicant also turned out to be inappropriate, as MCA, the lawyer whom the applicant chose from that list, did not take up the appointment as she was not qualified to plead before the Court of Cassation. Despite the fact that at that point it was not yet critical, MCA also erred in informing the applicant that the expiry of the time-limit was one year and forty-five days from the date of the lodging of the decision. Indeed, as mentioned above, given the relevant dates in the present case, two suspension periods were applicable to the one year time-limit to appeal, and therefore the deadline was in fact one year and ninety days from the lodging of the impugned decision. Lastly, when the applicant managed to contact another lawyer (who was competent to plead before the Court of Cassation), after having seen the file the latter also informed him that she was not in a position to assist him on the basis that the time-limit to appeal had already expired. The Court notes that, in reality and as explained above, on that date the applicant still had two weeks, namely until 9 October 2008, to lodge his appeal. Therefore, this refusal by the lawyer was based on an erroneous premise.",

It is indeed also the lack of such knowledge which makes it necessary for a lay person to be represented by counsel. Therefore, the Court is of the view that such errors may, when critical to a person\u2019s access to court, and when incurable in so far as they are not made good by actions of the authorities or the courts themselves, result in a lack of practical and effective representation which incurs the State\u2019s liability under the Convention. In the present case, the advice of the two appointed legal aid lawyers, both of whom gave erroneous information regarding the applicable time-limit, and one of whom informed the applicant that he could no longer appeal, cannot but amount to a manifest error, which in the present case was fatal to the applicant\u2019s chances of appealing.",

Moreover, there does not appear to be any further step he could have taken within the Italian legal framework to ensure that his case had not been dismissed arbitrarily or, even assuming the lawyer had acted in good faith, as a result of wrong advice. Thus, as a consequence of failings in the system itself, namely in the way the relevant bodies directed the applicant and particularly the failings of the appointed lawyers, the applicant lost all possibility of pursuing an appeal against the impugned decision. Thus, in the Court\u2019s view these failings amounted to ineffective representation in special circumstances which incur the State\u2019s liability under the Convention.",

However, the national authorities\u2019 obligation to take measures to facilitate reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with children who have lived for some time with the other parent may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken (see Ignaccolo-Zenide v.

Moreover, even where removal has been wrongful, Article 13 provides for exceptions where the court is not bound to order the return of the child. In the light of the applicant\u2019s submissions, it must be recalled that it is not the Court\u2019s function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I). Moreover, the national courts are entrusted to resolve problems of interpretation and application of domestic legislation as well as rules of general international law or international agreement (see Maumousseau and Washington, cited above, \u00a7 79).
