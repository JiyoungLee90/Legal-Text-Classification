That provision regulates offences against public order and is designed to regulate the manner in which demonstrations are to be held. Accordingly, the legal rule infringed by the applicant is directed towards all citizens and not towards a given group possessing a special status. The general character of the legal rule in question is further confirmed by Article\u00a01 and Article 12 of the CAO which refer to the fact that administrative responsibility comes into operation at the age of sixteen and all citizens must show respect for legal rules and the rights of other citizens and legal persons (see \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v.

This includes, inter alia, a right not only to be present, but also to hear and follow the proceedings. (see, for example, Stanford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 282A, \u00a7 26; Barbera\u0300, Messegue\u0301 and Jabardo v.\u00a0Spain judgment of 6 December 1988, Series A no. 146, \u00a7 78). This right is implicit in the very notion of an adversarial procedure and can also be derived from the guarantees contained in sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of paragraph 3 of Article 6 \u2013 \u201cto defend himself in person\u201d, \u201cto examine or have examined witnesses\u201d, and \u201cto have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court\u201d (see, Colozza v. Italy judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, \u00a7 27). It is difficult to see in the present case how the applicant could have exercised these rights without being present.",

The Court considers that the present case is distinguishable from those cases. In Kremzow and Kamasinski, the accused persons were represented by lawyers and in principle each had the possibility to organise his defence.
