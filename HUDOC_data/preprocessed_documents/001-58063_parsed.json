By itself it did not affect the content of ownership and did not make it impossible to dispose of the land concerned, especially as it lapsed after two years. For that reason, during that period, the declarations had not caused any interference or a transfer of or change to the title on the basis of which the applicants worked the land. In addition, Legislative Decree no. 173/84 had rendered the earlier measures nugatory and prevented them from being of any effect in the future. It had merely brought about a withdrawal of the concession, not an expropriation. Its effects had been suspended by a judgment of the  on 18 July 1985 and it had not caused any interference.

The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph (P1-1-1) and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph (P1-1-1), covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph (P1-1-2), recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not \"distinct\" in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property. They must therefore be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among other authorities, the Phocas v.  judgment of 23 April 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 541-42, para. 51).",

The applicants submitted that the combined effects of the five measures had resulted in a de facto expropriation of their possessions. The first two measures were indeed expropriation measures since, under Portuguese law, a public-interest declaration set in motion the expropriation procedure and was followed merely by an enforcement measure. The third measure was actually entitled expropriation. Yet no compensation was paid to the applicants. The owner lost all right to sell his property in its previous condition; he could only transfer precarious rights. In any event, it was no longer possible to work normally land that was subject to three public- interest declarations, several prohibitions including one on building, several easements and an authorisation enabling the State to take immediate possession of the land.",

The effects of the measures are not such that they can be equated with deprivation of possessions. As the Delegate of the Commission stated, the position was not irreversible as it had been in the case of Papamichalopoulos and Others v.  (judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 260-B, p. 70, paras. 44-45). The restrictions on the right to property stemmed from the reduced ability to dispose of the property and from the damage sustained by reason of the fact that expropriation was contemplated. Although the right in question had lost some of its substance, it had not disappeared. The Court notes, for example, that all reasonable manner of exploiting the property had not disappeared seeing that the applicants continued to work the land. The second sentence of the first paragraph (P1-1-1) is therefore not applicable in the instant case.",
