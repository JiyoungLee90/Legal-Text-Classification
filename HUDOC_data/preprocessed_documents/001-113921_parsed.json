The trial court noted that some of the essential characteristics of fraud and forgery were lacking. The applicant had not derived (and had not even intended to derive) any personal profit from the scheme and had not forged any official documents, but rather had given the organisation\u2019s members reason to believe that the reconfiguration of the plots and building permits issued in the name of the organisation were valid acts. So, in the view of the court, the applicant was guilty of the offence of taking the law into his own hands rather than fraud and forgery. Accordingly, the court acquitted the applicant under Article 327 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 and Article 159 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code. The court, however, convicted the applicant under Article\u00a0330 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code of taking the law into his own hands, and sentenced him to compulsory work for a term of 200\u00a0hours.

As a result, it was not until July\u2013August 2002, that is, six months after the alleged beatings, that most of those involved in the incident were questioned for the first time. It was also not until August 2002 that the forensic medical expert examined the applicant\u2019s medical file and, for the obvious reason of the remoteness of the events in question, was unable to establish the time when the applicant\u2019s injuries might have occurred (see paragraph 38 above). The delay in the institution of the criminal proceedings made it impossible later in the investigation to identify the ambulance doctors who had examined the applicant at the police station and to hold a forensic medical examination so as to determine whether the applicant could have received his injuries as a result of his fall on the floor (see paragraph 51 above). The Court has previously held that any unjustified delay in the institution of criminal proceedings and the gathering of essential evidence constitutes such a serious omission that the prospect of remedying the resulting damage by any subsequent investigation is rather doubtful (see, mutatis mutandis, Nechto v. Russia, no.\u00a024893/05, \u00a7\u00a087, 24\u00a0January 2012).",
