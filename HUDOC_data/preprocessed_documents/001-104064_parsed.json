Denmark, no. 10326/83, Commission decision of 6\u00a0September 1983, Decisions and Reports 35, p. 218; Prystavska v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no. 21287/02, 17 December 2002; and Denisov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a033408/03, 6 May 2004). Nor were there, in the Court's opinion, any special circumstances in the present case requiring the applicant to avail herself of that extraordinary remedy. In particular, Article 228 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure prescribed the possibility of reopening a case on the ground of newly discovered circumstances. This notion implied circumstances which existed at the material time but were unknown to the parties. The Court notes that the applicant's case was examined in August\u00a02004, while the above Government Decree was adopted only on 16\u00a0March 2006. Thus, the Decree in question could not be considered as a \u201cnewly discovered circumstance\u201d within the meaning of the above Article\u00a0228 (1) and any attempt to reopen the case on the ground suggested by the Government would have been futile. It follows that the Government's objection as to non-exhaustion must be dismissed.",

Furthermore, an ad hoc committee was set up at the National Assembly by its decision of 10 September 2003 which was also entrusted with the examination of that issue. As a result, the law on the 2006 State budget was enacted, which entered into force on 1 January 2006, and Government Decree no.\u00a0352-N was adopted on 6 April 2006, which prescribed the procedure and conditions for providing compensation to the depositors. This entire process was public and individuals were able to be informed about the joint measures taken by the Government and the National Assembly. Thus, the examination of a claim by a single person by the courts, in circumstances where a common solution was still in the process of being developed, would have had a negative impact on the entire process. In particular, all the individuals who had deposits with the Savings Bank, whose number exceeded 400,000, would have started lodging similar claims with the courts. The courts were therefore refusing to admit such claims for examination on the merits until the relevant legal basis for the recovery of deposits was created in April 2006.",

The Court shares the Government's position as regards the pursuit of a legitimate aim by this limitation. It notes that the applicant's claim arose as a consequence of the collapse of the Soviet rouble and the total withdrawal of that currency from circulation without solving the issue of individual savings in Soviet roubles.  was faced with an immense task of building its own monetary system and addressing the problems caused by the collapse of the previous monetary system. Indeed, the examination of a claim of a single individual, regardless of its outcome, could have had a negative impact on the process of recovery of deposits as a whole, a problem that required a comprehensive rather than an individual solution in view of the high number of persons affected. The Court therefore considers that the refusal to examine the applicant's claim on the above-mentioned grounds pursued a legitimate aim, namely ensuring a smooth and effective implementation of the recovery process.",

The Court notes in this respect that the question of recovery of savings has been at the centre of attention of the authorities for a number of years and gradual steps have been taken to solve the issue, including the adoption in 2006 of a procedure providing a possibility for the most vulnerable categories of depositors to claim compensation for devaluation of their savings (see paragraphs 26-28 above).

Thus, from 2001 the Savings Bank was a private company and the State bore no responsibility for its relations with private individuals, including its obligation to return the deposits. The State had only assumed the responsibility for the future possible indexation of the deposits and acted as a guarantor of their repayment. For that purpose on 5\u00a0July\u00a01993 the Government adopted Decree no. 345, whereby it indexed various types of savings deposited with the Savings Bank. The Government further introduced a monetary reform in November 1993, converting the former  roubles into Armenian drams at a rate of 200/1 and thereby secured the repayment of the deposits. Thus, any depositor, including the applicant, is entitled to receive his deposits at any point at the above-mentioned rate.
