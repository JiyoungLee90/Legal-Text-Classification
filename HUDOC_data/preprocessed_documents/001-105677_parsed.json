The decision stated that, on the date in question, the servicemen of military unit no. 3660 had been carrying out a special operation in the vicinity of Chechen-Aul, and that, in order to destroy a place which was supposed to be a terrorist arms and ammunition store, and which the terrorists had transformed into a base from which they had strafed a federal checkpoint, the servicemen, following their commanding officers\u2019 order, had blown up the mill complex belonging to the company, with the result that it had been completely destroyed. The decision further stated that the actions of the commanding officers and servicemen of military unit no.\u00a03660 had been based on section 21 of the Federal Law on Suppression of Terrorism (\u201cthe Suppression of Terrorism Act\u201d), had been rendered absolutely necessary by unlawful actions of unidentified illegal fighters putting the federal servicemen\u2019s lives in real danger, and had been aimed at eliminating that danger. The decision went on to note that the danger could not have been eliminated by any other means, and therefore the destruction of the company\u2019s property had not constituted a criminal offence. It thus concluded that there had been no evidence of a crime in the servicemen\u2019s actions. The decision also stated that, taking into account the aforementioned circumstances and the fact that the pecuniary damage had been inflicted on a third person who had not performed any actions that would have rendered the infliction of damage absolutely necessary, a question of compensation for that damage should be resolved by a civil procedure.",

He further stated that the Chechen-Aul local council in its decision, of 26 February 1992, (see paragraph 24 above), had authorised the company to build a petrol station, that the construction had been completed on 13 April 1993, and that the petrol station had been acknowledged by a competent State authority as commissioned and fully operational (see paragraph 25 above). The applicant pointed out that the company had duly registered the property title to the petrol station with the Bureau of Technical Inventory (see paragraph 27 above), but no documents confirming the formal transfer of the title in respect of the petrol station to the company had ever been drawn up. The applicant also stated that on 26 December 1993 the Chechen-Aul local council had also authorised the company to build a mill complex (see paragraph 26 above). According to him, the construction had been completed in late 1993 [apparently a mistake, should read 1994] and the mill complex started functioning with a production capacity of 100 tons of flour per day. The applicant stated that he had been unable to comply with the procedure whereby a new construction should be accepted by an appropriate State authority as commissioned and fully operational, because of the beginning of military actions in the  at that time. He also stated that the company had registered the property title to the mill complex with the Bureau of Technical Inventory (see paragraph 27 above), but no documents confirming the formal transfer of the title to the mill complex to the company had ever been drawn up. The applicant further claimed, with reference to the contract of 10 April 1999 (see paragraph 28 above), that the company had purchased various equipment for the mill. He went on to state that from late 1999, when the second counter-terrorism operation in the Chechen Republic started, until late 2001, military unit no.\u00a03660 had been stationed on the Voskhod company site, including in the mill complex, and that servicemen of that unit had disassembled the equipment. After military unit no. 3660 had been transferred to another location, the servicemen of that unit had blown up the mill complex building. According to the applicant, prior to the events in question no survey of the petrol station and mill complex had been done. The applicant further referred to an estimate of 15 September 2001 (see paragraph 33 above) and stated that at present the amount necessary to restore the petrol station and mill complex was considerably higher than that indicated in the estimate.",

In this respect, they argued that there was no entry in the Uniform State Register of Rights to Immovable Property and Transactions therewith confirming the property title of the Voskhod company to the mill complex (see paragraph 30 above), and that there was no information as to whether any taxes had been paid from that immovable property.

Also, the extract of 1\u00a0July 2008 from the Uniform State Register of Legal Entities revealed that one of the business activities of the Voskhod company was the production of flour, flour blends and pastry preparations for baking (see paragraph 23 above). The Court further considers that the historical context in which the relevant events of the case took place is also of a direct relevance. Indeed, it is clear from the applicant\u2019s explanation of 27 June 2008 that the completion of the construction of the mill complex coincided with the outbreak of hostilities in the  in late 1994 (see paragraph\u00a036 above).

In this respect the Government argued that it was extremely difficult clearly to define in law the scope, and the manner of exercise, of the powers vested in State agents acting within the zone of the counter-terrorism operation, because of the specific nature of such an operation and the specific nature of the warfare. They also explained the broad wording of section 21 of the Suppression of Terrorism Act by the need to respond quickly to changing circumstances within the zone of a counter-terrorism operation and to take instant decisions to save human lives.

According to the Government, the presence of federal servicemen within a certain territory had not excluded the possibility of combat encounters taking place between them and illegal fighters. The Government insisted with reference to the relevant findings in the decision of the prosecutor\u2019s office of military unit no. 20102 dated 25 May 2001 (see paragraph 12 above), that in 2000, in the period when illegal armed formations had been showing violent armed resistance, illegal fighters had on numerous occasions used the mill complex in question to fire on federal servicemen of military unit 3660 stationed nearby and also others travelling on the road. Therefore the commanding officers of military unit no. 3660 had taken a decision to blow up the mill complex, such actions having been absolutely necessary in order to eliminate danger emanating from illegal fighters and to protect human lives. In the Government\u2019s submission, that danger could not have been eliminated by any other means.

The Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s argument to the effect that it was difficult to define clearly the scope and manner of the exercise of powers of State agents participating in a counter-terrorism operation, and that the broad wording of section 21 was necessary to allow State agents to adapt themselves quickly to changing circumstances and to take instant decisions in the course of such an operation. In this respect, the Court reiterates that in matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a030985/96, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2000XI).

The Court notes that both these documents referred to costs of repair works necessary to restore the mill complex and petrol station rather than to new build. It further observes that the first-instance commercial court in the domestic proceedings agreed with the sum indicated in the working estimate of 15 September 2001 as the amount of pecuniary damage suffered by the Voskhod company, and also does not seem to have disputed that that amount should be index-linked in line with inflation (see paragraph 14 above). In such circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the aforementioned two documents submitted by the applicant, their authenticity or amounts indicated therein having not been contested by the Government, reflected the amount of actual pecuniary damage sustained by him, adjusted in line with the index of prices in the third quarter of the year 2002. It thus finds that the amount of compensation of pecuniary damage should be equal to the amount indicated in the report of 11 September 2002, that is to EUR\u00a0340,000, even though it differs from the amount indicated by the applicant in his claim for compensation brought before the domestic courts (see paragraph 13 above).",
