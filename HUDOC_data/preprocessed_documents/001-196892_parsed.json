Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of that law (see Ilnseher v.\u00a0Germany [GC], nos. 10211/12 and 27505/14, \u00a7 135, 4\u00a0December 2018, and S., V. and A. v.

However, these words do not merely refer back to domestic law. They also relate to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. On this last point, the Court stresses that where deprivation of liberty is concerned it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 9192, and Del R\u00edo Prada v. Spain [GC], no.\u00a042750/09, \u00a7\u00a0125, ECHR 2013, with further references).",

In these circumstances, it is hard to accept that the applicant was taken into police custody and kept for almost seven hours for identification. Consequently, it has not been established that the applicant\u2019s arrest was in keeping with the administrative escorting measure allowed by the Police Act (see paragraph 20 above).",
