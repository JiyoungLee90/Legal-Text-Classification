Such action is not governed per se by statute but has emerged from case-law. An action for recovery of possession can be defined as the bringing of proceedings to enforce a right in rem in which a dispossessed owner claims back his or her property from the person currently in possession of it. The main outcome of such an action, if successful, is the acknowledgment by the court of the claimant's title to the property, with retrospective effect, thus obliging the defendant to return the property. If physical restitution is no longer possible, that obligation is replaced by an obligation to pay compensation on the basis of an equivalent sum (see, for example, Liviu Pop, Dreptul de proprietate \u015fi dezmembr\u0103mintele sale (Ownership and its Attributes), Lumina Lex, Bucharest 1997, pp. 278-90, and Ion Dogaru and T.

Whilst an action for tortious liability enables the injured party to claim exact reparation for the loss sustained as a result of negligence on the part of an enriched person, in an action for unjust enrichment the claimant can only seek an amount corresponding to the other party's gain, provided that some pecuniary benefit has been obtained, without just cause, at the expense of the claimant (see Terr\u00e9, Simmler and Lequette, op. cit., p. 744, and Filipescu, op. cit., p. 98).",

As the proceedings brought by the applicants had resulted in a declaration that the nationalisation had been unlawful, their title to the flat had accordingly been acknowledged, with retrospective effect. Given that at the time of the sale the applicants had already brought an action against the State, asserting that the nationalisation had been unlawful, and that the existence of the proceedings was indicated in the land register, the sale could not have been lawful. As evidence of the unlawfulness of the sale, the applicants pointed out that the other flats in the house had not been sold to their tenants, precisely because an action was pending in the courts. Those flats had been returned to the applicants as a result of their action for recovery of possession.

In their submission, the case had been of a certain complexity, since it had concerned a nationalised building and a number of questions had therefore had to be studied: the entries in the land register and the interpretation of various expressions used in the relevant legislation, namely \u201cnationalisation with a document of title\u201d and \u201cnationalisation without a document of title\u201d. Moreover, the legislation had been amended during this period and this had made the case even more complex to examine. In this connection, the Government relied on the precedents of Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy ([GC], no. 32967/96, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, ECHR 2002I), and Constandache (cited above), and on the fact that the length of proceedings had been reasonable in each of the seven courts, to show that the period taken into consideration had been reasonable. With regard to the applicants' conduct, they considered that the successive adjournments requested by the parties \u2013 including the applicants \u2013 to instruct a lawyer, to prepare their defence or to involve the heirs in the proceedings had resulted in the determination of the case being delayed by over one year and eight months.",
