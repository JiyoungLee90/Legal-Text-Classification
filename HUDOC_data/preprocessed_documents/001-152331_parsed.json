In particular, in twenty-two of the member States surveyed, the domestic Code of Civil Procedure explicitly provides for the possibility for a successful applicant to request review of a civil case on the basis of a finding of a violation by the European Court of Human Rights or another international court. This is so for Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Georgia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Republic of Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland and Turkey. In all those States, requests for review are to be made to a court. However, the level of jurisdiction differs from member State to member State. In some, it is the highest court which entertains the request, that is the Supreme Court (which is the case in Albania, Azerbaijan, Estonia and Lithuania) or the Constitutional Court (the Czech Republic). In others, the request is made to the court whose decision is challenged (Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia). Normally, review is not automatic and is subject to admissibility criteria, such as time-limits, an applicant\u2019s standing and substantiation of the request (this is the case, for example, in Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Georgia, Montenegro and Turkey). Some domestic provisions provide for other conditions to be met, for example that the serious consequence of the violation continues to exist (Romania), or that compensation has not remedied the breach (Slovakia), or that the applicant could not be compensated by any other means (Estonia).",

In particular, she argued that when dealing with her exceptional appeal the Supreme Court had failed to take into account the Court\u2019s findings under Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention in its judgment of 3 May 2007 pertaining to the domestic courts\u2019 assessment of the evidence (see paragraph 15 above). It had also omitted to address some important aspects of the case, notably the validity of the principal documentary evidence on which the domestic courts\u2019 decisions had been based. Moreover, its reasoning relating to the outcome of the applicant\u2019s previous application had contradicted the Court\u2019s findings in the judgment of 3 May 2007 (see paragraphs 13 and 18 above). According to the applicant, the unfair manner in which the Supreme Court had dealt with her exceptional appeal had entailed a fresh violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

So, for instance, in the Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) case (cited above), the Court found that it was competent to examine a complaint that the domestic court in question had dismissed an application to reopen proceedings following the Court\u2019s judgment. The Court relied mainly on the fact that the grounds for dismissing the application were new and therefore constituted relevant new information capable of giving rise to a fresh violation of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 65). It further took into account the fact that the Committee of Ministers had ended its supervision of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgment without taking into account the reopening refusal as it had not been informed of that decision. The Court considered that, from that standpoint also, the refusal in issue constituted a new fact (ibid, \u00a7 67). Similarly, in its recent judgment in Emre (cited above) the Court found that a new domestic judgment given following the reopening of the case, and in which the domestic court had proceeded to carry out a new balancing of interests, constituted a new fact. It also observed in this respect that the execution procedure before the Committee of Ministers had not yet commenced. Comparable complaints were, however, dismissed in Schelling v. Austria (no. 2) (dec.), no. 46128/07, 16 September 2010, and Steck-Risch and Others v. Liechtenstein (dec.), no. 29061/08, 11 May 2010), as the Court considered that on the facts the decisions of the domestic courts refusing the applications for reopening were not based on or connected with relevant new grounds capable of giving rise to a fresh violation of the Convention. Further, in Steck-Risch and Others, cited above, the Court observed that the Committee of Ministers had ended its supervision of the execution of the Court\u2019s previous judgment prior to the domestic court\u2019s refusal to reopen the proceedings and without relying on the fact that a reopening request could be made.

The applicant can in particular be understood as arguing that the shortcomings in the original domestic proceedings that formed the subject matter of the Court\u2019s 2007 judgment were not remedied in the proceedings culminating in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 14\u00a0March 2008, in that the Supreme Court failed to address the validity of the principal documentary evidence on which the contested decisions of the domestic courts had been based (see paragraph 29 above).

By virtue of the following provision in the Code (Article 354 \u00a7 1), \u201ca finding by an international judicial authority, whose jurisdiction has been recognised by Ukraine, that a [domestic] judicial decision violated the international commitments of Ukraine\u201d was one of the two grounds on which such an exceptional appeal could be brought. Article\u00a0357 of the Code further defined \u201cexamination of a case in the light of exceptional circumstances\u201d as being \u201ca kind of cassation procedure\u201d, with the Supreme Court having the same powers of review as it had in cassation proceedings and the exceptional appeal being subject to the same procedure as in cassation appeals. The Supreme Court\u2019s powers of disposal of an exceptional appeal were likewise comparable to those it possessed in cassation appeals. Thus, the exceptional-appeal proceedings could result in one of the different types of decisions set out in Article 358 of the Code, in particular in a decision \u201cto dismiss an appeal and to leave [the contested] decision unchanged\u201d, \u201cto quash, in full or in part, [the contested] judicial decision and to remit the case for fresh consideration to the [competent lower court]\u201d, \u201cto quash [the contested] decision of the court of appeal or of the court of cassation and to uphold a decision which was wrongly quashed\u201d, or \u201cto amend [the contested] decision or to adopt a new decision on the merits of the case\u201d.",

In the course of that examination, the Supreme Court reviewed the case materials and the court decisions from the original proceedings in the light of the applicant\u2019s new submissions based mainly on the Court\u2019s judgment of 3 May 2007 (see paragraphs 20-21 above).

Ukraine, no. 7577/02, \u00a7 39, 3 May 2007), to which Article 6 \u00a7 1 applied ratione materiae.

Furthermore, even where a Contracting State provides for the possibility of requesting a reopening of terminated judicial proceedings on the basis of a judgment of the Court, it is for the domestic authorities to provide for a procedure to deal with such requests and to set out criteria for determining whether the requested reopening is called for in a particular case.

We can therefore observe, in a very intuitive manner, that the examination of a cassation appeal constitutes in a sense a \u201cnatural prolongation\u201d of the original proceedings, focusing at that stage on issues concerning the interpretation of the applicable law and prolonging for the parties the state of uncertainty as to the outcome of the proceedings. The reopening of proceedings appears to be more exceptional and may occur a very long time after a final judicial decision was handed down in the original proceedings.",

It is a means of establishing the correct interpretation of the law and harmonising the case-law of the lower courts. Persons wishing to lodge an appeal of this kind must demonstrate the public interest in having it examined. By contrast, a request to reopen proceedings is very often not subject to any such condition. It may therefore serve to protect subjective rights without it being necessary to demonstrate that there is a public interest in having it examined. Moreover, injustices remedied by means of the reopening of proceedings and linked to factual errors are often much more glaring than the often unavoidable hesitations in interpreting the law which are overcome by means of a cassation appeal. Furthermore, cassation appeals are often subject to a preliminary filtering procedure enabling their admissibility to be assessed before they are examined on the merits.",

I note, for my part, that in some countries a cassation appeal has a number of similarities in this regard. During the first stage, the competent court examines the admissibility of the appeal. During the second stage, it rules on the merits, possibly setting aside the impugned judgment.

In these circumstances it would appear more convincing to regard Article 6 as being applicable \u2013 at least in principle \u2013 to all extraordinary remedies in judicial proceedings.

When one of the parties challenges before the Court the compatibility with the Convention of the procedure applied or the decision given, the outcome of the proceedings before the Court affects the rights and interests of the other parties. Although the Court examines the vertical relationship (that is, the relationship between the applicant and the State) and rules on violations of the Convention attributed to the State authorities, the judgment finding a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights on account of civil proceedings or of a judicial decision in a civil case will have a bearing on the protection afforded to the rights of the other parties to the proceedings and necessarily has a horizontal dimension, that is, pertaining to relations between private parties.

The need to secure the stability of final judicial decisions determining cases involving private parties and the legitimate interests of all the parties to the proceedings constitutes a strong argument against the reopening of civil proceedings following a judgment by the Court finding a violation of the Convention.
