The notion of necessity implies that the interference must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In assessing whether the contact restrictions were a disproportionate interference with the applicants\u2019 Article 8 rights, the Court must consider whether, in the light of the case as a whole, the reasons adduced to justify this measure were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, K. and T. v. Finland [GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7 154, ECHR 2001-VII). In carrying out that assessment it must be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned, often at the very stage when care measures are being envisaged or immediately after their implementation. The Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities for the regulation of the public care of children and the rights of parents whose children have been taken into care, but rather to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their powers (see, among others, Johansen v. Norway, 7 August 1996, \u00a7 64, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III).",

Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed (see Elsholz v. Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2000-VIII, and Kutzner v. Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2002I). In this connection, the Court recalls the principles set out in Neulinger and Shuruk v.\u00a0Switzerland case in so far as they are relevant also to the present context (see Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7\u00a7 134-6, 6\u00a0July 2010 and R. and H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 35348/06, \u00a7\u00a7 73-4, 31\u00a0May 2011). In particular, in all decisions concerning children, their best interests must be paramount. The child\u2019s best interests may thus, depending on their nature and seriousness, override those of the parents. The parents\u2019 interests, especially in having regular contact with their child, nevertheless remain a factor when balancing the various interests at stake (Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7 134).",

The latter also set out contact arrangements, which were restricted to one hour every two weeks under supervision. Such arrangements were maintained until sometime in 2010. The Court notes that the restrictions on the contact between the applicants and the children were based essentially on two grounds. Originally, they related to the circumstances of the death of W, who was the same age as Y. These circumstances led to a suspicion of domestic violence and neglect of W, which was later confirmed by the criminal court finding both applicants guilty of negligent manslaughter and the first applicant guilty of causing severe injuries to W. In the face of the circumstances in which W died, it was only reasonable for the welfare authority to be concerned about the risk the children could be exposed to at home and to take precautionary measures to protect X and Y, which included restricting contact with the applicants. Secondly, the reports drawn by the experts in psychology and psychiatry, one of whom was proposed by the applicants, all deemed the applicants unsuitable as parents and indicated their, in particular the first applicant\u2019s, negative influence on the children\u2019s well-being. The experts possessed the required skills and had been able to make a direct assessment of the situation: they were, apart from the first one, independent of the welfare authority. They all advised that the contact should not be extended beyond the initial arrangement, as this would be to the detriment of X and Y (see paragraphs 12, 19 and 25). The Court notes that in following the experts\u2019 proposal the welfare authorities were striving to safeguard the children\u2019s best interest. It finds that the reasons relied on in justifying the restriction imposed on the applicants\u2019 contact rights were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Convention",

Meetings between the applicants and the social workers were held regularly, and it would appear from the reports made in this connection that the applicants\u2019 wishes concerning the implementation of contact arrangements were adhered to as much as possible. The Court also observes that sustained efforts were made on the part of the authorities to facilitate contact and possible family reunification, and that the situation was regularly examined to see whether there had been any improvement in the family situation (see paragraphs\u00a03742 above). It would appear that for a number of years the situation had not improved, in large part due to the applicants\u2019 lack of a constructive attitude, which had been noted in the aforementioned reports as well as in the last expert\u2019s opinion from 2007 (see paragraphs 25, 26 and 39 above). The contact, one hour every two weeks, nevertheless took place. It would appear that in 2010 the situation improved, to which the authorities reacted by agreeing to extending the contact to the whole day without supervision. These arrangements appear to be agreed to by the applicants and in line with the wishes of the children, who have opposed more frequent contact (see paragraph 42 above). Since the first applicant started serving her prison sentence, the children continue to spend a day every two weeks with the second applicant and go with him to visit the first applicant in prison.",
