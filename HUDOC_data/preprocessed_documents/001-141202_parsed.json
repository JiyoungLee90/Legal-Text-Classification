They considered the present case to be relatively simple and involving little documentary evidence. The Government further noted that the applicants\u2019 legal position and documentary evidence had been the same in the domestic proceedings and the proceedings before the Court. Therefore, in their view, even though the case might have required a certain degree of research and preparation, it had not been necessary to the extent claimed by the applicants\u2019 lawyer.",

The Court notes that the applicants provided receipts confirming the postal expenses and the payment of legal fees to Mr\u00a0B.\u00a0Rybak for representing them in the domestic proceedings and before the Court. It follows from those receipts that the applicants paid RUB\u00a0100,000 for their legal representation before the Court, and the remaining sum \u2013 for their legal representation before the domestic courts. The Court notes, however, that the receipts for the applicants\u2019 legal representation in the domestic proceedings are not sufficiently detailed to determine the exact costs incurred in connection with the complaints which were declared admissible by the Court and in which the violations of the Convention were found. The Court is also mindful of the fact that the Government acknowledged the violation of the applicants\u2019 rights in all communicated complaints, and therefore their lawyer was relieved of any legal research at the stage of submission of the applicants\u2019 observations. Regard being had to the foregoing, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 5,000 covering the costs and expenses incurred by the applicants under all heads, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants.",
