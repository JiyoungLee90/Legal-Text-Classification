The first applicant challenged this before the Court of First Instance for the district of Zieme\u013cu, which upheld his claim and annulled the re-assessment. The Municipal Council appealed before the Regional Court of Riga, which, in a judgment of 10 January 2003, upheld the annulment of the re-assessment. According to that judgment, the land tax was attached to a plot of land and not to a specific individual; therefore, it could be paid by someone other than the owner. In that case, to the extent that it was the first applicant\u2019s land, the tax had already been paid by the public corporation that was responsible for the port\u2019s management and was using the land on the basis of a servitude. The Municipal Council lodged a cassation appeal with the Senate of the Supreme Court, which dismissed it in a judgment of 19\u00a0March 2003.",

The applicant brought annulment proceedings before the court of competent jurisdiction, which upheld his claim. The Municipal Council appealed and on 26 February 2002 the Regional Court of Riga annulled the judgment of the Court of First Instance, finding that the second applicant\u2019s land was not part of that for which the public corporation had paid land tax. That judgment was upheld at cassation level. However, in September 2003 the Senate of the Supreme Court re-opened the proceedings on account of newly discovered facts. The case file was sent to the Administrative Court of Appeal, which, in a judgment of 15 July 2005, upheld the second applicant\u2019s claim and annulled the disputed re-assessment on the ground that the port management company had already paid land tax for the land in question. On 7\u00a0February 2006 the Senate of the Supreme Court, ruling on a cassation appeal, upheld that judgment. The second applicant was therefore not obliged to pay any supplementary tax on his land.",

Thus, for example, property had not been returned to its legitimate owner in cases where the public interest required it to be left in the hands of the State. In certain other cases, the legislature had found it necessary to limit the amount of the compensation to be paid to the former owners by fixing as the ceiling the cadastral value of the land in question at 22 July 1940. More precisely, that ceiling had been applied twice: first in respect of the former owners of twenty-three plots of land occupied by  airport, and later in respect of Mr Visti\u0146\u0161 and Mr Perepjolkins. The Government explained that in 1940 the cadastral value of all the plots of land concerned had been very low; after Soviet annexation, strategically significant technical infrastructures had been built on them, such that after the restoration of independence the said value had increased considerably, without any investments having been made by the lawful owners. This had been the case for the applicants in particular.

In this connection, the Government pointed out that the same law had also been applied to the owners of the twenty-three plots of land occupied by  airport. Moreover, it could hardly be regarded as unreasonable for the legislature to depart from the ordinary procedure for a number of practical reasons, in particular the lack of budgetary resources that made it impossible for the State to award the owners compensation at the level of the land\u2019s current cadastral value.

That choice could not be criticised per se as it corresponded to the general principle of international law restitutio ad integrum; moreover, the interests had been duly balanced by the legislature before its adoption.

Unlike an airport, whose location was determined by a large number of technical factors, the strategic importance of a plot of land along a major waterway was always practically the same. It was not true that only the construction of a port would add value to that land: in reality, at the present time, most of the plots of land in  on the banks of the Daugava were included within the port\u2019s territory, but were nevertheless still owned by private individuals. In the applicants\u2019 submission, the restrictions imposed on those owners by the Free Port Act sufficed to ensure the proper functioning of the port\u2019s facilities, without requiring expropriation. In their opinion, the authorities\u2019 wish to expropriate their land was directly related to the fact that they had succeeded in suing the Free Port of Riga for significant sums in rent arrears. In other words, the real aim pursued by the State was to ensure that the port no longer had to pay rent to the applicants, by taking possession of the land at issue in return for a paltry sum.",

In the first place, the Latvian authorities had not applied the ordinary procedure laid down by the General Expropriation Act. Secondly, it was the State Land Authority, and not the competent court, that had finally fixed the amount of the compensation to be paid.

The legal norms upon which the deprivation of property is based should therefore be in accordance with the domestic law of the Contracting State, including the relevant provisions of the Constitution (see Former King of Greece and Others (merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79 and 82, and Jahn and Others v.

Italy, no.\u00a075909/01, \u00a7 109, 20 January 2009). On this particular point, the Court would strongly emphasise the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention mechanism. The national authorities have direct democratic legitimation and are, as the Court has held on many occasions, in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. In matters of general social and economic policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, the role of the domestic policy-maker should be given special weight (see, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, \u00a7\u00a097, ECHR 2003VIII). This principle also applies in terms of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of an interference: in certain circumstances relating to a general policy of the State for which a large number of specific problems and situations have to be taken into account and to which the policy has to be adapted in order to be implemented successfully, the level of normative precision required in other cases will not have to be attained. For example, in the context of reforms carried out in a State after its transition from a totalitarian regime to a democracy \u2013 especially in the particular case of States of central and eastern Europe \u2013 the Court has accepted that the criterion of lawfulness may be much more flexible than in ordinary circumstances (see Velikovi and Others v.

First the Government submitted to Parliament an expropriation proposal that had to satisfy certain criteria. On the basis of that proposal, Parliament enacted a special law ordering the expropriation of the property or properties concerned. Then the public authority for whose benefit the expropriation had been decided would enter into negotiations with the owner for the purpose of reaching a friendly agreement as to the amount of the compensation; if those negotiations failed, the authority would refer the matter to the court of competent jurisdiction, which would settle the dispute and fix the final sum to be paid in compensation.",

Admittedly, at the time of their expropriation, all the disputed properties had already been finally denationalised and allocated to individual owners; the properties were thus disposable on the open market like any other real estate. However, on this point the Court cannot adopt a purely formalistic approach and ignore the general context of the case. Such an approach would have the effect of depriving the domestic legislature of any possibility of rectifying ex post facto manifestly unfair situations created by the property restitution process (see, mutatis mutandis, Jahn and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a084 and 92). In the present case it should first be observed that the restitution of the properties at issue to the heirs of the former owners, followed by their donation to the applicants and then their expropriation, all took place within no more than a few years, the period in issue thus being relatively short and condensed. Secondly, the Court notes that Article 2 of the Supreme Council\u2019s decision of 1992 fixing the method for calculation of compensation expressly referred to the case of denationalised property; and since section 3 of the 1997 expropriation law refers to it, the two provisions must be read in conjunction (see paragraphs 41-42 above). In other words, as the national legislature itself linked the deprivation of the property in issue to the general legal framework of property restitution, the Court has no reason to call that link into question.",

The Court does not rule out the possibility for the legislature to have recourse to such specific and targeted laws in situations which, in the broader context, fall within the domain of general social and economic policy-making, provided, however, that such action is justified and that the fundamental principles of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are upheld. In the field at issue, the process of denationalisation frequently leads to a large number of related problems, often of a complex and sensitive nature, that the authorities are called upon to resolve, such, as for example, cases of fraudulent or unjust enrichment, or the restitution of property on which, in the meantime, costly and strategically important infrastructures have been built. In particular, restitution laws may often contain hidden legal loopholes capable of creating situations of flagrant injustice and enabling certain persons to derive an undue advantage from them. The legislature, in rectifying such injustices on grounds of fairness and social justice, must therefore be afforded particularly broad discretion (see, mutatis mutandis, Jahn and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0113-116). The Court thus recognises that the adoption of specific and targeted laws in this kind of situation may be justified under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In the present case, it does not find anything in the law of 30 October 1997 that is unreasonable or manifestly in breach of the fundamental principles of that provision.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities accordingly enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Furthermore, the notion of \u201cpublic interest\u201d is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Former King of Greece and Others (merits), cited above, \u00a7 87; James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 98; and Beyeler v.

The Court thus notes that the applicants themselves initially agreed to assess their properties at a fairly low value. The parties agreed that this assessment had by no means corresponded to the actual value of the property and that its sole purpose had been to establish a basis for the calculation of the registration tax. For its part, the Court notes that the applicants\u2019 good faith as to the acquisition of the property in question was not called into question at domestic level (see, mutatis mutandis, N.A. and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a037451/97, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 2005X).

Greece, no. 43622/98, \u00a7\u00a051, ECHR 2001II). The Court can only note an extreme disproportion between the two property values: the current cadastral value and the 1940 value, which corresponded to the compensation received by the applicants. The compensation received by the first applicant constituted less than one thousandth of the cadastral value of his land, whereas the total sum of the compensation awarded to the second is some 350 times lower than the total cadastral value of all his properties (see, mutatis mutandis, Urb\u00e1rska Obec Tren\u010dianske Biskupice v.

In the Court\u2019s view it is clear that this very significant increase in the value of the properties concerned reflected the development of the port facilities now to be found on the land and the complete change in its strategic importance over the past few decades, these being objective factors to which neither the applicants nor the former owners have contributed in any way.",

Since the applicants have never argued that the compensation they received was any lower than that value, the Court cannot but observe that the situation of which they complained before the Court stemmed directly from a legislative instrument.

The donees had obtained their land free of charge and had not invested in its development, whereas the purchasers had acquired theirs at considerable expense. The situations of the two categories of owner were thus not similar, or even comparable.

Moreover, Article 14 of the Convention does not prevent, in principle, Contracting States from introducing general policy schemes by way of legislative measures whereby a certain category or group of individuals is treated differently from others, provided that the difference in treatment which results for the statutory category or group as a whole can be justified under the Convention and its Protocols (see, as a recent authority, \u015eerife Yi\u011fit v.

I am not questioning the public-interest grounds for the expropriation, although I do have some doubts about the \u201cconditions provided for by law\u201d. However, for me, the real problem is the question of \u201cproportionality\u201d and \u201cfair balance\u201d.",

However, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value would normally constitute a disproportionate interference and runs counter to the fundamental principles of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (this is in fact pointed out in paragraph 83 of the judgment).",

The land in question had been finally denationalised in favour of the heirs of the lawful owners in the early 1990s; subsequently (in 1994) it was allocated to the applicants under contracts of donation. Therefore, at the time the special expropriation law of 30 October 1997 was enacted the property had already been, for several years, completely in the private domain, regardless of the legal instruments giving rise to that situation (provided, of course, that those instruments were legal). Thus, the majority\u2019s argument to the effect that \u201cthe restitution of the properties at issue to the heirs of the former owners, followed by their donation to the applicants and then their expropriation, all took place within no more than a few years, the period in issue thus being relatively short and condensed\u201d (paragraph 76 of the judgment), apart from being devoid of legal relevance, does not serve to justify the very small sums awarded to the applicants by way of compensation (sums representing less than 5%, not even of the actual value of the property in question, but of the value of the rent received by the new owner of the property, namely the Government).",

No problem ever arose in relation to either of these aspects. Similarly, I find it inappropriate to emphasise that the property had been acquired by donation, \u201cthat is to say free of charge\u201d (paragraph 93) and to refer to a \u201cwindfall\u201d (paragraph 94). Lastly, whilst agreeing with the idea that the State has a duty to resolve related problems, which are often complex and sensitive, arising from a denationalisation process, I find that to cite the example of \u201cfraudulent enrichment\u201d is inappropriate in the present case (paragraph 77).",
