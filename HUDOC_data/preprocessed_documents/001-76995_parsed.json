The Court considers that the delay before the House of Lords derived, to a large extent, from the failure by the State to take adequate steps to advance the proceedings and, more generally, to organise its system in such a way as to meet its Convention obligations (see also Mitchell and Holloway v. the , no. 44808/98, \u00a7\u00a054, 17 December 2002).",
