She pointed out that, as she had attained the age of majority, her confinement in the clinic should have required a court order. She disputed that the health authorities, by virtue of their supervisory powers, were sufficiently able to say whether this requirement had been complied with. She stressed that during her stay in the clinic, in which she had been prevented from escaping by, inter alia, being administered medication by force, she had not been in a position to secure help from outside. The telephone had been monitored by the clinic personnel and only her father had visited her, and he would not have taken any steps to obtain her release. She pointed out that the possible protection awarded to persons confined to mental institutions by the creation of a Board of Visitors pursuant to section 34 of the Act on measures of aid and protection in cases of mental disorders (see paragraphs 59-60 above) had not been effective in her case. That Act, the enactment of which demonstrated the State\u2019s acknowledgment of a need for protection in this respect, had only come into force on 9 July 1979 \u2013 that is, after her initial detention in Dr Heines\u2019s clinic. Further, it did not entitle the health authorities to supervise mental institutions such as that clinic, which had not been authorised to admit persons confined pursuant to a court order. She argued that only an ombudsman, whom patients could contact at any time, could have adequately safeguarded her rights. Finally, neither the provisions of German civil law nor the safeguards of criminal law had offered her adequate protection against unlawful deprivation of liberty. While providing retroactive sanctions, they could not prevent the deprivation of liberty itself from occurring or continuing.

The applicant had brought her action against Dr Heines\u2019s clinic in 1997, eighteen years after the end of her initial treatment there. According to Article 852 \u00a7 1 of the Code, for the purposes of limitation, time for a claim in tort started to run when the person concerned learned that damage had been caused to him by a particular person. As had been correctly found by the Bremen Court of Appeal, the applicant had already known at the time when she had been confined in the clinic that she had \u2013 allegedly \u2013 been detained there against her will. This was proved by the expert opinions to the effect that she had, in fact, not suffered from schizophrenia at the relevant time. She had also been able to train as a draughtswoman (technische Zeichnerin) and to obtain a driving licence. She had therefore possessed the necessary intellectual capacities to have knowledge of the relevant facts. Consequently, the Bremen Court of Appeal had been entitled to assume that on her release from the clinic in 1981, at the latest, the applicant could have had the necessary knowledge and could also have been reasonably expected to bring her action in tort against the clinic. In any event, these were questions of fact to be resolved by the competent national courts.",

She had not objected to her admission to the hospital or to her medical treatment. It had also not been arbitrary for the court to conclude that this contract had not been terminated by her various attempts to escape from the clinic. The additional findings of that court concerning a possible contract concluded by the applicant\u2019s father with the clinic for the benefit of the applicant \u2013 which would not have entitled the clinic to treat her against her will \u2013 were therefore not decisive for its conclusion.",

It was already questionable whether Article 5 of the Convention incorporated such a positive obligation at all. In any event, German law provided multiple instruments for an individual to be protected against interferences with his liberty. Firstly, confinement in a psychiatric hospital had to be ordered by a judge. Secondly, the competent health authorities had far-reaching supervisory powers in monitoring the execution of these court orders. Thirdly, section 34 of the Act on measures of aid and protection in cases of mental disorders (see paragraphs 59-60 above), which came into force on 9 July 1979, introduced a Board of Visitors to monitor the detention of persons ordered under the Act in psychiatric hospitals. It thereby created a further innovative mechanism of protection. Fourthly, a person who deprived another person of his liberty incurred a prison sentence of up to ten years under Article 239 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 62 above). An individual who had been illegally deprived of his liberty also had the right to claim damages, including for non-pecuniary damage, under Articles 823 and 847 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 63 above). Furthermore, in accordance with section 30 of the Conduct of Trade Act (see paragraph 61 above), the running of a private clinic required a licence issued by the State. In the course of the examination of the application lodged by Dr Heines\u2019s clinic for the issuing and extension of such a licence, the competent State authorities had verified that the clinic\u2019s management was reliable and that it provided sufficient medical treatment for its patients.",

With respect to this, the Court refers to its above findings regarding the question whether the applicant was deprived of her liberty (see paragraphs 71-78 above). Assuming that she had the capacity to consent, there is no factual basis whatsoever for the assumption that the applicant, who had clearly objected to her stay and had tried to escape on several occasions, had consented to her stay and treatment at the clinic, thereby implicitly concluding a contract. If the applicant, in the alternative, had not been capable of consenting following her immediate treatment with strong medication, she could in any event not be considered to have validly concluded a contract. Given this finding, a contract concluded implicitly between the applicant\u2019s father and the clinic for the benefit of the applicant at the age of 18, which the Court of Appeal assumed in the alternative, could not have authorised her detention against her will.

Belgium, judgment of 23 November 1983, Series A no. 70, pp. 14-15, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30, and Wo\u015b, cited above, \u00a7 60). The Court would point out that in Costello-Roberts (cited above, p. 58, \u00a7\u00a7 27-28) the State was held responsible for the act of a headmaster of an independent school on account of its obligation to secure to pupils their rights guaranteed by Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention. The Court finds that, similarly, in the present case the State remained under a duty to exercise supervision and control over private psychiatric institutions. Such institutions, in particular those where persons are held without a court order, need not only a licence, but also competent supervision on a regular basis of whether the confinement and medical treatment is justified.",

In this case, the competent health authority also had powers to supervise the execution of these court orders. However, in the applicant\u2019s case, the clinic, despite her lack of consent, had not obtained the necessary court order. Therefore, no public health officer had ever assessed whether the applicant \u2013 which was more than doubtful \u2013 posed a serious threat to public safety or order within the meaning of section 2 of the Act of the  on the detention of mentally insane persons, mentally deficient persons and drug addicts. Consequently, the State likewise did not exercise any supervision of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention in the clinic for approximately twenty months.",

Moreover, a victim can, under German civil law, claim compensation in tort for damage caused by an unlawful detention. However, the Court, having regard to the importance of the right to liberty, does not consider that such retrospective measures alone provide effective protection for individuals in such a vulnerable position as the applicant. It notes that, particularly in the Act of the  on the detention of mentally insane persons, mentally deficient persons and drug addicts, there were numerous \u2013 necessary \u2013 safeguards for persons detained in a mental institution following a court order. However, these safeguards did not apply in the more critical cases of persons confined in a psychiatric institution without such an order. It must be borne in mind that the applicant, once detained and treated with strong antipsychotic medication, was no longer in a position to secure independent outside help.",

Thereby, the public authorities, as shown above, were involved in the applicant\u2019s detention in the clinic, and yet her escape and obvious unwillingness to return did not entail any review of the lawfulness of her forced stay there. This indicates the great danger of abuse in this field, notably in cases such as that of the applicant, in which family conflicts and an identity crisis were at the root of her troubles and long detention in a psychiatric hospital. The Court is therefore not convinced that the supervision exercised by the State authorities merely in connection with the issuing of a licence for the running of a private clinic pursuant to section 30 of the Conduct of Trade Act sufficed to ensure competent and regular supervisory control in respect of a deprivation of liberty in such a clinic. Moreover, section 30 of the Conduct of Trade Act was not in force as such at the start of the applicant\u2019s detention in the clinic.",

It finds in particular that the Court of Appeal, in its interpretation of the provisions governing the time-limit for bringing the compensation claim \u2013 including the possibility of interrupting or suspending the running of time for the purposes of limitation \u2013 did not have sufficient regard to the applicant\u2019s poor state of health during and following her treatment at the clinic.

Under these circumstances, the Court, presuming that the applicant had the capacity to consent, is unable to discern any reasonable factual basis for the national courts\u2019 conclusion that the applicant continuously consented to her medical treatment, thereby having validly concluded and not terminated a contract.",

The Court, referring to its settled case-law, reiterates that there is a positive obligation on the State flowing from Article 8 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure and protect individuals\u2019 rights to respect for their private life (see, inter alia, X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, p. 11, \u00a7 23, and Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2003-VIII).",

It notes also that in the sphere of interferences with a person\u2019s physical integrity, German law provided for retrospective sanctions, assault being punishable by up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment under Articles 223 to 226 of the Criminal Code. Moreover, a person whose physical integrity had been harmed could claim damages in tort for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss. However, just as in cases of deprivation of liberty, the Court finds that such retrospective measures alone are not sufficient to provide appropriate protection of the physical integrity of individuals in such a vulnerable position as the applicant. The above findings as to the lack of effective State control over private psychiatric institutions at the relevant time (see paragraphs 103-08 above) are equally applicable as far as the protection of individuals against infringements of their physical integrity is concerned. The Court therefore concludes that the respondent State failed to comply with its positive obligation to protect the applicant against interferences with her private life as guaranteed by Article\u00a08 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Spain (Article 50), judgment of 13 June 1994, Series A no. 285-C, pp. 57-58, \u00a7\u00a7 16-20, and \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 127, ECHR 1999-IV). In the present case, the Court notes that it has found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 1 and\u00a08 with respect to the applicant\u2019s stay in Dr Heines\u2019s clinic from 1977 to 1979. It observes that the applicant had neither trained in nor practised the profession of a technical engineer, or draughtswoman, before her confinement in the clinic, so that the detention did not interfere with an existing source of income. The Court is aware that the applicant\u2019s involuntary placement in the clinic, her medical treatment there and its consequences for her health entailed a loss of opportunities with regard to her professional career. It cannot, however, speculate as to what profession the applicant would have taken up, or how much money she would have earned at a later stage if she had not stayed in the clinic from 1977 to 1979. Consequently, no clear causal connection between the applicant\u2019s loss of estimated earnings and her pensions calculated on that basis has been established. Likewise, the Court, on the basis of the material before it, cannot discern a clear causal connection between the applicant\u2019s confinement in Dr Heines\u2019s clinic and her claim for dentist\u2019s fees and auxiliary devices not covered by her health insurance.",

Consequently, no claim for damages can arise in this respect. As to her claim concerning her treatment at Dr Heines\u2019s clinic from 1977 to 1979, the Court finds that it can neither speculate as to the exact amount of pecuniary damage that will arise from her confinement in that clinic, nor as to whether there will be a causal link between such future damage and her treatment there. Therefore, the Court makes no award in respect of pecuniary damage.",

It notes again that the applicant was confined in the clinic without a legal basis and was treated there at a rather young age for a period of more than twenty months. The interference with the applicant\u2019s physical integrity as a result of her forced medical treatment was of particular gravity. It was the cause of the serious and irreversible damage to her health and, indeed, deprived her of the opportunity to lead an autonomous professional and private life. The Court points out that the applicant\u2019s case, as regards the assessment of non-pecuniary damage, must also be distinguished from cases like H.L. v. the United Kingdom (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 148-50). In the present case, it is most questionable, and indeed was not assumed by either of the parties, that the applicant could have been detained at all against her will as a person posing a serious threat to public safety or order under the applicable legislation (section 2 of the Act of the Land of Bremen on the detention of mentally insane persons, mentally deficient persons and drug addicts \u2013 see paragraph 53 above). Having regard to previous comparable applications in which there have also been substantive interferences with applicants\u2019 physical and moral integrity (see, for example, A. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2701, \u00a7 34, and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2001-III), and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 75,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, together with any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
