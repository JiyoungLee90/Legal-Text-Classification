In this respect the applicant submitted, first of all, that the essence of her complaint was to challenge the decisions of the local administration and the lawfulness of the sale contract, which did not represent any particular complexity from the standpoint of legal analysis. The case did not call for any lengthy process of establishing the factual circumstances, examination of witnesses or performing complex expert examinations. Secondly, the parties to the proceedings were determined as early as 25 February 1999, and no modifications in this regard were made by the end of the proceedings. The proceedings relating to other claims filed by the applicant did not obstruct the proceedings in question as they were not directly linked to the merits of the complaint at issue. Thirdly, neither the issue of succession after the decease of the applicant\u2019s mother could impede the proceedings, given that it had been settled as early as 1996-97. Since then the applicant had been acting on her own behalf. Finally, after the judgment of 19 November 1997 had been quashed by way of supervisory review it took the domestic courts one or two hearings to decide on the merits of the case.",

The applicant disagreed with the Government and argued that she had regularly attended the hearings with the exception of those of which she had not been duly notified. Furthermore, she contested the Government\u2019s argument as regards the alleged suspension of the proceedings from 23 May to 15 August 2003 upon her request.

Moreover, nine hearings were adjourned due to the failure of the defendants to appear, and the domestic authorities cannot be blamed for these delays. Finally, the Government noted that the courts of three levels of jurisdiction were actively involved in the applicant\u2019s case and examined the case four times, which demonstrates that the domestic courts did not stay idle. In reply the applicant submitted that the proceedings several times spanned three levels of jurisdiction, including the supervisory review, which shows that the courts delayed the proceedings by committing numerous violations of substantive and procedural provisions of the domestic law. Furthermore, the applicant pointed out several instances of unjustified delays caused by the domestic authorities. In particular, from 25 February 1999 to 29 March 2000 six hearings were scheduled, of which only one took place. From 21\u00a0June 2000 to 3 May 2001 six hearings were scheduled and only one of them took place. On many occasions the hearings were postponed due to the absence of the defendants. Besides, several times the domestic court had failed to summon the applicant for the hearings. In particular, the applicant had not been notified of the hearings of 8 July 1999 and 24 September 1999, which had been confirmed by the decision of the regional court of 8\u00a0December 1999. The delay incurred therefrom amounted to eight months and twenty-one days. She further claimed not to have been notified of the hearings of 6\u00a0May and 26 November 2003, 14 January 2004. A delay of almost two months was caused by the decision of the district court of 18\u00a0September to transfer the case to another court.",

The Court finds that the task of the courts was rendered more difficult by these factors, although it cannot accept that the complexity of the case, taken on its own, was such as to justify the overall length of the proceedings (see Malinin v.

No appeal was lodged against the judgments, and they became binding and enforceable. On 13 February 2003, that is more than twenty months later, the judgments of 3\u00a0May and 14 May 2001 were quashed in the framework of the supervisory-review procedure initiated by the President of the  who was a State official and was not a party to the proceedings (see paragraph 19 above).",

Where a person actually possessed a property and was considered its owner for all legal purposes he or she can be said to have had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Zhigalev v. Russia, no.\u00a054891/00, \u00a7 131, 6 July 2006). Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that following the judgments of 3 May and 14\u00a0May 2001 the applicant obtained registration of her title to the disputed plot of land. The quashing of those judgments in supervisory-review procedure on 13 February 2003 led to invalidation of the applicant\u2019s title. Regard being had to its findings as to the compatibility of the above decision with the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 53 above), the Court finds that the setting aside of the final and binding judgments in the applicant\u2019s favour in supervisory review proceedings for the sake of correcting alleged factual and judicial errors constituted an unjustified interference with the applicant\u2019s possessions, protected by virtue of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Therefore, there has been a violation of this Convention provision.",
