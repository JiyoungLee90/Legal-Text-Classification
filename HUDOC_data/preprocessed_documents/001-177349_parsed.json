The appeal had been directed at the High Court\u2019s assessment of evidence as well as its application of the law. The disagreement in the Supreme Court concerned primarily the interpretation of the first paragraph of Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which, inter alia, journalists may refuse to answer questions as to who is the source of information confided to them for use in their work (see paragraph\u00a037 below).

However, the wording could not be given decisive weight. It emerged from the preparatory work that the legislature had not, with the chosen formulation, taken a stance on the issue at stake in the present case. There was therefore greater reason to assess whether the rationale underpinning the main rule, namely the right not to answer questions concerning the identity of the source, could also be given significant weight when the person, who had been the source of the information, had given evidence concerning his or her role and had confirmed being the source.

There was thus no cogent reason why such a conditional obligation to give evidence should lead to increased scepticism towards providing information to the press. The same would, to a great extent, be true if the obligation to give evidence also applied when the identity of the source had become known in some other way.

A person who so consented could do so, trusting that the recipient of the information would respect the protection of sources as long as the identity of the source was unknown. Once an informant had confirmed that he was the source, this fact would become known. Should the recipient of the information then refuse to give evidence, this would normally appear futile.

Consequently, a journalist\u2019s protection under Article 10 cannot automatically be removed by virtue of a source\u2019s own conduct. In the Court\u2019s view, these considerations are also relevant in a situation where a source comes forward, as in the present case. The Court would add, moreover, that it has previously held that source protection under Article 10 applies also where a source\u2019s identity was known to the investigating authorities before a search (see paragraph 70 above).",

However, the Court\u2019s task is broader. In assessing whether the interference was \u201cnecessary\u201d under Article 10 \u00a7 2 it has to examine whether relevant and sufficient reasons were adduced for the concrete judicial order to give testimony which was imposed on the applicant. Circumstances concerning Mr X\u2019s identity are only one element in that assessment.

Finally, it was then clarified that the applicant\u2019s appeal against the order would not be forwarded to the High Court until after the City Court\u2019s judgment in the case against Mr X had been delivered (see paragraph 14 above).

It took into account the fact that the domestic court was not prevented from considering the merits of the case (see paragraph\u00a069 above). While that finding was made in response to an argument that source disclosure had been necessary in order to ensure a fair trial for the accused (Voskuil, cited above, \u00a7 67), the Court considers that it must have a bearing also in the present case (see paragraphs 78-80 above).",

Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2004-XI) especially in view of the specific role of the media in exercising public scrutiny over public and private sectors in society and in increasing accountability and transparency. Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions of press freedom (see Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, 27\u00a0March 1996, \u00a7 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II) and a key aspect of journalistic work. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest. As a result, the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined and the ability to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected (see Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 38224/03, \u00a7 89, 14 September 2010).

The judgment also rightly acknowledges that X\u2019s identity cannot be decisive for the proportionality assessment (paragraph 75) as, according to the case-law, the fact that the source\u2019s identity is known does not remove a journalist\u2019s protection under Article 10 of the Convention (see Nagla v.

While the Court arrived at the right outcome in the present case, its approach, affording an unjustified wide margin of appreciation to States, may eventually lead to a finding of no violation in similar circumstances \u2013 a daunting prospect. The uncertainties derived from paragraph 76 are further exacerbated by the concluding statement in paragraph 83 that \u201ceven bearing in mind the appropriate level of protection applicable to the particular circumstances of the case ..., [the Court] is not convinced that the impugned order was justified by an \u2018overriding requirement in the public interest\u2019 ... or, therefore, necessary in a democratic society\u201d (emphasis added).",

                        "content": "Applying Convention principles developed under other circumstances, without explanation or context, does no good either to the consistency of the case-law or in general, the protection of freedom of expression. This is particularly troubling in the framework of the present case, which concerns a novel issue for the Court \u2013 the situation where the source identifies himself/herself and cooperates with the authorities. It should be recalled that the right of journalists not to disclose their sources is not \u201ca mere privilege to be granted or taken away ..., but is part and parcel of the right to information, to be treated with the utmost caution\u201d (see\u00a0Tillack v. Belgium, no.\u00a020477/05, \u00a7 65, 27 November 2007). The Court has previously found that Article 10 does not only protect anonymous sources assisting the press in informing the public about matters of public interest (see\u00a0Nordisk Film & TV A/S, cited above). A journalist\u2019s protection under Article 10 cannot automatically be removed or diminished by virtue of the source\u2019s own conduct. In this regard, while on the one hand the judgment, in paragraph 74, concludes (and rightly so!) that all previously developed standards for source protection are also relevant in a situation where a source comes forward, on the other hand, two paragraphs below, this very standard is unjustifiably called into question. Nor am I convinced by the statement that \u201cit may be true that the public perception of the principle of non-disclosure of sources would suffer no real damage in this situation\u201d (paragraph 82).",

Nonetheless, we are living in the modern digital era where the legal framework of the protection of journalistic sources is under significant strain. This expands the risk of erosion, restriction and compromise in the work of journalists, with an impact on freedom of expression, the media and investigative journalism in particular. The Court has been a frontrunner and an advocate of judicial protection of journalists and their sources and in so doing it has also served as an inspiration for many other jurisdictions. This path should not be reversed.",
