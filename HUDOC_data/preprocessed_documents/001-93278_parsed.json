Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 152 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV).",

It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the well-documented facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see Muller v. France, 17 March 1997, \u00a7 35, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II).",

This period involved fourteen months of pre-trial detention and thirteen months of house arrest which also falls within the scope of Article 5 (see, inter alia, Pekov v. Bulgaria, no. 50358/99, \u00a7 60). It notes that, initially, the principal reason for the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was the danger of his absconding and, to a lesser extent, that of collusion and reoffending. It is satisfied that, during this phase of the investigation, the suspicion that the applicant had committed the crimes in question justified his detention with a view to securing his attendance at court.",

The remaining reason for the continued measure was the risk of his absconding and reoffending. In the Court\u2019s view, the domestic courts should have assessed these risks in the light of all the aspects of the case and considered imposing a less strict measure. Instead, they limited themselves to reiterating mechanically that, given the seriousness of the charges against him, there was a risk that the applicant would abscond or reoffend. The Court finds this implausible in the circumstances, especially in view of the District Court\u2019s decision of 5 September 2006 terminating the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention and ordering his house arrest. Having regard to its overall duration, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty, in particular after 6 February 2006, was justified.",
